Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the consideration of H.R. 5093. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5093) making appropriations for the Department \n     of the Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2003, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the leadership has been invited to the White \nHouse this morning, and therefore this matter will be somewhat delayed \nuntil their return.\n  My distinguished ranking member, Mr. Burns, is with me, and we are \ngoing to proceed with statements on the bill, after which I have two or \nthree technical amendments which make corrections, and with the \napproval of my ranking member on the other side of the aisle, I shall \npropose those, and perhaps the Senate can move them, accept them, and \nget them out of the way.\n  The first amendment I intend to offer will not be offered until the \nmajority leader and the majority whip return.\n  I am pleased to be joined by my distinguished colleague, the ranking \nmember of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, as we bring before \nthe Senate the Interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 2003. I am \nvery proud of our work on this legislation.\n  Although this bill is not, in terms of total dollars appropriated, \nthe largest of the 13 annual appropriations bills, it is an exceedingly \nimportant bill. It is in this legislation that we support and protect \nthe crown jewels of this Nation, our national parks. The four land \nmanagement agencies funded through this bill, the National Parks \nService, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Forest Service, and the \nBureau of Land Management, are responsible for overseeing 628 million \nacres of land or about one-fourth of the total area of the United \nStates.\n  The Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service provide \neducational opportunities and critical health care to more than 1.4 \nmillion American Indians. The Department of Energy is charged with \ndeveloping cutting-edge technology in the areas of fossil energy and \nenergy conservation, and the Smithsonian Institution, along with the \narts and humanities endowments, protects and promotes some of our \nNation's most enduring cultural resources.\n  Because the bill and the report have been available for review since \nJune 28, I will not go through each and every account line by line. I \nwill, however, reiterate some of the highlights of the legislation.\n\n[[Page S8142]]\n\n  As it now stands, the bill provides the full $2 billion requested by \nthe President for fiscal year 2003 firefighting activities. It provides \nthe full $1.4 billion allowed for under the conservation spending \ncategory.\n  It provides a $35 million increase for basic operations at our 385 \nnational parks, including $6.1 million for enhanced security, and a \ntotal of $702 million to attack the maintenance backlog at those parks.\n  Our parks and wilderness areas reflect the pristine beauty, the \nunmatched beauty of this country. They are important to our sense of \nnational pride, and they showcase this Nation to approximately 33 \nmillion foreign visitors every year.\n  The bill also provides the Fish and Wildlife Service with $460 \nmillion for refuges and wildlife. It provides $641 million for fossil \nenergy research and development, including $150 million for the Clean \nCoal Technology Program, and $922 million for energy conservation \nprograms, including $286 million for the weatherization and State \nenergy programs.\n  This bill, which has been crafted by my colleague, Mr. Burns, and the \nRepublican and Democratic members of the subcommittee, also promotes \nculture and history by providing $538 million for the important work of \nthe Smithsonian Institution, and $246 million for the arts and \nhumanities endowments.\n  The funding levels contained in this bill are fully consistent with \nthe subcommittee's allocation as agreed to unanimously by the \nAppropriations Committee on June 27, and as published in the \nCongressional Record on June 28.\n  We have used scarce resources. I emphasize, resources are scarce, and \nwe have used scarce resources to fund all of the important missions of \nthe Department of Interior. But our fiscal situation and the times in \nwhich we live demand discretion and frugality. Consequently, Senator \nBurns and I, as managers of this bill, stand ready to oppose amendments \nthat would increase the fiscal year 2003 spending beyond the current \nlevel in the bill. We will also discourage amendments using offsets \nwhich rely on across-the-board cuts, undefined reductions in \nadministrative or travel expenses, or any other amorphous proposal that \nrelies on savings that may not be real.\n  Finally, Mr. President, before yielding the floor, I acknowledge the \nefforts of several people. First, I publicly thank the subcommittee's \ndistinguished ranking member for his help in drafting this legislation. \nAs a westerner, Senator Conrad Burns brings a wealth of experience and \nknowledge and an important perspective to the diverse and difficult \nissues that always seem to come up in the Interior appropriations bill.\n  I applaud the dedication to duty that he exudes, and I applaud his \nwillingness to work in a bipartisan fashion. It is a pleasure to work \nand to serve with Senator Conrad Burns on this subcommittee.\n  I wish to thank Senator Ted Stevens, the ranking member of the full \ncommittee. Senator Stevens has provided invaluable advice and counsel \nwith respect to the Interior bill. His efforts are one of the reasons \nthis bill was unanimously reported out of the Appropriations Committee. \nTed Stevens has a marvelous ability, based on a great wealth of \nexperience, to craft workable solutions to tough problems, and I rely \nheavily on his sage advice and his unique and thorough, meticulous \ngrasp of detail.\n  Let me thank our subcommittee staff. These are the men and women who \nwork for Senator Burns and for me on this important Interior bill. They \nare a highly dedicated group of individuals who spend a tremendous \namount of time, who ensure that all members of the subcommittee have \nthe information we need to accomplish our work. Senator Burns and I \nappreciate their efforts.\n  I especially want to thank Peter Kiefhaber, my clerk on the Interior \nbill, for his conscientious approach to funding this bill and to his \nnever-failing pleasant demeanor, for his characteristic cooperation and \ncourtesy always, not just to me but to all other Senators as well.\n  I also thank the staff person on the other side, the ranking member \nof this committee's staff. Bruce Evans never fails to add to the near \nperfection, as near as we can make it, of the bill that we present to \nour colleagues for their study and counsel and decision. So as chairman \nof the subcommittee, I thank him, as well as I thank my own clerk. We \nhave to work together. We have to get along together, and we do that. \nWe do these things together on this subcommittee.\n  I urge now my colleagues to adopt this measure in a timely manner so \nthat we can proceed to conference with the House. We need to get this \nwork done. Senator Burns and I stand ready, as we also stand ready with \nSenator Stevens, to go forward with this bill. We will be glad to \ndiscuss amendments as we proceed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when Mr. Burns has \ncompleted his statement, if he has one, and gets recognition, as I \nassume he will, that I be recognized to offer some technical \namendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I am very happy this \nmorning to join the Senator from West Virginia in support of the \nInterior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2003. \nNeedless to say, this is a very important piece of legislation, \nespecially for me and my colleagues in the West, particularly those in \nthe intermountain region. This bill funds the agencies that manage the \nmajority of our public lands.\n  It funds health care, education, and other services for Native \nAmericans. It supports research and development and allows us to \ndevelop and use our domestic energy resources in a responsible manner.\n  Although Senator Byrd does not hail from a Western State, we are \nabout to adopt him as a westerner. He has done a great job in putting \nthis bill together. The bill accurately reflects the priorities of the \nSenate as a whole, as it remains within the subcommittee's fairly \nmodest allocation. The bill as a whole is a mere 2 percent above the \nPresident's request and it is well below the allocation approved by the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Senator Byrd has worked with me and my staff to see the specific \ninterests of Republican Members have been fairly treated. Did everybody \nget everything they asked for? No, of course not. I, as ranking member, \ndid not get everything I asked for, but neither did the chairman. I can \nassure my colleagues that the chairman has taken an evenhanded approach \nin dealing with more than 2,000 individual requests which we received.\n  Since the chairman of the subcommittee has already outlined the \nprincipal features of this bill, I take this opportunity to speak about \na few specific items. First, I note that this bill increases funding \nfor payment in lieu of taxes by $10 million over the current level. \nWhile the funding provided for PILT still leaves us a long way from the \nfully authorized amount, it is a dramatic improvement over the $45 \nmillion cut proposed by the President's budget request. These funds are \nvital. They are vital to all the counties where public lands have a \npresence, especially in the West where most of the public lands are \nlocated. Those counties struggle to provide education, law enforcement, \nand other services without an adequate tax base. I hope the \nadministration will give greater consideration to the importance of \nthis program as it assembles its fiscal year 2004 budget request. I \nmake a footnote, saying as long as the American people have told us as \npolicymakers that they want to retain those Federal lands everywhere \nacross the country, then we must maintain and pay the taxes to support \nlocal services.\n  I will highlight the efforts Senator Byrd and I have made to increase \nfunding for the operation of our National Parks. While the Americans \nfor National Parks Campaign has turned a spotlight on the issue over \nthe last several months, those who have served on the subcommittee for \nyears know it is not a new problem. I view the increase of $35 million \nprovided in this bill for park operations, an increase of $20 million \nover the budget request, as a continuation of this subcommittee's \nongoing effort to provide adequate funds for our National Parks.\n\n[[Page S8143]]\n\n  Finally, I will talk about forest fires. It has been odd to see the \nnightly newscasts and they are not reporting on a wildfire somewhere in \nthe country. By now my colleagues are well aware that the 2002 fire \nseason is on its way to being as costly and as damaging as the record-\nsetting year 2000. The fact this is happening should come as no \nsurprise. We knew the conditions in many areas of the West were the \ndriest in recent memory. We knew that years of misguided forest \nmanagement have left our forests with intolerably high fuel loads. The \ninevitable has happened. And it will continue to happen as the fire \nseason progresses and as we meet the years ahead. The question is, what \nto do about it.\n  This bill fully funds the President's request for fire suppression, \nwhich is based on a 10-year average cost of firefighting. \nUnfortunately, using the 10-year average as a basis for budget requests \nno longer appears to be adequate. The 10-year average does not reflect \nthe impact of inflation. It does not reflect the recent changes in \nfirefighting practices associated with the national fire plan. And it \ndoes not reflect the impact of fire suppression costs of rapidly \nincreasing housing development in the wildland urban interface.\n\n  We need to be working on a better model for projecting fire \nsuppression budgets. Certainly, we need to do everything possible to \ncontrol suppression costs through effective management and aggressive \noversight, but at the end of the day we are going to have fires and we \nare going to have to fight them in many cases.\n  If our suppression budgets are consistently below the actual need, \nthe Forest Service and the Department of the Interior will continually \nhave to use their borrowing authority to cover fire costs. While this \nborrowing enables us to get the job done in terms of firefighting, \nrepeated and extensive borrowing makes it difficult to plan and conduct \nregular programs that are funded from the accounts subject to the \nborrowing. Such programs include facility construction and maintenance, \nland acquisition, and research activities.\n  Ironically, repeated borrowing also makes it more difficult for the \nForest Service and the Department of the Interior to execute their \nsalvage and hazardous fuels reduction programs--the very programs that \nwill help reduce fire suppression costs over the long term.\n  The Forest Service has already exhausted its fiscal year 2002 \nfirefighting funds and has commenced borrowing from other programs. \nCurrent estimates indicate that the Forest Service may have to borrow \nmore than $1 billion by the end of the fiscal year. The Department of \nthe Interior may have to borrow $220 million. While I appreciate \nSenator Stevens' and Senator Byrd's efforts to include $50 million for \nfirefighting in the supplemental over OMB's objections--by the way, \nthat amount does very little to address the problem; as such, I expect \nwe will have an amendment to this bill to provide the emergency funds \nneeded to pay for this year's firefighting costs. I certainly hope all \nmy colleagues will support the amendment.\n  On a final note, I wish to echo Senator Byrd's comments regarding the \noverall funding levels in this bill. Due to the failure of the Senate \nto take up and pass a budget resolution, as it is supposed to do, we \nhave no formal subcommittee allocation that is enforceable by a \nsupermajority vote. Nevertheless, I concur with my chairman, Senator \nByrd, and also with the ranking member of the full committee that we \nmust enforce fiscal discipline as we go through this appropriations \nprocess.\n  I will join Senator Byrd in opposing amendments that propose to add \nnonemergency spending to this bill without being fully offset. And in \nconsidering such offsets, I do not believe either of the managers would \nlook favorably on amendments that would duck the question of tradeoffs \nby using across-the-board cuts, reductions in travel, and other \ngimmicks. Agencies in this bill are already being asked to reduce their \ntravel costs and absorb a portion of mandated pay increases. I expect \nSenator Byrd and I will oppose proposals to further squeeze agencies in \nsuch an indirect manner.\n  With that, I conclude by once again thanking Senator Byrd, my \nchairman, for his efforts in putting this bill together. I also thank \nhis staff, led by Peter Kiefhaber, for their hard work and their \nwillingness to work with my staff in assembling this bill.\n  I know they have worked long hours to get the bill to this stage. \nEven though we were on August break, and most of us in our home States, \nstaff stayed here and worked on this legislation. I want to show that \nwe appreciate their efforts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4472\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have some technical amendments which have \nbeen cleared by the distinguished Senator, who is the ranking member. \nAnd they are technical. I do not plan to call up any amendment at this \nmoment that is not purely technical.\n  The first thing I will do is to call up the substitute amendment, \nwhich is the work of our committee. The House bill is before the \nSenate. So what I seek to do now is call up the Senate bill as a \nsubstitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4472.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4473 To Amendment No. 4472\n\n   (Purpose: To make permanent a provision relating to the National \n                            Business Center)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment will be to \nmake permanent a provision previously carried in the Interior \nappropriations bill relating to the Interior Department's National \nBusiness Center. I am not talking about the substitute amendment which \nI just offered. I am talking about an amendment which I will shortly \nsend to the desk, that, as I say, makes permanent a provision \npreviously carried in the Interior appropriations bill relating to the \nInterior Department's National Business Center.\n  In January 2001, the National Business Center expanded its \nacquisition services capability. As part of its expanded mission, the \nCenter now provides contracting support to the Defense Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency. The language that is being proposed by Mr. \nBurns and myself allows the Center to continue to support the Defense \nDepartment's need for grants, cooperative agreements, and other \ntransactions as authorized in the Defense Conversion, Reinvestment, and \nTransition Assistance Act of 1992.\n  This amendment will secure efficiencies in the area of procurement \nservices and should be agreed to by the Senate.\n  I send to the desk an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) for himself and \n     Mr. Burns, proposes an amendment numbered 4473 to amendment \n     No. 4472:\n       At the end of Title I, add the following new section:\n       ``Sec.   . Hereafter the Department of the Interior \n     National Business Center may continue to enter into grants, \n     cooperative agreements, and other transactions, under the \n     Defense Conversion, Reinvestment, and Transition Assistance \n     Act of 1992, and other related legislation.''\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have nothing further to say on the \namendment.\n  Mr. BURNS. It is all clear on this side. We are supporting it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4473) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4474 To Amendment No. 4472\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send a technical amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n\n[[Page S8144]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), for himself and \n     Mr. Burns, proposes an amendment numbered 4474 to amendment \n     No. 4472:\n       On page 83, line 13, strike ``$650,965,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$640,965,000''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this amendment corrects an error with \nrespect to the appropriation for the fossil energy account. On page 83, \nline 13, as the clerk has stated, the figure of $650,965,000 should \nread $640,965,000. The amendment that I sent to the desk on behalf of \nMr. Burns and myself makes this correction. I yield the floor so my \ndistinguished counterpart may comment if he wishes.\n  Mr. BURNS. No comment here. We support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4474) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4475 To Amendment No. 4472\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, a final technical amendment which I shall \noffer at this moment corrects a typographical error in the bill. I send \nthe amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4475 to amendment No. 4472:\n       On page 26, line 15, strike ``315'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``301''.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this amendment, which is supported by my \ncolleague, Mr. Burns, as I say, corrects a typographical error in the \nbill. On page 26 of the Senate bill, under the section titled \n``Administrative Provisions,'' the National Park Service is authorized \nto purchase 315 passenger vehicles. That number should be 301.\n  The amendment makes that correction. And as I stated, I know that the \ndistinguished ranking member is supportive of the proposal. I urge its \nadoption.\n  I yield the floor before the Senate votes on this amendment so that \nthe distinguished Senator, who is the ranking member, may be recognized \nif he wishes to be recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. We have no objection to this amendment, Mr. President. We \nfully support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4475) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move that the Senate reconsider the vote \nby which the amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no further technical amendments at \nthis time. I do have an amendment, which I will not offer at this time, \nto provide funds to repay accounts from which funds were borrowed for \nemergency wildfire suppression. I will not offer that amendment at this \npoint. I am sure there is going to be an amendment or amendments to the \namendment. I shall withhold offering the amendment until the majority \nleader, majority whip, and other interested Senators--on both sides of \nthe aisle--are back from their visit to the White House and at their \ndesks.\n  Mr. President, does my colleague have something he wishes to say? If \nhe does, I will sit down.\n  Mr. BURNS. I will say to my chairman that there will be some \ndiscussion. There is no doubt. It is only fair that the leadership be \non the Hill whenever we take this up because it has high interest. Many \nof those funds that were borrowed for fire suppression are impacting \nother programs within the Department of Interior and the Forest \nService. So we think it is a very important amendment. We are \nsupportive and would hope the rest of the Senate would approve of it, \ntoo.\n  I think this is an area that warrants debate in the Senate so we know \nwhat we are spending the money for and how it impacts those lands where \nthe U.S. Forest Service and the Department of Interior have a high \npresence.\n  Mr. President, I see no one else seeking the floor.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4480\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I am about to send to the desk an \namendment. Before doing so, let me just briefly tell Senators what this \namendment is about.\n  This amendment is being offered by myself, Senator Burns, Senator \nStevens, and other Senators. It addresses the critical firefighting \nneeds of the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.\n  As many of our colleagues know, 2002 is turning out to be one of the \nmost devastating fire seasons on record. Therefore, our amendment \nprovides $825 million in emergency funding to reimburse the various \naccounts from which these agencies are currently borrowing. Of the \namount provided, $636 million is allocated to the Forest Service and \n$189 million is allocated to the Department of the Interior. These are \nthe exact amounts requested by the President just last week.\n  If anyone may think that this money is not needed, let me briefly \nstate for the record, over the past 10 years the average number of \nacres burned by fire between January 1 and September 3 has been 3.2 \nmillion acres. This year--this year--however, the comparable number of \nacres burned is 6.3 million, almost twice the 10-year average.\n  This problem is much more than just numbers of acres burned. The \ndevastation and destruction resulting from these fires is almost too \nmuch to comprehend. More than $1 billion will be spent on fighting \nfires, nearly 2,300 structures have been destroyed, and 20 brave \nfirefighters have lost their lives. Clearly, this situation amounts to \na domestic emergency of historic proportions.\n  I send to the desk, Madam President, an amendment, the amendment to \nwhich I have already referred, for the clerk's reading, after which the \namendment will be open to amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), for himself, Mr. \n     Burns, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Reid, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Craig, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Baucus, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4480.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide funds to repay accounts from which funds were \n              borrowed for emergency wildfire suppression)\n\n       On page 127, line 2, immediately following the ``.'' insert \n     the following:\n\n           ``TITLE IV--WILDLAND FIRE EMERGENCY APPROPRIATIONS\n\n                       DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\n                       BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT\n\n                        WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT\n\n       For necessary expenses to repay prior year advances from \n     other appropriations transferred for emergency rehabilitation \n     or wildfire suppression by the Department of the Interior, \n     $189,000,000, to be available immediately upon enactment of \n     this Act and to\n\n[[Page S8145]]\n\n     remain available until expended: Provided, that the Secretary \n     of the Interior shall certify in writing to the House and \n     Senate Committees on Appropriations within 30 days of \n     receiving funds under this title which appropriations \n     accounts from which funds were advanced in fiscal year 2002 \n     for emergency rehabilitation or wildfire suppression have \n     been repaid and the amount of repayment: Provided, further, \n     That the entire amount is designated by the Congress as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as \n     amended.\n\n                             RELATED AGENCY\n\n                       DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n                             FOREST SERVICE\n\n                        WILDLAND FIRE MANAGEMENT\n\n       For necessary expenses to repay prior year advances from \n     appropriations accounts from which funds were borrowed for \n     wildlife suppression, $636,000,000, to be available \n     immediately upon enactment of this Act and to remain \n     available until expended: Provided, that the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall certify in writing to the House and Senate \n     Committees on Appropriation within 30 days of receiving funds \n     under this title which appropriations accounts from which \n     funds were advanced in fiscal year 2002 for wildfire \n     suppression have been repaid and the amount or repayment: \n     Provided further, That the entire amount is designated by the \n     Congress as en emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985, as amended.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I am supportive of this amendment. I \nthank my chairman for offering this amendment. And nothing could be \ncloser to the truth than the reason he stated for the appropriation of \nthese funds.\n  It is not just that it is over 6 million acres this year; it is where \nthose acres are located, as we have seen more burning this year in the \nforest and urban interface areas than we have ever seen. And they have \nbeen devastating. It has been in areas where it could have and should \nhave taken more management skills to prevent the fires, but, \nnonetheless, that is the situation in which we find ourselves.\n  So I am very supportive of this amendment. I thank the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee. As we debate this amendment today, I \nthink the rest of the Senate will, too. Not only is there a shortfall \nin the funds that they had to borrow from in other programs that do \nother things that are very important within the Department of the \nInterior and the BLM, the Park Service, the Forest Service, but other \nprograms suffered because of these devastating fires this year.\n  So I thank my chairman and look forward to working with him as we \nmove this legislation through the Senate.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request \nthat I be added as a cosponsor of this amendment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Absolutely. I make that unanimous consent request, \nMadam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I want to also indicate my strong \nsupport for the amendment just offered by Senator Byrd.\n  Like many States in the West and throughout the country, South Dakota \nhas suffered this year, especially from fires that have devastated many \nparts of the Black Hills in particular. Thousands of acres have been \nlost. So, clearly, this legislation is needed.\n  I am pleased the administration recently indicated, for the first \ntime, its willingness to support, on an emergency basis, additional \nfunds for firefighting. So I am grateful to the distinguished chairman \nfor his amendment. I strongly support it.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4481 To Amendment No. 4480\n\n  Madam President, I am mystified, however, that the administration, \nwhile willing to support, on an emergency basis, the funds necessary to \nfight fires, has, at least up until now, expressed opposition to \nproviding assistance to those who are suffering from drought. In many \ncases, drought can be just as devastating economically as fires. The \nresponse on the part of the Federal Government is every bit as \nimportant as it is for fires. There appears to be a disconnect between \nthose who support funding to fight fires and those who oppose funding \nfor purposes of fighting drought.\n  So I intend to offer an amendment on behalf of Senators Baucus, \nJohnson, Harkin, Carnahan, Burns, Dorgan, Nelson of Nebraska, Stabenow, \nLevin, Clinton, Lincoln, Conrad, Wellstone, Dayton, Schumer, and Reid. \nI send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota, [Mr. Daschle], for himself, \n     Mr. Baucus, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. \n     Burns, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n     Levin, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Wellstone, \n     Mr. Dayton, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Reid proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4481 to amendment No. 4480.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Madam President, would the distinguished majority leader \nadd my name to the list of Senators who are cosponsors of this measure?\n\n[[Page S8146]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I would be happy to add the name of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, as a cosponsor. I \nask unanimous consent that he be added as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, first of all, let me also express \npublicly my appreciation to Senator Byrd for his accommodation of my \nschedule this morning. He was prepared to offer his amendment some time \nago and withheld doing so in order to accommodate my schedule. As \nalways, he is very courteous, and has been very helpful to me in this \ncase. I appreciate his cooperation.\n  Madam President, when the Senate passed the farm bill 202 days ago, \nwe agreed, overwhelmingly, to include assistance for farmers and \nranchers who suffered serious economic losses as a result of natural \ndisasters during the crop-year of last year. Madam President, 69 \nSenators--Republicans and Democrats--voted to include that assistance \nin the farm bill.\n  The administration at that time, and Republican House leaders, \nobjected. In conference, they threatened to block any farm bill from \npassing unless we removed the natural disaster assistance for this \nyear. They said they would block all assistance for farmers and \nranchers unless we agreed to drop disaster assistance.\n  So, reluctantly, we agreed. But we said, when the farm bill passed, \nthat the need for disaster assistance for farmers and ranchers would \nnot go away. It would only get worse, and we would have to revisit the \nissue. That is what we are doing once again today.\n  Our amendment is simple and straightforward. It does not create a new \nprogram. All it does is fund existing crop loss and livestock \nassistance programs for this year and last year. It does, in other \nwords, exactly what 69 Senators agreed to do 202 days ago.\n  There are some who said we should not spend another dollar on \nagriculture. They say the new farm bill is more than generous. I want \nto make an important distinction. The new farm bill covers loss due to \nlow prices. It does not cover losses due to natural disasters. Farmers \nand ranchers all across America are suffering staggering losses due to \nnatural disasters.\n  In fact, in yesterday's Wall Street Journal there was a report that \nindicated the current drought may be the most expensive in all of U.S. \nhistory.\n  According to the Journal:\n\n       The U.S. may be looking at the most expensive drought in \n     United States history, inflicting economic damage far beyond \n     the Farm Belt.\n\n  In South Dakota, the drought is costing farmers upwards of $5 million \na day. All told, the impact on my State alone is estimated to be $1.8 \nbillion to agriculture and rural business. Things are getting worse by \nthe day. Some counties have had less rain this year than they had in \n1936, at the height of the Dust Bowl.\n  For as long as I can remember, the Congress has agreed that disaster \nrelief constitutes an emergency. Disaster relief for wildfires, \ntornadoes, floods, or any other natural disaster is truly an emergency. \nIt is astounding to me now that during what may be the most serious of \nall droughts we have had in U.S. history, some people would want to \nchange that. They would say that farmers and ranchers don't need or \ndon't deserve disaster assistance. They are wrong.\n  The farm bill doesn't include funds to help farmers and ranchers \nweather this unprecedented set of circumstances. Unless we act, many of \nthem simply will not survive.\n  We should not discriminate against those who are hurting simply \nbecause of the nature of the disaster. Whether it is caused by floods \nor droughts or wildfires, whether it devastates Texas or South Dakota \nor any other State, an emergency is an emergency. Sixty-nine of us \nrecognized that fundamental fact 202 days ago. I urge my colleagues to \nreaffirm it as we consider this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4481, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, may I ask the distinguished majority \nleader: The leader and the assistant leader and the distinguished \nranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Burns, Mr. Baucus, and I \nearlier had a discussion to the extent that the offeror, the author of \nthe amendment, Mr. Daschle, would modify the amendment to make it read \nthat the funds would be available in fiscal year 2002 and that the \namount would be charged to the Committee on Agriculture, the \nauthorizing committee. Are these provisions included in the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could respond to the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia, I would confirm that the issues raised just now by the \ndistinguished Senator are ones to which we have agreed. Obviously, we \nhave to incorporate the appropriate language in order to accommodate \nthat agreement. It is my intention to do so. At some point, I will ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment be so modified to accommodate \nthose requests.\n  Let me reiterate, they would involve charging whatever funds may be \nused against the Agriculture Committee. I would draw a distinction \nbetween that implication or that requirement and any implication that \nthat would entail using funds from the recently passed farm bill. The \nCongressional Budget Office has indicated we are not able to do that, \nto draw funds from the farm bill, per se. But none of us has any \nobjection to charging the funds against the committee itself.\n  Let me also say, we certainly have no objection to ensuring that \nthose funds are taken from the fiscal year 2002 budget allocation and \nnot the 2003.\n  So we certainly would be in agreement with both recommendations and \nwould be offering modifying language when we have it. I understand the \nlanguage is now at the desk. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, as I understand it, the author of the \namendment needs no consent to modify his amendment at this point, no \naction having been taken on his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I simply would then modify my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4481), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n          TITLE __--EMERGENCY AGRICULTURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE\n\n     SEC. __01.

I thank the distinguished majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I think finally we are here. Finally we \nwill pass agricultural disaster assistance which is so needed by many \nfarmers and ranchers throughout our country. The amendment now pending \nis the amendment I offered which got 69 votes just 200 days ago. It has \nbeen modified.\n  My colleague, Senator Burns, and I have modified the amendment so it \napplies to years 2001 and 2002--that is, to crop losses and livestock \nlosses in both those years--whereas the earlier amendment I offered \ncovered losses only in the year 2001. This has been a devastating year, \nin addition to 2001 being a devastating year.\n  Mother Nature works in strange ways. Some parts of America are hit in \nsome years rather than others. It doesn't rain in some parts of our \ncountry in some years, whereas it does in others. That is true within \nStates. Last year was worse for my State of Montana, and this year is a \nlittle bit better, but not a lot.\n  For Montana, it is not just 2 years of drought, it is successive \nyears of drought. It is 4 or more years depending upon where you are \nlocated in my State. I say that not only because of the obvious \nimplication that there are 4 years of farmers who are not producing the \nquality or quantity of crops that they should, but also because of the \nperverse way crop insurance works. I point this out to my colleagues \nwho may not be as steeped in agricultural policy as others.\n  I ask unanimous consent, even though we will get into morning \nbusiness, that I be allowed to continue as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The perverse operation of crop insurance is that with \neach successive year's drought, premiums rise but coverage decreases. \nThat is how crop insurance works; namely, premiums rise during years of \ndroughts and coverage declines.\n\n  Some might ask, why do we need agricultural disaster assistance when \nwe have Federal crop insurance? That is a good point. Federal crop \ninsurance is helpful. Federal crop insurance is widely available in \nmost parts of the country. The fact is, crop insurance today provides \nless coverage than is needed because of the perverse effect of the \noperation of the program and does not negate the need to provide \nnatural disaster.\n  Again, to repeat, in successive years of drought, premiums that \nfarmers pay for Federal crop insurance rise and the coverage continues \nto decline with each year that passes during a natural disaster. That \nis the way it works because farmers have less of production history, \nless acreage in a prior year that is available.\n  Add to that, when you have successive years of drought, it might rain \nthis year, as it has in some parts of my State, but that is just the \nsurface soil that is given moisture. It is the subsurface soil down 1, \n2, 3 feet that is parched. It is so dry. A lot of crops have roots that \ngo deeper. In addition, very dry subsurface soil has an effect on the \nmoisture content at the surface. So there are many reasons this has \njust mounted.\n  In 1996--I can only speak for Montana; I cannot speak as \nauthoritatively for other States--before these successive years of \ndrought began, farmers received almost $1 billion in cash receipts from \nwheat; $847 million, to be precise. Last year, 5 years into the \ndrought, Montana received only $317 million in cash receipts--that is a \n62-percent decline--just because of the drought.\n  The same is true with livestock. We are talking about not only crop \nassistance but also livestock because in drought years feed prices are \nextremely high and ranchers are liquidating their herds. The range is \nin poor condition. It just adds up and has a very detrimental \ncumulative effect.\n  Agriculture is more than 50 percent of my State's economy. It is \ntruly the backbone of our State's economy. So a drought affects not \nonly farmers and ranchers specifically, but it affects communities, it \naffects schools and businesses, because when farmers don't have a crop, \nwhat happens? They are not buying seed, they are not buying fertilizer, \nnot buying fuel, not buying all the staples that go into agriculture.\n  When that happens, clearly, the towns begin to suffer dramatically. \nIt affects our schools and the income available to schools. It affects \nthe psychology of the communities. More than that, it affects the \nnumber of people who are willing to stay and fight and live in those \ncommunities.\n  Many communities in Montana are losing population. If we don't get \nthis agricultural disaster assistance, I can guarantee you that the \nfailure is going to hasten the decline of the populations in many parts \nof our country. I can speak personally for parts of my State of \nMontana.\n  The leader made an excellent point a few minutes ago, which is that \nwe passed a farm bill that addressed economic assistance for farmers. \nIt is needed because the earlier farm program, ``freedom to fail'' was \njust that; it hurt farmers. There was no safety net. Farmers fell \nthrough the cracks and holes in the safety net. We didn't have a basic \nunderpinning for people. Not only was it necessary for farmers to have \nthat underpinning, but I want to remind my colleagues that we have a \nbig battle with other countries that support their farmers much more \nthan America supports its farmers.\n  I also might point out an interesting statistic, which is that \nagricultural trade barriers worldwide average about 60 percent. \nManufacturing trade barriers and tariffs average about 5 percent. We \nAmericans have very few barriers to agricultural trade. There are some \ncommodities, such as peanuts and sugar, that have some assistance, but \nwhen it comes to the basic commodities of wheat and barley, we have \nvirtually no protective subsidies. We have no trade barriers to help \nour industries, whereas, as I mentioned before, the average \nagricultural trade barrier worldwide is 60 percent. So, clearly, we \nhave to help our people when other countries are helping theirs so much \nmore than we are.\n  Second, in 1975, the European Union was the largest net importer of \nagricultural products. They didn't like that, so they started doing \nsomething about that. They decided to enact various measures within \nEurope, price levies, agricultural export subsidies, and similar \nmeasures. By 1985, Europe was the largest net exporter of agricultural \nproducts. That was a big turnaround in 10 years because of the degree \nto which they were protecting their producers.\n  Eighty-two percent or eighty-six percent of the world's agricultural \nexport subsidies are European Union. Their agricultural export \nsubsidies are about\n\n[[Page S8148]]\n\n85 percent of the world's agricultural export subsidies. What are \nAmerica's? Maybe 2 percent. Our Export Enhancement Program is just \npeanuts compared with what the Europeans do. So we have to fight and we \nhave to help our farmers. The farm bill was to help our farmers.\n  We are talking today about something totally different. What is it? \nWe are not talking about assistance for low prices, we are talking \nabout disaster assistance. When there are tornadoes, our country \nresponds with disaster assistance. When there are floods, our country \nresponds with disaster assistance. We had the Trade Towers tragedy--an \nunspeakable tragedy--and our country responded to that disaster. We are \nsimply stating--all of us who are sponsoring this amendment--in fact, I \nwas the original author of this amendment along with Senator Burns. We \nare saying here is another disaster, but not because of a tornado, \nearthquake, or floods, but because of the drought, people need help. \nThere is no reason that drought should play by a different set of rules \nthan other natural disasters.\n  We have the opportunity today to keep our rural communities and \neconomies alive. Rural America is resilient. And like them, I will not \ngive up. Thousands of people are suffering from the relentless drought. \nThey deserve emergency agricultural assistance and I will continue to \nfight until we are successful.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is long overdue \nand desperately needed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be brief. I know others want to \nspeak.\n  I think I speak for the Presiding Officer, given what he has seen in \nSouth Dakota. Senator Daschle also talked about the drought. Let me \nmake this appeal to my colleagues. In northwestern Minnesota, there are \n17 counties that have been declared Federal disasters. In our case, it \nis the flooding. I cannot remember more emotional gatherings I have \never been to since I have been in the Senate. We have had a lot of this \nkind of flooding, and I have been in towns devastated by tornadoes.\n  I make this appeal to my colleagues. Never in the years I have been a \nSenator--and I will be finishing up my 12th year--have I voted against \ndisaster assistance for any community anywhere in the United States of \nAmerica, whether it is tornadoes, hurricanes, fire, drought, or whether \nit is flooding. I believe this is a perfect example of there but for \nthe grace of God go I. The devastation to so much rich farmland in \nMinnesota and to those farmers and these communities is not because \npeople have been bad managers. Nobody asked for this. As Senator \nDaschle said, we are not talking about countercyclical income for low \nprices; we are talking about disaster relief.\n  So I will say to every Senator, Democrat and Republican, we hope we \nwill have your support. This is what we do as a community. This is what \nwe do as a national community. We provide help to people. I know the \nPresident has said no to this. I wish he would take another position. \nBut I really believe Senators understand full well that this kind of \ndisaster can happen to any community in any one of our States, and I \nthink this is a time when we really should come together, a time when \nwe become a community to help communities.\n  I am so pleased that this amendment is on the floor. I know we are \nsoon going to go back to the homeland defense bill, but tomorrow we \nwill be back on this amendment. Tomorrow, there will be an up-or-down \nvote. Tomorrow, I hope Senators will vote for this. Right now, for me, \nas a Senator from Minnesota, it is a priority to get help to these \npeople. A lot of farmers and a lot of people in northwestern Minnesota \nreally need the help. Please provide that help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is an important \nthing to do.\n  Disaster, in this case, is spelled in part of my State by a drought \nthat is devastating. It means those who have invested their lives and \nfortunes to put seeds into the ground, hoping to raise a crop and to \nhave some income with which to raise a family, have discovered that \ndrought has killed their crop. There is nothing to harvest. There is \nnothing left. In other parts of the State, flooding has prevented \nfields from being planted.

Mr. President, I wish to comment on one additional \nmatter. I intend to hold some hearings in the Commerce subcommittee \nthat I chair, on the issue of corporate responsibility.\n  We recently passed legislation dealing with corporate responsibility \nin the Senate. It was subsequently signed by the President. I supported \nthat legislation, but I thought that it could be improved in some \nareas.\n  During Senate debate, I tried to offer an amendment dealing with the \nissue of bankruptcy, that called for recovery of profits by top \nexecutives of companies that went bankrupt. The amendment was blocked \nby my colleague, the Senator from Texas, who kept me from offering it \nover several days. I was not able to offer that amendment on the bill, \nbut I am going to continue to push it.\n  My point is this: As corporations go bankrupt and as those CEOs take \nincreasing amounts of money out of corporations in bonus payments and \nincentive payments prior to bankruptcy, I think there ought to be a \nmechanism for disgorgement or recapture of that money for the benefit \nof other investors who lost their shirts and the employees who lost \ntheir jobs. I believe this idea would have had wide support in the \nSenate, but I could not get it done because it was blocked by the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Well, the Financial Times has done a study and written an article to \nwhich I want to call attention. It is titled ``The Survivors Who Left \nAll the Way to the Bank.'' The Financial Times found that in the 25 \nlargest companies that went bankrupt since January of 2001, there were \n208 top executives who were paid a total of $3.3 billion in salaries, \nbonuses, and incentive payments.\n\n[[Page S8149]]\n\n  Think of that. As these publicly traded companies were going down the \ntubes and into bankruptcy, executives were busy taking out massive \nsums--$933 million from one; $290 million from another; $299 million \nfrom another, just to give a few examples.\n  I would like one good reason anybody has for providing a bonus or \nincentive payment to any executive prior to the company filing \nbankruptcy--just one good reason. But there is not one. That money \nought to be recaptured. There ought to be what is called a disgorgement \nor recapture or clawback. That money ought to be used to reimburse \ninvestors who lost their shirts and employees who lost their jobs.\n  I am going to hold a hearing about this in my subcommittee. We are \ngoing to look into situations like that of Enron. We have already had \nsome testimony in this regard in my subcommittee, relating to bonuses \npaid at Enron. It turns out that Enron paid $55 million to people at \nthe top of the corporation to commit to stay 90 days as employees \nfollowing bankruptcy. Some people got bonuses of $1 million, some of \nhalf a million dollars. I think that is nuts.\n  The investors get ripped by losing their shirts, losing their \ninvestments, and a few people inside the companies that went into \nbankruptcy walk away with pockets full of gold from the treasuries of \nthese corporations. It ought not happen. It is just plain wrong.\n  Yet this was not dealt with by the corporate responsibility \nlegislation. Why? Because I was blocked from offering my amendment.\n  If I had been able to offer my amendment and had gotten a vote on it, \nwe would have gotten a mechanism for recapture and disgorgement. We \nwould have a law that says that you cannot walk away from a corporation \nyou took into bankruptcy with $100 million in your own bank account.\n  So there is unfinished business on corporate responsibility. We are \ngoing to have votes on this issue of bankruptcy and recapture of ill-\ngotten gains.\n  I am also going to be working on the issue of inversions. I know the \nPresiding Officer cares a lot about that issue, which involves \ncorporations deciding they want to renounce their U.S. citizenship. \nWhy? Because they want to become citizens of tax havens like Bermuda, \nso they can save on their U.S. tax bill. Shame on them. Inversion, my \neye.\n  We ought not have corporations renouncing their American citizenship \nout of sheer greed. I am going to offer legislation on that issue as \nwell.\n  So we have some unfinished business on corporate responsibility. \nNobody ought to think the bill we passed is a cure-all. It addresses \nthe problem of corporate irresponsibility in a constructive and \npositive way, but it is incomplete and there are other issues yet to be \naddressed. I, for one, intend to hold hearings and offer amendments on \nthis issue. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Chair advise the Senator when morning business \nstarted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business started at 12:07 p.m.\n  Mr. REID. Under the control of Senator Kennedy, or his designee, we \nhave the first half hour until 12:37 p.m.; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of an amendment \nwhich I have cosponsored which provides direct and immediate emergency \naid to the nation's farmers and ranchers coping with a drought of \ndevastating proportions. Mr. President, recently President Bush visited \nmy home State of South Dakota at Mount Rushmore. He was met with great \ncourtesy, respect, and hospitality which we always extend to Presidents \nof either political party. I was there, along with my wife, to greet \nthe President at Mount Rushmore. We are proud of our State and always \npleased to have an opportunity to show it off.\n  There was a great deal that the President said in South Dakota on \nwhich I could agree. There are a number of areas of common ground on \nwhich we can work together as Americans.\n  I have to say, however, that I was profoundly disappointed that the \nPresident chose at that time to express his opposition to emergency \ndrought relief for farmers and ranchers in my State all across America. \nSome 40 States have been struck to some degree or another by this \nrelentless drought.\n  There are areas in my State in dire circumstances. We have lost \nalmost $2 billion in the South Dakota economy over the course of this \npast year, and in our small State, that is an enormous hit. I have \nvisited farmers and ranchers across my State who detail with great pain \nand emotion the problems they're being forced to cope with due to this \ndrought.\n  I recently was in Philip and Faith, SD. The pastures look like the \nsurface of the Moon. There is no vegetation at all. I talked to Gary \nVance, the owner of the Faith livestock auction barn who indicated to \nme that a year ago, over a 2-month period, they sold 1,200 cattle. Over \n2 months this summer they sold over 12,000 cattle as people continued \nto liquidate their herds, including breeding stock, simply having to \nget out of the business altogether. Corn cannot be cut for silage, \nsoybeans are lying in the dust, and pastures are simply patches of dirt \nat this point. It is having a devastating impact.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota indicated, I have always been \nsupportive of emergency aid in circumstances where people have been \nstruck by forces of nature, whether it is hurricanes in Florida or \nearthquakes in California. I do not begrudge providing money to New \nYork and other places where we had floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.\n  I find it striking that some are arguing to set a new precedent \nwhereby this one sector of the economy, the agricultural sector, is \nbeing asked to play by a different rule. Those suggesting this new \nprecedent believe we can take money out of the existing farm program to \ndeal with a natural disaster. The farm bill was never designed to \naddress problems of natural disasters. By their very nature, droughts \nand floods are unpredictable. They occur some years; some years they do \nnot. Some years, their scope is of one kind; others, another. I find it \nhard to believe the administration has taken this position while at the \nsame time talking about an economic stimulus package.\n  I can think of few things that could be more stimulating to the \neconomy in our part of the country other than a drought bill to provide \nsome relief to get these people through the winter. Right now, in too \nmany instances livestock producers have no feed, they have no water. \nThey are not going to make it through the winter. They are selling \ntheir herds off at a $250-a-head loss. These pastures are not going to \nrecover, in some instances, for years. This is an enormous hit, and it \nis not just the farmers and ranchers, it is mainstream business. It is \nthe entire fabric of the economy of South Dakota that is suffering \nmightily, as it is in so many other States.\n  In the past, we have always dealt with this on an emergency basis. \nPresidents of both political parties, President Bush Sr., and this \nPresident, when he was Governor of Texas, asked for drought relief on \nan emergency basis in his State. So it seems hard to believe we find \nourselves in this circumstance where the Senate passed drought relief \nfor the 2001 year over 6 months ago that was defeated and pulled out of \nthe farm bill by colleagues in the House. The White House expressed \nopposition to it. some 200 days ago.\n  We attempted to put drought relief in the supplemental appropriations \nbill but again ran into resistance. Now we are looking at the 2003 \nfiscal year beginning on October 1. Things are delayed already, I don't \nthink we can afford to wait, we must enact emergency relief now. There \nare some who talk\n\n[[Page S8150]]\n\nabout finding the money within the farm bill, within the LDP and the \ncountercyclical payment money that will not be used. The Congressional \nBudget Office indicates to us there is no such fund, there is no such \n$5 billion lying around in the farm program waiting to be used, and we \nwould not know what the scope of the funding for those programs would \nbe until September of 2003 in any event.\n  Frankly, we have producers who needed help months ago who have to \nmake wrenching decisions right now relative to whether they are going \nto make it through the winter. They will have to liquidate everything \nthey have in order to survive in too many instances. Too many young \nproducers are being chased out of the business altogether. Those most \nvulnerable, those least capitalized, tend to be among the youngest. We \nare at risk of losing an entire generation of farmers, ranchers, school \nboard members, and church leaders in rural America if something is not \ndone to provide meaningful and immediate relief.\n  There is great urgency to this, and I hope we can find the bipartisan \nsupport to pass the comprehensive drought relief bill in these comings \ndays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. \n2800 to say that during the August break, when we all went home, what a \npleasant experience it was to go home, except that some of what I saw \nduring those days in August in Nebraska were not pleasant experiences. \nThe message from our farmers and ranchers in Nebraska is that the \ndrought is driving them out of their business and running them out of \nagriculture.\n  As a part of my trip back to Nebraska, I hosted a Senate Agriculture \nCommittee hearing in Grand Island, and I thought it might be important \nto report back what I heard from many of our farmers and ranchers in \nNebraska.\n  Al Davis, a rancher from Hyannis, NE, in the middle of the sand \nhills, told me his ranch has not had any measurable precipitation since \nJuly 6--a month and a half earlier.\n  For 60 days, Art Duvall's farm in Ord had no measurable rainfall, and \nthe McCook Daily Gazette, my hometown paper which I delivered as a \nyoung boy, reported that as of the date of the hearing, that area had \nhad only 8 inches of rain this year and that there will be 35 days this \nsummer with temperatures of 100 degrees or more, approaching the record \nset during the Dust Bowl years.\n  I visited Randy Peters' farm, a farm that has been in the Peters \nfamily since 1921, where on many occasions as a young boy, with my \nfather, I hunted pheasants. So I am familiar with the farm. Since 1921, \nthey have had a crop every year--some good years, some bad years, but \nthey had a crop. This year, there will be no crop. The corn will be \nleft standing, not even good for silage, not having any value except \nmaybe if we get any kind of snowfall this winter, maybe to catch a \nlittle snow and keep it for moisture for the future.\n  When we had TV cameras to take a look at how bad the ears of corn \nwere, we had to walk halfway through the field to find an ear of corn \nbig enough to shuck so we could peel back the husks and have people \ntake a look at the fact that there were no kernels of corn on that ear.\n  I also heard during the hearing the details regarding the sale of \nlivestock. As the Senator from South Dakota stated about selling off \nherds and recognizing that next year may not be any better, farmers may \nneed to sort of hedge their bet a bit and get rid of their herds in \ncase the high cost of hay--if it is available--will drive up the cost \nof production to the point where they lose more on every head of cattle \nthat they sell rather than recouping any losses.\n  Witnesses testified that much of the nonirrigated crop in large \nsections of the State would be a total loss this year, after 2 previous \nyears that had been bad crop years in their own right. Witness after \nwitness testified that they need the kind of assistance the Federal \nGovernment would not think twice about giving if Nebraska had been \nstruck by a hurricane.\n  As Merlyn Carlson, the director of agriculture for the State of \nNebraska, said, agricultural producers, farmers, need two things: Rain \nand money.\n  Well, we cannot do anything about the rain. Even if we could, the \nrain will come too late this year to protect against the problems that \nare currently being experienced. It will be great for next year but not \nfor this year.\n  At this point, I am sure some of our colleagues would bring up the \nsubject of offsets. That certainly has been raised by the \nadministration and by many of our colleagues. There are those who \nbelieve that any disaster relief should be funded only by cuts in \nfuture farm bill programs. I disagree. There is no reason to treat \ndisaster relief differently for rural areas struck by drought than we \nwould in other areas struck by another kind of natural disaster. \nMoreover, if we wait for offsets, we will delay relief.\n\n  One thing I have learned during my short time in the Senate is that \nevery program and every idea has a constituency, and if one Member of \nCongress attempts to defund a program for the benefit of another, there \nwill be a fight. We cannot afford to waste time having a floor fight \nover offsets.\n  Throughout the hearing, witnesses asked for relief without delay. At \none point, I asked a panel, consisting of representatives of the \nNational Corn Growers Association, the American Corn Growers \nAssociation, the Nebraska Wheat Board, the National Grain Sorghum \nProducers, and the Nebraska Corn Growers Association, if they favored a \ndelay in relief if offsetting costs could be found. Without exception, \nthey did not. They recognized that, in fact, if aid will be of any \nassistance, it must be delivered as soon as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for families across this country who have \nschool-age children, they have been involved over the period of these \nrecent days and weeks preparing their children to attend, by and large, \nthe public schools of our country. Over 90 percent of the children in \nthis country go to the public schools. A little less than 10 percent go \nto private schools.\n  Over these last several months, we have had, with President Bush, a \nbipartisan effort which resulted in what was called the ``No Child Left \nBehind Act.'' That legislation recognized that what is really needed \nfor the neediest children in this country is school reform. But we also \nneed investment, school reform and increased resources.\n  For a long time, the Title I program was criticized because it \nprovided resources without really providing the kind of accountability \nthat is so important. So there was a bipartisan effort to provide for \nthat kind of accountability.\n  Now as parents are seeing their children going back to school and \nthey are asking whether the Congress and this administration are \nmeeting their responsibility. Because in that legislation, we are \nholding accountable the children that were going through school. We are \nholding accountable the schools. We are holding accountable teachers.\n  I was asked over the recent month of August as I went around \nMassachusetts, is: What is going to be the administration's response to \nthe children being left behind with the budget that the administration \nrecommended to the Congress for funding of No Child Left Behind? Will \npoliticians be accountable? There are 10.3 million children who fall \ninto what we call the Title I category. Over 6 million of those \nchildren are going to be left behind under the administration's budget. \nWe do not expect that money in and\n\n[[Page S8151]]\n\nof itself to be the answer to all of the problems, but it is a pretty \ngood indication of the priorities of a nation and the priorities of an \nadministration. And this chart is a pretty clear indication of the \nrecent history of increased funding for education. We are talking her \nabout the total education budget. In 1997, a 16 percent increase; 12 \npercent in 1998; 12 percent in 1999; 6 percent in the year 2000; 19 \npercent in 2001; and 16 percent in 2002. However, it is only 2.8 \npercent under this administration's budget, the lowest we have seen \nover the last 7 years.\n  Again, money is not everything, but we did make a commitment to the \nparents, to the families, to the schools. There is tough criteria for \nall of those groups.\n  We have seen, in the efforts made by Senator Harkin in the \nAppropriations Committee, the recommendation that it will be higher \nthan this program. It will be some $4.2 billion, and it will raise this \npercentage up to about 6 percent. 2.8 percent is the recommendation \nthat is being made by our Republican friends in the House of \nRepresentatives. By and large, the best judgment we have is that this \nwill be the figure coming from the House, and we will be somewhat \nabove, and the conference will come out lower, certainly, than what we \nhave seen in recent years.\n  What has resulted from this--from the fact that we have not seen \nadequate funding of the program? We recognize in the No Child Left \nBehind Act that one of the most important necessities is a well-\nqualified teacher in every classroom in the country. There is virtually \nno increase in funding for teacher training. So the 18,000 teachers \nthat would have been trained if there had been a cost of living \nincrease will not receive the training.\n  Mr. President, 20,000 students will be cut from the college Work-\nStudy Program; 25,000 limited-English-proficient children cut from the \nFederal bilingual program; 33,000 children cut from afterschool \nprograms; there is virtually no increase in the Pell grants; and there \nis no increase in student loans.\n  What has the administration requested of the Congress? Why do I take \na few moments of the Senate time today? I want to point out what is \nhappening in this debate regarding funding of education because \ntomorrow in the House of Representatives, they will mark up a \nrecommendation by this administration for $4 billion in new funding for \nprivate school vouchers. We understand, this is for private schools, 10 \npercent of the education, $4 billion. Yet just 2.8 percent increase for \nthe public schools, where 90 percent of the children go.\n  There are a number of reasons we should be concerned. I think most of \nus believe that we should not be taking scarce funds from the public \nschool children and putting them into private schools. That is in \neffect what this is doing. If we had the $4 billion, we would be able \nto increase the total number of poor children to be covered under the \nTitle I program to about two-thirds of those that are being left behind \nthis year. However, the administration said no; we will have $4 billion \nover a 5-year period to be used for the private schools, for just 10 \npercent of the children.\n\n  The reason we raise this issue is in case we have these resources \nagain, we will have an opportunity, hopefully, to debate this, and it \nought to be directed toward the public school system.\n  But beyond that, some of the things that concern us is that with the \n$4 billion, there is virtually no requirement that we have \naccountability. The administration made a great deal about \naccountability, to make sure that we know where the money is invested, \nwhat the results will be on the standardized systems to be able to tell \nif children are progressing. In my own State of Massachusetts, we have \nseen important progress where we have had accountability and support, \nincluding the recent announcement of the MCAS results in the past week, \nin which we have seen continued progress in math and continued progress \nmade in English. Not all the problems are resolved, and there are still \npainful problems in terms of disparity, but we have seen progress made \nbecause of accountability.\n  The administration has talked about accountability. But for their $4 \nbillion, there is no accountability to any schools to ensure that they \ndo what all the public schools do, and that is, to have the \nexaminations.\n  There is no accountability to ensure that private schools accept all \nthe children. In the public school system there has to be acceptance of \nall of the children, but the private schools do not have to do that.\n  In private schools, there is no accountability to ensure teachers \nwill be highly qualified teachers. We wrote in that legislation that in \na 4-year period there will be highly qualified teachers in the \nclassrooms. We fund a variety of programs regarding recruitment, \ntraining, and retention, and we give maximum flexibility to local \ncommunities to be able to do that. But there is no requirement with \nthat $4 billion that they use those funds for highly qualified teachers \nin the classrooms. And there is no requirement to give the parents the \ncritical information they need and which we have insured under this \nlegislation.\n  So we are puzzled. We heard both the President and our good friends \non the other side saying accountability was the key element. We agree \nthat was enormously important--we are going to have accountability and \nresources. However, now we have the administration coming back with $4 \nbillion more. Instead of allocating that to the 90 percent of the \nschools that will train the children of America, the public school \nsystems which returned to school this past week--no, they will use that \nmoney, the $4 billion, in the private schools for vouchers. They have \nbasically retreated on each and every one of these principles. It seems \na very important mistake and one which we will have the opportunity, \nhopefully, to debate.\n  With those resources, if the Bush budget took that $4 billion in new \nfunding for private schools over 5 years along with the cut in public \nschools, had that $4 billion been available for public schools, it \nwould mean the upgrading of the skills of 1 million teachers across \nthis country. It would upgrade the skills of 1 million teachers. You \ncould provide 5.2 million more children with afterschool learning \nopportunities.\n\n  I just point out about the after-school programs, because of all of \nthe Federal programs that are out there that go through the process and \nare considered to be quality programs, when they get in line for the \nfunding, the afterschool programs are No. 1. Do we understand that? \nThere is a greater need, in terms of limited resources for these \nprograms, than for any other Federal program. People understand that if \nyou are going to provide afterschool programs and supplementary \nservices for the children who need them, this is the way to try to do \nit. We are seeing the results of success academically as well as in \nterms of the social progress the children have made.\n  This is what you would be able to do. You could provide 5.2 million \nmore children with afterschool learning opportunities. You could \nprovide a Pell Grant to 500,000 more college students--those students \nwho are able, gifted, talented, motivated young people whose parents \nhave limited resources and income. They will not go on to college \nbecause they are not eligible for the Pell grants. With these \nresources, 5,000,000 more children would receive increased college aid.\n  As we continue this debate and discussion about funding education, it \nis enormously important that the American people understand whose side \nwe are on. We on this side of the aisle believe very strongly that with \nscarce resources in our budget, these resources ought to be used to \nprovide more highly qualified teachers in every classroom, smaller \nclass sizes, afterschool programs, supplementary services, and \ninformation to parents so they know what is happening in those \nschools--all of those for the children in this country. We believe that \nis where the needs are. That is what we ought to be doing with scarce \nresources, not siphoning off $4 billion for the 10 percent of children \nwho are attending private schools.\n  We will have an opportunity, when this comes before the Senate, to \ndebate it further. But we want the parents of children going to public \nschools, who are facing increasing pressure--as we have seen all across \nthis country as States have cut back in support and help to local \ncommunities, increasing the size of their classes, reducing the \nafterschool programs, cutting out a\n\n[[Page S8152]]\n\nnumber of subjects such as music programs, and cutting back on the \nnumber of teachers' aides and teachers' assistants--to know that we \nunderstand this is not a time to abandon our public schools. This is a \ntime to invest in our future.\n  One final point. We have had a great deal of discussion and debate \nabout national security and national defense. I would like to make the \npoint that ensuring that we are going to have well-qualified children \nin schools that are going to meet standards is an essential aspect of \nour national security and national defense. And we should not \nshortchange that investment any more than we do our Defense Department.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the last few moments I had the \nopportunity to listen to the Senator from Massachusetts. Of course, he \nis well known for his dedication to public education in this country. I \napplaud him for that.\n  I also want to recognize a President who has seen public education in \nits current condition to be an issue on which to speak out and on which \nto lead. And while the private school and the voucher may be \ncriticized, we are creating a dynamic, now, in the marketplace of \neducation, that means the public schools are going to have to compete a \nlittle more. In that competition, they will dramatically improve.\n  The condition for educating young people, in my opinion--and I think \nit is a growing opinion in America--will rapidly increase.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8152-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8152-S8153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DROUGHT AND FIRE\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I did not come to the floor this afternoon \nto speak to education. I came to the floor today to talk about what I \nsaw on the Weather Channel this morning across the Great Basin West, \nthe Weather Channel that spoke of a hot weather pattern that permeates \nthe Great Basin West, that continues to allow it to be dry, and, as a \nresult of the drought conditions, we have a unique weakness in the West \nthis summer that tragically has been played out for a good number of \nyears and will be played out into the future.\n  The western skies are full of smoke today. They are full of smoke \nfrom forest fires that started burning in mid-June on the great Rocky \nMountain front of the Colorado and down into the southwestern mountains \nof Arizona. To date, we have seen a fire scenario on our forested \npublic lands that is almost unprecedented in the history of the U.S. \nForest Service and U.S. Forest Service management.\n  Today, as I speak, as a result of public policy and as a result of \nthe drought conditions in the West, we have seen over 6.3 million acres \nof public land burned. That 6.3 million acres is not a record, but it \nis without question a historic record when you compare it with the \naverages of the kinds of public lands we have seen burned over the last \ngood number of decades.\n  We watched what happened in Arizona earlier this year when nearly \n700,000 acres were burned and thousands of homes were lost and lives \nwere lost. Then, during the August recess while all of us were back in \nour States, we watched the firestorm that struck the eastern slopes of \nthe Cascade Mountains in Oregon. In the State of Oregon, almost a \nmillion acres of land have burned.\n  In the State of California, as I speak, 3 fires are burning and over \n12,000 acres have been burned.\n  In the State of Colorado, over a half-million acres have been burned.\n  That is a tragedy, without question. Wildlife habitat, watershed, has \nbeen destroyed at almost an unprecedented rate. Watershed for urban \nareas, habitat for endangered species--gone, up in smoke. There is \nnothing but a pile of ashes today because those fires were so hot, so \npenetrating, so intense, that they were unlike almost any other kind of \nfire we have seen on our public lands.\n  Why has that happened? What am I talking about? Is this \nunprecedented? Or is fire simply natural in our forest systems? Fire is \na natural element in our forest systems. But what we are seeing today--\nbecause largely we took fire out of the ecosystems of our forests 70 \nyears ago--is that these are very much abnormal fires, burning hotter \nthan ever, burning entire stands, burning the ground to such an extent \nthat we are caramelizing the soil and burning the humus out of it. By \nso doing, we are disallowing the ability of those forests to rejuvenate \nas they would under a reasonably normal scenario.\n  Why is this happening? It is happening because of public policy, \nbecause of an attitude that was held right here in this Senate that has \ncrafted public policy over the last several decades that not only took \nfire out of the forests but didn't allow active management in the \nforest to replace what fire would have otherwise accomplished.\n  As you know, in the Black Hills of South Dakota you have had this \nkind of situation. In fact, the Presiding Officer and his colleague, \nSenator Daschle, have felt the situation so intense and so risky of \necosystems, of timber, of wildlife habitat, of human dwellings and all \nof that, that you chose to act. I think you acted in a relatively \nappropriate way to recognize the need for immediate action that would \nnot deny the thinning and the cleaning and the fuel reduction that \nneeded to go on in those forests.\n  I chaired the forest subcommittee for 5 or 6 years here in the \nSenate. We have spent a lot of time looking at this issue, trying to \ndeal with this issue--largely to no avail.\n  In the early 1980s, a group of forest scientists met in Sun Valley, \nID, for a national review of the health of our forested lands. At that \ntime, 1981 or 1982, I believe, those forest scientists, with no bias, \nsimply made the statement that the public forests of the Great Basin \nWest were sick, dead, and dying, and if there was not active management \ninvolved to change the character of the forest health, that within a \ndecade or so these forests could be swept by devastating wildfires.\n  Those scientists were not prophets. They didn't have a crystal ball. \nThey simply looked at the facts that were available in the early 1980s \nand made a determination that, without active management, we could lose \nthese forests in an unprecedented way.\n  During the decade of the 1980s that followed and the decade of the \n1990s, we did just exactly the opposite of what those forest scientists \nproposed. We progressively became inactive on our forests, largely \nbecause many thought, and public policy allowed the argument, that no \nmanagement and no activity would improve the environment. What we \nfailed to recognize was that the environment had deteriorated so that \nsimply could not be the case and that these kinds of fires would be \nstand altering, stand destructive, and destroying wildlife habitat and \nwatersheds that we see in the West today.\n  The fire seasons in the West are not over. Today, literally thousands \nof acres are still burning. My guess is that before the fire season is \nover, we will see over 7 million acres of land burned.\n  Before we left for the August recess, a group of us gathered at a \npress conference to speak in a bipartisan way to this issue. At that \ntime, we had not yet quite determined what we needed to do, but we \nbelieved the American public was becoming increasingly aware that \nsomething had to be done, that we needed to lean on this issue to save \nour forests, to save wildlife habitat, to have a watershed, and to \nprotect homes in that urban wildland interface.\n  I said at that press conference--the last of July or early August, \nand at that time--that less than 4 million acres had burned. I said \nthat probably by the time we returned over 67 million acres would have \nburned. I was no prophet. I simply had studied fires and the way they \nwere burning in the West over the last several years to recognize that \nwas probably a reality. And it became a reality practically enough. \nToday, 6.3 million acres have burned. Thousands of acres are currently \nburning, with fires in almost all of the Western States--at this moment \nactively burning and out of control.\n  We said at that press conference that when we returned, we would try \nto resolve a bipartisan approach we could bring to the floor so that we \nmight offer it as an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill or \nsome similar vehicle. We are in the final hours of trying to craft that \nkind of an amendment that would bring us together in a bipartisan way, \nand in a collaborative way, to solve this problem.\n\n[[Page S8153]]\n\n  Earlier this year, the Western Governors Association, in conjunction \nwith the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture, \nmet and produced a western fire policy that dealt with these fire-prone \nacres. They proposed a collaborative process that targeted those \ncritical areas in all of the States involved and that would allow us to \nmove forward in a relatively unrestricted but environmentally sound way \nto do so. There has been a lot of work going on to try to solve this \nproblem.\n  Late this month, the President was out in Oregon, looked at those \nfire scenarios, and reported that he, too, agreed that active \nmanagement was necessary, that our forests were at a critical state, \nthat we were in a state of emergency, and that failure to respond was \nnegligence on our part. The President also said we shouldn't block from \nthe courthouse doors people who would want to appeal or object.\n  While I agree with you, Mr. President, and Tom Daschle, your \ncolleague, chose a slightly different course that would have denied \nappeals and court actions under certain circumstances, we are working \nright now to try to see if we can craft that collaborative process that \nwould limit but still allow some degree of protest and/or objection, or \nappeal based on law and based on the reality of the environment, and at \nthe same time not allow those thousands who would choose to obstruct \nentirely--to simply use that as a tool to bring any action on our \npublic land.\n\n  I hope by tomorrow we can bring to the floor that kind of an \namendment which will have bipartisan support. We are going to try \nmightily to achieve that.\n  Let me close with this thought, because to me this is the most \nfrightening of the thoughts about which I have talked.\n  Six point three million acres have burned to date, 2,500 homes have \nbeen wiped out, and 25 people have died trying to fight those fires. If \nthis had been Hurricane Andrew, which devastated less, we, with the \nfull force of the Government, would be out there today helping those \npeople rebuild those homes and trying to solve the problem. But some \nhave said: Oh, no, this is just Mother Nature, and this is natural. \nWell, hurricanes are Mother Nature, and they are very natural. But \nstill we have reacted differently. A hurricane is going on in the \nforests of public lands--wiping out millions of acres of trees, 2,500 \nhomes, killing 25 people to date, and it is clearly something we have \nto speak to, and speak loudly.\n  Even if we are able to gain public support to get optimum public \nactivity on our public land, if we are able to thin and clean and \nfireproof tens of millions of acres a year--even if we do that--our \nscientists are telling us that the forested lands--the Great Basin West \nprimarily, but all of the public forests of our country--today are in \nsuch unhealthy condition that over the next 15 years we could still \naverage anywhere from 5 million to 8 million acres a year being wiped \nout by wildfire, depending on climate conditions--drought or lack of \nmoisture.\n  Shame on us for having waited so long to attempt to do so little. But \nwe must attempt now to do something. I hope we can bring all of the \ncommunities of interest together in a kind of collaborative process to \nlook at these acres, to deal with what we call the class 3 sick, dead, \nand/or dying bug-infested acres, to look at our urban wildland \ninterface, to talk about and help shape the environment that protects \nhomes while at the same time protecting wildlife habitat and watershed \nand what can once again be the beautiful forests of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate begins consideration of \nthe fiscal year 2003 Interior appropriations bill. Land conservation \nfunding is the critical component of this legislation--funding for land \nconservation preserves, wetlands, open fields, barrens, and woodlands \nthat are threatened by ever-increasing pressures from development.\n  I would like to highlight three land conservation projects funded in \nthis bill that are of particular significance to the State of Maine.\n  First, let me congratulate the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Senators Byrd and \nBurns, for producing a bill that includes a generous amount for land \nconservation effort in the face of severe fiscal constraints.\n  The Forest Legacy Program, in particular, is funded at $80 million in \nthis bill, which represents a nearly 25-percent increase from last \nyear's level. This is a remarkable achievement considering that when I \nfirst joined the Senate in 1997, the Forest Legacy Program was funded \nat only $2 million.\n  I am a very strong supporter of the Forest Legacy Program because it \nrecognizes that our forests are both the source of good jobs and of \nboundless recreational opportunities for our sportsmen, our hunters, \nour hikers, and everyone who enjoys the great outdoors.\n  I am very pleased, therefore, that the bill before us today includes \n$2.9 million in Forest Legacy funding for an important project in \nMaine. It is known as the West Branch Project. The funding that is in \nthis legislation will help us complete this important land conservation \neffort. This historic project has been more than 3 years in the making, \nand it is a testament to what can be accomplished when the Federal \nGovernment teams up with private landowners, private nonprofit groups, \nand State and local governments to preserve special lands. I have \nworked hard with my senior colleague from Maine to help this project \nreach fruition.\n  This significant project will protect 330,000 acres of lakefront and \nforest lands in some of the most pristine areas of the State of Maine. \nMuch of the West Branch lands make up the viewshed from Mt. Katahdin, \nMaine's largest peak and the northernmost point of the Appalachian \nTrail. Their protection through the Forest Legacy Program is critical \nfor the well-being of Maine's recreational and natural \nresources. Moreover, protection of this land through the Forest Legacy \nProgram will enable the landowners to continue to supply area mills and \nsupport the local economy while allowing the public continued access to \nthe beautiful lakes, streams, and back country wildlands that are \ncharacteristic of this area.\n\n  That is why the Forest Legacy Program is such a good one. It \nrecognizes that our forests have multiple purposes, that they can \nprovide good jobs for those in the forest products industry as well as \nbeing a source of beautiful recreational opportunities for all of us \nwho enjoy walking through the woods or fishing or hunting or enjoying \nthe lakes and streams that abound in those forests.\n  Regrettably, the House Interior appropriations bill does not contain \nany funding for completing the West Branch Project; therefore, I hope \nthe Senate position will prevail in conference.\n  Another land conservation project that is important to my State is \nthe protection of the 8,600-acre Leavitt Plantation Forest. I, again, \nthank the managers of this bill for including $600,000 for this project \nin their legislation.\n  Leavitt is the largest contiguous forest in southern Maine. The \nforest was targeted for development 2 years ago, when it was scheduled \nfor auction in as many as 13 separate parcels.\n  Fortunately, Renewable Resources, a timber management company, \napproached the Maine Department of Conservation and the Nature \nConservancy with a plan to protect Leavitt Plantation. Working together \nwith the owner of the property, the company agreed to purchase the \ntract up to the New Hampshire border and to sell a conservation \neasement that will protect wildlife habitat, while allowing the \nproperty to continue to be managed for forestry and recreation.\n  Finally, the bill includes $3 million to purchase critical shorebird \nnesting\n\n[[Page S8154]]\n\nareas within the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge. It is easy to \nsee why so many are committed to protecting the Rachel Carson National \nWildlife Refuge. The refuge's 5,000 acres are home to rich and diverse \nwildlife habitats, including coastal salt marshes, barrier beaches, \nforested wetlands, coastal meadows, and upland forests.\n  During the course of the year, more than 250 species of birds, 47 \nspecies of mammals, and 35 species of reptiles and amphibians can be \nfound at the refuge. What is most remarkable about the refuge is that \nall of this wildlife and habitat diversity is located in Maine's most \npopulated region. So this makes this wildlife refuge a particularly \nspecial place to the people of southern Maine.\n  The funding in this bill for Rachel Carson will help protect the \nhabitat found on these lands. In addition, it will preserve open space \nin a region of Maine that faces tremendous development pressure. This \nproject serves as yet another example of how nonprofit and community \norganizations can work together with the Federal Government to identify \nand acquire critical lands from willing private sellers that otherwise \nmight be lost forever to sprawl and other development.\n  It takes considerable resources for the Federal Government to be an \neffective partner in the effort to protect habitat and preserve open \nspace, particularly in high-growth areas such as southern Maine where \nthe cost of land is increasingly high. That is why I have worked so \nhard in Washington to secure the resources needed to support these \ncommunity-based conservation efforts in my home State.\n  Rachel Carson, the patron of the Wildlife Refuge, once said of her \nsubstantial accomplishments:\n\n       The beauty of the living world I was trying to save has \n     always been uppermost in my mind. . . . Now I can believe I \n     have at least helped a little.\n\n  I think Rachel Carson would agree that the land conservation funding \nin the Interior bill we are considering today is helping, piece by \npiece, to preserve ``the beauty of the living world'' and to ``help a \nlittle.'' I am very pleased to support the land conservation efforts in \nthe bill. Again, I thank the managers for their leadership in this \narea.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

When Members come to the floor to start debate of the homeland \ndefense bill, I will be pleased to finish.\n  As a matter of fact, I will have an amendment, which will be the ``no \nFederal contracts for expatriates'' amendment, which is very similar to \nwhat I did on the Department of Defense bill. The House of \nRepresentatives actually took action on this with a pretty strong vote. \nWhat this says is, if you have companies that have moved to Bermuda and \nrenounced their citizenship, they will not be getting any Federal \ncontracts. It is a pretty simple proposition. I look forward to \nintroducing the amendment and hope to do it shortly, this afternoon. I \nam ready to get going.\n  We have so much to do in such a short period of time that I hope \nSenators will come to the floor with amendments on both sides. I will \nbe ready to do so.\n  As long as I am on the topic, I wanted to talk about my experience \nback home. I don't know about you, but we all have our own focus \ngroups. The greatest focus group in Minnesota is the State fair. It is \nreally quite a happening. In about 12 days, almost half the State's \npopulation comes to the State fair--2.5 million. That might be a slight \nexaggeration but not by much.\n  There are a couple of things I really like about the fair. One is, it \nis sort of the essence of political equality. Nobody has a lobbyist. \nEverybody counts as one and no more than one. Everybody comes up and \ntalks with you.\n  I also like what we call the greater Minnesota focus. We have a very \nthriving metropolitan community, but we are also an agricultural State. \nIt is great to see the very strong emphasis on agriculture at the fair.\n  It is a focus group because you can be at your own booth, and lots of \npeople come up, and I guess that is self-selection, where maybe it is a \nlot of supporters and whatnot. But even there, certainly walking \naround, you will run into everybody and anybody, and people are going \nto tell you what is on their mind.\n  I heard a lot--a lot, a lot--about corporate responsibility. I don't \nknow if people used those words, but there is really a lot of concern \nabout this flat economy. And look at the news yesterday and today. That \nis what we have. People really are worried that they will not have any \npension, and they are worried they might not have a job. In Minnesota, \nMr. Joseph Nacchio, CEO of QWEST, Minnesotans, starting with the QWEST \nemployees who worked so hard to build that company, they are not one \nbit pleased that while Mr. Nacchio was cheerleading them to invest a \nbig part of their 401(k) in QWEST stock, he was dumping his own and \nwalked away with around $230 million. There is a lot of that.\n  People are looking for those of us here to be watchdogs for them. \nThey are looking for us to not be too influenced by all the big \neconomic interests with all their money and lobbyists and their \nconnections and clout. People are saying to all of us, we want you to \nbe for us. I guess sometimes they are not so sure the Senate always is \nfor them. In that respect, the Sarbanes bill was a very positive step \nforward.\n  We had a stalemate here in 1994 on health care when we were talking \nabout universal health care coverage. Really between 1994 and now, it \nis as if this never was an issue. But the issue of health security, of \naffordable health care coverage for people, for their loved ones and \nfamilies, has walked into people's living rooms. I heard more \ndiscussion of the cost of it--the premiums, the copays, the \ndeductibles, the inadequate coverage--just unbelievable--and, of \ncourse, prescription drug coverage by the elderly and also by others. \nHealth care has emerged. I don't have my own poll on all these issues, \nbut I think it is a top issue for families.\n\n  In Minnesota, children have just started school, as in other States, \nand education is right up there. I am not without my bias. Two of our \nchildren are teachers. I will just tell you that Minnesota and a lot of \nStates around the country are still counting on us to provide the \nresources that we committed to providing to them for education. There \nis a lot of discussion about education.\n  There were questions about Iraq, what is going to happen, concern. I \ndon't think people feel they have much information. They want more \ninformation. They want to know about the different options and \nconsequences of those different options.\n  Over and over again, if you want to say politics is very concrete and \ndoesn't have much to do with labels, whether it was suburbs, inner city \nor greater Minnesota small towns, so much of the discussion was about \nthe economy, so much of the discussion was: Senator, what is going to \nhappen to our schools? We had to cut all these teachers. We don't have \nenough resources. Senator, my wife or my husband has $800 a month or \n$500 for prescription drugs. Senator, why do the pharmaceutical \ncompanies have so much power? Senator, what is going to happen to my \npension? Senator, how did those big companies get away with what they \nhave done to us?\n  That is really what I heard about again and again: I have no \ncoverage; I don't have enough insurance.\n  I could go into a whole separate discussion. I see my colleague, \nSenator Lieberman. I said when he came to the floor I would finish. I \nwill.\n  I could have a separate discussion about agricultural policy and \nabout small business and about veterans who are coming up, facing long \nwaiting lines for health care in Minnesota. I just want to remind \neverybody: We have a lot of work to do in a short period of time. We \nought to have amendments out here on the floor. We better\n\n[[Page S8155]]\n\nmake sure that we do not lose sight of these basic bread-and-butter \neconomic issues so important to families and so important to people's \nlives.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I hope we will do it.\n  I say to my colleague from Connecticut, the reason I came over is \nthat I am ready to offer an amendment. I think we need to do the work. \nI want to wait to see what my colleague has to say. I congratulate him \non his superb work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMinnesota. In a moment, I will call up an amendment, which is the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee substitute amendment on homeland \nsecurity, the substitute for the House bill that was sent over here. I \nwill speak on the substitute amendment.\n  It had been my thought that, in the normal course, Senator Thompson, \nas ranking member on the committee, would introduce the first \namendment. I have some reason to believe he may not be prepared to do \nthat right away. But we are prepared to go forward.\n  I want to indicate--and perhaps my friend from Minnesota will want to \ntalk to the leader about this--that I understand that Senator Daschle \nand Senator Lott are prepared to move to table any amendments that they \nconsider to be non-relevant to homeland security. Although, as the \nSenator from Minnesota knows, I share his anger about tax traders--if I \nmay use that term--or tax evaders and support what he wants to do.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, in the strict text, I have \ndrafted it as a relevant amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I look forward to reasoning with the Senator and the \nleadership on that very question.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, is the bill going to be reported now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I call up amendment No. 4471 and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4471.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfurther reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, September 3, \n2002, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, this legislation is a result of the \nbipartisan work of the committee, and the occupant of the chair, the \nSenator from Missouri, has been a contributing member of it. It was \nendorsed by our committee on July 25 by a 12-to-5 vote. I believe very \nstrongly that this deserves passage by the full Senate.\n  The substitute I am offering was modified in two respects after the \ncommittee held its business meetings in July. First, we added an offset \nto certain direct spending in the bill related, in fact, to civil \nservice reform. Second, we have clarified earlier language about the \nconduct of risk and threat assessment by the new Department. Both \nchanges were made after canvassing members of our committee and with \nthe approval of the majority of the committee. I will describe them in \nmore detail in a few moments.\n  This amendment, almost a year in the making, would create a focused \nand accountable Department of Homeland Security to enable our domestic \ndefenses to rise to the unprecedented challenge of defeating terrorism \non our home soil. Our defenses are either disorganized or organized for \nanother day that is past.\n  This bill aims to reorganize our homeland defenses to meet the \nunprecedented threats from terrorism that are sadly part of the 21st \ncentury. This amendment would also create a White House office to \nensure coordination across the many offices involved in the fight \nagainst terrorism, including intelligence, diplomatic and law \nenforcement agencies, foreign policy agencies, and economic assistance \nagencies that will remain outside the Department.\n  We recognize that the threat of terrorism on American soil will \npainfully be with us for some time. Therefore, the American people \ndeserve and demand a Government equipped to meet and beat that threat. \nThis committee-endorsed bill is presented in three divisions. Division \nA establishes a Department of Homeland Security, a White House office, \nand a national strategy for combating terrorism. Division B \nincorporates the provisions of the bipartisan Kennedy-Brownback reform \nof the Immigration and Naturalization Service.\n  We are going to hear a lot during the debate, I am confident, about \nthe need for further reorganization of the constituent agencies we have \nbrought together in this bill. But the committee-endorsed bill actually \ndoes undertake a massive reorganization of the one agency that just \nabout everyone agrees is in desperate need of reform, and that is the \nINS. Division C incorporates consensus civil service reforms, \nthemselves the product of intensive collaboration and discussion over a \nperiod of time--months and perhaps years--that were added as an \namendment by the bipartisan team of Senators Voinovich and Akaka.\n  I expect we will hear people saying that our legislation hasn't given \nthe President all the management flexibility he has asked for. Of \ncourse, that is literally true because we believe the administration's \nrequest simply went too far, usurping not only the fundamental \nresponsibility of Congress to adopt civil service laws, but to \nundermine important protections that guard the workplace and Federal \nworkers against favoritism and also that create some limits on the \nexecutive, some sense of accountability that is placed on those who \nhave sway over those who have chosen to serve the public as Federal \nemployees.\n  I urge my fellow Senators on both sides of the aisle to look \ncarefully at the reforms we have incorporated and the new flexibilities \nthat we do provide, which are sensible and significant indeed and, I \nbelieve, if passed, would give the Secretary of Homeland Security more \nmanagement flexibility than any Secretary operating under current law \nhas ever had.\n  I know this promises to be a controversial discussion, a serious \ndiscussion, and sometimes a passionate discussion. I look forward to \nairing our differences, resolving them, and getting a good bill to \nconference and then to the President's desk, certainly by the end of \nthis session.\n  We in the Congress have accomplished great and seemingly daunting \ntasks in the past; but, honestly, I can think of few in my time in the \nSenate, which is now 14 years, that have been more critical to our \ncommon future and cry out to us to work across party lines, to raise \nAmerica's guard against the savage, inhumane, cunning threat\n\n[[Page S8156]]\n\nof international terrorism. In fact, that is what happened on our \ncommittee.\n  The legislation I offer today was, as I have said, endorsed in July. \nIt was endorsed in a bipartisan vote of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. That marked the end of one of many stages in the bill's \ndevelopment in our committee. All told, we have been at this for almost \na year now--more than 11 months. We have worked with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. We have worked with experts in the field in various \naspects of counterterrorism and homeland security. We have worked very \nclosely since June 6--when President Bush endorsed the idea of a \nDepartment of Homeland Security--with the President and his staff at \nthe White House.\n  We gleaned insight and learned a lot from 18 hearings of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee that were held after September 11 on \nthis subject and dozens of hearings held by other committees of the \nCongress.\n  I must say that I am proud for our committee of the product of these \nlabors. This legislation puts forth a creative, constructive, and \ncomprehensive solution to the core homeland security challenges we now \nface.\n  Our legislation differs in some respects, including some important \nones from the House-passed bill and also from the President's proposal. \nWe are going to hear people dwell on those differences for much of the \ndebate. That is understandable. In some ways, it would be surprising if \nlegislation as significant and this large were passed without dissent. \nIn some ways, it would be not only surprising but unhealthy. The spirit \nof debate and controversy is here, and I hope out of it we will emerge \nwith a very strong bill. In the case of each significant difference, I \nbelieve in the path we have taken, and I look forward to explaining \nwhy.\n  Let me say again we cannot allow the differences to overshadow the \nvast common ground on which we stand. Mahatma Gandhi said: ``Honest \ndisagreement is often a good sign of progress.'' He had a point. With a \nbill this big, as I said, I would be uneasy if the Senate began the \nprocess in total unison.\n  Let's realize the underlying reality and not lose sight of it. Just \nabout everyone in this Chamber, on both sides of the aisle, understands \nthe urgent necessity of reordering and reorganizing our capabilities to \ndetect danger, protect Americans from attack, and respond in the event \nof an incident. That consensus should guide us and should ultimately \ndominate here. In fact, it is hard to find a Member of the Senate or \nthe other body who will say they are against the creation of a \nDepartment of Homeland Security. People have different ideas about how \none or another piece of it might look, but there is no one I have heard \nwho is really against the creation of this Department.\n  In the end, that is because I think people understand that the \ncurrent state of disorganization in the Federal Government's apparatus \nfor responding to homeland security threats is dangerous. The \nconsensus, therefore, for responding to that disorganization is by \norganizing the Federal Government better to meet those threats, to \nprotect our people, to protect our infrastructure, to see the threats \nbefore they emerge through good intelligence and law enforcement, to \ninvest in science and technology, to make protection of the American \npeople at home easier and more effective. In the end, I am confident \nthat we will pass a bill creating a Department of Homeland Security, \nand the sooner the better.\n  The American people understand why the creation of a strong \naccountable Homeland Security Department is the best way forward. They \nknow that the formation of such a Department will not of itself win our \nwar against terrorism. Obviously, we need to continue to encourage and \nsupport our military that is on the front lines of offense against the \nal-Qaida forces that struck us on September 11 and clearly remain out \nthere in the shadows scheming, arming, readying themselves to strike us \nagain.\n  The disadvantage we now have in defending ourselves because of our \ndisorganization can no longer be afforded. Today, as former Assistant \nSecretary of Defense Ashton Carter told our committee on June 26:\n  ``Homeland security remains institutionally homeless.''\n  It is well stated, ``Homeland security remains institutionally \nhomeless.'' Everyone is in charge, therefore, no one is in charge. Our \nlegislation would give this vital mission a home under a single roof \nand a firm foundation with someone, the Secretary, clearly in charge \nwith the responsible authority and accountability and hopefully the \nresources to get results.\n  For the first time, we would require in statute close and ongoing \nWhite House coordination of the many other pieces of the fight against \nthis 21st century threat--terrorism--and those pieces could not be \nincluded in the Homeland Security Department. They include defense, \ndiplomacy, finance, law enforcement, and others.\n  For the first time, we, through this legislation, would require a \ncomprehensive assessment of threats and vulnerability so that we \nunderstand the worst threats and the best ways to respond. We need a \nblueprint today. We do not have it. For the first time, we would create \na new intelligence division focused on the threats to our homeland, \nequipped to truly connect the intelligence and law enforcement dots \nfrom Federal, State, and local agencies, from human and signal \nintelligence, from closed and open sources, from law enforcement and \nforeign sources, including particularly the Counterterrorism Center at \nthe CIA.\n  These dots were not connected before September 11. We lived to \nexperience the disastrous consequences of that failure.\n  For the first time, we would bolster emergency preparedness and \nresponse efforts to ensure that all layers and levels of Government are \nworking together to anticipate and prepare for the worst. Today, \ncoordination is the exception, not the rule, and that is no longer \nacceptable.\n  For the first time, we would build strong bonds between Federal, \nState, and local governments to target terrorism. State and local \nofficials are clearly on the front lines as first responders and, as I \nlike to say, first preventers in the fight against terrorism.\n  Today, local communities are already expending funds to better \nprotect their people and their assets post-September 11. They are \nwaiting for help. They need better training, new tools, and a \ncoordinated prevention and protection strategy. That absence of \ncoordination and failure of adequate support for State and local first \nresponders and first preventers is no longer justifiable.\n  For the first time, we would bring key border and national entry \nagencies together to ensure that dangerous people and goods and \ncontainers are kept out of our country without restricting the flow of \nlegal immigration and commerce that nourishes the Nation.\n  Today, threats to America may be slipping through the cracks because \nof our disorganization, and that is indefensible. For the first time, \nwe would promote dramatic new research and technology development \nopportunities in homeland defense. This war has no traditional \nbattlefield, as I have said. One of the nontraditional battlefields \nwhere we must emerge is the laboratory with science and technology. \nThis bill would leverage Government and academic research capabilities \nand focus private sector innovation on the challenge. Today these \nefforts are blurred and dispersed, and that is unwise.\n  For the first time under this proposal, we would facilitate close and \ncomprehensive coordination between the public and private sectors to \nprotect critical infrastructure. Fully 85 percent of our critical \ninfrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, but our \nGovernment is not now working systematically with those companies to \nidentify and close vulnerabilities in, for example, communications \nnetworks, electric grids or food distribution systems. That is \nunbearable.\n  Finally, our legislation would adopt consensus civil service reforms \nto give Government new tools to manage it. These bipartisan reforms, \nintroduced by Senators Voinovich and Akaka, would provide significant \nnew management flexibility in hiring employees and shaping the \nworkforce, while assuring that the basic public accountability of the \ncivil service system is not summarily dissolved.\n  Under our bill, new flexibilities will increase accountability, \nstrengthen the chain of command, and give the Secretary and agencies \nthroughout our\n\n[[Page S8157]]\n\nGovernment the ability to put the right people in the right place at \nthe right time to defend the security of the American people.\n  As the writer H.G. Wells once said, ``Adapt or perish--now as ever--\nis nature's inexorable imperative.''\n  That is our choice today. Adapt and get stronger, or grow weaker; \nadapt, or give the American people reason to live in fear; adapt, or \nlive at the mercy of our cruel and cunning terrorist enemies rather \nthan being in control of our own destiny, as a great people should be.\n  So that we have an understanding of why this legislation takes the \nform it does, let me tell you briefly how it has evolved. It has been a \nvery careful and collaborative process, nearly a year in the making. \nLast October, Senator Specter and I introduced legislation to create a \nDepartment of Homeland Security. That was S. 1534. That legislation \ndrew heavily on the recommendation of the Hart-Rudman Commission on \nNational Security in the 21st Century, which was chartered by the \nSecretary of Defense and supported by both the President and Congress, \nwith the mission of providing the most comprehensive Government-\nsponsored review of our national security in more than 50 years.\n  The Commission released three reports in 1999, 2000, 2001, \nrespectively. Its third report, phase 3, entitled ``Roadmap for \nNational Security: Imperative for Change,'' warned that we would soon \nface asymmetrical and terrorist threats and would need a focused \nCabinet-level homeland security agency with adequate budget authority \nand direct accountability to the President to detect and counter those \nthreats.\n  The Commission's conclusion, headed by our former colleagues Gary \nHart and Warren Rudman, was issued on January 31, 2001, more than a \nhalf year before the day of darkness, September 11, 2001. Their \nconclusion included this statement: ``The United States is today very \npoorly organized to design and implement any comprehensive strategy to \nprotect the homeland.''\n  Senators Hart and Rudman, and the other distinguished members of the \nCommission, made their case effectively and, I might say, eloquently. \nBut the attacks of September 11 tragically drove the message home as no \nwords could or, unfortunately, did. We were suddenly and clearly aware \nthat we were more susceptible than we ever expected to the brutality of \nterrorism directed against innocent Americans for one reason only: \nBecause they were Americans.\n  No matter their origin, in terms of ethnicity, religion, race, \ngender, age, place in life, new American or born American, but just \nbecause they were Americans in America, they were targets. We realized \nwe were susceptible to that kind of violent extremism and we did not \nhave the organizational capabilities to leverage our strengths and \nprotect ourselves to the best of our ability.\n  So the bill I was privileged to introduce with my colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Arlen Specter, making it obviously bipartisan, \nlast October, hewed closely to the model proposed by the Hart-Rudman \nCommission and also drew on recommendations made by the Gilmore \nCommission and others. We called for a new Department made up of the \nCoast Guard, Customs, Border Patrol, and FEMA, as well as some smaller \noffices on critical infrastructure protection and emergency \npreparedness.\n  The compelling need for such a Department was reinforced in those 18 \nhearings before the Governmental Affairs Committee during which 85 \ndifferent witnesses testified on various aspects of homeland security. \nWe learned a great deal also from dozens of other hearings by other \ncommittees on both sides of the Hill. So for those who may worry or \nsuggest that we are moving more rapidly than we should, this is the \nrecord: Painstaking, deliberative, extensive consultation, \ninvestigation, education by experts, and an openness to ideas wherever \nthey came from because of the critical necessity to do something to \nprotect our security.\n\n  As chairman of the committee, I have been guided by a maxim that was \nused about foreign and defense policy, which is that partisanship stops \nat our Nation's coasts. In the same way, since this new enemy, the \nterrorists, has brought warfare within the United States of America, I \nsay when we are discussing matters of homeland security, partisanship \nalso must stop. That is the spirit in which our committee has gone \nforward.\n  We discovered, whether the subject was anthrax in the mail or port \nsecurity or critical infrastructure protection, that the Federal \nGovernment is now lacking an approach to our problems that is either \nstrong enough or coordinated enough to meet what we now know, post-\nSeptember 11, is the reality of the challenge to us. In other words, we \nare dividing our strengths at a time when we should be multiplying \nthem.\n  Again and again, the same message emerged from the witnesses who came \nbefore us, in big bold letters one might say: We still are not \nadequately prepared for terrorism at home, and a strong Cabinet-level \nDepartment, encompassing the key programs related to homeland security, \nis the necessary first step to addressing those deficiencies and \nclosing those vulnerabilities.\n  The need for such a Department was further underscored by our \nexperience with the Office of Homeland Security that was established \nlast October by Executive Order of the President. The President \nappointed Gov. Tom Ridge to fill that position. Governor Ridge is an \nable, hard-working public servant. He has had the President's \nconfidence and his ear from the very start. But we saw then, and the \nPresident would later acknowledge, that the office simply lacked the \nbudgetary and organizational authority to reshape the Federal \nbureaucracy to define priorities and to get results. Only a Cabinet-\nlevel Secretary in charge of the Cabinet-level Department could \naccomplish that task.\n  In the debate that has already begun and clearly will go on in \nconsideration of this bill, the President and the administration and \ntheir allies in this Chamber are saying we have not given the Executive \nenough management flexibility. The fact is that flexibility must come \nwith power. It was our bill almost a year ago, in contrast to the \nPresident's position, that wanted to give the Executive the authority \nto be able to carry out the necessary changes in the Federal \nbureaucracy.\n  So to portray somehow that this bill is protective of the Federal \nbureaucracy is not right. In fact, the President's original position \nthat this task could be carried out by an Office of Homeland Security \ndid not give that office the power. It had no management flexibility \nbecause the constituent agencies exercised the authority they had under \nlaw which was superior to the director of the office. Therefore, in \nthat sense, as well as all the specific senses in which we give \nmanagement flexibility to the Executive, we are proposing a Department \nwith a strong Secretary. That is the way to get the job done: blend the \nemployees together, encourage them to work together, and set standards \nfor them achieving homeland security. That can only be done by a strong \nSecretary.\n\n  At the same time, however, it became apparent that no single \nDepartment could address all of the Federal programs or coordinate all \nthe programs of all the Federal agencies engaged in homeland security \nor in the war on terrorism. Therefore, last May, Senator Specter and I \ncombined our proposal with legislation introduced by our colleague from \nFlorida, Senator Bob Graham, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, \ncalling for the creation of a National Office for Combating Terrorism \nwithin the White House to coordinate Federal antiterrorism efforts \ngovernment-wide.\n  In contrast to the position created for Governor Ridge by Executive \nOrder, this office would be a Senate confirmed-position, with full \naccountability and authority as well as statutory power to review \nFederal budgets related to terrorism.\n  The combined legislation that we have before the Senate in the form \nof this substitute amendment which I have introduced this afternoon, \nresulted from, as I said, Senator Specter and I joining with Senator \nGraham. Obviously, there is more added by the committee. That \nlegislation originally was introduced on May 2, and considered by the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee on May 22 of this year, and \nreported out on a 9-to-7 vote--a vote exactly split along party lines.\n  On June 6, we got a surprise, a welcome surprise. We gained another \nsupporter, a most important supporter. That was, of course, President \nGeorge\n\n[[Page S8158]]\n\nBush. This, I believe, was a recognition by the President--he said so \nin his own words--that the Office of Homeland Security, as it was \ncreated by Executive Order, was just too weak to get the job done. That \nis what we had been arguing for months. That announcement was followed \nby a legislative proposal from the administration. We were pleased to \nsee the administration's bill encompass almost all the S. 2452 \nprovisions regarding a Department of Homeland Security.\n  It went further, however, and also proposed that additional programs \nand agencies be transferred to the new Department--and there were some \ngood ideas there--to ensure the new administration proposals were \nproperly considered and necessary adjustments made to our legislation.\n  As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I held four \nadditional hearings on aspects of the President's proposal. \nIncorporating the insight from those hearings, as well as input from \nextensive discussion with colleagues, including committee chairmen and \nranking members, we prepared an expanded version of S. 2452. The \nexpanded version went a considerable way toward incorporating the \nproposals the President and the administration made that had not been \nmade part of our original bill. It was further amended during two very \nthoughtful, constructive days of committee deliberation and was \nultimately endorsed by our Senate Governmental Affairs Committee by a \nbipartisan vote of 12 to 5. That is what I offered as a substitute \namendment to H.R. 5005. The amendment I now offer is the product of \nthis lengthy and healthy process of consultation and deliberation. I \nthank my colleagues in the Senate for indulging me in this brief \nhistory expedition, and I want to say why I take the time to discuss \nthe time it took; and that is to demonstrate that we have gone a great \ndistance to hone this bill, to be open to input from anyone, to reach \nconsensus, to modify, and amplify different sections.\n\n  The Department we have designed would for the first time combine, \nunder a single chain of command and under the leadership of a single \nSecretary who is accountable to the President and the people, dozens of \nagencies and offices responsible for homeland security.\n  The Department's overarching mission, as stated in Section 101 of \nthis amendment, is twofold: To promote homeland security, particularly \nwith regard to terrorism; and to carry out the other functions and \npromote the other missions of entities transferred to the Department as \nprovided by law. That is a very important statement.\n  As much attention as the first part of the mission, homeland \nsecurity, will get in this debate, the second half cannot be forgotten \nbecause even though this Department's very reason for being created is \nto intelligently organize our Government's homeland security efforts, \nmany of its constituent agencies perform vital, non-homeland security \nduties, as well. They cannot and will not stop doing that work.\n  Our bill, in clear and unequivocal language, requires the Department \nto uphold these other missions and functions.\n  The extent to which the constituent agencies and programs that are \nbrought into this Department can both protect homeland security and \ncontinue to carry out the other responsibilities will depend on the \nextent to which we in Congress, through the appropriations process, are \nprepared to support this new Department.\n  The Secretary will be responsible for running the Department and for \ndeveloping policies and plans for the promotion of homeland security. \nThe legislation also charges the Secretary with including State and \nlocal governments, tribes, and other entities who, again, are first \nresponders and first preventers of the fight against terrorism in every \nState and city and county and town in our country. The Secretary must \nconsult them, with the Secretary of Defense and also State officers, \nregarding possible integration of the U.S. military, including the \nNational Guard, into all aspects of the homeland security strategy and \nits implementation. The Guard is a mighty force, with an historic \nmission which was originally, of course, to protect homeland security. \nIt has tremendous potential in this new 21st century, in responding to \nthis 21st century threat to our security without making it by any \nstretch, kind of a Federal constabulary. But the Guard has \nextraordinary skill and equipment sophistication and can play a very \nconstructive role here.\n  We also have charged the Secretary with the responsibility of \ndeveloping a comprehensive information technology blueprint for the \nDepartment. The Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, talked quite \neloquently and effectively about one aspect of that yesterday. In \naddition, the Secretary is responsible for administering the homeland \nsecurity advisory system, and for annually reviewing and updating the \nFederal Response Plan for homeland security and emergency preparedness.\n  This is a big job. The size should make it clear how much we need the \nnew Department. No one in Government is performing these duties \nadequately today. If they are doing the duties, they are not doing them \nsystematically, certainly not synergistically. There are a lot of gears \nturning. Some are touching each other, some are not. Some are spinning \nin isolation. We want the gears to turn together, generating torque, \nproducing energy, and getting results. That means more security for the \nAmerican people at home.\n  No one can claim that the creation of a new Department is a guarantee \nor panacea for all our problems. I agree with Charles Boyd, \ndistinguished American, great public servant and Executive Director of \nthe Hart-Rudman Commission:\n  ``There is no perfect organizational design, no flawless managerial \nmix. The reason is that organizations are made up of people, and people \ninvariably devise informal means of dealing with one another in accord \nwith the accidents of personality and temperament.'' Even excellent \norganizational structure cannot make impetuous or mistaken leaders \npatient or wise, but poor organizational design can make good leaders \nless effective.\n\n  That, in one sense, is what this is all about. Poor organizational \ndesign makes good leaders less effective with unnecessary gaps, \noverlaps, and bureaucratic barriers--by spreading authority and \nresources too thin, by diminishing accountability, by tolerating \noverlap and inefficiency--while good organizational design will empower \ngood leaders, hold people accountable, and enable their talent and hard \nwork to make a difference.\n  In other words, 10 gallons of gas poured into a well-designed, \nefficient engine can get you long distances at high speeds, but 10 \ngallons poured into an old, less efficient engine won't get you very \nfar in a very efficient way.\n  That leads me to a second caution about the legislation, which is the \nblueprint that we need to build a Homeland Security Department that \nAmerica needs. In a number of areas likely to be the most \ncontroversial, I strongly believe we have chosen the right path. But it \nwould be arrogant of me or anyone to suggest that this legislation is \nperfect. It is not. That is why we have specifically built into it room \nfor adjustment and refinement as the administration actually begins \nmoving the pieces together. And we have given them a year from the \neffective date to, in fact, do that.\n  We require the administration to report back to Congress 6 months \nafter the effective date or earlier during the reorganization process, \nand every 6 months thereafter, and require recommendations for changes \nto law at these junctures and throughout the process.\n  So even the passage of this bill will be not the end of the process, \nbut its start; as Churchill once said in a very different context, \n``not the beginning of the end, but the end of the beginning.''\n  But the fact that we cannot guarantee perfection is no argument \nagainst this legislation. Obviously, even our country's Constitution, \nwhich Senator Byrd and Senator Thompson and others quite eloquently and \ncorrectly honored and celebrated in yesterday's debate, the very \nfoundation of our democracy, a democracy created with as much foresight \nand wisdom as any other in the history of government, was not perfect. \nIt has been amended 27 times. At the time, the Founders understood it \nhad to be built to change over time. Indeed, during the ratification \ndebate, Alexander Hamilton urged those who criticized the\n\n[[Page S8159]]\n\nConstitution not to fail to approve it in what he called ``the \nchimerical pursuit of a perfect plan.'' In a more homely translation \nthat we constantly--at least regularly--use here: Don't let the perfect \nbe the enemy of the good.\n  Similarly, we must not fail to create this Department in pursuit of a \nperfect Department. History has dropped at our feet an urgent and \nnecessary challenge, to reshape our Government, to protect the lives \nand affirm the values of our people, for surely our terrorist enemies \nare as intent on striking and destroying our humanistic, tolerant, \ninclusive, free values as they are of destroying our people. We can \neither meet the moment by staying focused on that goal or we can let it \npass by bickering over petty and sometimes partisan or ideological \nparticulars.\n  Let the debate go forward, but let us, as we go forward in debating \nand amending this substitute amendment that I have laid down, remember \nthe urgent challenge the terrorists have given us and the broad ground \nwe all seem to occupy about most of how we should respond to that \nchallenge, by creating this Department.\n\n  Let's have some debates and disagreements. But when it is all over, \nlet's remember, not only in this bill but more generally in our values, \nthere is so much more that unites us, and that ultimately is our \ngreatest strength against our enemies, past, present, and future. We \nmust be certain to preserve that when this debate is done and a new \nDepartment of Homeland Security is created.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan addendum statement, a section-by-section analysis, and a letter \ndated August 28, 2002.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       Mr. President, I want to share with the Senate my views on \n     the meaning and intent of the provisions we added to this \n     legislation since the Governmental Affairs Committee first \n     considered the bill in May and filed the accompanying report \n     to S. 2452. This legislation has been almost a year in the \n     making, and reflects the thoughtful contributions of an array \n     of distinguished legislators and policy experts.\n       Last October, I introduced legislation with Senator Specter \n     to create a Department of Homeland Security (S. 1534). That \n     legislation drew heavily on the recommendations of the United \n     States Commission on National Security/21st Century, also \n     known as the Hart-Rudman Commission. It called for a new \n     department made up of the Coast Guard, Customs, Border \n     Patrol, and FEMA, as well as some smaller offices that \n     specialize in critical infrastructure protection and \n     emergency preparedness. The compelling need for such a \n     department was quickly underscored in a series of hearings \n     before the Governmental Affairs Committee examining aspects \n     of homeland security. Whether the subject was anthrax in the \n     mail, port security, or critical infrastructure protection, \n     the Federal government generally did not have a strong, \n     coordinated approach to address the range of threats. A \n     strong, Cabinet-level department encompassing key programs \n     related to homeland security would be a vital first step to \n     addressing this deficiency. At the same time, however, it \n     became apparent that no single department could address all \n     of the Federal programs engaged in the war on terrorism. \n     Therefore, I combined forces with Sen. Graham, who had \n     proposed legislation to create a White House terrorism office \n     to coordinate federal efforts to combat terrorism government-\n     wide. In contrast to the position created by executive order \n     for Gov. Ridge, this office would be a Senate-confirmed \n     position with full accountability and authority, as well as \n     statutory power to review federal budgets relating to \n     terrorism. The combined legislation, the ``National Homeland \n     Security and Combating Terrorism Act of 2002,'' was \n     introduced on May 2, 2002. It was considered by the \n     Governmental Affairs Committee on May 22, 2002 and reported \n     out on a 7-3 vote. A full account of the background and \n     history of that legislation is included in its accompanying \n     report, No. 107-175.\n       Before the full Senate had a chance to consider that bill, \n     however, the President announced his support for a Department \n     of Homeland Security. That announcement was followed, on June \n     18, with a legislative proposal from the administration. The \n     administration's bill encompassed almost all of S. 2452's \n     organizational elements regarding a Department of Homeland \n     Security. It went further, however, and proposed that \n     additional programs and agencies be transferred to the new \n     department. To ensure that these new administration proposals \n     were properly considered, the Governmental Affairs Committee \n     held four additional hearings. Then, working with other \n     committee chairmen and ranking members, I prepared an \n     amendment to S. 2452 that was considered at a July 24-25 \n     business meeting of the Governmental Affairs Committee. That \n     expanded version of S. 2452 went a considerable way to \n     incorporate Administration proposals that had not been part \n     of the original bill. It was further amended during two days \n     of Committee deliberation, and ultimately endorsed by a \n     bipartisan Committee vote of 12 to 5.\n       What follows is a description of some of the key changes to \n     the legislation since the May 22, 2002 markup of S. 2452. It \n     should be considered in concert with Report 107-175, which \n     describes the core of the legislation--most of which is \n     unchanged. A complete section-by-section analysis is also \n     included.\n       As reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee (GAC) \n     on May 22nd, S. 2452 created a Department of Homeland \n     Security with three directorates: Border and Transportation \n     Protection, Critical Infrastructure Protection, and Emergency \n     Preparedness and Response. The GAC-endorsed legislation now \n     includes additional programs and agencies that will be \n     organized into six directorates: the original three, plus \n     directorates for Intelligence, Immigration and Science and \n     Technology, an expanded version of a Science and Technology \n     Office in the original bill. The key changes are summarized \n     below:\n       The GAC-endorsed legislation adds the Transportation \n     Security Administration (TSA) to the agencies incorporated \n     into the Directorate for Border and Transportation \n     Protection. TSA was created through the Aviation and \n     Transportation Security Act, Pub. L. 107-71, which was signed \n     into law on November 19, 2001. The agency's mission is to \n     protect the country's transportation systems, including rail, \n     highways, and maritime, although currently its main focus is \n     to improve aviation safety. TSA's responsibilities include \n     meeting a series of deadlines to upgrade aviation security, \n     including the hiring of more than 30,000 airport security \n     personnel, deploying explosive detection systems and other \n     security equipment, facilitating airport passenger and \n     baggage inspection, and implementing other measures to \n     heighten the safety of air travel.\n       The inclusion of TSA in the Department will permit better \n     coordination of transportation security operations with other \n     agencies that are responsible for security at the borders. \n     These agencies, which include the Customs Service, Coast \n     Guard, Border Patrol, INS, and border inspection agents from \n     the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service, are \n     responsible for conducting inspections of travelers and goods \n     entering the United States and for securing the international \n     boundaries the United States shares with Mexico and Canada. \n     TSA's mission to secure our transportation infrastructure is \n     closely tied to maintaining the security of the ports of \n     entry where these border agencies are stationed. For example, \n     cargo containers that pass through our ports are conveyed to \n     other parts of the country through our transportation system, \n     either on rail or the highways, and could cause significant \n     harm and disruption to our transportation infrastructure if \n     they contained explosives or were used in a terrorist attack. \n     It is essential for these agencies to coordinate their \n     efforts so that security measures are linked and more \n     seamlessly implemented. This process will be easier with TSA \n     and the key border agencies in the same chain of command.\n       Our transportation system must also be able to move people \n     and goods quickly and efficiently from the borders throughout \n     the country. To ensure the security of this system, TSA needs \n     access to key information regarding vulnerabilities and \n     threats. The Department's Directorate of Intelligence, which \n     I will describe shortly, will have the intelligence \n     architecture to help provide this critical information to TSA \n     and other agencies within the Department. By being closely \n     tied to that intelligence directorate, and to the other \n     border agencies in the Department that will be collecting \n     vital information, TSA will be in a better position to \n     prevent future attacks using the transportation system.\n       Finally, as a new agency TSA may be able to take advantage \n     of some economies of scale offered by the new Department. \n     Specifically, it may not need to create certain \n     capabilities--administrative or otherwise--that will already \n     exist in other components of the Department.\n       In S. 2452, the Customs Service was transferred intact to \n     the Department. This remains the case in the GAC-endorsed \n     legislation, which also provides that Customs will be \n     preserved as a distinct entity.\n       At the request of the Senate Finance Committee Chairman and \n     Ranking Member, the legislation incorporates an amendment, \n     adopted by the Committee and agreed to by both the White \n     House and the Finance Committee Chairman and Ranking Member, \n     which will preserve the ability of the Treasury Secretary--\n     with the concurrence of the Secretary--to issue regulations \n     on customs revenue functions that involve economic judgments \n     within the expertise of the Treasury Department, and which \n     can have a major impact on our economy and relationships with \n     foreign countries. These customs revenue functions include: \n     assessing, collecting, and refunding duties, taxes, and fees \n     on imported goods; administering import quotas and labeling \n     requirements; collecting import data needed to compile \n     international trade statistics; and administering reciprocal \n     trade agreements and trade preference legislation. The \n     Customs Service, reporting to the Secretary, is responsible \n     for administering and enforcing these laws, and indeed\n\n[[Page S8160]]\n\n     for all the Custom Service's traditional border and revenue \n     operations; the Commissioner of Customs is also authorized to \n     develop and support the issuance of regulations by the \n     Treasury Secretary regarding customs revenue functions. After \n     further review, Congress may consider legislation to \n     determine the appropriate allocation of these regulatory \n     authorities between the Secretary of Homeland Security and \n     the Treasury Secretary.\n       The legislation transfers the Federal Law Enforcement \n     Training Center (FLETC) from the Department of the Treasury \n     to the Directorate for Border and Transportation Protection. \n     FLETC provides basic and advanced agency-specific training \n     for law enforcement officers and analysts at over 70 Federal \n     agencies. This training allows for greater standardization of \n     law enforcement training that is also more cost-effective and \n     is taught by professional instructors using modern \n     facilities. Many of its key customer agencies are being \n     transferred to the new Department, including the Secret \n     Service, INS, Border Patrol, Customs Service, Coast Guard, \n     and Federal Protective Service. Given these relationships, \n     the Department will benefit from the inclusion of FLETC.\n       FLETC also provides training to State and local entities \n     and to foreign law enforcement personnel, programs generally \n     not otherwise available to these agencies. The programs also \n     enhance networking and cooperation throughout the law \n     enforcement community, domestically as well as world-wide. \n     Therefore, these programs will support and complement the \n     Department's efforts to work more closely with State and \n     local agencies as well as foreign governments to detect and \n     prevent acts of terrorism.\n       The legislation transfers the Coast Guard to the new \n     Department, and specifies that it be maintained as a distinct \n     entity. At the July 24-25 business meeting, the Committee \n     adopted language intended to maintain the structural and \n     operational integrity of the Coast Guard and the authority of \n     the Commandant, ensure continuation of the non-homeland \n     security missions of the Coast Guard and the Service's \n     capabilities to carry out these missions as it is transferred \n     to the new Department, and ensure that the Commandant reports \n     to the Secretary.\n       The language, offered as an amendment by Senators Stevens \n     and Collins, states that the Secretary may not make any \n     significant change to any of the non-homeland security \n     missions and capabilities of the Coast Guard without the \n     prior approval of the Congress in a subsequent statute. The \n     President may waive this restriction for no more than 90 days \n     upon his declaration and certification to the Congress that a \n     clear, compelling, and immediate state of national emergency \n     exists that justifies such a waiver.\n       The language further directs that the Coast Guard's \n     organizational structure, units, personnel, and non-homeland \n     security missions shall be maintained intact and without \n     reduction after the transfer unless Congress specifies \n     otherwise in subsequent Acts. The language also states that \n     Coast Guard personnel, ships, aircraft, helicopters, and \n     vehicles may not be transferred to the operational control \n     of, or diverted to the principal and continuing use of, \n     any other organization, unit, or entity of the Department.\n       Upon the transfer of the Coast Guard to the Department, the \n     Commandant shall report directly to the Secretary and not \n     through any other official of the Department.\n       The Inspector General of the Department shall annually \n     assess the Coast Guard's performance of all its missions with \n     a particular emphasis on examining the non-homeland security \n     missions.\n       None of the conditions in the approved language shall apply \n     when the Coast Guard operates as a service in the Navy under \n     section 3 of title 14, United States Code.\n       The legislation creates a separate directorate for \n     intelligence (DI) to serve as a national level focal point \n     for information available to the government relating to the \n     plans, intentions, and capabilities of terrorists and \n     terrorist organizations. To emphasize its importance to all \n     aspects of Homeland Security, the DI is an independent \n     directorate within the Department, and is headed by an Under \n     Secretary who reports to the Secretary.\n       This directorate is a new addition to the legislation since \n     the May 22 markup. It stems from the Administration's \n     proposal to create an intelligence analysis unit within the \n     Department. However, the President's concept has been altered \n     and strengthened in response to testimony before the \n     Committee and input from key senators. Specifically, this \n     proposal reflects important input from Senators Levin and \n     Akaka, both in negotiations and amendments offered at the \n     business meeting. In addition, Intelligence Chairman Senator \n     Graham, Intelligence Vice Chairman Senator Shelby, former \n     Intelligence Chairman Senator Specter and Senator Durbin \n     contributed key ideas.\n       As an independent directorate--without the operational \n     responsibilities of other directorates--the DI will focus on \n     providing intelligence analysis to all of the other \n     directorates in the Department, to State and local \n     government, and to law enforcement, for the purpose of \n     preventing terrorist attacks, enhancing border security, \n     protecting critical infrastructure, enhancing emergency \n     preparedness and response, and better informing our research \n     and development activities.\n       It is important to note that the new Department, through \n     its component organizations, will be one of the largest \n     generators in the government of information relevant to \n     terrorism. The data it obtains about persons and goods \n     entering the country must be better organized and coordinated \n     with threat data from other agencies if the new Department is \n     going to be able to do its job. The DI, therefore, will be \n     responsible for receiving and analyzing law enforcement \n     information from agencies of the United States government, \n     State and local government agencies (including law \n     enforcement agencies), and the private sector, and fusing \n     such information and analysis with analytical products, \n     assessments, and warnings concerning foreign intelligence \n     from the CIA's Counterterrorist Center in order to detect and \n     identify threats of terrorism and other threats to homeland \n     security. The Counterterrorist Center shall have primary \n     responsibility for the analysis of foreign intelligence \n     relating to international terrorism. However, the DI may also \n     conduct its own supplemental analysis of foreign intelligence \n     relating to threats of terrorism against the United States \n     and other threats to homeland security.\n       The DI's mission is critical to all the Department's \n     activities, as well as to the homeland security mission of \n     the intelligence community, law enforcement community, and \n     State and local governments. For this reason, unless the \n     President directs otherwise, the Secretary is provided with \n     broad, routine access to reports, assessments, analytical \n     information, and other information--including unevaluated \n     intelligence--from the intelligence community and other \n     United States government agencies. The Secretary will also \n     receive information from State and local government agencies, \n     and the private sector. As the President may further provide, \n     the Secretary is also authorized to request additional \n     information--either information that an agency already has in \n     its possession, or new information that could require further \n     investigation. The Secretary will work with the Director of \n     Central Intelligence and the Attorney General to ensure that \n     all material received by the Department is protected against \n     unauthorized disclosure and that sources and methods are \n     protected.\n       The provision also reflects an amendment by Senator Akaka \n     that makes the Department a full participant in the process, \n     managed by the Director of Central Intelligence, whereby the \n     intelligence community establishes overall requirements and \n     priorities for the collection of national intelligence. \n     Similarly, the Akaka amendment also makes the Directorate \n     responsible for consulting with the Attorney General and \n     other officials to establish overall collection priorities \n     and strategies for information, including law enforcement \n     information, relating to domestic threats.\n       The intelligence proposal reflected in the GAC-endorsed \n     legislation was developed after examining the \n     Administration's proposal and hearing from expert witnesses \n     on the critical need for a national level focal point for the \n     analysis of all information available to the United States to \n     combat terrorism. On June 26 and 27, the Committee held \n     hearings on how to shape the intelligence functions of the \n     proposed Department--to determine how, in light of the \n     failure of our government to bring all of the information \n     available to various agencies together prior to September 11 \n     the government should receive information from the field, \n     both foreign and domestic, and convert it, through analysis, \n     into actionable information that better protects our \n     security.\n       The Committee heard testimony from former directors of the \n     Defense Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, \n     from FBI Director Mueller and Director of Central \n     Intelligence Tenet, and from William Webster--who headed both \n     the FBI and CIA. It also heard from the Chairman and Vice-\n     Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senators Bob Graham \n     and Richard Shelby, whose investigation into the failures of \n     September 11 is expected to yield recommendations for broader \n     reforms that address long-standing and systemic problems \n     within the intelligence community.\n       Senator Graham's written testimony stated that the \n     Intelligence Committee's hearings thus far have uncovered \n     several factors that contributed to the failures of September \n     11--one of which is ``the absence of a single set of eyes to \n     analyze all the bits and pieces of relevant intelligence \n     information, including open source material.'' Senator \n     Shelby's written testimony stated that ``most Americans would \n     probably be surprised to know that even nine months after the \n     terrorist attacks, there is today no federal official, not a \n     single one, to whom the President can turn to ask the simple \n     question, what do we know about current terrorist threats \n     against our homeland? No one person or entity has meaningful \n     access to all such information the government possesses. No \n     one really knows what we know, and no one is even in a \n     position to go to find out.'' General Patrick Hughes, former \n     director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, echoed these \n     points. His testimony stated that, ``in our intelligence \n     community, we currently have an inadequate capability to \n     process, analyze, prepare in contextual and technical forms \n     that make sense and deliver cogent intelligence to users \n     as soon as possible so that the time dependent operational \n     demands for intelligence are met.''\n       The Administration's approach falls short of what we need. \n     A key concern is the mission and position of the intelligence \n     unit\n\n[[Page S8161]]\n\n     within the new Department. By making intelligence its own \n     directorate, our legislation recognizes that the work it does \n     will be instrumental to every other directorate in the \n     organization and to state and local authorities--not just to \n     federal infrastructure protection efforts. The \n     Administration's proposal imbeds the intelligence division \n     within a directorate responsible for critical infrastructure \n     protection. The Administration's proposal is to create an \n     ``information analysis and critical infrastructure protection \n     division''--whose most important role, as CIA Director Tenet \n     testified before the Committee on June 27, would be ``to \n     translate assessments about evolving terrorist targeting \n     strategies, training, and doctrine overseas into a system of \n     protection for the infrastructure of the United States.'' But \n     that is not enough. Intelligence will be crucial not only to \n     infrastructure protection, but to everything this Department \n     will do. It is not hard to imagine many threats to American \n     lives that do not involve infrastructure at all: a plot to \n     detonate a bomb in a shopping mall, for instance, or to \n     unleash a biological agent on a city from above.\n       To be most effective, the entity responsible for producing \n     all-sources intelligence analysis should not be charged with \n     implementing operational responsibilities. The danger in the \n     Administration's approach is that the intelligence analysis \n     function will be consumed by the operational needs of \n     critical infrastructure protection, and not focus enough on \n     other aspects of the homeland security fight.\n       There is also a practical reason why these two functions \n     should be under different Under Secretaries. Both are very \n     complex functions that have never before been performed in \n     our government. These are very demanding jobs and the GAC \n     endorsed amendment places them under different Under \n     Secretaries so that, like border and transportation security, \n     science and technology, immigration, and emergency \n     preparedness and response, they will receive the focused \n     leadership and attention necessary to succeed. Just \n     protecting our cyber assets--which is only one aspect of \n     critical infrastructure--is a daunting challenge that grows \n     more each year.\n       The Under Secretary for Intelligence, who will have to \n     establish and operate a robust Directorate of Intelligence to \n     systematically analyze the threats to our country will be \n     fully consumed with that function. The Under Secretary for \n     Critical Infrastructure Protection, whose role will be to map \n     the threat information to the vulnerabilities in our critical \n     infrastructure, and work closely with other agencies, and the \n     private sector to ensure adequate protective measures are put \n     in place, will also have a huge challenge. However, by making \n     the same official responsible for establishing a robust \n     intelligence division and protecting critical infrastructure, \n     the Administration's proposal underestimates the challenges \n     that we face in both areas.\n       Secondly, the President's proposal does not allow the DI \n     sufficient, routine access to information produced by other \n     parts of the Intelligence Community and other agencies. The \n     GAC-endorsed legislation provides the Secretary with broad, \n     routine access to reports, assessments, analytical \n     information, and other information--including unevaluated \n     intelligence--relating to the capabilities, intentions, and \n     activities of terrorists and terrorist organizations, unless \n     otherwise directed by the President. ``Unevaluated \n     intelligence'' refers to the substance of intelligence \n     reports, absent any information about sources and methods. We \n     use this term based on the recommendation of the Chairman of \n     the Senate Intelligence Committee--precisely to make it clear \n     that information about sources and methods, which is \n     generally included in ``raw intelligence'', will be \n     protected. In contrast, the Administration's proposal would \n     curtail the Secretary's access to unanalyzed information. The \n     Secretary would have routine access to reports, assessments, \n     and analytical information. But, except for information \n     concerning vulnerabilities to critical infrastructure, the \n     Secretary would receive access to unanalyzed information only \n     as the President may further provide.\n       At the Committee's hearing on June 27, Senator Shelby, the \n     Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, objected to the \n     limitations on information access in the President's \n     proposal. He stated that ``unlike information relating to \n     infrastructure or other vulnerabilities to terrorist attack--\n     all of which the Secretary would be given access to `whether \n     or not such information has been analyzed'--information on \n     terrorist threats themselves would be available to the \n     Department only in the form of what is known as `finished' \n     intelligence.'' He testified that, under Sec. 203 of the \n     President's proposal, the Secretary may obtain the underlying \n     information only `by request' or when the President \n     specifically provides for its transmission to the new \n     Department. Senator Shelby called these limitations in the \n     President's bill ``unacceptable''. Clearly, the \n     Administration's proposal would reinforce tendencies not to \n     share information among agencies that have historically been \n     reluctant to share. Our purpose is to remove obstacles to \n     information sharing--obstacles that clearly contributed to \n     the tragedy of September 11--not to reinforce them.\n       The GAC-endorsed amendment establishes a proactive DI. In \n     addition to helping set intelligence priorities and receiving \n     analysis from all other agencies in government, it would have \n     routine access to the unevaluated intelligence, the \n     information behind the reports that DHS will receive, unless \n     the President directs otherwise. The Secretary will also be \n     able to request and receive additional information (as the \n     President further provides) that might require agencies to \n     conduct separate investigations or redeploy resources. We \n     anticipate that the cases would be rare where an agency is \n     unwilling or unable to comply with the Secretary's request; \n     however, the President will ultimately determine how \n     conflicts, if any, will be resolved.\n       During the July 24-25 business meeting, Senator Thompson \n     offered an amendment reflecting the President's approach on \n     intelligence; however that amendment was defeated.\n       S. 2452 included a Directorate for Critical Infrastructure \n     Protection (CIP). The GAC endorsed amendment continues to \n     include that directorate, and expands it to incorporate \n     significant additions as proposed by the President. The \n     Directorate will be headed by an Under Secretary who is \n     appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the \n     Senate.\n       The CIP will combine the key entities, currently scattered \n     across the Federal government, that are charged with working \n     with the private sector and other agencies to protect various \n     sectors of our nation's critical infrastructure. The \n     authorities, functions, personnel, and assets of several \n     offices are transferred to the Department. These include the \n     Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office of the Department of \n     Commerce (established by Presidential Decision Directive 63 \n     in 1998 to coordinate federal initiatives on critical \n     infrastructure); and the National Infrastructure Protection \n     Center of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (other than the \n     Computer Investigations and Operations Section, which the \n     Administration requested remain in the FBI to ensure that \n     it continues to have a capability to pursue computer \n     crimes). To these we have added several important entities \n     from the President's proposal: (1) the National \n     Communications System of the Department of Defense \n     (established by Executive Order in 1984 to assist the \n     President and others in: (a) the exercise of \n     telecommunications functions and (b) coordinating the \n     planning for and provision of national security and \n     emergency preparedness communications); (2) the Computer \n     Security Division of the National Institute of Standards \n     and Technology (NIST) of the Department of Commerce (which \n     is tasked with improving information systems security); \n     (3) The National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis \n     Center of the Department of Energy (established to serve \n     as a source of national competence to address critical \n     infrastructure protection and continuity through support \n     for activities related to counterterrorism, threat \n     assessment, and risk mitigation); (4) The Federal Computer \n     Incident Response Center of the General Service \n     Administration (a partnership of computer incident \n     response, security, and law enforcement personnel to share \n     information and handle computer security incidents); and \n     (5) The Energy Security and Assurance Program of the \n     Department of Energy, a national security program to help \n     reduce America's energy supply vulnerability from severe \n     disruptions due to natural or malevolent causes.\n       Finally, the GAC endorsed legislation transfers the Federal \n     Protective Service of the General Services Administration \n     (GSA) to the CIP. The President proposed that FPS be \n     transferred to the Border and Transportation Protection \n     Directorate. The Federal Protective Service oversees security \n     at Federal property managed by GSA. Its expertise and mission \n     is to provide physical security for some of our nation's key \n     resources, making it more appropriate that it be combined \n     with the other entities responsible for physical security and \n     cyber security in this Directorate.\n       The GAC endorsed legislation establishes specialized \n     research and analysis units in the CIP to process \n     intelligence and identify vulnerabilities in key areas, \n     including: (a) Public health, (b) food and water storage, \n     production, and distribution; (c) commerce systems, including \n     banking and finance; (d) energy systems, including electric \n     power and oil and gas production and storage; (e) \n     transportation systems, including pipelines; (f) information \n     and communication systems; (g) continuity of government \n     services; and (h) other systems or facilities the destruction \n     of which would cause substantial hard to health, safety, \n     property, or the environment.\n       Among its other duties, the CIP shall be responsible for \n     receiving relevant information from the Directorate of \n     Intelligence, law enforcement, and other information to \n     assess the vulnerabilities of the key resources and critical \n     infrastructures; identifying priorities and supporting \n     protective measures by the Department and other entities; \n     developing a comprehensive national plan for securing key \n     resources and critical infrastructure; enhancing and sharing \n     of information regarding cyber-security and physical \n     security; developing security standards, tracking \n     vulnerabilities, proposing improved risk management policies; \n     and delineating the roles of various governmental agencies in \n     preventing, defending, and recovering from attacks.\n       The Directorate will also be responsible for establishing \n     the necessary organizational structure to provide leadership \n     and focus on both cyber-security and physical security, and \n     ensuring the maintenance of a nucleus of\n\n[[Page S8162]]\n\n     cyber and physical security experts in the United States \n     Government. Both cyber and physical security are critical to \n     the adequate protection of those systems on which our \n     nation's economy and culture depend. The CIP will be \n     responsible for utilizing the best modeling, simulation, and \n     analytic tools to prioritize the effort.\n       The creation of this Directorate indicates broad consensus \n     on the need for a single entity to coordinate a national \n     effort to secure America's critical infrastructure. This is a \n     shared responsibility of Federal, State, and local \n     governments along with a private sector which owns 85% of our \n     nation's critical infrastructure. However, unlike the \n     President's proposal, which combines information analysis and \n     infrastructure protection under one Under Secretary, the GAC \n     amendment places Critical Infrastructure Protection in its \n     own directorate where it will work closely with the \n     Intelligence Directorate. This was done both to elevate and \n     stress the centrality of intelligence analysis to all of the \n     Department's missions, but also because critical \n     infrastructure protection is a sufficiently complex and \n     daunting challenge that it will require the focused \n     leadership and attention of an Under Secretary.\n       As reported out of the Committee in May, S. 2452 would have \n     transferred the law enforcement programs of the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service to the new Department, while \n     leaving its service functions at the Department of Justice. \n     However, key senators and immigration experts argued that \n     this course could undermine the critical task of reforming \n     the INS. The GAC-endorsed legislation now transfers all \n     immigration functions to the new Department, but specifies \n     that the INS be disbanded and reorganized along the lines of \n     a major, bipartisan reform bill, S. 2444, sponsored by \n     Senators Kennedy and Brownback. These senators are the \n     chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the immigration \n     subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and have \n     assembled an impressive bipartisan majority of that committee \n     in support of their legislation. Rather than try to \n     characterize their handiwork for them, I am attaching a \n     letter from Senators Kennedy and Brownback describing the \n     substance of the immigration reforms now incorporated in this \n     legislation.\n       Because the work of reforming INS is very demanding, the \n     immigration programs will be in their own directorate, with \n     direct accountability to the Secretary, rather than included \n     as part of the Border and Transportation Protection \n     directorate. However, to ensure adequate coordination between \n     immigration programs and other agencies that operate at the \n     border, the legislation creates a Border Security Working \n     Group. This Working Group will consist primarily of the \n     Secretary, or his designee, and the Under Secretaries for \n     Immigration and Border and Transportation Protection. It will \n     meet at least four times a year, and coordinate matters \n     including budget requests, staffing requirements, and use of \n     equipment. This working group can also bring in other federal \n     agencies with border operations (such as the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration or the Food and Drug Administration) that are \n     not part of the Department, offering a critical mechanism for \n     government-wide coordination along the border and at ports of \n     entry.\n       The legislation also gives the Secretary regulatory \n     authority over the visa application process. Consular \n     employees at the Department of State would continue to \n     process visa applications. However, the Secretary would have \n     authority to issue regulations concerning the application \n     process. This would include the required procedures for \n     considering an application, such as whether all applicants \n     must be interviewed in person or what kind of \n     identification documents would be required. In addition, \n     the Secretary would have authority to station Departmental \n     employees oversees to consult with State Department \n     employees on the visa process and specific threats.\n       The homeland security mission will face profound \n     technological needs and requirements, and the challenges are \n     substantial. The first challenge derives from the fact that \n     most research and development of new technologies relevant to \n     homeland security will occur outside the new Department--in \n     other agencies, academia, and the private sector. Therefore, \n     the Department will require powerful tools and mechanisms to \n     elicit cooperation from entities external to the Department, \n     and to coordinate R efforts across a range of disparate \n     groups, each with their own missions and priorities, in \n     service to homeland security goals. The legislation attempts \n     to provide the Directorate of Science and Technology with the \n     mechanisms it needs to resolve this fundamental coordination \n     problem. The legislation establishes a Security Advanced \n     Research Projects Agency (SARPA), which is inspired by the \n     highly successful Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency \n     (DARPA) of the Department of Defense (DOD). Following the \n     DARPA model, SARPA will have funding, in the form of an \n     Acceleration Fund, to support key homeland security R both \n     within and outside of the federal government, and to leverage \n     collaboration on R between entities, particularly among the \n     agencies. A second mechanism provided under the legislation \n     is a Science and Technology Council consisting of senior R \n     officials from the agencies and other appropriate entities. \n     The Council will assist the Under Secretary in coordinating \n     interagency efforts to execute the science and technology \n     agenda of the Department, primarily through supporting the \n     development of a comprehensive technology roadmap for \n     establishing common priorities and allocating individual \n     responsibilities. Another important mechanism is the ability \n     to directly engage any of the Department of Energy (DOE) \n     national laboratory and sites through joint sponsorship \n     agreements in carrying out R activities for homeland \n     security purposes. With respect to bioterrorism research, the \n     Secretary will be able to ensure that the best researchers \n     are focused on developing necessary countermeasures against \n     biothreats by establishing general priorities for biothreat \n     research programs conducted at the National Institutes of \n     Health.\n       A second R challenge is to assure that the Directorate \n     will have expedient access to broad, deep, and ongoing \n     support for critical analysis and decision-making regarding \n     scientific or technical issues. To address this issue, the \n     legislation provides authority for the Directorate to \n     contract with or establish Federally Funded Research and \n     Development Centers (FFRDCs) to obtain independent \n     analytical, scientific, and technical expertise and support, \n     including support for risk analysis and risk management \n     functions. In addition, an Office of Risk Analysis and \n     Assessment is created within the Directorate to ensure that \n     such risk analysis functions are given institutional priority \n     and conducted internally or through outsourcing to FFRDCs.\n       A third challenge is for the Department to develop and \n     effectively manage a critical mass of internal homeland \n     security R capabilities. The legislation transfers a number \n     of entities from the Department of Energy, and one to be \n     created in the Department of Defense, that will constitute a \n     core scientific base upon which the Department will conduct \n     in-house R efforts central to its mission. Fundamental to \n     developing this in-house expertise is the ability to procure \n     a strong talent base and to engage them in innovative \n     projects quickly. In view of this, the legislation affords \n     the Secretary with flexible management tools to hire and \n     retain top flight scientific and technical personnel, as well \n     as to accelerate R and prototype projects to advance the \n     homeland security mission.\n       Intelligent and coordinated deployment of technology within \n     the Department is a fourth challenge that must be overcome. \n     Too often, government agencies are hampered and distracted \n     from their fundamental missions as a result of unstructured \n     and technically unsophisticated approaches to technology \n     acquisition and deployment that lead to interoperability \n     problems downstream. The legislation establishes an Office \n     for Technology Evaluation and Transition to assist the Under \n     Secretary in his responsibilities as the chief technology \n     officer and to assure his central role in testing, \n     evaluating, and approving new homeland security technologies \n     being considered by the Department for acquisition.\n       Lastly, the Committee recognizes that a sea of scientific \n     and technological expertise and resources resides outside the \n     walls of the Federal government, and has therefore included \n     several provisions to engage the private sector in \n     maintaining our national security. Transition of technology \n     is emphasized throughout the section. An Advisory Panel \n     consisting of experts from the private sector and academia \n     may be convened by the Secretary to advise the Under \n     Secretary and Council and promote communication with non-\n     federal entities. The Office of Technology Evaluation and \n     Transition described earlier will provide a gateway and \n     clearinghouse for companies with innovative technologies \n     relating to homeland security. This Office will also have \n     particular responsibility for facilitating the transition of \n     technologies into fielded systems for use by the Department, \n     other agencies, or private sector entities. Another provision \n     requires the Secretary to articulate a strategy and plan for \n     encouraging biotechnology firms, pharmaceutical companies, \n     and other entities to develop countermeasures against \n     biological and chemical weapons, with a view towards \n     commercial production. A fourth provision directs the Under \n     Secretary to establish a National Emergency Technology Guard \n     composed of teams of volunteer experts in science and \n     technology to assist local communities in responding to and \n     recovering from disasters requiring specialized scientific or \n     technical skills.\n       Taken in combination, the mechanisms granted by the \n     legislation provide the Department with an array of tools \n     with which to forcefully tackle the set of R challenges \n     confronting it. The legislative history and specific details \n     regarding the legislation are discussed in greater detail \n     below.\n       S. 2452, as reported out of the Committee on May 22, \n     contained a provision establishing an Office of Science and \n     Technology within the new Department of Homeland Security. \n     The underlying intent of this provision was to create an R \n     entity similar in organization and function to the Defense \n     Advanced Research Projects Agency, which was selected as an \n     appropriate model for the Department's R component in light \n     of the fact that the Department, as originally contemplated, \n     would have had limited capability to conduct R internally. \n     Consequently, it was determined that the Department could \n     most effectively initiate and promote R in support of its \n     mission through a DARPA-like entity with a lean, flexible \n     organizational structure joined with funding to leverage \n     external interagency collaboration. Since the release of the \n     President's proposal for the Department, and in\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\n     response to that and additional input received by the \n     Committee from a broad range of contributors, including \n     other Member offices and experts from the scientific \n     research and technology communities, the scope and \n     responsibilities of the Office have been broadened.\n       The legislation redesignates the Office of Science and \n     Technology as the ``Directorate of Science and Technology'' \n     (``Directorate''), and elevates the head of the Directorate \n     to the rank of a Senate-confirmed Under Secretary. This \n     follows the consensus view of the National Academy of \n     Sciences that the Directorate's chief science and technology \n     (S) official requires sufficient stature to influence and \n     coordinate S policies and activities outside the \n     Department. The Under Secretary will be responsible for \n     executing the Directorate's mission of managing and \n     supporting R activities to meet national homeland security \n     needs and objectives; articulating national R goals, \n     priorities, and strategies pursuant to the mission of the \n     Department; coordinating with entities within and outside \n     government to advance the R agenda of the Department; \n     advising the Secretary of the Department on all scientific \n     and technical matters; facilitating the transfer and \n     deployment of technologies critical to homeland security \n     needs; and generally serving as the Department's chief \n     technology officer.\n       The legislation provides a number of key components to \n     assist the Directorate in meeting its mission. First among \n     these is SARPA, the new R agency modeled after DARPA that \n     was established in the original version of the legislation \n     and is retained in the amended legislation. DARPA was created \n     in 1958 in response to the launch of Sputnik. It is an \n     organization that recruits outstanding scientific and \n     technical talent and funds high-risk, high-payoff projects \n     that offer the potential for revolutionary advances. DARPA's \n     nimble, aggressive and creative approach has consistently \n     produced impressive and effective war-fighting technologies. \n     Moreover, in the course of fulfilling its central mission, \n     DARPA has developed technologies with broad commercial and \n     societal application, such as the Internet. Of particular \n     significance to the Committee in selecting DARPA as a model \n     for the S apparatus in the Department is DARPA's use of its \n     funding to leverage R investments in other parts of DOD, \n     effectively generating a multiplier effect that maximizes \n     DARPA's contribution to national defense in disproportion to \n     its actual funding level. Over five decades, DARPA has been \n     recognized as one of the most productive engines of \n     technological innovation in the U.S. government.\n       While DARPA concentrates primarily on the development of \n     revolutionary technologies, SARPA will have a broader focus \n     consistent with its larger mission. Since there are many \n     technologies relevant to homeland security in various stages \n     of development and deployment, SARPA will promote a wide \n     range of technology development, transition, and deployment \n     efforts, as well as research for revolutionary new \n     technologies. Nevertheless, the Committee anticipates that \n     with an Acceleration Fund authorized at $200 million for \n     FY03, SARPA will have the foundation for replicating or \n     exceeding DARPA's success in catalyzing critical new \n     technologies by initiating and leveraging R among public, \n     private, or university innovators. Under an amendment offered \n     by Senator Stevens, ten percent of the Acceleration Fund is \n     to be allocated to Coast Guard homeland security R missions \n     for FY'04 and FY'05 through a joint agreement with the \n     Commandant of the Coast Guard.\n       While Congress should restrain itself in directing \n     particular management strategies, it is the Committee's \n     expectation that SARPA will take full advantage of evolving \n     modern management strategies in the R field, particularly \n     in assuring effective technology transition. For example, the \n     Committee would expect SARPA to engage in a careful ``needs \n     identification'' effort which involves eventual technology \n     ``users'' in its R roadmapping and planning exercises. The \n     Committee also expects that it operate not simply as a \n     traditional research organization but that it explore methods \n     to involve venture participants, incubate new technologies, \n     encourage the startup process, facilitate prototyping, and \n     promote strategic government and private sector supporters \n     and investors. SARPA will also need to actively encourage \n     connections with technology first-adopters in and out of \n     government, and establish interactive feedback systems for \n     technology development and deployment to ensure sustained \n     interaction between front-line researchers and with users.\n       To support the Directorate and its functions, an \n     interagency Science and Technology Council, which is the \n     successor to the Science and Technology Steering Council \n     contained in the original version of the legislation, will \n     advise the Under Secretary on priorities and strategies for \n     homeland security R This Council will consist of senior \n     R officials from across the government and will serve to \n     facilitate interagency coordination on R activities \n     pertinent to homeland security. One of the chief \n     responsibilities of the Council will be to assist the Under \n     Secretary in developing overarching technology roadmap that \n     will enable a coherent national homeland security R program \n     to be coordinated among the many federal agencies.\n       The Administration's proposal contemplated the designation \n     of one of the DOE national laboratories to serve as the \n     primary research and development center for the Department. \n     However, in recognition of the extensive scope and nature of \n     homeland security R, as well as the different research and \n     technology-related capabilities possessed by each of the DOE \n     laboratories and sites, the GAC-endorsed legislation \n     establishes in the Directorate an Office for National \n     Laboratories to coordinate and utilize such entities in \n     creating a networked laboratory system to support the \n     missions of the Department. Through joint sponsorship \n     agreements with the DOE, the legislation allows the \n     Department to easily access and benefit from the combined \n     expertise of all of the DOE laboratories and sites.\n       The Department will have extraordinary analytical needs \n     cutting across of all of its Directorates, especially with \n     regard to the assessment, analysis, and management of \n     threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. Although the \n     Administration's bill did not specifically address this need, \n     the President's Strategic Plan released in mid-July suggests \n     that risk analysis is a fundamental issue that needs to be \n     addressed in planning for our nation's security. Although the \n     legislation vests ultimate responsibility for risk analysis \n     and risk management by the Department with the Secretary, all \n     the Directorates will be required to assist the Secretary in \n     coordination with each other and consistent with their own \n     missions. The Directorate of Science and Technology has a \n     contributing role to play in this framework by providing the \n     Secretary and the other Directorates with scientific and \n     technical support for such functions. To ensure that the \n     Directorate has access to the requisite resources and \n     expertise to fulfill its risk analysis responsibilities and \n     other research-related functions, the legislation gives the \n     Department the power to contract with or establish FFRDCs-\n     independent, non-profit institutions that conduct analysis \n     and provide support integral to the mission and operation of \n     the sponsoring agency. Thirty-six FFRDCs across the nation \n     have proven indispensable in enabling the government to \n     undertake research with a creativity and flexibility not \n     always available within the confines of a federal agency. \n     The importance of FFRDCs is underscored by a prominent \n     study on homeland security conducted by the National \n     Academy of Sciences, which recommended the establishment \n     of an FFRDC to furnish capabilities related to risk \n     analysis, scenario-based threat assessments, red teaming, \n     and other functions. Moreover, an Office of Risk Analysis \n     and Assessment is created within the Directorate to ensure \n     that these functions are given institutional priority and \n     carried out--whether internally or through outsourcing to \n     FFRDCs--in a coordinated manner in accordance with the \n     Secretary's requirements and overall management. This \n     Office will assume operational responsibility within the \n     Directorate and on behalf of the Under Secretary for \n     supporting the risk analysis and risk management needs of \n     the Secretary and the other Directorates, as well as help \n     ensure that R activities are aligned with risks and \n     threats.\n       The President's proposal included language that would grant \n     the Department control over funds appropriated to the \n     National Institute of Health (NIH) for bioterrorism research. \n     Although the provision clearly contemplated that these funds \n     would remain committed to the NIH for application in \n     accordance with the Department's guidelines, the Committee \n     was concerned that the provision technically allowed for such \n     funds to be transferred to other agencies, thereby depriving \n     the NIH of funding necessary to conduct its critical research \n     in this area. With the collaboration of staff from the \n     Administration and Senator Thompson's office, a final \n     provision was negotiated under which NIH funds would not be \n     transferred out of the HHS. Instead, through joint strategic \n     agreements, the Secretary of the Department would set general \n     research priorities for the funds, while the HHS would \n     establish the specific scientific research agenda as well as \n     award and manage all grants. This modified language will \n     protect our strategic commitment to biodefense research, \n     while leaving the means and methods for this research to the \n     scientists at the NIH.\n       The President's proposal targeted a number of R entities \n     and programs in other agencies for transfer into the \n     Department. While the Committee does not agree with all of \n     the Administration's transfers, it recognizes the value of \n     providing the Department with a critical base of in-house R \n     capabilities. Therefore, most of the programs targeted by the \n     Administration have been moved, including the chemical, \n     biological, and nuclear threat assessment and detection \n     programs within the Department of Energy (DOE) relevant to \n     homeland security, and the National Bio-Weapons Defense \n     Analysis Center to be created within the Department of \n     Defense. The transferred programs will be collectively \n     supervised by a new Office of Laboratory Research. Together, \n     these transferred entities will confer a basic in-house \n     research capability with the resident scientific expertise to \n     help the Directorate better coordinate the broader \n     government-wide homeland R portfolio.\n       Given that the Federal government represents only one of \n     several sectors in our nation with R resources and \n     expertise, the Department will require mechanisms to engage \n     and benefit from private sector and academic efforts \n     regarding homeland security. Toward this end, the legislation \n     allows for the establishment of an Advisory Panel consisting \n     of experts from the private sector,\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\n     academia, State, and local entities to advise and support the \n     Under Secretary and the Science and Technology Council. The \n     Panel will ensure that a diversity of perspectives are taken \n     into consideration in the establishment of priorities, and \n     that the contributions to be made from the private sector are \n     properly addressed and incorporated into the national \n     homeland security effort.\n       The Directorate will also include an Office for Technology \n     Evaluation and Transition, which will serve as a \n     clearinghouse and national point-of-contact for companies and \n     other entities that possess technologies relevant to homeland \n     security. The Office will evaluate these technologies and, if \n     appropriate, assist in developing and transitioning them into \n     Department entities or other agencies possessing matching \n     needs. The Technical Support Working Group (TSWG) provides an \n     applicable model for this function, and the legislation \n     requires the Office to coordinate with or work through TSWG, \n     or use TSWG as a model, in performing this technology \n     solicitation and transition role. It is also intended that \n     this Office serve as the Department's internal center for \n     testing and evaluating new technologies being considered for \n     acquisition or deployment by the Department or its entities. \n     The new Department will be a large one, and very dependent on \n     technology in carrying out its homeland mission. As a result, \n     it is vital that new technologies deployed in the \n     Department's component Directorates and other entities be \n     compatible and interoperable to ensure efficiency and \n     expanded capability. The Office, by performing the \n     Department's testing and evaluation function, will support \n     the Under Secretary in carrying out his duties as the \n     Department's chief technology officer. In addition to \n     conducting testing and evaluation activities for the \n     Department, the Office will also coordinate with the \n     Department's Chief Information Officer and with other \n     agencies in promoting government-wide compatibility and \n     interoperability with regard to homeland security \n     technologies and systems.\n       Rapidly developing medicines and antidotes to counter \n     chemical and biological weapons is an enormous challenge and \n     one that government-supported R cannot accomplish on its \n     own. The legislation directs the Secretary to implement a \n     strategy to engage the biotechnology and pharmaceutical \n     industries in the critical research and product development \n     that will produce antidotes and vaccines to the chemical and \n     biological weapons that terrorists may employ against our \n     nation. This strategy should explore and suggest ways to \n     provide incentives and facilitate ``bench-to-bedside'' \n     transition for these products.\n       Recognizing that technological prowess in this country is \n     in communities, as well as colleges and companies, the \n     Department must tap the boundless expertise and energy of \n     ordinary citizens. Drawing on legislation developed in the \n     Senate Commerce Committee, the legislation endorsed by the \n     Committee creates a National Emergency Technology Guard of \n     volunteers with expertise in science and technology to assist \n     local communities in responding to and recovering from \n     emergencies requiring scientific or technical expertise.\n       As reported on May 22, S. 2452 included a Directorate of \n     Emergency Preparedness and Response, with FEMA as its core. \n     The new GAC-endorsed legislation retains this directorate and \n     expands it to include some of the programs the Administration \n     proposed moving to the new department. This amendment also \n     provides that the President may appoint the same person to \n     serve as both the Director of FEMA and the Under Secretary \n     for this directorate.\n       This directorate's responsibilities include organizing and \n     training local entities to respond to emergencies and \n     providing State and local authorities with equipment for \n     detection, protection, and decontamination in an emergency \n     involving weapons of mass destruction; overseeing \n     Federal, State, and local emergency preparedness training \n     and exercise programs; assembling a single Federal \n     disaster plan to help orchestrate Federal assistance for \n     any emergency; coordinating among private sector entities, \n     including the health community, in emergency planning and \n     response activities; and developing a comprehensive plan \n     to address the interface of medical informatics and the \n     medical response to terrorism. (Medical informatics is the \n     scientific field that addresses the storage, retrieval, \n     sharing, and optimal use of biomedical information, data, \n     and knowledge for problem-solving and decision-making.) \n     This directorate also creates a National Crisis Action \n     Center to coordinate federal support for State and local \n     governments and the private sector during a crisis; \n     additionally, the directorate is responsible for ensuring \n     the appropriate integration of operational activities of \n     the Department of Defense, the National Guard, and other \n     federal agencies in the Federal Response Plan in order to \n     respond to acts of terrorism and other disasters.\n       In addition to FEMA, the Emergency Preparedness and \n     Response directorate transfers the National Office of \n     Domestic Preparedness, within the FBI. This entity was \n     created by the Attorney General in 1998 and coordinates \n     federal efforts to assist state and local emergency \n     responders with training and materials necessary to respond \n     to an event involving weapons of mass destruction. The Office \n     of Domestic Preparedness (ODP) within the Department of \n     Justice is also transferred. ODP was developed to help train \n     State and local law enforcement agencies to respond to \n     terrorist incidents.\n       The Administration proposed transferring the Select Agent \n     Registration Enforcement Program from the Centers for Disease \n     Control within the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     to the Department. The Select Agent Registration Enforcement \n     Program was developed to identify all biological agents and \n     toxins that may threaten public health and safety, regulate \n     the transfer of such agents and toxins, and establish a \n     registration scheme regulating their possession, use, and \n     transfer. The GAC-endorsed legislation transfers this program \n     to the Emergency Preparedness and Response directorate \n     because it is a program critical to preparing for and \n     responding to a public health emergency. The Under Secretary \n     for Science and Technology, the Secretary of Agriculture, and \n     the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention will work together to establish and update the \n     list of toxins to be monitored.\n       Like the Administration's proposal, the GAC-endorsed \n     legislation transfers the Strategic National Stockpile to the \n     new department. The Strategic National Stockpile is a \n     stockpile of drugs and vaccines that may be used in the event \n     of a terrorist attack or other emergencies. However, because \n     of CDC's experience and expertise, the legislation allows for \n     the Stockpile to be managed on a day-to-day basis for the \n     Department by CDC through a new Bioterrorism Preparedness and \n     Response Division, which is created in this legislation \n     pursuant to an amendment from Senator Cleland. However, the \n     Department would remain in charge of the overall strategic \n     planning concerning the Stockpile. The Public Health \n     Emergency and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of \n     2002 authorized funds for both the Stockpile and the \n     acquisition of smallpox vaccine doses and potassium iodide. \n     Consequently, the GAC-endorsed legislation transfers \n     responsibility for the acquisition of smallpox doses and \n     potassium iodide to this directorate as well.\n       Finally, the Administration also proposed transferring the \n     Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health \n     Preparedness (OPHP) from the Department of Health and Human \n     Services to the Emergency Preparedness and Response \n     directorate. This office has three primary components: (1) \n     the awarding and administration of state and local grants for \n     public health preparedness; (2) the Principal Science \n     Advisor, who advises the Secretary on the global R strategy \n     for HHS; and, (3) the Office of Emergency Preparedness, which \n     manages rapid-response emergency health and first-responder \n     personnel. From this Office of the Assistant Secretary for \n     Public Health Preparedness, the GAC-endorsed legislation \n     transfers the Office of Emergency Preparedness.\n       The other two components of the OPHP each play a role in \n     emergency response, but also a very extensive role in general \n     public health. Because they perform a dual-use function, and \n     because of their extensive interaction with other parts of \n     HHS, it does not seem appropriate to transfer them to the new \n     department. Additionally, experts in the public health and \n     biomedical communities expressed concern that the \n     Administration's proposal would not operate effectively. The \n     OPHP was established to address the problems of intra-agency \n     communication and coordination, and it could reverse the \n     gains achieved by this office to remove it from the \n     department with which it is primarily engaged. Indeed, HHS \n     would be probably be forced to re-create this capacity \n     internally if OPHP were transferred to the Department.\n       At the same time, it is important the Department have in-\n     house capability to address biological, chemical, and nuclear \n     weapons. Consequently, the Department would include those \n     public health and biomedical programs--the OEP, the Select \n     Agent Registration Enforcement Programs, and the Strategic \n     National Stockpile--which focus primarily on terrorism and \n     emergency response.\n\n\n                             Secret Service\n\n       The legislation adopts the Administration's proposal to \n     include the United States Secret Service as a distinct entity \n     reporting directly to the Secretary. The Service has a dual \n     mission of protection and investigation, with a central focus \n     on preventing attacks and other missions now very relevant to \n     terrorist threats. The Service was originally created to \n     safeguard the country's currency and financial payment \n     systems, and it remains the sole agency charged with \n     enforcing the counterfeiting statutes. Its responsibility for \n     protecting the country's financial infrastructure has led to \n     an expansion of the Service's investigative mission, which \n     now includes crimes involving identity theft, credit card \n     fraud, false identification documents, computer fraud, and \n     financial institution fraud. In addition, the Secret Service \n     is well-known for its mission to protect the nation's highest \n     elected leaders and their families, as well as visiting heads \n     of state. In recent years, the Secret Service has assumed \n     responsibility for planning, coordinating, and implementing \n     security operations at National Special Security Events, as \n     designated by the President. It also has created the National \n     Threat Assessment Center, which provides advice and training \n     to law enforcement and other organizations with \n     responsibilities to investigate or prevent targeted violence.\n       The missions of the Secret Service have a clear connection \n     to the fundamental mission of the new Department. Its \n     protective mission is central to safeguarding the country's\n\n[[Page S8165]]\n\n     leadership. Many of the crimes it is charged with \n     investigating involve activities in which terrorists often \n     engage. And it is an agency that is uniquely focused on \n     assessing vulnerabilities and designing ways to reduce them \n     in advance of an attack, an expertise that will benefit the \n     new Department. The responsibilities and experience of the \n     Secret Service support its transfer as a separate office \n     reporting directly to the Secretary rather than its inclusion \n     in one of the Directorates. This structure will allow the \n     Service to draw on the expertise and resources of the \n     Directorates to support its protective mission, as well as to \n     provide its own expertise and experience to the rest of \n     the Department.\n\n\n                State and Local Government Coordination\n\n       Homeland security is clearly a joint responsibility among \n     the Federal, State, and local governments. There are many \n     ways in which the bill recognizes the importance of these \n     relationships and places a high priority on ensuring that the \n     Department works closely with, and provides significant \n     assistance to, State and local agencies. To coordinate this \n     effort, the Department will have an office devoted to \n     facilitating effective communications and partnerships with \n     State and local government. The Office for State and Local \n     Government Coordination will be established within the office \n     of the Secretary to ensure that the needs and role of State \n     and local governments are considered throughout the work of \n     each of the Department's directorates. In addition to \n     coordinating the activities of the Department relating to \n     State and local governments, the Office will be responsible \n     for assessing and advocating for the resources needed by \n     State and local government to implement the national strategy \n     for combating terrorism. This advocacy function is necessary \n     so that budget decisions to implement the national strategy \n     are made with the full understanding of the role that State \n     and local governments will play in implementing the strategy, \n     as well as the resources necessary at all levels of \n     government for success.\n       The Secretary, in conjunction with the Director of the \n     National Office for Combating Terrorism, is responsible for \n     working with State and local governments to develop a \n     national strategy for combating terrorism--not simply a \n     Federal strategy. Thus, the Office for State and Local \n     Government Coordination will develop a process for receiving \n     meaningful input from State and local government to assist in \n     the development of the strategy for homeland security and \n     other homeland activities. The Office will also provide State \n     and local government with regular information, research, and \n     technical support to assist local efforts at securing the \n     homeland.\n       The GAC-endorsed legislation incorporates an amendment, \n     offered by Senators Collins and Carper, which creates the \n     position of Chief Homeland Security Liaison Officer, who is \n     charged with coordinating the efforts of homeland security \n     liaison officers in each state. These liaison officers will \n     work with State and local first responders to make sure that \n     these organizations receive the training and resources they \n     need. A Federal Interagency Committee on First Responders \n     will bring together the federal agencies that work most \n     closely with State and local first responders and will be \n     counseled by an Advisory Council, including representatives \n     of first responders and urban and rural communities.\n       To further encourage communication and coordination between \n     the Department and State and local agencies, the GAC-endorsed \n     legislation authorizes the Secretary to establish an employee \n     exchange program. This program--which was suggested by \n     Senator Voinovich--would allow employees of the Department \n     and State and local agencies with homeland security \n     responsibilities to work together, to share their specialized \n     expertise, and to enhance their ability to assess threats \n     against the country, develop appropriate responses, and \n     inform the public. Employees who participate in the program \n     must have appropriate training or experience to perform the \n     work required by the assignment, and assignments must be \n     structured to appropriately safeguard classified and other \n     sensitive information.\n\n\n                    Office of International Affairs\n\n       The legislation includes an amendment offered by Senator \n     Thompson that creates an Office of International Affairs \n     within the office of the Secretary. The Director of the \n     Office will be responsible for promoting the exchange of \n     information with foreign nations to encourage sharing of best \n     practices and technologies relating to homeland security. \n     This information exchange will include joint research and \n     development on countermeasures, joint training exercises for \n     first responders, exchange programs, and international \n     conferences. The Director will manage the activities under \n     this provision in consultation with the Department of State \n     and other relevant Federal officials. These programs will be \n     developed first with countries that are already highly \n     focused on homeland security issues and that have previously \n     engaged in fruitful cooperation with the United States in the \n     area of counterterrorism.\n\n\n                    MANAGEMENT AND TRANSITION ISSUES\n\n     Management structure\n       The Administration's proposed legislation calls for the \n     appointment of a number of management officials to support \n     the Secretary in carrying out the mission of the Department. \n     The Committee-endorsed legislation includes much, though not \n     all, of the management structure proposed by the \n     Administration.\n       Secretary--First and foremost, the Committee-endorsed \n     legislation calls for a strong Secretary, vested with \n     effective, centralized management authority over what will be \n     a large new organization. Although responsibilities under \n     this legislation are allocated among the various \n     Directorates, it is intended that all powers provided under \n     this bill be subject to the full control and direction of the \n     Secretary. Also, while the bill establishes the basic \n     organizational framework for the new Department and \n     establishes its principal components, carrying out this \n     organizational task is only part of the role that the new \n     Secretary must play. While a number of more subjective \n     management factors cannot be defined in statutory language, \n     we anticipate that the new Secretary will need to spend a \n     great deal of time on key management tasks that cannot be \n     embodied in a formal organizational structure. These tasks \n     include: creating a sense of shared values across the new \n     Department and its disparate components; ensuring that core \n     skills and competencies are both developed and shared across \n     the Department; developing an effective common departmental \n     strategy for achieving the agency's missions with buy-in \n     among component agencies; deciding on the key systems and \n     management processes apart from the organizational structure \n     that will manage and bind together the new Department; \n     assuring that the success of those systems and processes are \n     measured and evaluated frequently to test their performance; \n     ensuring that departmental personnel gain experience in a \n     variety of agency components to encourage cross-agency \n     thinking, capability, and solutions so that the synergy of a \n     new Department can be realized, and establishing a leadership \n     style that will create a strong organizational culture based \n     on the values and attitudes the new Department must have to \n     effectively perform its mission. The bill aims to create a \n     structure that will enable the new Secretary to carry out \n     these critical management efforts.\n       The Department will be headed by a Presidentially \n     appointed, Senate-confirmed Secretary. The Secretary's duties \n     include developing policies and plans for the promotion of \n     homeland security, carrying out and promoting the other \n     established missions of entities transferred to the \n     Department, and developing a comprehensive strategy for \n     combating terrorism and the homeland security response in \n     conjunction with the Director of the National Office for \n     Combating Terrorism.\n       The Secretary is charged with consulting with the Secretary \n     of Defense and the nation's governors to integrate the \n     National Guard into the nation's strategy to combat \n     terrorism. The Secretary must also consult and coordinate \n     with the Secretary of Defense regarding military \n     organization, equipment, and assets that are critical to \n     fighting terrorism, as well as the training of personnel to \n     respond to terrorist attacks involving chemical or biological \n     agents.\n       Section 102 details numerous other duties of the Secretary.\n       Deputy Secretary--Section 103 provides for appointment of a \n     Deputy Secretary, subject to Senate confirmation, responsible \n     for assisting the Secretary.\n       Under Secretary for Management--The Administration proposal \n     calls for the appointment of an Under Secretary for \n     Management with broad responsibilities for management and \n     administration of the Department. Section 104 of the \n     Committee-endorsed bill establishes this position with \n     substantially the same responsibilities as in the \n     Administration bill. These include budget and other financial \n     matters, procurement, human resources and personnel, \n     information technology and communications, facilities and \n     other material resources, security for the Department, and \n     managing performance measures for the Department.\n       Assistant Secretaries--The Administration requested \n     authority for the President to appoint not more than six \n     Senate-confirmed Assistant Secretaries, without specifying in \n     statute what the responsibilities of these officers would be. \n     Following generally the Administration's approach, section \n     105 of the legislation authorizes the President to appoint up \n     to five such Assistant Secretaries (these do not include the \n     two additional, Senate-confirmed Assistant Secretary \n     positions, with immigration-related functions, established in \n     division B of the legislation.) The President must describe \n     the general responsibilities when submitting a nominee for \n     confirmation. The authority of the President to assign \n     functions to up to five Assistant Secretaries should provide \n     important flexibility in designing the management structure \n     for the Department.\n       Inspector General--The Department will include an office of \n     Inspector General under the Inspector General Act of 1978, \n     thereby applying the authorities and independence provided \n     under that Act. The legislation would define a narrow set of \n     circumstances under which the Secretary could prohibit the \n     Inspector General from carrying out an investigation or \n     performing other duties if necessary in the interest of \n     national security or other compelling circumstances specified \n     in the legislation. This language is modeled closely on \n     provisions that apply to the Inspectors General at the \n     Departments of Justice, Defense, and Treasury, the United \n     States Postal Service, and the Central Intelligence Agency. \n     Also modeled closely on provisions applicable at Treasury, is \n     a provision\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\n     granting the Homeland Security IG oversight over internal \n     investigations performed by any other investigatory offices \n     where they exist in the Department's sub-agencies. The \n     Inspector General must designate an official to collect and \n     review information about alleged abuses of civil rights and \n     civil liberties by Department officers and employees, and \n     report to Congress on such abuses.\n       Chief Financial Officer--The legislation would establish a \n     Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and a Chief Information Officer \n     (CIO) at the new Department. Section 107 would define the \n     Department as an agency under the CFO Act, thereby making \n     applicable the requirements of the CFO Act of 1994, \n     regarding, for example, the qualifications and \n     responsibilities of the CFO and annual financial reporting. \n     Under the CFO Act, the CFO at the Department must be either \n     appointed by the President subject to Senate confirmation, or \n     designated by the President, in consultation with the \n     Secretary, from among Senate-confirmed officials at the \n     Department.\n       Chief Information Officer--Section 108 of the legislation \n     would establish a Chief Information Officer (CIO) at the new \n     Department. Furthermore, the provisions of law defining the \n     responsibilities of the CIO, including the Paperwork \n     Reduction Act and Clinger-Cohen, would apply by their own \n     terms to the new Department. Under applicable law, the CIO \n     need not be Senate-confirmed.\n       Chief Human Capital Officer--The Secretary must appoint or \n     designate a Chief Human Capital Officer to advise and assist \n     the Department in workforce skills, training, recruitment, \n     retention, and other issues necessary to attract and retain a \n     highly qualified workforce.\n       Civil Rights Office--Section 110 of the bill establishes a \n     Civil Rights Office, whose head will be appointed by the \n     President and confirmed by the Senate. The Office will have \n     two important functions. First, the Civil Rights Office will \n     have responsibility for coordinating the administration of \n     and ensuring compliance with laws prohibiting discrimination \n     against Department employees and beneficiaries of Department \n     programs (see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2000d, 2000e-16).\n       Second, it will advise the Secretary, as well as the \n     Department's directorates and offices, on the constitutional \n     and statutory framework that governs the Department's \n     interactions with the citizenry at large and help develop and \n     implement policies that ensure that consideration of this \n     group's civil rights are appropriately incorporated and \n     implemented in Department programs and activities. It also \n     will oversee the Department's compliance with requirements \n     related to the civil rights of individuals affected by the \n     Department's programs and activities. Authority to \n     investigate specific complaints by the citizenry at large of \n     civil rights or civil liberties violations, however, will \n     reside in the Office of the Inspector General, to which the \n     Civil Rights Office will refer any matter that, in the \n     opinion of the Civil Rights Officer, warrants further \n     investigation.\n       Privacy Officer--A Chief Privacy Officer will oversee the \n     Department's compliance with privacy laws and help ensure \n     that personal information is appropriately safeguarded. \n     Several federal agencies that deal with sensitive personal \n     information, such as the Internal Revenue Service and the \n     U.S. Postal Service, currently have similar privacy advocates \n     to aid in the development of policies and provide assistance \n     to agency officials. The Chief Privacy Officer's mandate \n     extends beyond overseeing compliance with existing privacy \n     laws, such as the Privacy Act, and includes assisting in the \n     development of policies that incorporate privacy safeguards \n     and minimize the risk of inappropriate disclosure or use of \n     personal information. The Privacy Officer may also assist in \n     the development of privacy impact assessments, when required \n     by law or considered appropriate by the Secretary, which are \n     documents that explain how an agency takes into account \n     privacy considerations when initiating information \n     collections and developing information systems.\n       The Constitution clearly assigns to Congress what is called \n     the ``power of the purse''--the power to appropriate funds \n     and to prescribe the conditions governing the use of those \n     funds. The Framers thus made Congress responsible to the \n     people for how the people's money gets spent. The legislation \n     contains provisions reaffirming that appropriated funds may \n     be used only for the purposes stated by Congress. To provide \n     for initial funding of the Department, the legislation \n     requires the Administration to submit a transition plan and \n     proposed budget by September 15, 2002, so that Congress can \n     appropriate timely start-up funds based on that proposal.\n       By contrast, the Administration has requested that the new \n     Department be excepted from the traditional arrangements \n     regarding the use of appropriated funds. For initial funding \n     for the Department, the Administration proposed to take funds \n     (up to 5%) from each agency slated for transfer to the \n     Department and use these funds for any purpose under the \n     legislation. This could total roughly $2 billion. To adjust \n     funding priorities without having to go back to Congress, the \n     Administration requested permanent power to take funds (up to \n     5%) from each appropriations account in the Department and \n     use those funds for any other purpose in the Department.\n       Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens, the Chairman and Ranking \n     Member of the Appropriations Committee, respectively, wrote \n     to me expressing their strong legal objection to the \n     appropriation transfer provisions requested by the \n     Administration:\n       ``The proposal by the President provides the new Secretary \n     with extraordinary powers, powers that could potentially tip \n     the delicate balance of constitutional powers between the \n     Legislative and Executive branches of government. These are \n     powers that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of \n     State do not currently have, nor should they have. The \n     Framers carefully crafted that balance, and it has served the \n     nation well for more than 200 years.''\n       Senators Byrd and Stevens also requested that the \n     legislation include provisions to sustain existing law and \n     practice governing the use of appropriated funds, and \n     language that they agreed to is included in the legislation. \n     These provisions are designed to provide for establishment of \n     the Department, while preserving the customary and \n     Constitutional role of Congress in appropriating funds and in \n     ensuring that such funds are used effectively and efficiently \n     and according to the will of the people, as expressed through \n     their elected Senators and Representatives.\n       Under the legislation, initial funding for the Department \n     will be provided through appropriations Acts, not through \n     transfer of funds appropriated for other purposes. To provide \n     this initial funding in a timely fashion, the legislation \n     requires the President to submit a transition plan by \n     September 15, 2002, including a proposal for financing the \n     initial operations of the Department. The financing proposal \n     might consist of any combination of specific appropriations \n     transfers, specific reprogrammings, or specific new \n     appropriations. By putting the Administration on notice, even \n     before the legislation is enacted, this provision has given \n     the Administration ample time to submit their plan while \n     Congress still has time to act on the Administration's \n     proposal.\n       To further clarify that initial funding will be provided by \n     appropriations acts, the legislation states that transferred \n     funds may only be used for their original purposes unless \n     Congress approves in advance a reallocation of such funds. \n     This provision does not limit the ability of an agency \n     transferred to the Department to use transferred funds for a \n     new position previously authorized in law, but does reinforce \n     that transferred funds may not be used to fund a new position \n     established under this legislation itself.\n       Looking beyond the transition period, the Administration \n     sought to justify its request for power to transfer \n     appropriations by stating, in the analysis accompanying the \n     Administration's proposed legislation: ``Appropriations \n     transfer provisions are enacted annually in a number of \n     appropriations acts.'' While declining now to grant the \n     broad, permanent transfer power requested by the \n     Administration, this Committee-endorsed legislation does not \n     address whether any power to transfer funds should \n     subsequently be included in annual appropriations acts for \n     the Department. In fact, annual appropriations bills often \n     build in such flexibility, but more often in smaller amounts \n     under close oversight by Congress. The proper way for the \n     Administration to seek this authority is to request it as \n     part of their annual appropriations, not as permanent \n     authority in the enabling legislation.\n       The Committee concluded that the Congress and the Executive \n     Branch must fully understand the annual and multi-year \n     funding requirements for the Department to ascertain the most \n     appropriate funding levels to protect the American people \n     from homeland security threats.\n       Accordingly, the GAC-endorsed legislation requires the new \n     Department, beginning with the fiscal year 2005 budget \n     request, to submit annually a Future Years Homeland Security \n     Program to accompany the annual departmental budget request \n     and the National Terrorism Prevention and Response Program \n     Budget mandated elsewhere in the Committee-approved \n     legislation. The language requires that Future Years Homeland \n     Security Program be structured, and include the same type of \n     information and level of detail, as the Future Years Defense \n     Program required by statute to be submitted to the Congress \n     by the Department of Defense.\n       S. 2452, as reported on May 22, set an effective date of \n     180 days after enactment for the transfer of personnel and \n     assets to the new Department, and included ``savings \n     provisions'' to generally preserve the status quo with \n     respect to the ongoing missions of the agencies being \n     transferred. The Administration's subsequent proposed \n     legislation requested greater flexibility with respect to the \n     timing of the transition by giving the President discretion \n     to move agencies at any time over a one-year transition \n     period. It also requested further flexibilities to enable the \n     Administration to make certain incidental transfers and to \n     allocate transferred assets and personnel.\n       The GAC-approved legislation now includes, in subtitle B of \n     title XI, transition provisions based on the corresponding \n     provisions of the Administration's proposed legislation. \n     These provisions include most of the transition-related \n     flexibilities requested by the Administration. The principal \n     exceptions are that, under the GAC-endorsed legislation, the \n     Administration would not have the flexibility to use funds, \n     appropriated by Congress for one purpose, for a different \n     purpose (discussed above), or in the area of withdrawing \n     collective bargaining rights from personnel transferred or \n     employed in the new Department.\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\n       Following the Administration's approach, the Committee-\n     approved legislation adopts from the Administration bill an \n     effective date and a ``transition period''--the effective \n     date is generally 30 days after enactment (unless enacted \n     less than 30 days before January 1, 2003, in which case that \n     is the effective date), and the ``transition period'' is the \n     one year period following the effective date. The President \n     is then authorized to direct the transfer of any asset to the \n     Department at any time the President directs, up to the end \n     of the transition period. This should allow agencies to be \n     transferred to the Department in an orderly progression, \n     leaving the Administration free to determine which are in a \n     position to be transferred first.\n       This legislation, by bringing numerous agencies responsible \n     for homeland security together for the first time under a \n     single chain-of-command responsible for policy and funding, \n     represents one of the most significant reorganizations of the \n     Federal government. However, once these agencies are \n     consolidated into one Department, further reorganization of \n     offices and functions at the departmental level may be needed \n     to integrate incoming offices and to gain additional \n     coordination, efficiency, and effectiveness. The \n     legislation provides for departmental reorganization, by: \n     (1) authorizing the Secretary to reorganize unilaterally \n     to the extent consistent with applicable law; and (2) \n     instructing the Secretary to recommend legislation \n     enabling specific further reorganization involving \n     organizational structures established in law.\n       The Administration has not offered a proposal for \n     departmental reorganization for consideration by Congress, \n     but, instead, requested that the Secretary be granted the \n     power generally to conduct such reorganizations unilaterally. \n     Under the Administration's proposal, the only limits on this \n     reorganization power would be that the Secretary could not \n     abolish the Secret Service or the Coast Guard, and the \n     Secretary would have to give Congress 90 days notice before \n     overriding a statute.\n       Many of the statutes establishing entities and assigning \n     functions reflect important policy judgments of Congress and \n     ongoing critical missions required by law, however, and it \n     would be inappropriate for Congress to cede to the executive \n     the power to override these statutes unilaterally, without \n     opportunity for Congress to evaluate, debate, and decide. \n     This view was also expressed by a Senator Byrd and Senator \n     Stevens, the leaders of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \n     in a letter stating their objection to a provision in the \n     President's proposal:\n       ``Congress should not authorize the Executive Branch to \n     establish, consolidate, alter, or discontinue agencies of \n     government that are established in statute. This is Congress' \n     responsibility.''\n       The legislation establishes reorganization authorities and \n     procedures designed to enable the Secretary to achieve an \n     efficient and effective structure for the Department, while \n     maintaining the appropriate role of Congress in deciding \n     whether statutory law should be changed. Under section 191 of \n     the bill, the Secretary can proceed, without further \n     congressional approval, with any reorganization that does not \n     change organizational structure established by law. The \n     Secretary can perform substantial reorganization and \n     consolidation under this authority. For example, agency units \n     responsible for human resources, information technology or \n     other management functions are typically not established in \n     law, so the Secretary could conduct substantial \n     reorganization and consolidation of such functions to make \n     them more efficient and effective.\n       Furthermore, as the Secretary identifies specific entities \n     established in law that he or she believes should be \n     reorganized, the legislation instructs the Secretary to \n     submit recommendations to Congress on an ongoing basis for \n     legislation providing for such reorganization. Specifically, \n     section 185(d)(1)(B) of the legislation requires the \n     Secretary to recommend any legislation that the Secretary \n     determines necessary to ``reorganize agencies, executive \n     positions, and the assignment of functions within the \n     Department.'' Anticipating that the Secretary may develop \n     reorganization proposals over the one-year transition period, \n     the bill does not require the Secretary to submit these \n     recommendations as a single reorganization plan, but rather \n     requires submission of these recommendations as they become \n     available, the first no later than 6 months after enactment \n     of the Act and any subsequent recommendations at least every \n     6 months thereafter until 6 months after the transition is \n     completed.\n       The legislation specifies that several of the agencies \n     transferred to Department--i.e., the United States Customs \n     Service, the United States Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency, and the United States Secret Service--each \n     ``shall be maintained as a distinct entity within the \n     Department.'' This requirement does not impose precise \n     constraints on the Secretary's authority to reorganize with \n     respect to these agencies, since each of these agencies is \n     established by law and this legislation prohibits the \n     Secretary from reorganizing in contravention of such law. \n     Instead, the ``distinct entity'' requirements serves as an \n     instruction to the President and Secretary that Congress \n     intends that the unique identity of each of these four \n     agencies should be preserved.\n       Under current law, the President and Secretary can reward \n     excellence, remove poorly performing employees, offer \n     recruitment bonuses, and use many other performance-oriented \n     management tools. In an effort to give the Department and \n     other agencies additional flexibility in the management of \n     personnel, our legislation adopts significant, government-\n     wide civil service reforms, contained in provisions proposed \n     by Senators Voinovich and Akaka. To support research and \n     development, we also provided the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security authority to use innovative techniques to hire \n     talent and fund projects. Taken together, this package will \n     give the Secretary the ability to: speed up staffing of new \n     employees; recruit and retain top science and technology \n     talent; procure temporary services outside the civil service \n     system when there is a critical need; reshape the workforce; \n     reform old competitive-hiring practices; provide more \n     effective bonuses for exemplary performance; promote \n     procurement flexibility in research, development, the \n     prototyping of new technologies, and other procurement; and \n     make additional valuable changes to help the new Department \n     attract, maintain, and motivate the best talent. These \n     reforms represent a major modernization of the way federal \n     agencies are managed.\n\n\n              Sen. Voinovich's and Sen. Akaka's Amendment\n\n       Division C of the legislation contains important provisions \n     to strengthen significantly the management of the federal \n     workforce government-wide that were offered at the \n     Committee's business meeting by Senators Voinovich and Akaka, \n     and were agreed to by the Committee by voice vote.\n       The Voinovich-Akaka amendment establishes a chief human \n     capital officer (CHCO) at each major agency (i.e., at the \n     agencies required to have Chief Financial Officers under the \n     CFO Act). The primary responsibility is to advise and assist \n     their respective directors in selecting, developing, \n     training, and managing a high-quality workforce. The creation \n     of a CHCO is intended to help identify and prioritize the \n     recruitment, retention, and workforce management needs across \n     the government. The CHCO will have added importance in the \n     new Department, because consolidation of the different \n     agencies into the Department will pose unique recruitment, \n     retention, training, and workforce management challenges. The \n     CHCO will heighten awareness of workforce issues and provide \n     leadership in resolving these issues.\n       Another section of the Voinovich-Akaka provision, Section \n     2202 in the GAC-endorsed legislation, allows agencies to hire \n     candidates directly and bypass the current civil-service \n     hiring requirements once the Office of Personnel Management \n     has determined that there is a severe shortage of candidates \n     for the position. This provision also allows agencies to \n     streamline its staffing procedures by authorizing more \n     flexible merit assessment tools. This will make the \n     government more competitive with the private sector by \n     improving the federal hiring process.\n       The Voinovich-Akaka provisions include government-wide \n     authority for Voluntary Separation Incentive Payments and \n     Voluntary Early Retirement Authority, two programs \n     currently allowed only in limited situations. The \n     expansion of this authority would give agencies the \n     flexibility required to reorganize the workforce should an \n     agency need to undergo substantial consolidation, transfer \n     of functions, or other substantial workforce reshaping. \n     The provision would allow agencies to reduce high-grade, \n     managerial, or supervisory positions, correct skill \n     imbalances, and reduce operating costs without being \n     forced to reduce overall staff levels.\n       The Voinovich-Akaka proposal increases the cap on the total \n     annual compensation of senior executives, Administrative Law \n     Judges, officers of the court, and other senior level \n     positions to allow career executives to receive performance \n     awards and other authorized payments within the cap in a \n     single year. This will enable agencies to better reward \n     excellence in the ranks of the most senior and experienced \n     parts of the workforce. It also includes measures to help \n     federal employees earn academic degrees, a step that will \n     help enable agencies to build a highly trained workforce and \n     retain valuable employees who wish to continue their \n     education. To fill the serious gap in foreign language skills \n     across the federal government, which is a particular homeland \n     security problem, Section 2402 eases the restrictions on \n     placement of National Security Education Program (NSEP) \n     fellows who are proficient in languages critical to our \n     national security. The provision would allow NSEP fellows to \n     work in a non-national security position in the federal \n     government, including a homeland security position, if a \n     national security position is not available.\n       These authorities complement the flexible authority in \n     Section 135 enabling the Science and Technology Directorate \n     to attract outstanding scientists and technologists.\n       All these detailed and carefully considered personnel \n     provisions provide the Administration with a major management \n     opportunity and flexibility.\n       It is our responsibility to ensure that Federal agencies \n     with a role in homeland security can purchase--quickly and \n     efficiently--the most high-tech and sophisticated products \n     and services to support antiterrorism efforts and to defend \n     against biological, chemical, nuclear, or radiological \n     attacks. Last year's National Defense Authorization Act \n     provided the Department of Defense with many of these \n     authorities. Title V of this bill\n\n[[Page S8168]]\n\n     provides to other Federal agencies--including the new \n     Department--emergency contracting authority which is already \n     in place for the Department of Defense. This measure also \n     provides certain new contracting flexibility to these \n     agencies, including raising the threshold amount for \n     contracts carried out in the United States to $250,000 and \n     raising the threshold amount for contracts outside the United \n     States to $500,000. Title V also raises the micro-purchase \n     (purchase card) threshold to $10,000.\n       Title V would give Federal agencies new procurement \n     flexibility in fighting terrorism. It would streamline \n     procurement procedures for contingency operations or \n     peacekeeping and humanitarian operations; permit agencies to \n     use more ``commercial-style'' contracting procedures for \n     technologies or products which are cutting-edge; and require \n     agencies to do ongoing market research to identify new \n     companies, including small businesses, with new capabilities \n     to help agencies in the fight against terrorism.\n       Title V also requires that the Comptroller General complete \n     a review of the extent to which procurements and services \n     have been made in accordance with this subtitle and submit a \n     report on the results of the review.\n       There is a one year sunset for these provisions.\n       This authority complements the flexible procurement \n     authority in Section 135 concerning R and technology \n     prototyping.\n       The Committee-approved legislation authorizes the Secretary \n     to hire experts and consultants, in accordance with existing \n     law, for periods of up to one year and subject to a pay cap \n     equivalent to the GS-15 level. However, the amendment \n     provides additional hiring flexibility to the Secretary by \n     expanding his authority under current law if necessary to \n     meet urgent homeland security needs. In such cases, the \n     Secretary may obtain personal services, including those of \n     experts or consultants, for periods not to exceed one year \n     without a ceiling on the amount of compensation that may be \n     paid to those individuals. These provisions will allow the \n     Secretary to meet critical needs of the Department by \n     securing the services of individuals with specialized \n     experience and expertise.\n       During the Cold War, Presidents acquired the power to take \n     away--by executive order--the collective bargaining rights of \n     particular agencies or subdivisions when he determines that \n     national security is at stake. Agency managers may also \n     remove from collective bargaining individual employees \n     engaged in certain kinds of work directly affecting national \n     security, subject to review by the independent Federal Labor \n     Relations Authority (FLRA).\n       Most of the tens of thousands of employees that will make \n     up the new Department will be transferred from existing \n     federal agencies, and the Congressional Research Service \n     estimates that about 43,000 (mostly in the Customs Service, \n     the INS, the Coast Guard and FEMA) are now represented by \n     unions. Thus far, no President--including President Bush--has \n     tried to deny collective bargaining rights to these workers. \n     Nevertheless, these existing employees are fearful they will \n     lose their collective bargaining rights simply by virtue of \n     being transferred to a department organized around a mission \n     of homeland security--even if their duties remain \n     substantially the same.\n       The Committee-approved legislation seeks to provide these \n     employees some reassurance. It provides that, for offices and \n     employees transferred into the Department with pre-existing \n     rights to unionize, those rights may not be withdrawn on an \n     office-wide basis by executive order. However, the \n     legislation still provides the Administration ample authority \n     to remove collective bargaining rights if national security \n     is at issue. These rights can be withdrawn from individual \n     employees if their primary job duty materially changes and \n     consists of intelligence, counterintelligence, or \n     investigative duties related to terrorism investigation and \n     their membership in a collective-bargaining unit would \n     adversely affect national security. If so, following existing \n     procedures, Department managers may remove employees from \n     collective bargaining immediately upon determining that such \n     action is warranted, subject to review by the FLRA. Thus, for \n     the employees of offices transferred to the Department with \n     existing rights to form a union, the Committee-endorsed \n     legislation allows the Administration to immediately take \n     employees out of collective bargaining to protect national \n     security, but requires the Administration to state clear \n     reasons for doing so and allows for due process review.\n       Furthermore, with respect to newly created offices at the \n     Department, the legislation retains the President's authority \n     to remove collective bargaining rights from an entire office \n     by executive order, if the primary function of the office is \n     intelligence, counterintelligence, or investigative \n     duties directly related to terrorism investigation, and if \n     collective bargaining rights cannot be applied consistent \n     with national security.\n       It is important to remember that bargaining rights of \n     Federal employees are very limited compared to the private \n     sector. Federal employees have no right to strike. Most have \n     their salary and benefits set in statute. And they may not \n     bargain over, or agree to, anything that would affect \n     managers' statutory prerogatives, which include hiring, \n     firing, assigning personnel and work, as well as taking any \n     necessary action during an emergency.\n       The Committee-approved legislation provides that any \n     construction work financed by assistance under this \n     legislation will be subject to the Davis-Bacon Act, which \n     requires the payment of prevailing wages. The prevailing wage \n     under Davis-Bacon means the local average wage, as determined \n     by the Secretary of Labor.\n       The Davis-Bacon Act itself applies to federal construction \n     contracts, and, in addition, Davis-Bacon requirements have \n     been incorporated into more than 50 program statutes that \n     provide assistance to non-federal parties for construction. \n     For example, federal assistance programs that apply Davis-\n     Bacon requirements include: a variety of transportation \n     construction grant programs (including interstate highways, \n     mass transportation, airport improvement); FEMA emergency \n     preparedness grants; various environmental programs \n     (including drinking and waste water treatment, and Superfund \n     cleanup).\n       Like these other statutes, the Committee-endorsed \n     legislation would require the payment of prevailing wages in \n     any construction supported by assistance under this \n     legislation. For example, under the Emergency Preparedness \n     Enhancement Pilot Program under section 153, the Department \n     may award grants for the deployment of innovative emergency \n     preparedness technologies. If such a grant is used for \n     construction, the contractor would have to pay the prevailing \n     wage. Section 194 would not affect grant programs that are \n     not under this legislation, even if administered by the \n     Department, however. For example, under the Stafford Act, \n     Davis-Bacon applies to FEMA grants for emergency \n     preparedness, but not to FEMA's grants for disaster relief. \n     Thus, disaster relief under the Stafford Act will remain \n     exempt from Davis-Bacon even after FEMA and its disaster-\n     relief functions are transferred to the new Department.\n       At the request of Senator Thompson, the legislation \n     incorporates the text of S. 2530, granting some law \n     enforcement authorities to certain Inspectors General. That \n     bill was reported out of the Governmental Affairs Committee \n     on June 25, 2002. Briefly, the proposal amends the Inspector \n     General Act to authorize certain IG officers to carry a \n     firearm or make an arrest in certain instances while engaged \n     in official duties as authorized by this Act or other \n     statute, or by a request from the Attorney General, and to \n     seek and execute warrants under the authority of the United \n     States upon probable cause that a violation has been \n     committed. A full description of the proposal and its \n     legislative history can be found in the accompanying \n     Committee report, No. 107-176.\n       The GAC-endorsed legislation will ensure that information \n     systems are effectively deployed in the new Department and \n     government-wide. Improved management of information resources \n     is a vital aspect of enhanced homeland security. Federal \n     agencies have deployed information systems in stovepipes, \n     with little thought given to interoperability with the \n     systems of other agencies. Interoperable information systems \n     would allow for efficient sharing of data and better \n     communications between agencies responsible for intelligence \n     gathering, border security, crisis response, and other \n     homeland security missions. Agencies vital to homeland \n     security are also plagued by poor information security and \n     outdated technologies. These management challenges need to be \n     addressed both within the new Department and government-wide.\n       The legislation contains several new provisions that impose \n     general mandates and establish accountability mechanisms with \n     respect to information systems within the Department. The \n     Secretary is required to direct the acquisition and \n     management of the Departments information resources, \n     including the information systems of agencies being \n     transferred into the Department. In ensuring proper \n     Department-wide management, the Secretary will be assisted by \n     the Chief Information Officer. The Secretary is responsible \n     for making the Department's information systems effective, \n     efficient, secure, and interoperable, and will report to \n     Congress on the implementation of an enterprise architecture \n     for the Department. The CIO will work closely with the Under \n     Secretary for Science and Technology on the development, \n     testing, and deployment of new IT technologies.\n       The need for more effective cooperation between agencies \n     such as the FBI, CIA, Department of State, and INS has become \n     obvious, yet poorly developed information systems are getting \n     in the way when technology should be enhancing agencies' \n     effectiveness. The federal government has barely addressed \n     the inability of agencies to link up their information \n     systems. Pursuant to language proposed by Sen. Durbin, the \n     legislation requires the OMB Director to develop a \n     comprehensive enterprise architecture for information systems \n     of agencies related to homeland security, and to make sure \n     agencies implement the plan. The architecture and resulting \n     systems must be designed so that they can achieve \n     interoperability between federal agencies responsible for \n     homeland defense, that they are capable of being deployed \n     quickly and upgraded with improved technologies, and that \n     effective information security is maintained. The OMB \n     Director and the Secretary will also facilitate improved \n     interoperability between information systems of Federal, \n     State and local agencies responsible for homeland defense.\n       Enterprise architectures require systematically thinking \n     through the relationship\n\n[[Page S8169]]\n\n     between operations and underlying information technologies. \n     Used increasingly by industry and some governments, they can \n     reduce redundancies, modernize operations, and improve \n     program performance.\n       The Committee-approved legislation includes a key \n     compromise on the public disclosure of certain sensitive \n     information that may be submitted to the Department--one that \n     thoughtfully balances the public's right to know and the \n     legitimate security concerns of private entities that may \n     share information with the Department. Specifically, the \n     legislation provides that records pertaining to the \n     vulnerability of--and threats to--critical infrastructure \n     that are voluntarily furnished to the Department and that are \n     not customarily made public by the provider, are not subject \n     to public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. \n     Furthermore, the provision would not limit the disclosure of \n     a record used to satisfy a legal obligation or to obtain a \n     permit or other government approval, or received by \n     another Federal, State, or local agency independently of \n     the Department.\n       Senators Bennett and Levin offered this provision at the \n     business meeting. The language of the provision had also been \n     developed in conjunction with the Chairman of the Judiciary \n     Committee, Senator Leahy. Senator Bennett explained to the \n     Committee that the amendment addresses the concerns of three \n     groups--the federal government, which wants to receive \n     information from the private sector in order to better \n     understand and address vulnerabilities and threats to \n     critical infrastructure; the private sector, which has said \n     it would like to help the government, but not if it would be \n     disadvantaged by disclosure of sensitive information; and the \n     public-access and environmental communities, which did not \n     want public access diminished to information that is of \n     importance to the public. Senators Bennett and Levin told the \n     Committee that all three of these interested groups found the \n     amendment acceptable. Senator Bennett further reported that \n     the Administration had examined the provision and supported \n     it as well.\n       To safeguard against the erosion of non-security programs \n     within the transferred entities, the revised legislation \n     establishes a reporting requirement designed to monitor the \n     performance of non-homeland security missions by entities \n     transferred to the Department--pursuant to an amendment by \n     Senators Akaka and Carper. For each of the first five years \n     after a program or agency is transferred to the Department, \n     the relevant Under Secretary must report to the Secretary, \n     the Comptroller General, and Congress regarding the \n     performance of that entity, with particular emphasis on non-\n     homeland security missions. These reports shall seek to \n     inventory non-homeland security capabilities, including the \n     personnel, budgets, and flexibilities used to carry out those \n     functions. The reports shall include information regarding \n     whether any changes are required to enable the transferred \n     entities to continue to carry out non-homeland security \n     missions without diminishment. Under another provision, the \n     Comptroller General is also required to submit reports to \n     Congress that include an evaluation of how successfully the \n     Department is meeting homeland security and other missions.\n\n\n                              Firefighters\n\n       The legislation includes an amendment by Senators Carnahan \n     and Collins to provide federal assistance to local \n     communities to hire additional firefighters, who clearly play \n     a critical first responder role for terrorist threats. The \n     amendment amends the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act \n     of 1974 to authorize the Director of FEMA to award 3-year \n     grants to local communities to hire additional firefighters. \n     It would fund 75% of a firefighter's salary and benefits over \n     three years. Communities applying for grants under the \n     program would be required to present a plan for how they will \n     fund the position at the conclusion of the third year. The \n     three-year cost is capped at $100,000 per fire fighter. The \n     amendment authorizes $1 billion for FY 2003 and FY 2004 for \n     this program. If fully appropriated, the amendment would \n     provide funding for as many as 10,000 new firefighters each \n     year, able to play a vital role in terrorism response.\n       The amendment addresses a critical and urgent need. Federal \n     programs currently exist to fund training and equipment for \n     firefighters and other first responders, and more funding for \n     these needs has been proposed in response to the events of \n     September 11. However, no Federal funds have been made \n     available to fund personnel even though the staffing shortage \n     in the nation's fire departments has reached crisis \n     proportions. Two-thirds of all fire departments do not have \n     adequate staffing, falling below the accepted industry \n     consensus standards developed by the National Fire Protection \n     Association. According to the International Association of \n     Firefighters, most fire departments are not able to comply \n     with OSHA's ``two-in/two-out'' standard for safe fire ground \n     operations. These standards require that if two firefighters \n     enter a dangerous environment, there must be at least two \n     firefighters stationed outside to perform a rescue operation \n     if needed.\n       The International Association of Fire Chiefs estimates that \n     75,000 additional fire fighters are needed to bring fire \n     department staffing up to minimally acceptable levels for \n     safety and effective response. In addition, investigations \n     into firefighter fatalities conducted by the National \n     Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) over the \n     past decade have consistently identified inadequate staffing \n     as either the primary cause or a significant contributing \n     factor to the death of the firefighter. Clearly, without \n     additional assistance, our firefighters' lives are being \n     jeopardized.\n       The Carnahan/Collins amendment reflects broad consensus \n     that in order to protect the public against acts of terrorism \n     and other dangers, the nation's fire departments must have \n     adequate personnel, training, and equipment. One of the major \n     purposes of the Department will be to assess and advocate for \n     the resource needs of State and local governments. The need \n     for more firefighters has already been well documented and \n     thus it is appropriate that this issue be addressed now.\n       The amendment includes an amendment offered by Senators \n     Carper and Torricelli that authorizes funding for Amtrak to \n     finance system-wide safety and security, make life safety \n     improvements to critical rail tunnels, and help ensure Amtrak \n     has adequate fleet capacity in the event of a national \n     security emergency. This funding is authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Department over two years for Amtrak and \n     will remain available until obligated.\n       Pursuant to an amendment by Sen. Durbin, the GAC-endorsed \n     legislation would require the Secretary to enter into an \n     agreement with and provide funding to the National Academy of \n     Sciences to conduct a detailed and comprehensive review of \n     Federal statutes and regulations affecting the safety and \n     security of the food supply and to review the efficiency and \n     effectiveness of the organizational structure of Federal food \n     safety oversight. It requires the Academy to report its \n     findings, conclusions, and recommendations, to Congress not \n     later than 1 year after enactment of this Act and spells out \n     the issues that must be addressed in the report. The \n     Secretary must provide Congress and the President with a \n     response to the recommendations.\n       Pursuant to amendment offered by Senator Akaka, for himself \n     and Senator Levin, the legislation would extend whistleblower \n     protections to airport security screeners. For baggage \n     screeners who are federal employees, the legislation would \n     extend the same whistleblower protections as apply generally \n     to federal employees. They are protected against retaliation \n     for coming forward with information about a violation of law, \n     rule, or regulation; mismanagement; waste; abuse; or a danger \n     to health or safety. For airport screening personnel who are \n     not federal employees, the bill provides the same \n     whistleblower protections as apply to air carrier personnel. \n     They are protected against retaliation for coming forward \n     with information about a violation relating to air carrier \n     safety.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na section-by-section analysis and a letter dated August 28, 2002.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Legislation to Establish a Department of Homeland Security and the \nNational Office for Combating Terrorism as Supported by Bipartisan Vote \n              of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee\n\n       Sec. 1.

Establishes a Directorate of Border and \n     Transportation Protection which shall be headed by an Under \n     Secretary who is appointed by the President with the advice \n     and consent of the Senate. The Directorate shall be \n     responsible for securing borders, territorial waters, ports, \n     waterways, air, land, and sea transportation systems, \n     including coordinating governmental activities at ports of \n     entry. It shall also be responsible for using intelligence to \n     establish inspection priorities for agricultural products and \n     livestock from locations suspected of terrorist activities, \n     harboring terrorists, or of having unusual human health or \n     agriculture disease outbreaks. In addition, it shall provide \n     agency-specific training for agents and analysts from within \n     the Department, other agencies, State and local agencies and \n     international entities that have partnerships with the \n     Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. Authorities, \n     functions, personnel, and assets are transferred from the \n     Customs Service, which shall be maintained as a distinct \n     entity; the Coast Guard, which shall also be maintained as a \n     distinct entity and shall report directly to the Secretary; \n     that portion of the Animal Plant and Health Inspection \n     Service of the Department of Agriculture which administers \n     laws relating to agricultural quarantine inspections at \n     points of entry; the Transportation Security Administration \n     of the Department of Transportation; and the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Training Center of the Department of Treasury (a \n     center which provides training to law enforcement officers of \n     70 Federal partner agencies).\n       Sec. 131 subsection (d)--Exercise of Customs Revenue \n     Functions. Notwithstanding the transfer of authorities, \n     functions, personnel, and assets from the Customs Service, \n     the Secretary of the Treasury shall retain authority to issue \n     regulations governing customs revenue functions, with the \n     concurrence of the Secretary and with the assistance of the \n     Customs Service. The Customs Service is responsible for \n     administering and enforcing the laws regarding customs \n     revenue functions, which include: assessing, collecting and \n     refunding duties, taxes and fees on imported goods; \n     administering import quotas and labeling requirements; \n     collecting import data needed to compile international trade \n     statistics; and administering reciprocal trade agreements and \n     trade preference legislation. These regulations will be \n     administered by the Secretary. Within 60 days, the Secretary \n     of the Treasury will submit recommendations to Congress \n     regarding the appropriate allocation of legal authorities \n     relating to these functions.\n       Sec. 131 subsection (e)--Preserving Coast Guard Mission \n     Performance. Preserves the structural and operational \n     integrity of the Coast Guard, the authority of the \n     Commandant, the non-homeland security missions of the Coast \n     Guard and the Coast Guard's capabilities to carry out these \n     missions even as it is transferred to the new Department. The \n     Coast Guard must be maintained intact and without reduction \n     after transfer to the Department unless Congress legislates \n     otherwise. No missions, functions, personnel or assets may be \n     controlled by, or diverted to the principal and continuing \n     use of any other part of the Department. The Secretary may \n     not make a substantial change to the Coast Guard's non-\n     security missions or capabilities without prior Congressional \n     approval by statute. However, the President may waive this \n     restriction for up to 90 days if he certifies to Congress \n     that there is a clear, compelling and immediate state of \n     national emergency. None of these conditions shall apply when \n     the Coast Guard operates as a service in the Navy under \n     section 3 of title 14, United States Code.\n       The Coast Guard will report directly to the Secretary. The \n     Inspector General of the Department will conduct an annual \n     review to assess the Coast Guard's performance, \n     particularly with respect to non-security missions.\n       Sec. 132. Directorate of Intelligence. Establishes a \n     Directorate of Intelligence, headed by an Under Secretary \n     appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent \n     of the Senate. The Directorate shall serve as a national-\n     level focal point for the analysis of information available \n     to the United States Government relating to the plans, \n     intentions, and capabilities of terrorists and terrorist \n     organizations for the purpose of supporting the mission of \n     the Department. The Directorate shall communicate,\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\n     coordinate, and cooperate with the intelligence community and \n     other agencies as determined by the Secretary. The Director \n     of Central Intelligence's Counterterrorist Center shall have \n     primary responsibility for the analysis of foreign \n     intelligence relating to international terrorism. The \n     Directorate of Intelligence may conduct supplemental analysis \n     of foreign intelligence relating to threats of terrorism \n     against the United States.\n       In general, the Directorate shall be responsible for \n     receiving and analyzing law enforcement information, \n     intelligence and other information to detect and identify \n     specific threats of terrorism; working with the Director of \n     Central Intelligence and the intelligence community to \n     establish overall intelligence priorities; requesting \n     additional information; disseminating information to other \n     entities, including state and local law enforcement, to \n     assist in deterring, preventing and responding to terrorism \n     and other threats; establishing, in conjunction with other \n     appropriate officials, secure communications and information \n     technology infrastructure, and advanced analytical tools; and \n     ensuring that all material received by the Department is \n     protected against unauthorized disclosure and handled \n     consistent with the authority of the Director of Central \n     Intelligence to protect sources and methods, and similar \n     authorities of the Attorney General concerning sensitive law \n     enforcement information. The Directorate is also responsible \n     for providing training and other support to providers of \n     information to the Department or consumers of information \n     from the Department; and making recommendations to the \n     Secretary for improving policies and procedures governing \n     sharing of law enforcement, intelligence, and other \n     information within the Federal government and between the \n     Federal government and state and local governments and law \n     enforcement agencies. The Directorate shall be staffed, in \n     part, by analysts via reimbursable detail from agencies of \n     the intelligence community.\n       Sec. 132 subsection (c)--Access to Information. Provides \n     that, unless otherwise directed by the President, the \n     Secretary shall have access to, and agencies shall provide, \n     all reports, assessments, analytical information, and \n     information, including unevaluated intelligence, relating to \n     the plans, intentions, capabilities, and activities of \n     terrorist organizations and to other areas of responsibility \n     that may be collected, possessed, or prepared by any other \n     United States government agency.

Reports will also include \n     information workforce planning, information technology \n     matters, and other matters necessary for the successful \n     implementation of the transition.\n       Sec. 185 subsection (d)--Legislative Recommendations. Calls \n     upon the Secretary to submit recommendations for legislation \n     that the Secretary determines necessary as part of each semi-\n     annual implementation progress report. If the legislative \n     recommendations are ready sooner, the bill specifically \n     invites the Secretary to submit them in advance of the \n     balance of the report. The Secretary is to provide \n     recommended legislation that would, among other things, \n     facilitate the integration of transferred entities into the \n     Department; reorganize within the Department, or provide the \n     Secretary additional authority to do so; address inequities \n     in pay or other terms and conditions of employment; enable \n     the Secretary to engage in essential procurement; and \n     otherwise help further the mission of the Department.\n       Sec. 186. Transfer and Allocation. Provides that, except \n     where otherwise provided in this title, personnel employed in \n     connection with, and the assets, liabilities, contracts, \n     property records, and any unexpended balance on \n     appropriations, authorizations, allocations and other funds \n     related to the functions and entities transferred, shall be \n     transferred to the Secretary as appropriate, subject to the \n     approval of the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget and subject to applicable laws on the transfer of \n     appropriated funds. Unexpended funds transferred pursuant to \n     this section shall be used only for purposes for which the \n     funds were originally authorized and appropriated.\n       Sec. 187. Savings Provisions. In general, this section \n     provides that all orders, determinations, rules, regulations, \n     permits, agreements, contracts, recognitions of labor \n     organizations, collective bargaining agreements and other \n     administrative actions in effect at the time this Division \n     takes effect shall continue in effect according to their \n     terms until modified or revoked. Certain proceedings, such as \n     notices of proposed rulemaking or applications for licenses, \n     permits, or financial assistance pending at the time this \n     title takes effect shall also continue. Suits and other \n     proceedings commenced before the effective date of this Act \n     are also not affected. Administrative actions by an agency \n     relating to a function transferred under this title may be \n     continued by the Department.\n       Sec. 187 subsection (f)(1). Employee Rights. This \n     subsection is intended to assure employees in agencies \n     transferred to the new\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\n     Department that they can keep their collective bargaining \n     rights unless their job changes and there is an actual \n     national security basis for taking those rights away. For \n     agencies transferred to the Department subject to pre-\n     existing rights to form a union, the President may not \n     terminate those rights agency-wide by executive order. \n     However, such rights may be withdrawn from individual \n     employees at the Department if their primary job duties \n     materially change and consist of intelligence, \n     counterintelligence, or investigative duties directly related \n     to terrorism investigation and if it is demonstrated \n     that collective bargaining would adversely affect national \n     security. Applying this standard under existing \n     procedures, managers at the Department may act immediately \n     to remove individual employees from collective bargaining \n     upon deciding that the conditions for removal are met. \n     Either the union or management may ask the Federal Labor \n     Relations Authority (FLRA) to review this action. For new \n     offices established at the Department under this bill, the \n     President may remove collective bargaining rights from an \n     entire office by executive order, if the primary function \n     is intelligence, counterintelligence, or investigative \n     duties related to terrorism investigation, and if \n     application of those rights would adversely affect \n     national security. Furthermore, employees hired to serve \n     in new offices at the Department, like employees \n     transferred to the Department, may be removed individually \n     from collective bargaining for national security reasons.\n       Sec. 187 subsections (f)(2)--(4). Other personnel matters. \n     The transfer of an employee to the Department will not alter \n     the terms and conditions of employment, including \n     compensation. Any conditions for appointment, including the \n     requirement of Senate confirmation, would continue to apply. \n     Any employee transferred with pre-existing whistleblower \n     protection rights may not be deprived of those rights based \n     on a determination of necessity for good administration.\n       Sec. 187 subsection (g). No effect on intelligence \n     authorities. The transfer of authorities under this title \n     shall not be construed as affecting the authorities of the \n     Director of Central Intelligence, the Secretary of Defense, \n     or the heads of departments and agencies within the \n     intelligence community.\n       Sec. 188. Transition Plan. By September 15, 2002, the \n     President is required to submit to Congress a transition \n     plan, including a detailed plan for transition to the \n     Department and implementation of relevant portions of the \n     Act, and including a proposal for financing the new \n     operations of the Department for which appropriations are not \n     available.\n       Sec. 189. Use of Appropriated Funds. This section sets \n     forth a number of conditions on the use of funds by the \n     Department, the Office, and the National Combating Terrorism \n     Strategy Panel. Balances of appropriations and other funds \n     transferred under the Act may be used only for the purposes \n     for which they were originally available and subject to the \n     conditions provided by the law originally appropriating or \n     otherwise making available the amount. The President shall \n     notify Congress not less than 15 days before transferring \n     funds or assets under this Act. Additional conditions under \n     this section apply to disposal of property, receipt and use \n     of gifts, and other matters. The President shall submit a \n     detailed budget request for the Department for FY 2004.\n       Subtitle F--Administrative Provisions\n       Sec. 191. Reorganizations and Delegations. Provides that \n     the Secretary may, as appropriate, reorganize within the \n     Department, except where specific organizational structure is \n     established by law. The Secretary may delegate any of the \n     functions of the Secretary and authorize successive \n     redelegations to other officers or employees of the \n     Department. However, any function vested by law, or assigned \n     by this title, to an organizational unit of the Department or \n     to the head of an organizational unit may not be delegated \n     outside of that unit.\n       Sec. 192. Reporting Requirements. Requires the Comptroller \n     General of the United States to submit to Congress a report \n     not later than 15 months after the effective date of this \n     division and each year for the succeeding five years \n     containing an evaluation of the progress reports submitted \n     under section 185 and the findings, conclusions and \n     recommendations of the Comptroller General concerning how \n     successfully the Department is meeting the homeland security \n     missions of the Department and the other missions of the \n     Department.\n       This section also outlines additional reports to be \n     submitted by the Secretary. These include: (1) biennial \n     reports relating to (a) border security and emergency \n     preparedness, and (b) certifying preparedness to prevent, \n     protect against, and respond to natural disasters, cyber \n     attacks, and incidents involving weapons of mass destruction; \n     (2) a report outlining proposed steps to consolidate \n     management authority for Federal operations at key points of \n     entry into the United States; (3) a report with definitions \n     of the terms ``combating terrorism'' and ``homeland \n     security,'' and (4) a strategic plan and annual performance \n     plan, along with annual performance reports, required by \n     existing statutes.\n       Sec. 193. Environmental Protection, Safety, and Health \n     Requirements. Provides that the Secretary shall ensure that \n     the Department complies with all applicable environmental, \n     safety and health statutes and requirements, and develops \n     procedures for meeting such requirements.\n       Sec. 194. Labor Standards. All laborers and mechanics \n     employed by contractors or subcontractors in the performance \n     of construction work financed in whole or in part with \n     assistance received under this Act shall be paid wages at \n     rates not less than those prevailing on similar construction \n     in the locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor in \n     accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a et. \n     seq.).\n       Sec. 195. Procurement of Temporary and Intermittent \n     Services. In addition to the authority to hire experts or \n     consultants on a temporary or intermittent basis in \n     accordance with section 3109(b) of title 5, United States \n     Code, the Secretary may procure personal services, whenever \n     necessary due to an urgent homeland security need, for \n     periods of not more than a year without regard to the pay \n     limitations of section 3109.\n       Sec. 196. Preserving Non-Homeland Security Mission \n     Performance. Establishes a reporting requirement designed to \n     monitor the performance of non-homeland security missions by \n     entities transferred to the Department. For each of the first \n     five years after a program or agency is transferred to the \n     Department, the relevant Under Secretary must report to the \n     Secretary, the Comptroller General and Congress regarding the \n     performance of that entity, with particular emphasis on non-\n     homeland security missions. These reports shall seek to \n     inventory non-homeland security capabilities, including the \n     personnel, budgets and flexibilities used to carry out those \n     functions. The reports shall include information regarding \n     whether any changes are required to enable the transferred \n     entities to continue to carry out non-homeland security \n     missions without diminishment.\n       Sec. 197. Future Years Homeland Security Program. Beginning \n     with the FY 2005 budget request, each budget request shall be \n     accompanied by a Future Years Homeland Security Program, \n     reflecting the estimated expenditures and proposed \n     appropriations included in that budget covering the fiscal \n     year with respect to which the budget is submitted and at \n     least the four succeeding fiscal years.\n       Sec. 198. Protection of Voluntarily Furnished Confidential \n     Information. Records pertaining to the vulnerability of, and \n     threats to, critical infrastructure that are voluntarily \n     furnished to the Department and that are not customarily made \n     public by the provider are not subject to public disclosure \n     under the Freedom of Information Act. This provision would \n     not cover records submitted to satisfy legal requirements or \n     to obtain permits or other approvals, and would not cover \n     information that another Federal, State or local agency \n     receives independently of the Department.\n       Sec. 199. Authorization of Appropriations. Authorizes such \n     sums as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to \n     administer and manage the Department and to carry out the \n     Department's functions created by the Act.\n     Title II--National Office for Combating Terrorism\n       Sec. 201. National Office for Combating Terrorism. This \n     section establishes a terrorism office within the Executive \n     Office of the President, to be run by a Director who will be \n     appointed by the President with advice and consent of the \n     Senate. The responsibilities of the Director will include: \n     (1) to develop national objectives and policies for combating \n     terrorism; (2) to direct and review the development of a \n     comprehensive national assessment of terrorist threats and \n     vulnerabilities to those threats, to be conducted by heads of \n     the relevant Federal agencies; (3) to develop, with the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, a National Strategy for \n     combating terrorism under Title III; (4) to coordinate, \n     oversee and evaluate implementation and execution of the \n     Strategy; (5) to coordinate the development of a \n     comprehensive annual budget for programs and activities under \n     the Strategy, including the budgets of the military \n     departments and agencies with the National Foreign \n     Intelligence Program relating to international terrorism, but \n     excluding military programs, projects, or activities relating \n     to force protection; (6) to have lead responsibility for \n     budget recommendations relating to military, intelligence, \n     law enforcement and diplomatic assets in support of the \n     Strategy; (7) to exercise funding authority for Federal \n     terrorism prevention and response agencies; (8) to serve as \n     an adviser to the National Security Council; and (9) work \n     with the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to \n     ensure that the Director receives relevant information \n     related to terrorism from the FBI, and that such information \n     is made available to appropriate Federal agencies and State \n     and local law enforcement officials. The President, in \n     consultation with the Director, shall assign resources as \n     appropriate to the Office.

Funding for Strategy Programs and Activities. \n     This section establishes a process for the Director to review \n     the proposed budgets for federal programs under the Strategy. \n     The Director will, in consultation with the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, identify programs that contribute to the Strategy, \n     and provide advice to the heads of the executive departments \n     and agencies on the amount and use of these programs through \n     budget certification procedures and the development of a \n     consolidated budget for the Strategy. The Director\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\n     will review agencies' budget submissions to OMB and may \n     decertify any proposals that do not incorporate the proposed \n     funding or initiatives previously advised by the National \n     Office on Combating Terrorism. The Director will provide \n     Congress with notice of any such decertification. Each year, \n     the Director will, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security and the head of each Federal terrorism \n     prevention and response agency, develop a consolidated \n     proposed budget for all programs and activities under the \n     Strategy for that fiscal year.\n     Title III--National Strategy for Combating Terrorism and the \n         Homeland Security Response\n       Sec. 301.

The Secretary has responsibility \n     for portions of the Strategy addressing border security, \n     critical infrastructure protection, emergency preparation and \n     response, and integrating state and local efforts with \n     activities of the Federal government. The Director has \n     overall responsibility for the development of the Strategy, \n     and particularly for those portions addressing intelligence, \n     military assets, law enforcement and diplomacy. The Strategy \n     will include: (1) policies and procedures to maximize the \n     collection, translation, analysis, exploitation and \n     dissemination of information related to combating terrorism \n     and homeland security response throughout the Federal \n     government and with State and local authorities; (2) plans \n     for countering chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, \n     explosives, and cyber threats; (3) plans for improving the \n     resources of, coordination among, and effectiveness of health \n     and medical sectors for detecting and responding to terrorist \n     attacks on homeland; (4) specific measures to enhance \n     cooperative efforts between the public and private sectors in \n     protecting against terrorist attacks; (5) a review of \n     measures needed to enhance transportation security with \n     respect to potential terrorist attacks; and (6) other \n     critical areas. This section also establishes the National \n     Combating Terrorism and Homeland Security Response Council to \n     assist with preparation and implementation of the Strategy. \n     Members of the Council will be the heads of federal terrorism \n     prevention and response agencies or their designees.

This section amends the Inspector General Act to \n     authorize certain IG officers to carry a firearm or make an \n     arrest in certain instances while engaged in official duties \n     as authorized by this Act or other statute, or by the \n     Attorney General; and to seek and execute warrants under the \n     authority of the United States upon probable cause that a \n     violation has been committed. This section also describes the \n     conditions under which the Attorney General may authorize \n     exercise of powers under this section, and it lists those \n     offices of Inspector General which are exempt from this \n     requirement. This section further describes the circumstances \n     under which the Attorney General may also rescind or suspend \n     powers authorized for an Office of Inspector General, and \n     provides that determinations by the Attorney General in this \n     section shall not be reviewable in or by any court. The \n     section also requires the Offices of Inspector General to \n     enter into memoranda of understanding to establish an \n     external review process for ensuring that adequate safeguards \n     and management procedures continue to exist within each \n     Office.\n     Title V--Federal Emergency Procurement Flexibility\n       Subtitle A--Temporary Flexibility for Certain Procurements\n       Sec. 501. Defines the term ``executive agency.''\n       Sec. 502. Procurements for Defense Against or Recovery from \n     Terrorism or Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, or Radiological \n     Attack. States that the authorities provided in this subtitle \n     apply to any procurement of property or services by or for an \n     executive agency that, as determined by the head of the \n     executive agency, are to be used to facilitate defense \n     against or recovery from terrorism or nuclear, biological, \n     chemical or radiological attack for one year after the date \n     of enactment.\n       Sec. 503. Increased Simplified Acquisition Threshold for \n     Procurements in Support of Humanitarian or Peacekeeping \n     Operations or Contingency Operations. Raises the threshold \n     amounts to $250,000 for contracts carried out in the United \n     States and to $500,000 for contracts outside the United \n     States pursuant to section 502. Raises the Small Business \n     reserve to $250,000 for contracts inside the United States \n     and $500,000 for contracts outside the United States for \n     procurements carried out pursuant to section 502.\n       Sec. 504. Increased Micro-Purchase Threshold for Certain \n     Procurements.

The head of an \n     executive agency shall use, when appropriate, streamlined \n     acquisition authorities and procedures provided by law \n     including use of procedures other than competitive procedures \n     and task and delivery order contracts. This provision removes \n     the thresholds ($5 million for manufacturing and $3 million \n     for all other contracts) for contracts with limited \n     competition under the small business ``8(A)'' and HUB Zone \n     programs. Waiving the threshold means that small \n     disadvantaged businesses within the ``8(A)'' program and \n     qualified HUB Zone small business concerns can compete for \n     contracts using limited competition (or sole source \n     competition) regardless of the value of the contract.\n       Sec. 507. Review and Report by Comptroller General. \n     Requires that not later than March 31, 2004, the Comptroller \n     General complete a review of the extent to which procurements \n     of property and services have been made in accordance with \n     this subtitle, and submit a report on the results of the \n     review to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and House \n     Government Reform Committee. The report shall assess the \n     extent to which property and services procured in accordance \n     with this subtitle have contributed to the capacity of \n     Federal employees to carry out the missions of the agencies, \n     and the extent to which Federal employees have been trained \n     on the use of technology. The report shall include any \n     recommendations of the Comptroller General resulting from the \n     assessment. The Comptroller General shall consult with the \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs and the Committee on \n     Governmental Reform on the specific issues and topics to be \n     reviewed, including areas such as technology integration, \n     employee training, and human capital management, and the data \n     requirements of the study.\n       Subtitle B--Other Matters\n       Sec. 511. Identification of New Entrants Into the Federal \n     Marketplace. Requires agencies to do ongoing market research \n     to identify new companies with new capabilities, including \n     small businesses, to help agencies facilitate defense against \n     or recovery from terrorism or nuclear, biological, chemical \n     or radiological attack.\n     Title VI--Effective Date\n       Sec. 601. Provides that the Division shall take effect 30 \n     days after the date of enactment, or if enacted within 30 \n     days before January 1, 2003, on January 1, 2003.\n\n\n     Division B--Immigration Reform, Accountability, and Security \n                        Enhancement Act of 2002\n\n       Sec. 1001.

The General \n     Counsel's responsibilities include: providing specialized \n     legal advice, opinions, determinations, regulations, and any \n     other assistance to the Director with regard to legal matters \n     affecting the Directorate and its components. A Chief \n     Financial Officer (``CFO'') will direct, supervise, and \n     coordinate all budget formulas and execution for the \n     Directorate. A Chief of Policy and Strategy is created to \n     establish national immigration policy and priorities, perform \n     policy research and analysis on immigration issues under U.S. \n     immigration laws, and coordinate immigration policy between \n     the Directorate, the Service Bureau, and the Enforcement \n     Bureau.

Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Thompson: We \n     commend your leadership and dedication to the creation of a\n\n[[Page S8179]]\n\n     new Department of Homeland Security. We thank you for the \n     opportunity to contribute to this historic legislation.\n       As division B of your legislation currently includes \n     immigration provisions drawn in large part from legislation \n     that we introduced earlier this year--S. 2444, the \n     Immigration Reform, Accountability, and Security Enhancement \n     Act of 2002, we here provide you with an explanation of the \n     intent behind this language.\n       Purpose and Summary. For years, the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service (INS) has been plagued by myriad \n     problems, including mission-overload, mismanagement, and \n     insufficient resources. For too long, INS has been unable to \n     meet its dual responsibility of enforcing our immigration and \n     nationality laws and providing services to newcomers, \n     refugees, and aspiring citizens.\n       A critical component of homeland security is an agency that \n     effectively polices our borders, enforces our laws, and \n     provides timely immigration services. To responsibly create \n     an Office of Homeland Security, we must address the \n     inadequacies of the INS.\n       Accordingly, Division B abolishes the INS and replaces it \n     with a Directorate of Immigration Affairs (Directorate) \n     placed squarely within the Department of Homeland Security.\n       Legislative History. The Judiciary Committee has earnestly \n     debated how best to reform the INS. Since 1998, the Judiciary \n     Committee has held five hearings on this topic, and Senate \n     bills to reform INS have been introduced in each of the last \n     three Congresses. In each hearing, governmental and private \n     sector experts critiqued the workings of INS and offered \n     substantive, insightful recommendations on how to revamp that \n     agency. From those hearings, certain principles have emerged: \n     the need for a separation of functions, the need for greater \n     coordination between functions, and the need for a strong, \n     central authority to ensure consistent policy and \n     implementation.\n       In the 106th Congress, Senator Abraham and Senator Kennedy, \n     chair and ranking member of the Immigration Subcommittee, \n     introduced S. 1563, the ``INS Reform and Border Security Act \n     of 1999,'' a bipartisan attempt to split enforcement and \n     services into separate bureaus and to elevate the profile of \n     the immigration agency within the Department of Justice. This \n     legislation served as the basis for legislation in the 107th \n     Congress: S. 2444, the ``Immigration Reform, Accountability, \n     and Security Enhancement Act of 2002,'' another bipartisan \n     bill, introduced by Senator Kennedy and Senator Brownback, \n     chair and ranking member of the current immigration \n     subcommittee. S. 2444, like its predecessor, splits \n     enforcement and services into separate bureaus and seeks to \n     elevate the profile of immigration in the Department of \n     Justice. Cosponsors of S. 2444 include Senators Hatch, \n     Feinstein, DeWine, Durbin, Helms, Edwards, Hagel, Daschle, \n     Dodd, Graham, and Clinton.\n       Need for INS Reform. Experts both inside and outside \n     government have reached the same conclusions regarding the \n     most critical problems with the INS. In a report from the \n     early 1990s, the General Accounting Office observed that the \n     INS' problems stem from a lack of clearly defined goals and \n     priorities, inconsistent leadership and weak management \n     systems, and overlapping and inconsistent programs. In the \n     years since, these observations have been echoed in witness \n     testimony, academic publications, and reports issued by \n     various commissions. The criticisms of INS have remained \n     consistent over the past decade.\n       With the criticisms have come various recommendations on \n     how to rehabilitate the agency. Three guiding principles can \n     be distilled from those recommendations:\n       Separation of functions. Immigration law and policy can \n     roughly be divided into two components--enforcement and \n     services. Currently, the enforcement and service functions \n     are commingled in a way that creates conflicting priorities \n     and troubling inefficiencies. There must be a clearer \n     separation of the enforcement and services functions to \n     achieve great clarity of mission and thereby greater \n     efficiency in the respective functions.\n       Coordination. At the same time, the two functions cannot \n     exist independent of each other. Almost every immigration-\n     related action involves both an adjudicatory and enforcement \n     component. Law enforcers must be cognizant of immigration \n     benefits and relief; adjudicators must be mindful of \n     immigration fraud and transgressions. Accordingly, effective \n     coordination between the two functions must exist for either \n     function to work well.\n       Strong, Central Authority. Given the dynamic of having \n     separate but coordinated functions, it is essential to \n     establish a strong, central authority to ensure uniform \n     immigration policy, efficient interaction between components, \n     and fiscal responsibility. There must be a focal point for \n     managerial accountability for all immigration-related \n     actions, as well as a central decision-maker to guarantee \n     that all aspects of immigration policy and implementation get \n     appropriate attention.\n       Division B satisfies all three of these principles. First, \n     it abolishes INS and creates a Directorate of Immigration \n     Affairs (Directorate) within the new Department of Homeland \n     Security. The Directorate consists of three offices: the \n     Office of the Under Secretary of Immigration Affairs, the \n     Bureau of Enforcement and Border Affairs, and the Bureau \n     of Services.\n       Under Secretary of Immigration Affairs. The Directorate is \n     headed by an Under Secretary of Immigration Affairs (Under \n     Secretary). Under the authority of the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, the Under Secretary is responsible for \n     administering the Directorate, including the direction, \n     supervision, and coordination of both bureaus.\n       The Under Secretary develops and implements U.S. \n     immigration policy and ensures that immigration policy is \n     coordinated and applied consistently through: (1) \n     administration and enforcement of U.S. immigration laws; (2) \n     administration of the Directorate; (3) inspection of \n     individuals arriving at ports of entry; (4) management of \n     resources, personnel, and other support; and (5) management \n     of information resources, including maintenance and \n     coordination of records, databases and other information \n     within the Directorate.\n       Reporting to the Under Secretary is a General Counsel who \n     serves as chief legal officer for the Directorate. A Chief \n     Financial Officer is responsible for directing, supervising, \n     and coordinating the Directorate's budget. Also in the Office \n     of the Under Secretary is a Chief of Policy and Strategy, and \n     a Chief of Congressional, Intergovernmental, and Public \n     Affairs.\n       Bureau of Immigration Services. The Bureau of Immigration \n     Services, headed by its Assistant Secretary, administers the \n     service functions of the Directorate, including: (1) visa \n     petitions; (2) applications for adjustment of status and \n     change of status; (3) naturalization applications; (4) asylum \n     and refugee applications; (5) determinations regarding the \n     custody and parole of asylum seekers; and (6) Service Center \n     adjudications.\n       Bureau of Enforcement and Border Affairs. The Bureau of \n     Enforcement and Border Affairs, headed by its Assistant \n     Secretary, administers the immigration enforcement functions \n     of the Directorate, including: (1) border patrol; (2) \n     detention; (3) removal; (4) intelligence; and (5) \n     investigations.\n       Offices Within Each Bureau. Each bureau has its own Chief \n     Budget Officer (under the direction of the Directorate's \n     Chief Financial Officer). Each bureau also has an Office of \n     Quality Assurance (which develops procedures and conducts \n     audits to ensure that the Director's policies are properly \n     implemented) and an Office of Professional Responsibility \n     (which ensures professional conduct by bureau personnel).\n       Office of the Ombudsman. Reporting to the Under Secretary, \n     is the Office of the Ombudsman, which assists the public in \n     resolving individual cases, identifying systemic problems \n     encountered by the public, and proposing solutions to those \n     problems. The Office of the Ombudsman will report to Congress \n     annually.\n       Office of Immigration Statistics. The Directorate also \n     contains an Office of Immigration Statistics, which is \n     responsible for collecting and analyzing statistical \n     information for both the Directorate and the immigration \n     court system.\n       Raised Profile of Immigration. After September 11th, it is \n     clear that strengthening our immigration system is an \n     indispensable part of the nation's efforts to prevent future \n     terrorist attacks. Remedying INS' administrative woes is \n     critical, but will do little to improve our security if the \n     agency that administers our immigration laws and policies is \n     not given the priority and attention it deserves.\n       Immigration law and policy is extremely complex and \n     dynamic. Immigration officers are charged with a wide variety \n     of duties. INS guards the borders, admitting more than 500 \n     million citizens, permanent residents, and lawful visitors, \n     students, and temporary workers each year. INS also \n     adjudicates hundreds of thousands of applications for \n     citizenship, permanent residence, changes of status, and work \n     authorization annually. Further, INS is responsible for \n     apprehending unlawful entrants, investigating fraud, \n     enforcing employment sanctions, and removing criminal aliens. \n     At the same time, INS entertains family-based and employment-\n     based visa petitions, while also hearing asylum in the United \n     States and refugee claims around the world.\n       Given the array of responsibilities and the sheer volume of \n     people involved, immigration functions merit special \n     attention. The immigration functions must not be diluted in \n     with a host of other border functions. They deserve a \n     separate directorate wherein the various missions of INS, \n     which standing alone are diverse enough, can be properly \n     attended. Elevation of the INS within its own directorate \n     also achieves the necessary balance between enhancing our \n     security, securing our borders, and ensuring the effective, \n     efficient, and fair implementation of our immigration laws.\n       Need to Keep Enforcement and Services Together. Almost \n     every immigration-related action involves both enforcement \n     and service components. Coordination of these key functions \n     is critical to ensure consistent interpretation and \n     implementation of the law, clarity of mission, and in turn, \n     more efficient adjudications and more effective enforcement. \n     Coordination of immigration functions cannot be achieved \n     merely by creating a shared database or some commonality of \n     management far up the administrative ladder. Moreover, \n     coordination is certainly impossible when enforcement and \n     services are housed in different departments. Inconsistent \n     policies and interpretations of the law, the lack of a common \n     culture, and--most importantly--the absence of a single, \n     integrated authority who can resolve differences result in a \n     disjointed immigration\n\n[[Page S8180]]\n\n     policy and undermines the efficacy of both enforcement and \n     services.\n       September 11th brought to light serious problems with \n     immigration enforcement, but there are equally serious \n     problems with immigration services. If services are divorced \n     from enforcement, particularly in a department dedicated to \n     security, services will continue to struggle and will \n     inevitably, and understandably, be devalued and assigned \n     lesser priority. To ensure that services are not `left \n     behind' in a security culture, it is essential that they be \n     recognized as the other half of the immigration equation.\n       Coordination with Other Border Functions. Coordinating the \n     border security functions within the Department of Homeland \n     Security is critical, whatever the agency's configuration. \n     That coordination is achieved by creating a Border \n     Coordination Working Group, composed of the Secretary, the \n     Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security, and \n     the Under Secretary for Immigration Affairs. The Working \n     Group is responsible for coordinating functions necessary to \n     secure the borders, territorial waters, ports, terminal, \n     waterways, and air, land, and sea transportation systems of \n     the United States.\n       The responsibilities of this office include:\n       Coordinating budget requests and allocation of \n     appropriations, staffing requirements, communication, use of \n     equipment, transportation, facilities and other \n     infrastructure;\n       Developing and implementing policies and technologies to \n     ensure the speedy, orderly, and efficient flow of lawful \n     traffic, travel, and commerce and enhanced scrutiny for high \n     risk travelers and cargo;\n       Monitoring, evaluating, and making improvements in the \n     coverage and geographic distribution of border security \n     programs and personnel;\n       Coordinating joint and cross-training programs for \n     personnel performing border security functions; and\n       Identifying systemic problems in coordination encountered \n     by border security agencies and programs and proposing \n     administrative, regulatory, or statutory changes to mitigate \n     such problems.\n       The Working Group also consults with representatives of \n     other agencies or departments to enhance coordination and \n     cooperation, curtail overlapping and duplicative functions, \n     and reduce interagency rivalries. At the same time, experts \n     in each of these agencies retain their authority and ability \n     to perform their jobs at this critical time.\n       Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors. Unaccompanied minors \n     deserve special treatment under our immigration laws and \n     policies. Many of these children have been abandoned, are \n     fleeing persecution, or are escaping abusive situations at \n     home. These children are either sent here by adults or forced \n     by their circumstances, and the decision to come to our \n     country is seldom their own.\n       Currently, INS has responsibility for the care and custody \n     of these children. It would not be appropriate to transfer \n     this responsibility to a Department of Homeland Security.\n       Office of Refugee Resettlement. This legislation transfers \n     responsibility for the care and custody of unaccompanied \n     alien children who are in Federal custody (by reason of their \n     immigration status) from INS to the Office of Refugee \n     Resettlement (ORR) in the Department of Health and Human \n     Services (HHS). ORR has decades of experience working with \n     foreign-born children, and ORR administers a specialized \n     resettlement program for unaccompanied refugee children.\n       HHS coordinates comprehensive services to address the \n     special needs of newcomer children, including placement in \n     foster or group home settings, medical and mental health \n     care, skills training, education, family tracing, and legal \n     assistance. Such services are tailored to address the \n     cultural, linguistic, legal, and developmental needs of \n     newcomer children and the individual needs of the child. ORR \n     can easily integrate the care of unaccompanied alien children \n     into its existing functions.\n       Responsibilities. Minimum standards for the care and \n     custody are set forth in the legislation, as are ensuring \n     that unaccompanied children are housed in appropriate \n     shelters or with foster families who are able to care for \n     them.\n       Specifically, ORR will be responsible for: (1) ensuring \n     that the best interests of the child are considered in the \n     care and placement of unaccompanied alien children; (2) \n     making placement, release, and detention determinations; (3) \n     implementing determinations; (4) convening the Interagency \n     Task Force on Unaccompanied Alien Children; (5) identifying \n     qualified persons, entities, and facilities to house \n     unaccompanied alien children; (6) overseeing persons, \n     entities and facilities; (7) compiling and publishing a \n     State-by-State list of professionals or other entities \n     qualified to contract with the Office to provide services; \n     (8) maintaining statistical information and other data on \n     unaccompanied alien children in the Office's custody and \n     care; (9) collecting and compiling statistical information \n     from the INS (or successor entity); and (10) conducting \n     investigations and inspections of facilities and other \n     entities where unaccompanied alien children reside. The \n     legislation also provides children with access to appointed \n     counsel and guardians ad litem.\n       Responsibility for adjudicating immigration benefits will \n     not transfer over to HHS but will remain with the INS (or its \n     successor) and the immigration court system.\n       Immigration Court System. The current immigration court \n     system--the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), \n     which contains the immigration courts and the Board of \n     Immigration Appeals--is a component of the Department of \n     Justice. The immigration court system exists not in statute, \n     but only in regulation.\n       The evolution of the immigration courts reflects the \n     importance of impartiality. Originally, the court system was \n     entirely contained within the INS. In response to criticisms \n     that judge and ``prosecutor'' should not be housed together, \n     the immigration courts were moved to a separate component \n     within the Justice Department--the EOIR--in 1983. Even parsed \n     out into separate components, however, concerns remain that \n     the immigration courts are still too closely aligned with the \n     immigration enforcers.\n       Concerns about the impartiality of a court system located \n     in a law enforcement agency are certain to be exacerbated if \n     the court system is relocated to a security agency. If INS \n     moves, then it is best to leave the immigration court system \n     where it is--in the Justice Department--and thereby keep \n     judge and enforcer well separated.\n       The immigration court system is critical both to law \n     enforcement and to humanitarian protections. The immigration \n     courts daily make decisions that could remove a criminal \n     alien from our country, provide safe haven to an asylum-\n     seeker fleeing torture or execution, and keep together or \n     break up families. The immigration courts make potentially \n     life-or-death decisions every day and are therefore too \n     important to exist only in regulation.\n       We look forward to working with you on this legislation and \n     making additional recommendations as it is considered by the \n     full Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n       Chair, Subcommittee on Immigration, Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n     Sam Brownback,\n       Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Immigration, Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8180-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8180-S8183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nstand in recess from 2:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. today for a briefing by \nSecretary Rumsfeld.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut \nfor the statement he has made today and for his leadership, once again, \non this issue, and for his contribution toward our being here today. He \nspeaks eloquently as to our need to do things differently with regard \nto this Government and with regard to the reorganization of a very \nimportant part of our Government. His analogy of gasoline and engines I \nthink is right on point. It doesn't matter how much gasoline you put \ninto a faulty engine, it is still a faulty engine.\n  We need to do better than that. There is no reason that at end of the \nday we can't pass a bill that is going to make this country safer than \nit was before, and that is our common goal.\n  Few need to be reminded why we are here. While September 11 was not \nthe opening salvo, it was the event that forced us to confront the \nscope of the threats to our country and to recognize the need to do \nsomething significant and meaningful to address those threats.\n  Prior to the 1980s, most terrorist groups were regionally focused and \nlacked the means and the connections to operate on a global scale. They \nrelied upon state sponsors for financial support and often fought for \nideological reasons. The few exceptions were those who fought to \ndestroy the Israeli state. During the 1980s, this trend began to \nchange. With the increase in militant Islamic attacks against Israel, \nthe rise of revolutionary Iran, and the formation of Mujahedin in \nAfghanistan, terrorism began to take a more extremist tone. Then, in \n1983, a small group in Lebanon, now known as Hizballah, began using a \ndevastating new tactic to target Western troops: suicide bombings. The \nUnited States was the first to experience the destructiveness of this \nform of attack. In April 1983, a suicide bomber drove a 2,000 pound \ntruck bomb into the U.S. embassy in Beirut, killing 63. The full impact \nof suicide bombings, however, was not felt until 6 months later. On \nOctober 23, 1983, a lone suicide bomber drove a truck laden with \nexplosives into the U.S. Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, killing 241 \nAmerican servicemen and injuring dozens more.\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\n  Since 1983, we have experienced other terrorist attacks as well. In \n1989, terrorists downed Pam Am 103, killing over two hundred; in 1993, \nextremists tried to destroy the World Trade Center by detonating a van \nladen with tens of pounds of high explosives; in 1995, Timothy McVeigh \nexploded a rental van outside the Oklahoma Federal Building, killing \n168 people; in 1996, religious extremists blew up the Khobar Towers in \nSaudi Arabia, killing 19 American servicemen and injuring another 372; \nin 1998, extremists blew up truck bombs outside the U.S. embassies in \nTanzania and Kenya, murdering 252 people, including 12 Americans, and \ninjuring at least 5,000 more; and in 2000, extremists blew themselves \nup alongside the U.S.S. Cole, nearly sinking the ship. 17 American \nsailors were killed and another 39 were wounded.\n  The list does not include a number of planned terrorist attacks that \nwere disrupted or prevented by U.S. or foreign intelligence, military, \nand law enforcement operations. It is easy to imagine, however, that \nthis list could have been much longer.\n  Over the last 10 years, Congress literally held dozens of hearings on \nwhat we should do to combat terrorism. We have also had report after \nreport highlighting the dangers of terrorism. The General Accounting \nOffice alone has issued over 50 reports on various ways to better \nprotect our country against terrorist attack. Several independent \ncommissions have also recommended measures that would have addressed \nmany of our vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, we did not implement \nmeasures because they were either costly or unpopular. We lacked both \nconsensus and a sense of urgency.\n\n  If anything positive can be gleaned from the tragic attacks of \nSeptember 11, perhaps it is the appearance of a national consensus for \nchange. Most Americans today believe that the deficiencies in our \nhomeland security must be corrected and are willing to bear the costs \nof doing so.\n  President Bush has personally embraced this task and employed every \ntool at his disposal. Some of the actions that he has taken to date \ninclude: Destroying terrorist camps in Afghanistan and helping to \nrestore a civil government in that beleaguered land; tracking and \neliminating funding sources for terrorist organizations; deploying \ngreater intelligence resources around the world to hunt down \nterrorists; fostering an international consensus and forming a \ndiplomatic coalition against terrorism and its supporters; creating the \nNorthern Command in the Department of Defense to manage and coordinate \nthe defense of the territory of the United States; and, doubling the \n``Homeland Security'' budget to $38 billion; and developing a National \nHomeland Security Strategy.\n  A critical element of the Administration's response to terrorism is \nthe President's proposal to create a Department of Homeland Security. \nthis proposal is not a new idea. Seven months before September 11, the \nHart-Rudman Commission released its third comprehensive report on U.S. \nnational security. To the surprise of many, the commission proposed the \ncreation of a new federal department to better counter the threat posed \nby terrorism. Unfortunately, most considered such an idea at that time \nto be impractical. Even after September 11, many of us were less than \nenthusiastic about the creation of such a department. To their credit, \nSenators Hart and Rudman continued to push for a department. Our \ncolleagues, Senator Lieberman and Senator Specter, eventually took up \ntheir cause and offered legislation that would create a Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  Over the last eleven months, the President's Office of Homeland \nSecurity has carefully examined every facet of our homeland security \nweaknesses, our needs, our effort, our allocation of resources. It \nconsidered numerous proposals for a homeland security organization from \noutside studies, commission, and members of Congress, including the \nHart-Rudman proposal. The President eventually came to the conclusion \nthat reorganization on a large scale was necessary. The President's \nproposal would not have been possible had the Administration not taken \nthe time to conduct its comprehensive review.\n  The President's June 6 proposal was unusual in several respects. \nReorganization of the executive branch on this scale has not occurred \nor been attempted for 55 years. The proposal would move 22 federal \nagencies and programs with some 170,000 employees into a single \ndepartment with a total budget for fiscal year 2003 of nearly $38 \nbillion.\n  Upon receiving the President's proposal, the governmental Affairs \nCommittee held a number of hearings and subsequently marked up a \nsubstitute amendment to S. 2452, the bill we are moving to consider. \nWhile there is broad overlap between the President's proposal and the \ncommittee's substitute amendment, there are significant differences as \nwell. The debate will mostly focus on the differences. Before I \nhighlight some of these areas, let me also take some time to summarize \nthe Committee's substitute and explain the importance of some of its \nprovisions.\n  As it currently stands, our country's homeland security effort is \ndisorganized and disjointed. Many Federal agencies responsible for \nhomeland security have many other responsibilities as well. The guiding \nprinciple of the proposals to reorganize Federal agencies into a new \ndepartment of Homeland Security is the recognition that the Nation \nneeds a reinvigorated and refocused effort on the part of these \nagencies. A new department will force agencies whose missions only \npartly involve homeland security to refocus their efforts to make \nhomeland security their primary effort.\n  Both the President's proposal and the committee's substitute \namendment to the Lieberman-Specter bill would enhance border security \nby bringing in under one roof all the agencies responsible for border \ncontrol. The Border Patrol, the Customs Service, the new Transportation \nSecurity Administration, the appropriate components of the Animal and \nPlant Health Inspection Service, and the coast guard will all become \na part of the new department, with an eye towards developing a fully \nintegrated approach to border security operations.\n\n  On border security, I do want to point out my concern that the \ncommittee substitute keeps the components of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service intact in a new Immigration Affairs Directorate \nof the new department. I think the Border Patrol must not only become \npart of the new department, but must be made a part of the Border and \nTransportation Security Directorate if the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity is to be as effective as we need it to be. I hope we are able \nto take a look at this structural issue as the debate proceeds.\n  The President proposed that the new department contain a component to \nassess the Nation's vulnerabilities to terrorism, analyze information \nregarding threats to our homeland, and match the threat assessments to \nthe nation's vulnerabilities to help prioritize our homeland security \nefforts. The President's proposal was designed to fill a gap in the \nFederal Government's intelligence capabilities. While a number of \nagencies conduct a variety of threat assessments, and a few agencies \nconduct narrowly focused vulnerability assessments, no one in the \nfederal government married the threats with the vulnerabilities to \ndevelop national policy. The committee substitute differs from the \nPresident's proposal by splitting the intelligence analysis component \nof the new department from the infrastructure protection component and \ncreating two distinct organizations within the new department.\n  I support the establishment of an intelligence capability in the new \ndepartment, but I believe the President's proposal is more sound than \nthe Committee's approach. I will discuss this later.\n  Clearly, one of the greatest strengths we have to employ against \npotential enemies of our nation is technology. The President proposed a \ncomponent of the new department to focus on weapons of mass \ndestruction, which the President believes are not receiving adequate \nattention from existing agencies. Building on the President's proposal, \nChairman Lieberman, Senator Domenici, Chairman Bingaman, and I worked \nto develop a Science and Technology Directorate to develop and focus a \nconcerted national effort, relying on resources the Federal Government \nhas already deployed, primarily the National Laboratories and their \npartnerships, that will develop new technologies to combat terrorist \nthreats.\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\n  Thus far, the department that both the President and the Committee \npropose focuses its efforts on prevention, on before-the-fact counter-\nterrorism activities. The proposals go further, however, by bringing in \nas part of the new department the responsibilities for consequence \nmanagement, for the after-the-fact efforts. The main component of this \naspect of the proposals is the inclusion of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency in the new Department of Homeland Security.\n  By bringing together the management of the prevention \nresponsibilities and the consequence management responsibilities, we \nhope to eliminate bureaucratic impediments and unify diverse \nbureaucracies, improve coordination, find and exploit appropriate \nsynergies, and strengthen the Federal Government's entire homeland \nsecurity effort.\n  We must be realistic about this reorganization. It is mammoth. It \nwill take years of exacting effort to get it done. Congress may be \ncalled upon again to legislate changes to the new department. Let us \nnot forget that many believe that the Defense Department was not fully \nrealized until 1986, almost 40 years after it creation, when Congress \nenacted the Goldwater-Nickles Act.\n  When the President first proposed this massive homeland security \nreorganization, I did some research into the mergers of private \ncompanies. My staff and I have consulted with management and merger \nexperts in the private sector and in academia. I regret that their \nanalysis of the prospect for success was largely pessimistic. Many \nprivate sector mergers fail. The problems are obvious: blending \ncorporate cultures and product lines is not a simple task. chief \nexecutive officers who have been through mergers that were smaller and \nmuch less complicated than this one give us only about a 20 or 30 \npercent chance of success. These odds are not promising. It makes me \nwonder what we need to do to improve those odds. The transition period \nwill be particularly difficult. In some ways, it will be like an \nelephant on roller skates attempting to learn to juggle.\n\n  The proposed reorganization will be greatly complicated by the fact \nthat several of the agencies being transferred currently are themselves \ndysfunctional from a management standpoint. A lack of coordination, \nimproper payments, waste, missing equipment, human capital \nshortcomings, and program inefficiencies are all serious problems \nconfronting the Federal Government at large. These problems will piggy-\nback their way into the new department with the incoming component \nagencies and will limit its effectiveness unless we address them here.\n  The management challenges facing this Department are in many respects \na reflection of the Federal Government as a whole. For years, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has had parades of witnesses and reports \ntelling us that the executive branch and Congress must together do a \nbetter job of managing the taxpayers' money. Simply put, we are a \ngovernment that cannot pass an audit.\n  Last year, the Government Affairs Committee released a report titled \n``Government at the Brink,'' that highlighted some of the waste, fraud, \nand mismanagement that pervades our Federal Government. Unfortunately, \nthis new department is inheriting a number of agencies that were the \nfocus of that report. The Immigration and Naturalization Service lacks \nsufficient staff resources to perform intelligence functions; the \nCustoms Service cannot rely on its data systems to determine where the \nworkload is heaviest and therefore where to assign its employees; the \nFederal Emergency management Agency, FEMA, faces significant problems \nin managing its grants, and the list goes on and on.\n  These are not partisan problems. They developed and have existed in \nboth Republican and Democratic administrations. They have flourished \nwhen Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress, when Republicans \ncontrolled both Houses of Congress, when Republicans controlled both \nHouses of Congress, and when there was split control of Congress.\n  While we cannot cure these government-wide problems in this bill, we \nmust recognize them, learn from our experience with them, and try to \navoid these problems in the future as we create this new Department.\n  The current management paradigms for the Government that try to \naddress these problems are largely the creation of the post-World War \nII expansion of the executive branch. They are largely premised on a \ncommand-and-control approach to management. These paradigms are out of \ndate for the modern, largely white-collar, technological workforce \nneeded by the Federal Government to meet the challenges of the 21st \ncentury. The current management structure throughout the executive \nbranch puts no premium on accountability. Managers find it difficult to \nreward good performers, and even more difficult to sanction poor \nperformers. Efforts by employees and managers to find new ways to \nmeeting agency missions are rebuffed, often by political appointees who \nhave only short-term goals in mind. These appointees rarely see the \nvalue of major management reforms whose benefits may not accrue to the \nagency and its leaders for years to come and long after they are gone.\n  For a number of years, both the legislative and executive branches \nhave been promoting performance-based management. The \nprimary legislative reform to promote a new emphasis on results is the \nGovernment Performance and Results Act--we call it the Results Act--\nwhich was enacted by a Democratic Congress during a Democratic \nadministration. President Bush and his staff at the Office of \nManagement and Budget have made great efforts to make performance-based \nmanagement a reality throughout the executive branch. The President has \ndeveloped a management agenda that, when fully implemented, will force \nagency managers to focus more closely on the results they are achieving \nwith the resources Congress and the taxpayers provide to them.\n\n  Congress, which started the revolution toward performance-based \nmanaging in Government, should encourage the executive branch to \ncontinue to increase its emphasis on managing for results. We should be \na partner with the President in encouraging new management techniques \nand giving Federal managers the tools they need and the flexibility \nthey require to accomplish the missions we assign to them. In return, \nwe must demand greater accountability from the President and those he \nappoints to manage Federal agencies.\n  Even with this emphasis by both branches of Government on better \nmanagement, the results are mixed at best. Each year, the GAO continues \nto place the same agencies and the same Departments on its list of \nentities that are at high risk for waste, fraud, and mismanagement, \ndemonstrating how deep and seemingly intractable this problem is--which \nbrings us to our present consideration: We simply must give this new \ndepartment and this new Secretary the management tools with which to \ncarry out this new massive and vitally important job.\n  The sheer volume of people, property, and assets involved in the new \ndepartment is overwhelming. Coupled with our expectations that this new \ndepartment will be the cure that will strengthen our domestic security, \nI fear that we are setting ourselves up for failure if we do not \nprovide the new Secretary with the flexibility to manage the department \nproperly.\n  By maintaining the status quo, not only will the Secretary be \nrequired to pay the same salary to two counterterrorism experts with \nvastly different performance and ability levels, we are also \nprohibiting the Secretary from accessing a single cent of the \nunexpended funds from agencies that are transferred to the new \ndepartment to assist in the transition. Instead, the Secretary must \nappeal to Congress to enact enabling legislation each and every time \nthe Secretary of the new department needs some flexibility to \nreorganize or get this department up and running successfully.\n  Supporters of the legislation before us disagree. They argue that the \nSecretary does not need additional managerial tools or flexibility to \ntake on this monumental task. It is true that flexibility is not needed \nto set up another Federal bureaucracy that resembles the rest of \nGovernment. Flexibility is not needed to replicate the problems that \npervade our Government in terms of Federal workforce management, \nfinancial management, information technology management, and program \noverlap and duplication. Managerial tools and flexibility are not \nneeded\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\nto create another Federal Department that ranks at the top of the \nGeneral Accounting Office's ``high-risk'' list of agencies in the \nGovernment that are most vulnerable to waste, fraud, and mismanagement. \nManagerial tools and flexibility are not needed to create a civil \nservice, that, according to one expert, Paul Light, of the Brookings \nInstitution, and former staff member to the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee:\n\n       Underwhelms at virtually every task it undertakes. It is \n     sluggish at hiring, hyper-inflated at appraising, permissive \n     at promoting, weak-kneed at disciplining, and mind-numbingly \n     elongated at firing.\n\n  Our goal in this new department must not be to replicate the failures \nMr. Light outlines, but, rather, to make improvements. If we cannot \nimprove our well-known operational shortcomings now that our Nation's \nsecurity is at issue, when in the world will we ever be able to do so?\n  According to the legislation before us today, the mission of the new \ndepartment is to ``promote homeland security,'' ``prevent terrorist \nattacks,'' and ``reduce the vulnerability of the United States to \nterrorism.'' I question how this new department will possibly be able \nto fulfill its mission if it is bogged down by the same old persistent \nmanagement problems that have faced the rest of our Government for so \nmany years.\n  First and foremost, I think most of us would agree with Paul Light, \nand other experts, that the Federal civil service system, the process \nthe Federal Government uses to hire and promote workers, is broken.\n  Madam President, this is a logical stopping point for me. If I am \nreading the clock correctly, we are very close to the time of recess \nfor our briefing. So, with that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8183-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have 5 \nminutes, without losing my place in the debate, as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes. Following his \nstatement, he will have the floor.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Wellstone are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to speak to a very simple \namendment I introduced. I say to my colleagues, this actually was \npassed in the House in the homeland defense bill. It certainly is \nrelevant that we bar the Secretary of Homeland Security from entering \ninto contracts with U.S. companies that give up U.S. citizenship to \navoid U.S. taxes.\n  I need to really summarize this amendment again. This is a very \nsimple amendment that would bar the Secretary of Homeland Security from \nentering into contracts with U.S. companies that give up U.S. \ncitizenship to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  To about 99.9 percent of people in Minnesota and probably to about \n99.9 percent of the people in the country, this is a very reasonable \nproposition. My colleagues might remember that I had an amendment like \nthis to the Defense appropriations bill which passed here by unanimous \nvote.\n  Before I get into the specifics of my amendment, let me make a quick \ncomment about the relevancy of the amendment. I gather there is an \nagreement among the majority leader and the minority leader to move all \nnonrelevant amendments. That agreement won't affect this amendment \nbecause it was drafted to be relevant. It deals with government \ncontracts. It deals with the Department of Homeland Security.\n  The underlying House bill, as I just mentioned, has a similar \nprovision. So the substance of my amendment is\n\n[[Page S8184]]\n\nfully relevant to this bill. This is the appropriate place to have this \ndebate, as we debate the question of whether we will have a Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  Former U.S. companies that have renounced their citizenship currently \nhold at least $2 billion worth of contracts with the Federal \nGovernment. I don't think companies that aren't willing to pay their \nfair share of taxes should be able to hold those contracts.\n  U.S. companies that play by the rules, that pay their fair share of \ntaxes, should not be forced to compete with bad actors who can undercut \ntheir bids because of the tax loophole. I had a debate on a similar \nprovision on ``Nightline.'' I said that the vast majority of companies \nin Minnesota and around the country, if they had the lawyers and the \naccountants, wouldn't do this because they wouldn't believe it was the \nright thing to do, or many of the smaller businesses in my State and \nall around the country don't have the lawyers and the accountants to \nreally get such a loophole.\n  In the last couple of years, a number of prominent U.S. corporations, \nusing creative paperwork, have transformed themselves into Bermuda \ncorporations in order to avoid paying their share of U.S. taxes. These \nnew Bermuda companies are basically shell corporations. They have no \nstaff, no offices, no business activity in Bermuda. This exists for the \nsole purpose of shielding income from the IRS. That is what this is \nabout.\n  By the way, I am talking about shielding not just profits made abroad \nbut profits made in our country that are just shifted. There is a lot \nof cooking of the books that goes on. Does that sound familiar to any \nSenator?\n  U.S. tax law contains many provisions designed to expose such \ncreative accounting and to require U.S. companies that are foreign in \nname only to pay the same taxes as other domestic corporations. But \nthese bad corporate former citizens exploit a specific loophole in \ncurrent law so that the country is treated as foreign for tax purposes \nand, therefore, pays no U.S. taxes on its foreign income--or, for that \nmatter, on all-too-often a good part of its U.S. income. Additionally, \nthese companies can use accounting tricks, as documented by the Senate \nFinance Committee in their investigations of this issue, to reduce \ntheir U.S. income on paper and their U.S. tax on even their U.S. \nincome.\n\n  By the way, I thank staff on the Senate Finance Committee, majority \nand minority, for their help in working on this amendment. We have \ntried to do this in the right way. I will repeat this point. They use \nthese accounting tricks, which have been documented by our Finance \nCommittee, to reduce their U.S. income on paper and reduce U.S. tax \neven on U.S. income.\n  These are Enron-like schemes involving sham loans and other \n``Imclone'' transfers that allow these companies to reduce taxes on a \nU.S. company, including income from Government contracts. This is \ncalled earnings stripping.\n  I have spent the last 2 weeks, or thereabouts, at the Minnesota State \nFair. About half the State's population comes. It is quite a happening. \nIt is the essence of grassroots democracy. I will tell you one thing, \npeople are really indignant about a lot of these inside corporate \nscandals.\n  Some Senators may say: Paul, you are just jumping on the issue. Well, \nI don't know; this has been my work for years. I will tell you this. \nBetween having some of your savings and putting it in stock and seeing \nit erode in value, or your savings in a 401(k) eroding, or CEOs telling \nthem they had an independent audit done and everything was great, to \ninvest more of their 401(k), at the same time he dumped his stock and \nmade $230 million in profit--people are tired of this behavior.\n  This is all about corporate accountability. That is what this \namendment is all about. What I am saying is that these companies are \nnot paying their fair share. If they want to renounce their citizenship \nso they don't have to pay their fair share of taxes, fine, but don't \nexpect to get Government contracts.\n  Now, the loophole that we want to get rid of gives tens of millions \nof dollars of tax breaks to major multinational companies, and these \nare tax cheats. It also puts other companies that are unwilling or \nunable to use this loophole at a competitive disadvantage. No Minnesota \ncompany, or no American company, should be penalized for staying put in \nour country while others that renounce their U.S. citizenship get a tax \nbreak. This is a simple proposition. No company that does the right \nthing and stays in our country should be penalized for staying put \nwhile others renounce their U.S. citizenship just to get a tax break, \nto not pay their fair share of taxes.\n  The problem is that when these companies don't pay their fair share, \nthe rest of American taxpayers and businesses are stuck with the bill. \nI think I can safely say that very few of the small businesses I have \nvisited in Detroit Lakes, or Mankato, or Duluth, or Minneapolis, or \nNorthfield, or Faribault, or on the Iron Range, can avail themselves of \nthe Bermuda Triangle. As a matter of fact, they would not view it as a \nvery patriotic thing to do. They cannot afford the big-name tax lawyers \nand accountants to show them how to do their books Enron style, but \nthey probably would not do it anyway if it meant renouncing their \ncitizenship. So the price they pay for their good citizenship, good \ncorporate citizenship, their good business citizenship, is a higher \ntax bill.\n\n  Now, the House passed an amendment similar to this amendment on their \nhomeland security bill. My amendment uses a different mechanism than \nthe House bill to get at the same bad behavior. I have worked with \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus to conform this amendment with \ntheir bill that would close the tax loophole. That is what I ultimately \nwant to do. Here is how my amendment would work. If a U.S. company \nreincorporated in a foreign country and 50 percent or more of the \nshareholders of the new foreign corporation were the same as the \nshareholders of the old U.S. company, then that company would be barred \nfrom contracting with any homeland security agency if the company did \nnot have substantial business activity in its foreign home. It is that \nsimple. That is a perfect operational definition of a sham operation.\n  In other words, this is a two-part test, and if a company met both \ntests, it would be barred from contracting with the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  First test: Are a majority of the shareholders of the new company the \nsame as the shareholders of the old U.S. company? This test is designed \nto separate the true purchase of two real companies, which is fine, \nfrom a sham transaction done just for tax purposes when the owners \nchange only the home country.\n  Second test: Does the new foreign company have substantial business \nactivity in its new foreign home? If it doesn't, then the new foreign \nparent company is really just a paper shell designed to take advantage \nof a tax loophole.\n  A lot of this is self-explanatory. I am not a lawyer, and some of the \ntechnical material is hard for me, but this is not too difficult to \nfigure out.\n  This is contained in the Grassley-Baucus tax bill. I believe Congress \nwill close this tax loophole this year. There is growing support for \ndoing so in the House. I have introduced legislation to close 24 \nloophole, and the Senate Finance Committee has reported a version of \nthis legislation, which I strongly support, that would do so as well. \nIt is not appropriate for the Senate to close the tax loophole on this \nbill--this is not a tax bill--but it is appropriate for us to say that \nif a U.S. company wants to bid for a contract for U.S. homeland \nsecurity work, then it should not renounce its U.S. citizenship for a \ntax break.\n  We all make sacrifices in a time of war. The only sacrifice this \namendment asks of Federal contractors is that they pay their fair share \nof taxes like everybody else.\n  Mr. President, when I was talking about a Mr. Denis Kozlowski, the \nreason I mentioned it, this was about Tyco Company, which has taken \nadvantage of this scheme. It is highly lucrative for these \ncorporations. Tyco International saved $400 million last year by \nchartering its space in Bermuda--$400 million. About a month ago, we \nlearned that those savings may have helped the company buy the CEO a \n$19 million home in Boca Raton and a $6,000 shower curtain for his \nplace in\n\n[[Page S8185]]\n\nManhattan. That was in the Wall Street Journal. Here is Tyco \nInternational which saves $400 million, and the CEO gets a lot of help \nto buy a home and also uses $6,000 to purchase a shower curtain for his \nplace in Manhattan.\n  Was the company using some of the money that they received in \nGovernment contracts--$220 million--to pay for that home and apparently \na very nice shower curtain? Should we feel sorry for these corporations \nthat have to scrape and pinch to find some tax savings? This is a \ncorporate responsibility issue. I think in the House of \nRepresentatives, altogether, there were over 300 votes for a very \nsimilar amendment.\n  I know some of my colleagues have an honest-to-goodness philosophical \nobjection to this approach, and I understand that and respect them for \nit. On this one, maybe it is the populist in me, but to me this is a \nstraightforward proposition. If these companies want to engage in this \nkind of sham or scam, they want to renounce their citizenship, they are \nnot going to get U.S. contracts from this new homeland defense agency. \nThat is what this amendment says.\n  I will wait for other colleagues to speak. I will say to my colleague \nfrom Tennessee that I have been willing to accommodate anybody's \nschedule--if people want to put off the debate for a while and vote \ntomorrow, or whatever he wants to do. I wanted to begin and get the \ndiscussion going on the amendment, whatever fits in with the schedule, \nobviously.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reid and Senator \nBaucus be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. \nSenator Lieberman can perhaps consult with the Senator from Minnesota \nas to the way we will proceed. If the Senator is willing to set aside \nthe amendment for a moment, we will bring it back in due course and \nproceed with the discussion, if that is agreeable.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Connecticut, \nI will accommodate his schedule. I want to get the amendment up and \nhave a debate. If the Senator from Connecticut wants to lay the \namendment aside--whatever best accommodates his schedule. As long as my \ncolleagues will be nice to me in the debate and praise me, I am willing \nto do anything he wants.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. It is easy to find common ground. I thank the Senator \nfrom Minnesota. I suggest Senator Thompson and I engage in some \nconversation with the Senator from Minnesota. For that purpose, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is the pending business \nis the amendment offered by Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Wellstone has offered an amendment \nthat deals with a subject I mentioned this morning, and I wanted to \nspeak a bit more about that subject. It is a subject that, by its \ntitle, most people would not think much about. It is called inversion.\n  What does inversion mean with respect to corporate America these \ndays? Inversion is a process by which a corporation decides to renounce \nits American citizenship. A number of high-profile corporations have \ndone that, saying, we wish to renounce our American citizenship and \nbecome citizens of another country--in a couple of cases, Bermuda. So \nan American corporation says, we no longer want to be an American \ncorporation, we want to be a Bermuda corporation.\n  Why would a U.S. corporation decide it wants to renounce its \ncitizenship? The answer, of course, is very simple. Because there are \ncircumstances under which, in the renouncement of citizenship by a \ncorporation, called an inversion, they can save millions, or tens of \nmillions, or perhaps hundreds of millions, of dollars in taxation. So \nsome companies make a decision, we would like to no longer be U.S. \ncitizens in order that we might save money on our tax bill. I happen to \nthink that is unpatriotic.\n  We are at war. Our country is at war with terrorists. Nearly 1 year \nago, on 9/11, we were attacked with unspeakable horror by terrorists in \nNew York City, in Washington, DC, at the Pentagon, and then there was \nthe aircraft that crashed in Pennsylvania.\n  Since that time, of course, we have had a remarkable speech by \nPresident Bush, one of the best I have heard in my service in Congress, \ncalling this country to cooperate and to work together for a common \npurpose, to wage this war on terrorism. Then in the middle of all of \nthis, we read stories about corporations that decide they want to \nrenounce their citizenship so they can save on taxation.\n  I ask a question of a company that decides it wants to renounce its \nAmerican citizenship: If it gets in trouble somewhere around the world, \nif some dictator wants to expropriate its assets in some country around \nthe world, whom is it going to call? The Bermuda Navy? The Bermuda \nMarines? The Bermuda Army? I do not think so.\n  It is shameful to see companies do what are called inversions and \nrenounce their American citizenship. They have a perfect legal right to \ndo it under today's law, but there are ways to try to plug that hole in \nour Tax Code, and a number of us are working on that.\n  The Senator from Minnesota offers another proposal with respect to \nthis specific bill, and that is to say those companies that decide they \nwant to renounce their American citizenship should not be bidding for \ncontracts under homeland security.\n  We have a lot to do with respect to the needs in this country, and \nthe requirement that we all get together, work together, stay together, \nto fight terrorism and do what we must as Americans to respond to this \nthreat. There is something horribly out of step with our requirements \nas Americans, our requirements of citizenship, our requirements as the \nstewards of this democracy, to see some corporations in this country \ndecide they no longer want to be American, they no longer want to have \nU.S. citizenship. Technically and currently under the law, they have a \nright to renounce their citizenship, but I think it sends a terrible \nmessage to our country and to the world when they do that.\n  Yes, they can save on taxes by doing it perhaps. The question then \nwill be: Who will pay the taxes they do not pay? Which other Americans \nwould they choose to burden with this additional tax bill? Americans \nworking in the manufacturing plants they used to have in this country \nor perhaps still have in this country? Do they want to shift the burden \nto working people? That is what happens with respect to inversions.\n  I indicated I am going to hold some hearings on a couple of these \nissues. There is some unfinished business with respect to this issue of \ncorporate responsibility. We passed a bill and the President signed it, \nand that is important because we have seen now the emergence and the \ndisclosures of corporate scandals unparalleled in my lifetime.\n  You know, I have a card in my pocket. I put it in my pocket this \nmorning, because it reminded me of something important. I was on an \nairplane recently. I was sitting in an aisle seat, and a man sitting \ntwo rows ahead of me in the aisle seat across the aisle, as we landed \nand before we disembarked, passed me his business card. His business \ncard named him and the company for which he worked. He is president of \nthe company. He wrote on the back of the card with a ballpoint pen and \npassed it to me. I had never met the man, did not know him. He said:\n\n       Dear Senator Dorgan, Good morning. I am president of a \n     corporation. I work very hard and I am honest. I believe \n     there are more like me than not.\n\n  This is the president of a corporation. His first name is John.\n\n[[Page S8186]]\n\n  I sent John a letter and said: I do not ever speak of corporate \nscandal without saying I think we ought to understand American business \nby and large in this country is run by wonderful men and women, good \nstewards of the investors' money, people who want to do the right \nthing, people who do not try to find where the line is and cross the \nline, people who do not cook the books, people who work long hours and \nare honest and do the right thing. That is the rule in American \nbusiness, in my judgment. But it is also true that the emergence and \nthe disclosures of these corporate scandals tarnish all in American \nbusiness and injure those honest, hard-working people trying to run \nAmerican companies. It injures the ability to raise capital because it \ndestroys people's faith in the system. They invest in a stock in a \ncompany they have never visited. They buy a stock in a company they do \nnot know much about, but they trust the CEO, they trust the financial \nstatements, they trust the accounting firm that reviewed the \nstatements, they trust the law firm that gave advice to the CEO, they \ntrust the board of directors. So they invest in a share of stock in a \ncompany they have never visited or never seen.\n  But there have been far too many instances recently of corporate \nexecutives acting in complete disregard of their responsibilities as \nbusiness leaders. And although we recently passed an accounting reform \nbill to tackle some of these problems, we have unfinished business. One \nissue involves inversions, the issue that Senator Wellstone is bringing \nto our attention today. Another important issue involves bankruptcies, \nand an amendment I tried to offer to the corporate responsibility bill. \nThat amendment was blocked by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm. He \nblocked that amendment for a couple of days, and I was not able to put \nit on the bill, but it deals with this. It is an amendment that says, \nif in the year prior to the bankruptcy of a corporation, the major \nexecutives in the corporation are receiving millions of dollars in \nincentive and bonus payments, there ought to be a disgorgement and \nrecapture of that money to go to the stockholders and the employees. It \nis very simple.\n  Since the time that I was blocked in offering that amendment, the \nFinancial Times did an investigation and an evaluation of the 25 \nlargest bankruptcies in our country since January of last year.\n  What did it show? It showed that 230 top executives in the 25 largest \ncompanies that filed for bankruptcy took $3 billion out of those \ncompanies in compensation as those companies headed towards bankruptcy.\n  Well, guess what. The investors lost their shirts, they lost their \nlife savings, and, as the Financial Times says, the barons of \nbankruptcy, the executives running companies into bankruptcy, went off \nwith a pocketful of gold.\n  There is something wrong with that. That is a piece of unfinished \nbusiness. We ought to pass legislation that says prior bankruptcy, if \nexecutives are getting bonus and incentive payments as this company \nheads towards bankruptcy, there ought to be the right to recapture that \nmoney and use it to help offset the perks and costs with respect to \ninvestors and employees.\n\n  That is one piece of unfinished business. Another piece deals with \ninversions and the tax with respect to those corporations that want to \nrenounce their American citizenship. There is unfinished business with \nrespect to corporate responsibility. We did a wonderful thing in \npassing that bill. Senator Paul Sarbanes deserves our unending thanks \nfor the work he did to put that bill together. The President signed it. \nIt is a bill destined to give confidence to people, but there is more \nto do.\n  If we stop here we will have stopped before we got to the \nintersection. There is more to do. Part of that deals with inversion, \nand part of it deals with disgorgement and recapturing of funds as CEOs \ntook companies into bankruptcy. I intend, in the coming weeks, to be \namong those in Congress who will address these issues. We should not \ndecide the bill we passed represents the end of corporate \nresponsibility legislation in the Senate.\n  I conclude by saying the fellow that passed me his business card on \nan airplane a few days ago is right. He said: I'm president of a \ncorporation. I work very hard and I'm honest. I believe there are more \nlike me than not.\n  He is right about that. Absolutely. And on behalf of people like him, \nwe have a responsibility to be tough and to go after those who abuse \ntheir trust and steal money. We have a responsibility to see to it that \nthey do more than 2 years of hard tennis at a minimum security \ninstitution somewhere.\n  The Senator from Minnesota does us a service by offering this subject \non the floor of the Senate. There is more to do on inversion, but there \nis more to do beyond inversion and corporate responsibility, including \ndisgorgement and recapturing of bankruptcy incentive and bonus payments \nto CEOs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4490 to Amendment No. 4486\n\n  Mr. REID. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. REID] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4490 to amendment 4486.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To prohibit the Secretary of Homeland Security from \n               contracting with any corporate expatriate)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. __.

The Senator from New Hampshire is here and is going to ask \nthat the present amendments be set aside so that he can offer an \namendment. I will first take just a few minutes.\n  First of all, I commend the Senator from Minnesota for this \namendment. I was on the Senate floor when he offered this amendment on \na previous piece of legislation and spent some time talking about the \nmerits of his legislation. It passed by voice vote. The Senator from \nMinnesota recognizes in the House something comparable to this has \npassed, so we have no problems with this legislation as to it being \nrelevant or germane.\n  This legislation is important to reestablish confidence in what is \ngoing on in the country. This amendment is designed to attack a tax \nloophole that has allowed scores of U.S. corporations to move their \nheadquarters, on paper only, to tax haven countries to avoid paying \ntheir fair share of our taxes.\n  Specifically, the amendment bars the Department of Homeland Security \nfrom awarding Government contracts for those corporate tax runaways.\n  It is a sad reality that under our current law these corporate \nexpatriations are technically legal--I say technically. Legal or not, \nthere is no reason the U.S. Government should reward tax runaways with \nlucrative Government contracts.\n  I had one of these big contractors talk to me. He brought with him \none of my friends who was no longer in the Senate. Because of my close, \nwarm feelings for the person who brought this man in, I wanted to try \nto help. But after listening, I said I cannot help because it is wrong.\n  These corporations have turned their back on their country in their \ncountry's hour of need, but they continue to come to Congress and the \nexecutive agencies with their hands outstretched asking for rewards. We \nneed to end as soon as we can the practice of companies that hold \nbillions of dollars in Federal contracts renouncing U.S. citizenship. \nIt is wrong that the companies that play by the rules and meet the \nresponsibilities of the country should be forced to compete with bad \nactors who shirk their tax bill.\n  If the corporations want Federal contracts so badly, I have advice: \nCome home. Come back to your country, to our country, and you will be \neligible to bid on homeland security contracts. If you do not, you \ncan't. Go lobby Bermuda or the Cayman Islands, but leave us alone.\n  Let me talk about a few of the companies involved that have handled \nthis in an improper manner: Ingersoll-Rand. When I was a little boy and \nwent with my dad down in the mines, Ingersoll-Rand was the name on the \ncompressor that was above ground and on the jackhammer he used \nunderground. In my mind, even today, I can see my father pick up that \njackhammer and push it into that hard land and drill. Ingersoll-Rand is \nall he had, all I remember, an Ingersoll-Rand jackhammer. This company \nwas founded in 1905. They have been headquartered in Woodcliff, NJ, for \nmany decades, mostly manufacturing jackhammers, bobcat vehicles, club \ncar golf carts, hardware products, security devices, control systems. \nIn fact, one of the things they talk about in advertisements is their \njackhammers made Mount Rushmore.\n  But times have changed. Last December, 3 months after September 11, \nIngersoll-Rand put the finishing touches on renouncing its U.S. \ncorporate citizenship. It filed paperwork to set up three British \nemployees in a little office in Hamilton, Bermuda. Now it can avoid \npaying $40 million each year in U.S. taxes. This will not stop \nIngersoll-Rand from lobbying for U.S. Government contracts. As we \nspeak, the corporation holds over $40 million in Government contracts, \nvirtually all of which are directly related to homeland defense or the \nmilitary. These days, the company has been lobbying the Government to \nbuy its airport security screening devices. If they renounce their \nBermuda citizenship, I am happy to work with them and let them get the \ncontract. That is fine.\n\n  There are many other companies. Fruit of the Loom, headquartered in \nBowling Green, KY, for years, last year decided it wanted to do \nsomething else and moved offshore. They have millions of dollars in \ncontracts.\n  Cooper Industries makes tools and hardware needed to transmit natural \ngas. They were founded in 1833 in Mount Vernon, OH. Last year, they had \nrevenues of $4 billion, net income of $230 million, and they decided \nthey could make a few extra bucks by moving offshore. That is what they \nhave done.\n  I have page after page of companies that have decided to go offshore. \nYet they have large amounts of Government contracts, where the \nunderlying company had scores, hundreds of offshore Government \ncorporations, legal entities set up so they could play around with our \nmoney.\n  Accenture, APW, Carnival Corporation, Cooper Industries, Enron, \nEverest Reinsurance, Foster Wheeler, Fruit of the Loom, Global \nCrossings, Gold Reserve, Halliburton, Harken Oil--Halliburton had units \nin St. Lucia, Liechtenstein, Barbados, Cayman Islands, Cyprus, the \nNetherlands Antilles, and the British Virgin Islands, among others--\nHelen of Troy, Leucadia Corporation, on and on.\n  The time has come. If they want to move offshore, let them get their \ncontracts someplace else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, my understanding is the \npending business is the Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent the Wellstone \namendment be temporarily laid aside for the purpose of offering an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I couldn't hear. What was the request?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The request I made was to temporarily lay \naside the Wellstone amendment for the purpose of offering an amendment, \nwhich I will not debate at this time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Hampshire yield the \nfloor?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object. Will the Senator from New \nHampshire restate his unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent that the \nWellstone amendment be temporarily laid aside for the purposes of \noffering my amendment on armed pilots.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4491 To Amendment No. 4471\n\n  Mr. SMITH. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Smith), for himself, \n     Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Burns, Mr. Bunning, and Mr. \n     Miller, proposes an amendment numbered 4491 to amendment \n     4471.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text Of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this amendment is offered \non behalf of myself and Senators Boxer, Murkowski, Bunning, Burns, the \nSenator presiding, Senator Miller, and others. Because there is an \nagreement with some of my colleagues that we would not debate it today, \nI will not\n\n[[Page S8188]]\n\ntake any further time from the Senate, other than to say that this \namendment is the Arming Pilots Against Terrorism and Cabin Defense Act \nof 2002, which will be an amendment that will provide help for training \nfor those flight attendants in the cabin, and for pilots to be able to \ncarry weapons, lethal weapons, in the cockpit to protect our country, \nour citizens, and those in the aircraft from the aircraft becoming \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  The intention is to debate this tomorrow when my other colleagues are \navailable, at a time to which the leaders will mutually agree. I very \nmuch appreciate the assistant leader, Mr. Reid, allowing me to offer \nthe amendment at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the bill as it \nstands and some of the challenges relating to it rather than any \nspecific amendment.\n  All of us, as we want to arrive at a position, fall back upon our own \nexperience. I have some experience that I think is relative to this \nsituation which I would share with the Senate. I have shared it with \nsome members of the committee, but I have found in my time in the \nSenate that there is no such thing as repetition. Every speech is given \nas if it is brand new and no one has ever heard any of this before. I \nhave learned that from some of my more senior colleagues here.\n  First when I arrived here, I found it a little distressing, but after \nI found out how often people listen to what you say, I decided it is \nprobably a pretty good thing, because repeating something over and over \nagain in this body, many times, is the only way you can get anybody to \nlisten to you.\n  With that, let me share with you and my colleagues, and any others \nwho may be listening, my experience with a similar situation when I \nserved in the first term of the Nixon administration.\n  In the 18 months prior to President Nixon's election, Joe Califano, \nas the Chief of Staff to President Johnson, conceived of the idea of \nthe Department of Transportation. We were one of the few industrialized \ncountries in the world that did not have a ministry of transport, as it \nis called in most other countries. We found that our transportation \nfunctions were scattered all over the Government. Mr. Califano, \nconsulting with President Johnson, convinced the President that the \ntime had come to create the American version of a ministry of \ntransport. So the Department of Transportation was born.\n  On paper, it looks like a department that was created at the Harvard \nBusiness School. You had a series of assistant secretaries who were \nstaff officers. You had a series of administrators who were line \nofficers. It was put together with modern business terminology and a \ncomplete understanding of how a large organization should be formed.\n  It took the Federal Highway Administration out of the Department of \nCommerce, where it was such a significant part of that Department that \nthey had two Under Secretaries, one an Under Secretary for \nTransportation and the other an Under Secretary for everything else. It \ntook the FAA from its status as an independent agency reporting \ndirectly to the President. It was called the Federal Aviation Agency. \nIt was renamed the Federal Aviation Administration so that the \nterminology would be comparable.\n  It took the Coast Guard out of the Treasury Department. It goes all \nthe way back to the time of Thomas Jefferson, perhaps, as being part of \nthe Treasury Department looking for smugglers so they could collect \nduties on people who would bring goods into the United States. The \nCoast Guard represents a significant part of our transportation \nactivity, and it was recognized it no longer belonged in the Treasury \nDepartment.\n  There was a fledgling group called the Urban Mass Transit \nAdministration that was over at HUD, the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development. But they recognized it had nothing, really, to do \nwith housing and belonged over in the new Department of Transportation.\n  They looked at some other areas where there needed to be some \ninitiatives in transportation and created some new agencies solely for \nthose--the Federal Rail Administration being the chief among them. Then \nit took some other isolated agencies, folded them in, put them on a \npiece of paper, and said: Here is your new department.\n\n  Alan Boyd, who was the Under Secretary of Commerce for \nTransportation, was made the new Secretary of Transportation and for 18 \nmonths struggled with the challenge of trying to bring these groups \ntogether. His service was terminated when President Johnson left \noffice. John Volpe came down, as former Governor of the State of \nMassachusetts, to assume the Secretaryship of the Department of \nTransportation. The Under Secretary was James Beggs, who came over from \nNASA, where he had performed excellent service as an associate \nadministrator there. I was hired to run the congressional liaison \nfunction for the Department.\n  As I say, the Department was 18 months old. When I walked into it to \ntake over my new duties, I found that almost no one knew what those new \nduties would be because the challenge of bringing together, at a \ndepartmental level, all of the people involved in congressional liaison \nhad not been successfully met in the 18 months previous. I am not \nputting any blame on Secretary Boyd or on any of the people who worked \nwith him during that 18 months. As I became acquainted with the \nDepartment and its functions, I realized how difficult it was to bring \ntogether agencies that had no common culture, no common background, \nthat had been operating in many different places across the Government, \nand turn them into a clearly, smoothly functioning single unit.\n  Indeed, there were some people in that organization who refused to \nadmit they were even members of the Department of Transportation.\n  An anecdote: One of the personnel officers who worked for the \nAssistant Secretary for Administration got on the elevator and punched \nthe button that said eighth floor. Someone behind her said: You are one \nof those DOT types. The eighth floor was the floor that had been \nrecommissioned for the offices of the Secretary. The tenth floor was \nwhere the Administrator of the FAA worked. She turned around and said: \nWe are all DOT types.\n\n  Her remark was not favorably received. The folks behind her in the \nelevator said: We are FAA. You are DOT.\n  It is a small anecdote, but it demonstrates that after 18 months \nthere were still people who had a hard time bringing themselves into \nthe new Department.\n  To my own specific experience, I found that the FAA still had its own \ncongressional relations function. Urban Mass Transit didn't have one at \nall. They had not really brought anything over with them from HUD. The \nFederal Highway Administration had a well-entrenched congressional \nliaison function, and the Coast Guard had been at it for close to 200 \nyears, and they were not about to give that up to anybody as \nunimportant as a Cabinet officer.\n  The new agencies that had been created didn't have any service. They \ndidn't know what they were doing. Those officers who had been trying to \nperform congressional relations functions for the Secretary and the \nteam of Assistant Secretaries that had been created under him had been \nfloundering and flopping around trying to find their way in this \nmorass.\n  Secretary Volpe and Under Secretary Beggs gave me the challenge of \ntrying to pull all of this together. It was one of the most interesting \nand difficult experiences of my then-young life. That was enough years \nago that I was a young man when I undertook that.\n  Eventually, we were able to pull all of those functions together into \na single office reporting directly to the Secretary. I rearranged all \nof the functions so that everyone involved in that activity reported to \nme either directly or through my deputy. I said: I will give you an \nassignment--as if we were a consulting firm dealing with clients. You, \nsir, your client is the FAA. You, sir, your client is Urban Mass \nTransit, and so on. You will not be acceptable to me if your client is \nunhappy. If the Administrator of the FAA believes he is not getting the \nkind of congressional relations he deserves, he will complain directly \nto me as we meet together in the Secretary's staff meetings, and I will \nbe around to see you. But at the same time, you work for me. And, \nthrough me, you work for Secretary Volpe.\n\n[[Page S8189]]\n\n  This meant that when we had an issue that required more manpower and \nwomanpower than that particular officer could provide, I could rally \nthe resources of the office and the other officers to help on that \nparticular issue at that particular time. We were much more flexible. I \nthink we were much more efficient and effective.\n  As it turned out, a large percentage of President Nixon's domestic \nagenda fell under the Department of Transportation. Congress passed, \nwith our help and liaison, a whole series of landmark bills setting \ndown the transportation process for this country. It was one of the \nmost stimulating experiences of my life.\n  What does that have to do with the Department of Homeland Security? \nIn making the kinds of changes that I have described, I had to have \nmanagement flexibility so that when, with the Secretary's authority, I \ndidn't have--it came from the Secretary--I could say: You no longer \nwork for the Administrator of the FAA; you now work for me. You no \nlonger report to the Administrator of the Federal Highway \nAdministration, you now work for me. This is how we are going to set \nyour procedures, and this is how we are going to rationalize salaries \nwithin the office that I created.\n\n  I was able to do that because the enabling act that created the \nDepartment of Transportation gave the Secretary management flexibility \nto move people around within the Department without coming back to the \nCongress for approval. He had flexibility to change payroll.\n  One of the interesting things that occurred was that in the FAA, \npromotions were all made on even numbers; that is, you went from a GS-4 \nto a GS-6; from a GS-8 to a GS-10; from a GS-10 to a GS-12, and so on. \nIn other parts of the Department they did two numbers per jump, but \nthey were all on odd numbers.\n  As I brought all of these people together in the same offices, I had \nsome GS-5's and GS-6's. The amount of money they were earning, frankly, \nwas the same. It was very interesting to me, coming from the corporate \nworld as I was at that time in this somewhat strange and challenging \nworld of the U.S. personnel system. We had to rationalize that or the \noffice didn't make any sense. We had to make some changes. We didn't do \nit in a way that damaged anyone. No one lost money. No one lost \nposition. But someone had to transfer from the odd system to the even \nsystem, and adjustments had to be made. And they were made on the basis \nof what made the most sense for the office and how it would work. The \nflexibility that was written into the act made that possible.\n  One interesting thing that probably doesn't apply anymore but that \ncame out of that experience was the result with respect to supergrades. \nIn those days, a GS-16, GS-17, or GS-18 was called a supergrade, and \neach Department had a set number of supergrades. That was true of the \nDepartment of Transportation. I don't remember what the number was, but \nthe Department could not have more than 25 or 35 or whatever the number \nwas of supergrades.\n  As I went through this process of bringing all of these people \ntogether, I was able to walk into the Under Secretary's office and say: \nI am giving you back three supergrades--because so many of these people \nhad held supergrade positions in the previous administration. The way \nwe organized this, I only needed two supergrades--one for myself and \none for my deputy and everybody else was a GS-10 or below.\n  I didn't realize what I was doing because the Under Secretary greeted \nme with one of the biggest smiles I have ever received and said: This \nis pure gold because there are other places in the Department where the \npositions deserve supergrades and I don't have any supergrades to give \nthem. And you have just freed up three supergrades by virtue of your \nconsolidation of this function.\n  I don't know where the supergrades went. But they went out to other \ndeserving people.\n  That is why I feel so strongly in favor of President Bush's position \nthat the Department of Homeland Security must be formed with \nflexibility for management and personnel and other decisions on the \npart of the Secretary. I have been there and I have seen how vital it \nis. If we had to go through the kinds of hoops that are created in the \nFederal personnel system in the reorganizing something as insignificant \nas my offices--I am talking about 30 to 35 people max; I am not talking \nabout anything approaching the challenge of this new Department--if we \nhad to go through all of those hoops in reorganizing my office, I would \nhave spent the entire 2 years that I was there working on personnel \nissues and management issues instead of trying to get the program \npassed through the Congress--the landmark legislation that was passed. \nI still have the pens that President Nixon gave me and my picture in \nthe Cabinet Room when those bills were signed. We would not have been \nable to get that done. We would have been snarled up in all of the \ninternal management challenges of, well, we have to go to Congress to \nget this approved or that approved; we haven't got the flexibility to \ndo it.\n  I have that personal experience that drives me to stand with the \nPresident on this issue and to say that I believe the President is \ncorrect when he says he will veto this bill, if that flexibility is not \nthere.\n  None of us should have the false assumption that this Department will \nwork for at least 3 and more likely 5 years. All of us should \nunderstand how difficult a management challenge this is going to be \nunder the best of circumstances. The Department of Transportation, as I \nsay, 18 months after its formation was still not working. John Volpe \ndidn't come in and wave a magic wand to make it work overnight. John \nVolpe and Jim Beggs labored for a full 4 years beyond the 18 months \nthat it had under President Johnson. It was only toward the end of \nthose 4 years that you began to see things really meshed together and \nstart to work together and see a real Department of Transportation \ninstead of the old turf battles that had been there. The Department of \nDefense took longer than that to come together. It was the kind of \nreorganization more closely paralleling the size of the one we are now \ndoing.\n\n  It is instructive to remember that the first Secretary of Defense, \nJames Forrestal, committed suicide. The challenge of managing that \ndifficult a bureaucracy was sufficiently great that this dedicated \npublic servant--perhaps too dedicated because he took it so seriously--\nthat he ultimately could not cope with it and committed suicide, which \ndemonstrates how serious it is for us to do this right.\n  I do not want the new Secretary, whoever he or she may be, to have \nany more impediments placed on the challenge of making this Department \nwork than are necessary. To not give the Secretary the management \nflexibility that the President has called for is asking for failure in \nthis Department.\n  As I say, it is not going to work for at least 3, and more likely 5, \nyears. That does not mean we should not do it. We should do it because \nif we wait a year, that will just push back a year the 3-to-5-year \nperiod that it will not work. But let's be realistic about it. Let's \nunderstand from the model of Government mergers, let's understand from \nthe model of corporate mergers, how difficult this is going to be; and \nthen let us, in the Congress, fashion a piece of legislation that says \nwe are going to make it as easy as possible for the new Secretary to do \nall of the internal kinds of shifting and changing necessary to make it \nwork closer to the 3-year figure than to the 5-year figure.\n  Now, I hope I am wrong. I hope it will work magnificently in 6 \nmonths. But life tells me that is not likely. So that is why I voted \nagainst this bill in committee. I said to Chairman Lieberman: If you \nreally needed my vote to report out this bill, I would give you my vote \nbecause I think the bill ought to be reported out. But since you don't \nneed my vote, I want to register my deep concern about the management \nflexibility and lack thereof that is written into this bill. And the \nonly way I can do that is to cast a vote against the bill.\n  Someone has asked me: Well, if it comes out of the Senate and the \nPresident is not given the management flexibility he has asked for, how \nwill you vote on final passage? I will probably vote against it on \nfinal passage, even though some people say to me:\n\n[[Page S8190]]\n\nOh, let it go to conference and we'll fix it in conference.\n  I have learned around here the motto ``let's fix it in conference'' \ndoes not always work. Very often it comes back from conference worse \nthan when it went to conference, and then you are stuck.\n  So I am dedicated to the creation of the new Department. I will do \neverything I can to help the President and the Congress pass \nlegislation that makes sense. But I cannot, from my own experience, \nbelieve this makes any sense if it does not go forward with complete \nmanagement flexibility in every possible way.\n  A press conference was held today in which some Members of this body \nwere quoted as saying that those of us who believe as I have just \ndescribed are union baiters; that our whole motive here is to bash \norganized labor; our whole motive here is to attack honest working \npeople.\n  Let me take you back to my experience at the Department of \nTransportation. It was my first experience in an executive branch \norganization. I had served on Capitol Hill as a staffer, as a \nGovernment employee, but I had never been a civil servant. And I went \nin with some of the standard prejudices that many people in the private \nsector have about civil servants: That they don't work very hard; that \nthey are just serving their time until their 40-year period for \nretirement comes along; that they are not very entrepreneurial; that \nthey are not interested in new ideas; that they take as their motto, \n``We were here before you got here, and we will be here after you \nleave, so we don't need to pay any attention to you.''\n\n  There were some who had that view, there is no question. There is a \nvery small percentage of civil servants who feel that way.\n  I was overwhelmed with admiration for the career civil service people \nin our Government who were dedicated, determined to make Government \nwork, absolutely determined to do the very best job they could, and \nopen to suggestions and comments that may have come from the political \nappointees.\n  We had an Assistant Secretary for Administration, a position that is \na civil-service-protected position, who had been appointed by Alan \nBoyd. He was a known Democrat. But because his position had civil \nservice protection, there was not anything that Secretary Volpe could \ndo about it. He was as helpful to me in this reorganization effort that \nI have just described as anybody at the Department.\n  He sat down with me and helped take me through the labyrinth of \nFederal regulations. And when I made some mistakes--and I made several \nwhich were beauts--he did not jump all over me. He said: It's our fault \nfor not having warned you in advance that that's what would happen if \nyou did it that way. And if we had been there, we would have helped you \ndo it another way. And let's see to it that it happens the other way.\n  These people do not need to be protected from competent managers. \nThese people need to be motivated and excited about the creation of a \nnew Department. If the new Department is being created with intelligent \nmanagement and flexibility on the part of the management, the civil \nservants will respond, certainly those at the Department of \nTransportation. They will respond with enthusiasm: At least we are \nmoving forward in an area where we have been deficient in the past. \nThank you for the opportunity for this new kind of service that the old \nparadigm would not allow.\n  They will be supportive of this. Maybe their union managers are \nfearful of what management might do, but get a competent manager in as \nthe Secretary and have him or her choose competent people as the \nAssistant Secretaries and the other administrators, give them the \nflexibility to do the right management thing, and the civil servants \nwill not feel attacked. They will not feel under siege. They will feel \nliberated and excited. And they will be part of the solution because if \nthis Department is going to work in 3 years rather than 5, it has to \nhave the support of the civil servants; it has to have the kind of \npartnership between the civil servants and the political leadership \nthat America has seen happen so often in so many other places.\n  So I reject the notion that my call for management flexibility is \nsomehow an attack on the civil servants or an attack on their unions. \nInstead, it is reaching out and saying: Join with us to make the best \nkind of Department we possibly can and, thus, create for you the best \nworking environment you can ever be in in your Federal career. Be part \nof something truly exciting, something truly significant and historic, \nthe creation of a new Department in the 21st century dealing with 21st \ncentury challenges that this country has not had to face in its past \nhistory.\n  But don't let us start out with a traditional 19th-century-style \nmanagement-labor confrontation. Do not let us start out with: We have \nto protect our turf and everything we have now, and we have absolutely \nno confidence at all that the management will do anything but attack \nus.\n  Let's put all of that aside and say: What are we dealing with here? \nAs I say, we are dealing with a 21st century challenge of the kind this \ncountry has not faced in its history. We are trying to reorganize the \nassets of the Government to meet this challenge in a cohesive, \ncoherent, intelligent way.\n  Let us never lose sight of that objective and keep our eye on that \nball as we write this legislation and as we adopt amendments on the \nfloor.\n  One of the first amendments that will be offered will be one to give \nthe Secretary, through the President, the kind of management \nflexibility I have been talking about. I intend to support that as \nstrongly as I know how, for all of the reasons I have laid out here.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to speak on behalf of the \nhomeland security agency bill.\n  It is with humble appreciation of the gravity of the task now before \nus that I rise to advocate the creation of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  Today, almost a full year since the forces of hatred attacked the \nAmerican homeland, we are poised to transform the Federal Government \ninto a sharper, more versatile instrument of peace and security for all \nof our citizens. The people of America and their leaders here in \nWashington, in both Chambers of the Congress, on both sides of the \naisle, and at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, are united on the \nsubstance of this issue.\n  All agree we cannot stand idly by as the enemies of freedom plot our \ndestruction. All agree that the homeland security apparatus of the \nGovernment is at present ill equipped for its grave task. And all agree \nthat we are called, therefore, to take decisive action to retrofit the \nFederal Government for the more effective performance of its greatest \ncommission--the protection of its citizens.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said the real goal of government is the \nprotection of life and not its destruction. When Senators Lieberman and \nSpecter introduced legislation establishing a Department of Homeland \nSecurity in May, I am proud to say I was one of four Senators to sign \non as an original cosponsor.\n  Since that time, we all now know, the administration, followed by \nevery Member of Congress, has joined us in this critical reform effort, \nso that we find ourselves standing now on the threshold of an historic \nbipartisan achievement. A few points of difference on the details do \nremain. I look forward to a full and healthy debate on these over the \nnext few days. But by and large, we are headed in the same direction, \ntoward the same ultimate destination--the protection of our Nation.\n\n  I have no doubt that we will get there together. As my good friend \nCongressman John Lewis said after September 11:\n\n       We may have come to this country aboard different ships, \n     but we are all in the same boat now.\n\n  How true that is.\n  Under Senator Lieberman's leadership, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, upon which I sit, has outlined in its bipartisan homeland \nsecurity legislation a blueprint for a robust new\n\n[[Page S8191]]\n\nDepartment that hews closely in most key respects to that envisioned by \nthe President. The committee's measure would construct the Department \naround the core missions already identified by the President: Critical \ninfrastructure protection, border and transportation protection, \nemergency preparedness and response, and science and technology.\n  With few exceptions, the existing agencies transferred to the new \nDepartment under the administration's proposal are the same as those \ntransferred by the committee's bill. Often where the committee has \ndiverged from what the administration has done, as in the case of the \ntransfer of the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, \nGA, to the new Department, the change has been made in close \nconsultation with, and with the approval of, the administration. In \nother cases, changes are merely a fleshing out of proposals and \nconcepts previously set forth by the administration.\n  Among the latter are two amendments I offered during markup of this \nlegislation that pertain to the Federal response to terrorism of a \nbiological nature. The administration's proposal laid a strong \nfoundation by recognizing that public health agencies, such as the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, in Atlanta are \nabsolutely central to an effective response to biological terrorism and \nby further recognizing that prudence requires that scientists who focus \non bioterrorism not be separated from the vast expertise and resources \nof the rest of the public health sector.\n  My amendments, which the committee adopted during the July markup, \nare efforts to use the lessons of last fall's anthrax crisis culled \nfrom hours of testimony before our Governmental Affairs Committee to \nbuild on the solid foundation the President and HHS Secretary Thompson \nhave set.\n  The inadequacy of our bioterrorism preparedness and response \ncapability was exposed in dramatic and painful fashion last fall. In \nreaction, the Governmental Affairs Committee, under the distinguished \nleadership of Chairman Lieberman and Senator Thompson, held a series of \nhearings investigating the roots and potential remedies of that \ninadequacy.\n  At a hearing convened at my request on April 18 this year, Secretary \nof Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson, buttressed by a panel of \nexperts who followed him, testified to the following unmet needs in our \nFederal counterbioterrorism efforts:\n  First, a reorganization of the CDC's Bioterrorism Preparedness and \nResponse Program, much like on a smaller scale what we are now doing \nwith the Federal Government at large.\n  Second, clearer protocols of communication and coordination between \npublic health and law enforcement officials.\n  And third, a greater commitment of resources to the CDC.\n  These recommendations comprise the three-point approach for filling \nin the gaps in our national bioterrorism defenses that I have been \nadvocating for some months now. I am pleased that two of these largely \nhave been incorporated into the bill we are now considering.\n  With respect to the first, I proposed, and the committee adopted, an \namendment to create in the CDC a Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response \nDivision. Why a division, Mr. President? Because that division answers \ndirectly to the head of the CDC. It is an entity located at the \nintersection of science and security, of public health and law \nenforcement, empowered to respond with speed and with a firm grounding \nin the science of biological warfare to the infectious terror some \nmight seek to unleash upon this great Nation. The CDC's existing \nBioterrorism Preparedness and Response Program is a relatively new \ninitiative at the agency, having been created only in 1999 with a \nhandful of personnel, little status within the agency, and meager \nfunding.\n  The program remains as a subsidiary of the National Center for \nInfectious Diseases, a sub-branch of a sub-branch. It should come as \nlittle surprise then that the many witnesses who testified before our \ncommittee about last fall's crisis depicted a Federal response that was \nfragmented, confused, and largely inadequate.\n  CDC officials, both within and without the bioterrorism program, \nresponded commendably, but their ability to do so was clearly \nconstrained by, among other factors, an organizational structure that \nled inadequate focus to the unique aspects of a manmade threat to the \npublic health.\n  The Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Division, as described in \nthis chart, will remedy that. Operating directly out of the Office of \nthe Director of the CDC, the division will lead and coordinate the \nagency's counterbioterrorism activities. It will train and employ a \ncadre of public health professionals whose specialized training and \nfocus is on bioterrorism, and it will serve as a nexus, a meeting \nground, between the realms of public health and security, including \nhomeland security and law enforcement.\n  There is a real need in the Federal Government for expertise in the \nintersection of health and security. Terrorists, as a matter of fact, \nhit the seam. They went right between the two. Officials thinking \nexclusively along either law enforcement or public health lines, as is \ntoo often the case under the current structure, will inevitably \noverlook key bits of information that are not fully appreciable, except \nby individuals with expertise in both areas.\n\n  In the case of bioterrorism--the word itself a fusing of health, bio, \nand security, terrorism--appreciating such bits of information and \ndrawing critical conclusions based on these are absolutely essential to \nan effective Federal response. The cadre of bioterrorism specialists \ndeveloped by the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Division would \nbe specially trained accordingly.\n  In addition, while the threat posed by bioterrorism bears a strong \nresemblance to that posed by conventional disease outbreaks, there are \nreal substantive differences between a manmade disease outbreak--a la \nthe anthrax attack through envelopes that were obviously mailed by a \nhuman being--and a naturally occurring one--West Nile virus, Ebola \nvirus, and the like. Our health officials are highly trained to cope \nwith the latter, but most lack a sophisticated appreciation of the \ndifferent considerations that attend a manmade attack.\n  The upshot is when a recognition of these different divergences can \nmake a difference between effective and ineffective emergency response. \nFor example, while epidemiologists knew that contracting inhalation \nanthrax naturally required exposure to between 5,000 to 10,000 spores, \nthey failed in the early stages of the crisis to consider the ways in \nwhich the deliberate weaponization of anthrax, with a substance such as \nsilica, might alter the level of exposure required for lethality. \nConsequently, two Postal Service workers died.\n  They are not to be criticized. They are scientists, after all, not \ncriminal investigators. However, had bioterrorism specialists with \ntraining in both medicine and criminal behavior been on the case last \nfall, their unique expertise might have led to conclusions that in the \nhands of decisionmakers might have made a difference in recommendations \nand courses of action.\n  In academia, there is a growing recognition that the study of \nbioterrorism, though it shares much with the fields of public health \nand counterterrorism, is a distinct discipline. To cite just a few \nleading examples in the world of academia, Mr. President, Johns Hopkins \nUniversity has established the Center for Civilian Biodefense \nStrategies; St. Louis University's School of Public Health has a Center \nfor the Study of Bioterrorism; and the University of Texas medical \nbranch has established a Center for Biodefense.\n  This bill will create in the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response \nDivision of the CDC a career track for the bioterrorism specialist, a \nplace for graduates of programs such as these to put to use their \nunique expertise in the service of their country.\n  The chart behind me describes the organization of the \ncounterbioterrorism efforts of the Federal Government with the \nestablishment of the Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Division \nand a Department of Homeland Security, as under the bill we are \nconsidering.\n  The second part of my plan for improving our bioterrorism defenses is\n\n[[Page S8192]]\n\ncontained in an amendment also adopted by the committee in the July \nmarkup that mandates that law enforcement, homeland security, and \npublic health personnel keep each other fully and currently informed in \nthe event of a bioterrorist attack.\n  One of the objectives of a Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response \nDivision of the CDC is to coordinate, cooperate, and communicate with \nother elements of the Federal Government that are involved in a \nbiological attack on this country--Department of Homeland Security, law \nenforcement, Department of Justice, FBI, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, and State and local public health entities, all of \nwhich are in this boat together, Mr. President.\n  It was too frequently the case last fall that the different agencies \nwith a role in the Federal response failed to communicate and \ncoordinate with one another often or adequately enough. The requirement \nof full disclosure that will help put an end to that is upon us, but a \nsignificant part of the same problem relates to confusion in current \nlaw. Executive branch documents delineating the roles of law \nenforcement and public health agencies vis-a-vis one another say one \nthing while Federal statutes, most notably section 319 of the Public \nHealth Service Act, say another.\n  In an effort to address this inconsistency, this legislation we are \nconsidering includes my amendment to direct the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to develop a Federal response plan that accords fully with the \nstatutory authorities granted to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices under the Public Health Service Act.\n  By so doing, this bill will mitigate in future crises a good bit of \nthe confusion that prevailed last time. As we debate this legislation, \nI will offer an additional amendment to provide further clarity with \nrespect to the roles of public health, law enforcement, and homeland \nsecurity in the event of a bioterrorist attack. This amendment will \nprovide the Secretary of Health and Human Services with the authority \nand flexibility he needs to carry out the responsibilities of the \npublic health sector in the Federal response to bioterrorism.\n  Specifically, the amendment provides that no Federal agency may \nsupersede the authority of the public health agencies to respond to a \npublic health emergency in whatever manner is appropriate and \nnecessary.\n  Last fall, public health authorities were at times muzzled, \noverridden, and generally kept out of the loop by law enforcement \nagencies. Each was doing its own thing, so to speak. Therein lies the \nproblem. The problem arises because public health and law enforcement \nagencies both have essential roles to play in the event of an attack of \nterrorism that is also a threat to the public health. These roles are \ndistinct but sometimes overlap. While both are vital, in the event of a \nterrorist-caused public health emergency, the unique life-and-death \nramifications of such an attack mandate, in my view, that public health \nexperts take the lead role in investigating and treating the attack. \nThe amendment I will offer would give public health officials the \nauthority and flexibility they need to do just that.\n  The third point of my bioterrorism response plan calls for providing \nthe public health agencies that will play the central role in preparing \nfor and responding to bioterrorism with the resources they need to do \nthe job. We have to put our money where our mouth is--in this case, our \nmoney where our mission is, and our mission is to defend this Nation.\n  I commend the administration for proposing an unprecedented $4.3 \nbillion for HHS's bioterrorism initiative in the next fiscal year, a \n45-percent increase over the current year's funding level. These funds \nare badly needed. However, within this considerable request there is \nsignificant oversight. The administration has proposed actually a \nreduction in funds for revitalizing and securing the CDC's dilapidated, \nWorld War II-era facilities in Atlanta by $186 million in the next \nfiscal year, a Draconian cut of nearly two-thirds. That does not \ncomport with putting our money where our mission is of defending this \nNation.\n  As the chart behind me demonstrates, since fiscal year 2000 when \nCongress first got on board with the CDC's master plan, the \nrevitalization of its ramshackle facilities, the budget for building \nfacilities and security has steadily increased each year. I have been \nproud to be part of this increase. This increase accompanied a \nrecognition on the part of Congress, especially the Senate, and made \nmore acute in the aftermath of the anthrax crisis, that if the CDC is \nable to protect us all against the new, more insidious threats to the \npublic health we now face, the agency must be equipped with adequate \nmodern facilities and its labs must be fortified against potential \nterrorist designs.\n  The needed funds will not, of course, be appropriated through the \nlegislation we are considering today, but I urge my colleagues to keep \nin mind, when the Labor-HHS appropriations bill reaches the floor, that \nthe steps we are taking to combat bioterrorism in this legislation will \nrequire an adequate commitment of resources if they are to be \neffective.\n  In summary, the public health-related provisions of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee bill that were added during the markup of this bill \nare, in my view, perfectly aligned with the administration's approach \nand goals. While they are not contained in the administration's \noriginal proposal, they are really extensions on concepts contained \ntherein.\n  On a separate but related matter, however, I must respectfully \ndisagree with the approach contained in both the committee's and the \nadministration's proposals. The legislation before us would transfer \nthe strategic national stockpile--that is the vaccines that are \nstrategically placed around America in secret locations known as the \nstrategic national stockpile--from the CDC, where it has been \nsuccessfully operated since its creation in 1999, to the Department of \nHomeland Security. I have serious reservations about the proposed \ntransfer. Accordingly, I am continuing to work on a bipartisan basis \nwith the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Chairman \nLieberman, the administration, and others, on an attempt to preserve \nthe role of the CDC in the operation of the stockpile.\n  The stockpile is collectively 12 secret stashes of vaccines, \nmedicines, and other medical supplies placed in strategic locations \naround the country, deliverable in a few short hours to any location in \nthe country should the need for massive quantities of emergency \nmedicines arise. Decisions related to deploying the medicines in the \nstockpile, what medicines to administer, who should receive medicines, \nwhat medicines should be in the stockpile, are essentially medical \nquestions. They should, as such, be made by public medical \nprofessionals based on public health considerations. This is the \nreason, in point of fact, that the stockpile was assigned to the CDC in \nthe first place.\n\n  The committee's bill would transfer final authority over the \nstockpile to the new department while leaving some operational \nresponsibility with the CDC. I am afraid we are borrowing from Peter to \npay Paul. Leaving aside the problems inherently associated with \nseparating operational responsibility from accountability, this \napproach, while retaining some stockpile functions with the CDC, would \nundermine the most important reason to have the CDC involved at all; \nthat is, to bring to bear the necessary expertise in making final \ndecisions regarding the use of the stockpile.\n  If there were a core public health competency in the new department \nthat could supervise the stockpile, then the reasons cited by the \nproponents of the transfer--primarily a desire to consolidate all \nemergency response functions in the new department--might be sufficient \nto justify the move. However, the public health expertise of the \nFederal Government was, by and large--correctly, in my view--left where \nit currently resides because of the important synergies, the command, \ncontrol, cooperation, and communication, that would be lost if certain \npublic health professionals were to be segregated from their colleagues \nin other public health sectors.\n\n[[Page S8193]]\n\n  There is, consequently, no core public health competency in the new \ndepartment. There is no assistant secretary for health, as some have \nproposed.\n  An interest in the effective administration of the stockpile demands \nthen that it remain in the hands of those who do have public health \nexpertise. The CDC has handled the stockpile effectively to date, \ncoordinating smoothly its deployment on September 11 and during the \nanthrax crisis with FEMA and other emergency responders.\n  We should follow the old dictum that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. \nWhatever the Senate's final decision on this matter, however, let me \nreiterate I am fully on board with the President and his team on \nhomeland security. We are all in the same boat. We cannot, we will not, \nstand by idly while those who hate us plot our demise. The fundamental \nreorganization of our homeland security apparatus is the surest step we \ncan take now to gird ourselves for the threats to come. With sober \nunderstanding of the moment of the task now at hand, let us complete \nthis good work.\n  Above the pyramid on the Great Seal of the United States, in \nreference to the founding of our Nation, it says, in Latin, ``God has \nfavored our undertaking.'' May He grant us now His favor again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the matter before the Senate is \nthe Smith amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4492 to Amendment No. 4471\n\n (Purpose: To amend title 49, United States Code to improve flight and \n                 cabin security on passenger aircraft)\n\n  Mr. REID. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of Senators Boxer \nand Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Smith of New \n     Hampshire, for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Burns, \n     Mr. Bunning, and Mr. Miller, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4492 to amendment No. 4471.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Georgia leaves--and I \nknow the Senator from Vermont wishes to speak--I want to emphasize how \nimportant the Centers for Disease Control are to this country and to \nthe world. I have traveled with the Senator from Georgia to the Centers \nfor Disease Control and seen some of those old, dilapidated buildings, \nsome of them built prior to World War II.\n  We should allow the Centers for Disease Control to have a space where \nthey can work with some degree of quality. They are spread out all over \nthe campus, and they need to be brought into one central location. That \nis what is being attempted.\n  I say to my friend, this entity was established many years ago to \nfight malaria in the southern part of the United States. After we \nwhipped malaria, they had such a presence that we used them for a \npublic health entity in this country. They have done remarkable work, \nand not only in America. I had the pleasure of traveling and \nrepresenting this country on the continent of Africa during the August \nbreak. The Centers for Disease Control has spread throughout that \ncontinent. It is money that the taxpayers should be proud is being \nspent. Each day that goes by, because of the Centers for Disease \nControl, lives are being saved from mosquito-related problems and, of \ncourse, AIDS.\n  The Senator from Georgia has a tremendous responsibility to convey to \nthe rest of the Senate the importance of the Centers for Disease \nControl and make sure they have adequate resources to do the job that \nis necessary to be done, especially post-September 11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns \nabout a central component of the proposed Department of Homeland \nSecurity--the inclusion of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in \nthe new department.\n  I understand that in the wake of the horrific events of September 11, \nwe would look for ways to strengthen our Nation's defense to prevent \nany future catastrophe. I fully support that goal. But we must be \ncautious, very cautious, to make sure that we work to correct what went \nwrong and not interfere with what went right.\n  We know what went wrong, and I firmly hope that we, as a nation, will \ndevelop a comprehensive plan to address the shortcomings in our \nintelligence gathering and communication efforts. That, I believe, \nshould be the prime goal of any new homeland defense effort.\n  What went right after September 11 was the response of the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency. In the days after the September 11 \nterrorist attacks I visited the Pentagon and World Trade Center. I saw \nfirsthand how well FEMA responded to a horrific scene that all of the \ndisaster drills and training exercises could not have prepared anyone \nfor. I was incredibly impressed by what I saw. Thousands of workers \nfrom around the country came together to bring calm and order to an \notherwise chaotic situation.\n  Of nearly 400 disasters that FEMA has responded to since the Oklahoma \nCity bombing in 1995, only the attacks on the World Trade Center and \nthe Pentagon were acts of terrorism. Through the coordination of FEMA's \ndirector, the agency demonstrated that it was capable of responding in \nsuch cases, and responding well.\n  Yet things have not always gone so smoothly with the Agency. We need \nonly to look back to the 1980s, when FEMA's focus shifted to civil \ndefense and left the Agency ill-prepared to respond to natural \ndisasters. In 1985, after a tornado killed 65 people in Pennsylvania, \nFEMA's poor response prompted then-Congressman Tom Ridge to play a \ncentral role in efforts to refocus the Agency's mission on victims of \nnatural disasters.\n  But it took time. After seeing the bungled responses to Hurricane \nHugo in 1989 and Hurricane Andrew in 1992, my friend from South \nCarolina, Senator Hollings summed up FEMA's performance by saying, ``A \nmajor hurricane is not one disaster, but two: The natural disaster of \nthe hurricane itself, and the unnatural disaster of Federal efforts to \naid the victims.''\n  Over the last decade, with help from Congress and new leadership, \nFEMA has worked hard to regain the trust of its constituents, \nespecially those Americans affected by a major disaster. Now we must \nmaintain FEMA's independence to ensure that an increased emphasis on \nterrorism will be in addition to, and not at the expense of, the \nAgency's natural hazard programs.\n  As it now stands, FEMA is a small, flexible agency with a director \nreporting directly to the President. This chain of command works well, \nbut it would be lost if FEMA were moved into the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Adding another layer of bureaucracy to the disaster \ndeclaration process can only slow vital response and recovery efforts.\n  Again, I firmly believe that it is critical to prepare America to \nrespond to terrorist acts, but we must not lose sight of the fact that \nFEMA's primary focus is to respond to nature's fury. We know that \nfires, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes will continue to \ncause injuries, deaths, and property damage every year.\n  Jeopardizing FEMA's abilities to deal with disasters is not the best \nway to secure our homeland.\n  As we move forward, we should be thoughtful and deliberate, and we \nshould focus on fixing the failures and not tinkering with the \nsuccesses.\n  Accordingly, at the appropriate time I will offer an amendment to \nremove the Federal Emergency Management Agency from the Department of \nHomeland Security. Preserving FEMA's independence is the best way to \nprepare our nation to respond to natural disasters and any future \nterrorist attacks we may face.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8194]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords).

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an American \nhero, Tom Burnett, Jr., who was a beloved husband and father and adored \nson and a very able business leader. He was a person who would not and \ndid not sit quietly as terrorists carried out their plan last year on \nSeptember 11.\n  Along with my colleague, Senator Dayton, and with our colleague Jim \nRamstad on the House side, we introduced legislation to designate a \nU.S. Postal Service facility in Bloomington, MN, as the Thomas E. \nBurnett, Jr. Post Office Building.\n  This legislation today is passing the House, and my expectation is \nthat by the end of the day this will also pass the Senate. I don't know \nthat there would ever be any Senator would disagree with this.\n  Tom Burnett, Jr. grew up in Bloomington, MN, and he was aboard flight \n93 on September 11 of last year. America owes Tom Burnett a deep debt \nof gratitude for his bravery on that day. It is possible that Members \nof the Congress, including myself, could very well owe him our own \nlives. We will never know for sure.\n  Tom is believed by investigators to have been among those passengers \nwho kept the hijackers from crashing flight 93 into a national \nlandmark, most likely the White House or the Capitol. That, of course, \nwould have likely resulted in many more deaths than already occurred on \nthat day, and instead, as we all know, flight 93 crashed into a \nPennsylvania field. After listening to a tape from the flight's black \nbox, law enforcement officials have described a desperate struggle \naboard the plane.\n  As FBI Director Mueller said after being briefed on the contents of \nthe tape:\n\n       We believe that those passengers were absolute heroes, and \n     their actions during this flight were heroic.\n\n  Tom Burnett, Jr. was 38 years old when he died. A 1986 graduate of \nCarlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota and a \nmember of the Apha Cappa Psi Fraternity, he had shown selfless \nleadership before. When he was quarterback of Thomas Jefferson High \nSchool in Bloomington, Tom's inspired play led his team to a conference \nchampionship game in 1990. He was a successful business leader as chief \noperating officer for a medical device manufacturer in California.\n  We will never forget his ultimate sacrifice and the ultimate \nsacrifice of many other heroes as well on September 11. Our thoughts \nand prayers today are with Tom's family: His wife Deena, and their \ndaughters, Madison, Halley, and Anna-Clair, three little daughters; his \nparents, Thomas, Sr. and Beverly--I had a chance to talk to Bev just \nthe other day--and his sisters, Martha O'Brien and Mary Margaret \nBurnett.\n  Bloomington will be very proud to have this post office named for Tom \nBurnett, Jr. We are all very proud of this son of Minnesota.\n  Again, I thank Congressman Ramstad for his leadership in the House. I \nknow this bill is going to pass the House today, and my expectation is \nthat it will pass the Senate as well.\n  I thank again Senator Lieberman for his help in expediting this and \nmaking this happen. I know for a fact this is really very important to \nTom's family and to all of Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8194-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONFIRMATION OF TERRENCE F. McVERRY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to express my \nstrong approval of the Senate's confirmation of Mr. Terrence F. McVerry \nwho President Bush nominated for the United States District Court for \nthe Western District of Pennsylvania. The American Bar Association has \nrated Mr. McVerry ``unanimously well-qualified'' to sit on the bench.\n  Mr. McVerry received his B.A. degree from Duquesne University in 1962 \nand his J.D. from Duquesne University School of Law in 1968. After \nfinishing law school, Mr. McVerry started his legal career in the \nAllegheny County District Attorney's Office. He prosecuted hundreds of \nbench and jury trials with a concentration on major felonies and \nhomicides. After serving in the District Attorney's Office, he and two \ncolleagues formed their own private practice. He went on to serve as a \npartner in several other prestigious Pittsburgh firms.\n  Mr. McVerry has also served as a member of Pennsylvania House of \nRepresentatives and as a member of the Pennsylvania Commission on \nSentencing. He served his country by joining the United States Army \nReserve and the Pennsylvania Air National Guard. Former Pennsylvania \nGovernor Tom Ridge nominated him to fill a judicial vacancy on the \nCourt of Common Pleas to Allegheny County.\n  Currently, he serves as a Soldier for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, \nwhere he is the chief legal officer and director of a governmental law \ndepartment comprised of 36 attorneys. In this capacity, he is \nresponsible for the representation of all branches and departments of a \ncounty government that has approximately 7,000 employees and \nresponsible for nearly 1.3 million inhabitants.\n  Pennsylvania is fortunate to have an extremely well-qualified nominee \nlike Mr. McVerry. This success is due to the bipartisan nominating \ncommission which Senator Santorum and I have established. This \ncommission reviews all federal judicial candidates and recommends \nindividuals to Senator Santorum and myself. We then recommend these \nindividuals to the President.\n  I thank my colleagues for their confirmation of Mr. Terrence McVerry \nto sit on the United States District Court for the Western District of \nPennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8194-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8194-S8195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          H.R. 3009, THE ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE EXPANSION ACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to join me \nin opposition to the motion before us, on passage of the conference \nreport on H.R. 3009, the Andean Trade Preference Expansion Act. During \nthe Senate's consideration of this act, the bill's managers stripped \nH.R. 3009 of the language approved by the House and offered a \nsubstitute amendment comprising three measures reported by the Finance \nCommittee. The first, H.R. 3009, is indeed the Andean Trade Preference \nExpansion Act. But the amendment added as well two other major trade-\nrelated bills. The second measure, H.R. 3005, would grant the President \nfast-track authority for certain proposed trade negotiations, and also, \nretroactively, for other negotiations already underway. And the third, \nS. 1209, would reauthorize the Trade Adjustment Assistance and NAFTA \nTransitional Adjustment Assistance programs. H.R. 3009 thereby became a \nlegislative vehicle for linking together three independent measures, \nall trade-related to be sure but each with its own focus and \nprovisions.\n  Let me say first that I am troubled by this procedural maneuvering. \nThe three measures, each with far-reaching and very different \nramifications, were considered independently of one another in \ncommittee. In my view they should have been considered separately on \nthe floor of the Senate; each should have been amended and voted up or \ndown on its own merits. Linked together, each measure became a hostage \nto the other two, a procedure which in my view ill served the American \npeople.\n  I am particularly concerned by the linking of trade promotion \nauthority with trade adjustment assistance. TAA addresses specific \nproblems which Congress has defined. In contrast, trade promotion \nauthority is very broad, potentially reaching into areas we cannot even \nidentify. In fact the term is a euphemism. What we have before us is \nthe procedure known more precisely and accurately as ``fast-track,'' a \nprocedure that radically redefines and limits the authority granted to \nCongress in article II, section 8 of the Constitution ``to regulate \ncommerce with foreign nations.''\n  It is easily forgotten that ``fast-track'' is a relatively new \ninnovation\n\n[[Page S8195]]\n\nwhose long-term consequences are as yet little understood. It dates \nback only to the Trade Act of 1974, and it lapsed in 1994. It differs \nfundamentally from the ``Proclamation Authority'' that Congress granted \nthe President in the Reciprocal Trade Act of 1934, which gave the \nExecutive power to set tariffs within limits and periods of time set by \nthe Congress. Proclamation Authority did not grant to the President \nauthority to negotiate trade agreements requiring changes in U.S. law, \nlet alone limit the discretion of Congress to approve or reject such \nchanges. In contrast, fast track authority does both. It greatly \nexpands the latitude of the Executive to negotiate an agreement, while \nsharply restricting the latitude of the Congress to consider any \nimplementing legislation that results from the negotiation. Fast track \nguarantees that the executive branch can write legislation implementing \na trade agreement and have that legislation voted on, up or down, 90 \ndays after it is submitted, with only 20 hours of debate and no \nopportunity for amendment. While vast change in U.S. law may be at \nstake, under fast-track procedures Congress becomes little more than a \nrubber stamp.\n  In no other area of U.S. international negotiation and agreement are \narguments for fast track made. All major U.S. tax, arms control, \nterritorial, defense and other treaties are still accomplished through \nestablished constitutional procedures, fully respecting the role of the \nCongress.\n  Proponents of fast track often argue that in the area of trade, \nhowever, the Executive will find it difficult if not impossible to \nnegotiate agreements. This is certainly not the case. Fast-track \nprocedures are relevant only to trade agreements that require Congress \nto make changes in existing U.S. law in order for the agreements to be \nimplemented. Most trade agreements do not require legislative changes \nand are thus not subject to fast track consideration. Of the hundreds \nof agreements entered into between 1974-1994, when fast-track authority \nwas in effect, only five have required fast track procedures: the GATT \nTokyo Round of 1979, the United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement of \n1985, the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement of 1988; the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, of 1993, and the GATT Uruguay \nRound of 1994. In 1994, after just twenty years, fast track lapsed, and \nin 1997 the Congress declined to extend it. Yet since 1994 hundreds of \ntrade agreements have been successfully negotiated and implemented.\n  For example, in 2000 the office of the Trade Representative \nidentified the following agreements, negotiated without fast track, as \nhaving ``truly historic importance'': The Information Technology, IT, \nAgreement, under which 40 countries eliminated import duties and other \ncharges on IT products representing more than 90 percent of the \ntelecommunications market; the Financial Services Agreement, which has \nhelped U.S. service suppliers expand commercial operations and find new \nmarket opportunities around the world; the Basic Telecommunications \nAgreement, which opened up 95 percent of the world telecommunications \nmarket to competition; and the Bilateral agreement on China's WTO \naccession, which opened the largest economy in the world to American \nproducts and services.\n\n  I could cite many other examples. During this period the Executive \nnegotiated and then obtained Congressional approval of normalization of \nour trade relations with China, a new Caribbean Basin initiative bill, \nand the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act. Without any fast-track \nauthority the previous administration negotiated major bilateral trade \nagreements with Jordan and Vietnam. The ground-breaking United States-\nJordan agreement was submitted to and approved by Congress in January \nof last year. And although negotiated by the previous administration, \nthe United States-Vietnam agreement was actually submitted to Congress \nby the current administration. It was approved in June of last year.\n  Furthermore, in the absence of fast-track authority the current \nadministration has found it possible and prudent to carry forward the \nnegotiations for bilateral free trade agreements with Chile and \nSingapore which were initiated by its predecessor. The case of Chile is \nparticularly instructive. In 1994 Chile declined an invitation to join \nNAFTA, citing the Administration's failure to obtain fast track \nauthority. Six years later, however, Chile reconsidered its position \nand in 2000 entered into negotiations on a United States-Chile \nbilateral agreement. Negotiations since then have continued more or \nless on a monthly basis, and in a report dated April 1, 2002 and titled \n``Chile: Political and Economic Conditions and U.S. Relations'', the \nCongressional Research Service concluded that ``Chile's trade policies \nand practices indicate that it is willing and able to conclude and live \nup to a broad bilateral FTA with the U.S., suggesting that this could \nbe a comparatively easy trade agreement for the U.S. to conclude.''\n  In 1997, I opposed the previous administration's request. It was my \nview then, as it is my view now, that the arguments for fast track have \nbeen vastly overstated--they simply ignore our continuing success in \nconcluding agreements that open foreign markets to U.S. exporters and \nbenefit U.S. consumers. Chile and Singapore offer a case in point. The \nabsence of fast track has not prevented negotiations with either, yet \nthis legislation would apply the procedure retroactively. It is not \nclear why this should be necessary.\n  Additionally, I want to remind my colleagues that in December of last \nyear our colleagues in the House of Representatives approved H.R. 3005 \nby a single vote, 215-214. Writing in the Washington Post, David Broder \ncalled this a ``shaky victory on trade.'' He observed about that \n``longtime supporters of liberal trade'' voted against fast track \nbecause ``trade agreements now go far beyond tariff reduction and \ninvolve tradeoffs on intellectual property rights, environmental \nstandards, basic labor laws and other issues''--issues too important, \nin Broder's words, ``to delegate sweeping authority to any \nadministration to negotiate them away.'' These are the concerns, he \nwrote, of ``people who are by no means protectionists.''\n  Indeed, these are the concerns of the American people, and it is for \nthis reason that trade agreements affecting vital areas of social and \neconomic policy should not be hurried through Congress using an \nexpedited and restrictive procedure.\n  Finally, not only do I disapprove of this measure as passed by the \nSenate, but I am deeply troubled by two very significant changes made \nto the legislation in conference. Whereas the Senate bill provided that \nemployees whose factories move overseas would automatically qualify for \nhealth insurance, job training, and unemployment benefits, under the \ncompromise, only workers whose companies relocate to countries that \nhave a preferential trade agreement with the U.S. would be covered. \nOther workers would have to undergo a qualifying procedure through \nwhich the USTR must determine that the move was linked to trade. \nAdditionally, during the Senate's consideration of the trade bill, \nSenators Dayton and Craig offered an amendment to the fast-track bill \nto allow Congress to consider provisions within trade agreements that \nweaken U.S. trade remedy laws. The amendment had the support of 61 \nSenators and was adopted by voice vote. Following passage of the trade \nbill, I joined many of my colleagues in urging the conferees to \npreserve the Dayton-Craig language. Under the compromise reached, \nhowever, this language was removed from the bill and replaced by non-\nbinding language allowing members to simply express their objections to \na particular trade provision. And as my colleagues are aware, over the \nweekend, our colleagues in the House approved the package that emerged \nfrom the conference by a margin of 215-212, a margin greater than that \nof last year's House vote by only two. It seems clear that the \ncompromise before us is not a consensus on trade and I would urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the conference report to H.R. 3009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8195-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8195-S8196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent\n\n[[Page S8196]]\n\nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 29, 2000 \nin Mahwah, NJ.

The assailant confronted the two partygoers in the \napartment parking lot, made obscene remarks about their sexual \norientation, and then punched and kicked them. One of the victims had \nto be treated at a local hospital.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8196-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE ELEVENTH OF SEPTEMBER\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nshare with the Senate the memory of one of my constituents, Captain \nCharles F. Burlingame, III, who lost his life on September 11, 2001. \nCaptain Burlingame was 51 years old when the flight he was piloting, \nAmerican Airlines Flight 77, was overtaken and hijacked by terrorists. \nAs we all know, that plane crashed into the Pentagon, killing everyone \non board.\n  Charles Burlingame was known as ``Chic'' his entire life by family \nand friends. He was born in St. Paul, MN, and grew up in Anaheim, CA. \nChic was an Eagle Scout and played trumpet in his high school marching \nband. After graduating from Anaheim High School in 1967, President \nLyndon Johnson appointed him to the United States Naval Academy in \nAnnapolis, MD.\n  He continued developing his musical talents and played bugle in the \nNaval Academy Drum and Bugle Corps. After graduating from the Naval \nAcademy in 1971, he attended Naval air training at Pensacola, FL and \nthen enrolled at the advanced tactical school at Meridian, MS, and \nCorpus Christi, TX. He flew F-4 Phantom jets as a carrier-based pilot \naboard the U.S.S. Saratoga.\n  In 1979 Captain Burlingame was honorably discharged from active duty \nand became a member of the Naval Reserves. During the Gulf War he \nserved at the Pentagon under the Assistant Secretary of Defense and was \nawarded the Defense Superior Service Medal. Later, as a pilot for \nAmerican Airlines he flew domestic and international flights.\n  At his eulogy, Navy Vice-Admiral Timothy Keating described Captain \nBurlingame as ``a gifted aviator who could make jets talk.'' Senator \nGeorge Allen of Virginia eulogized him as a man who ``gave his last \nbreath in a struggle against terrorism. He was a true American patriot \nwho paid the ultimate sacrifice as one of our Nation's first warriors \nto perish in the war on terrorism.'' Perhaps Chic Burlingame's attitude \ntoward life is best summed up by a statement he wrote in a classmate's \nhigh school yearbook when Chic was about to graduate, ``Remember, \ndesire and hard work equal victory!'' Chic believed that one person \nreally can make a difference.\n  Captain Burlingame is survived by his wife, Sheri G. Harris \nBurlingame, his daughter, Wendy D. Pattavina, his grandson, Jack \nPattavina, step-sons John Harris and Chad Harris, brothers Mark M. \nBurlingame and Bradley M. Burlingame and sister Debra A.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nshare with the Senate the memory of one of my constituents, Lauren \nGrandcolas, of San Rafael, CA, who lost her life on September 11, 2001. \nMrs. Grandcolas was a 38-year-old advertising sales consultant when the \nflight she was on, United Airlines Flight 93, was hijacked by \nterrorists. As we all know, that plane crashed in a Pennsylvania field, \nkilling everyone on board.\n  Mrs. Grandcolas was born in Bloomington, IN and attended the \nUniversity of Texas at Austin, where she met her husband, Jack \nGrandcolas. After graduation, she worked as a Marketing Director for a \nlaw firm and then for Price, Waterhouse, Coopers. At the time of her \ntragic death, Mrs. Grandcolas was working as an advertising sales \nconsultant at Good Housekeeping Magazine and was researching and \nwriting a non-fiction book to help women boost their self-esteem.\n  Lauren had enthusiasm and passion for life, loved the outdoors and \nwas devoted to physical fitness. She hiked, jogged, kayaked, and \nenjoyed in-line skating around her neighborhood. Her energy was \nboundless and she took classes in cooking, gardening, scuba-diving and \nwine appreciation. Lauren was also active with United Way, March of \nDimes, Project Open Hand, Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Breast Cancer \nAwareness and Glide Memorial.\n  Her husband Jack recalls she had a heart the size of Texas. Knowing \nher flight had been hijacked, Lauren left her husband a message on \ntheir home answering machine and then loaned her cell phone to another \npassenger to call loved ones.\n  The joy Lauren felt pursuing new interests and developing new skills \nwas being interwoven in the book she was writing for women.

Mr. President, as you may know, I introduced \nlegislation (S. Res. 316) on August 1, 2002, designating the year \nbeginning February 1, 2003, as the ``Year of the Blues'' and requesting \nthat the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S8197]]\n\nStates to observe the ``Year of the Blues'' with appropriate \nceremonies, activities, and educational programs. I am proud to be \njoined by Senators Cochran, Thompson, and Frist.\n  It has been said that ``Blues is more than music; Blues is culture. \nBlues is America.'' As a native of Helena, Arkansas, I could not agree \nmore. Growing up in the Delta, I often listened to the blues during the \nfamous ``King Biscuit Time'' show on my hometown station, KFFA radio. \nThe songs I heard often told stories of both celebration and triumph, \nas well as sorrow and struggle.\n  Although its roots are in the tradition of the primitive songs of the \nold Southern sharecroppers, the blues has left an important cultural \nlegacy in our country and has documented African-American history in \nthe last century. As the blues began to transform in style and content \nthroughout the twentieth century, its evolution paralleled the \nmigration of American life from a rural, agricultural society to an \nurban industrialized nation. The blues has also left an indelible \nimpression on other forms of music with its influence heard in jazz, \nrock and roll, rhythm and blues, country, and even classical music. \nDespite these facts, though, many young people today do not understand \nthe rich heritage of the blues or recognize its impact on our nation \nand our world.\n  That is why I am delighted to introduce this resolution and \nparticipate in the Year of the Blues project. Coordinated by The Blues \nFoundation and Experience Music Project, The Year of the Blues is a \nmulti-faceted entertainment, education, and outreach program recently \nformed to both celebrate and create greater awareness for the blues and \nits place in the history and evolution of music and culture, both in \nthe United States and around the world. The program is anchored by high \nprofile events, and beginning next year, it will feature a wide array \nof participants, projects, and components designed to reach a large \naudience, as well as support blues oriented education and outreach \nprograms, such as Blues in the Schools.\n  This project also takes on a special meaning for me because I am a \n``daughter of the Delta,'' and my hometown of Helena has played a large \nrole in the development of the blues. Today, Helena serves as a \ntemporary blues Mecca each October when the three day King Biscuit \nBlues Festival takes place. And as I noted earlier, it is also the site \nof one of the longest running daily music shows, ``King Biscuit Time,'' \nwhich continues to air every weekday at 12:15 pm on KFFA radio from the \nDelta Cultural Center Visitors' Center. As long as I can remember, \n``King Biscuit Time'' originally featured famous harmonica player Sonny \nBoy Williamson, guitarist Robert Junior Lockwood, and the King Biscuit \nEntertainers. When recently noting the uniqueness of the show, long-\ntime host ``Sunshine'' Sonny Payne recalled that many of the songs \nplayed on ``King Biscuit Time'' originated during the live broadcasts, \nand in some cases, words to the songs were known to change day to day. \nAfter becoming involved with this project, I recently came across an \narticle ``Pass the biscuits, cause it's King Biscuit Time . . . '' \nwritten by freelance writer Lex Gillespie. I believe this article \nprovides an accurate account of the development of blues in the South.\n  I will ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record following my \nstatement.\n  So as you can see, Mr. President, the blues has been an important \npart of my life and the life of many others. It's a style of music that \nis, in its essence, truly American. But as we move into a new century \nand embrace new forms and styles of music, we must not allow today's \nyouth to forget the legacy of our past. By teaching the blues, \npromoting the blues, and celebrating the blues, we can ensure that the \nrich culture and heritage of our forefathers will always live on. I \nurge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent that the Gillespie article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        ``Pass the Biscuits, `Cause It's King Biscuit Time...''\n\n                           (By Lex Gillespie)\n\n       Ever since it hit the airwaves one lunchtime fifty-six \n     years ago this November, ``King Biscuit Time'' has profoundly \n     influenced the development and popularity of the blues. As \n     the oldest and longest-running blues program on the radio, it \n     helped promote the careers of bluesmen who pioneered this \n     musical style and later brought it from street corners and \n     juke joints in the South to an international audience. And \n     today, KFFA and Helena are even ``must see'' stops for \n     Japanese and European tourists who want to learn about the \n     cultural roots of the blues.\n       ``First things first,'' recalls Sonny ``Sunshine'' Payne, \n     the program's host for over eleven thousand broadcasts; King \n     Biscuit Time started when guitarist Robert Junior Lockwood \n     and harmonica player Sonny Boy Williamson were told they \n     would have to get a sponsor to get on the air.'' That was \n     1941, when Payne was a teenager cleaning 78 rpm's and running \n     errands at KFFA. ``They came to the station one day and I \n     showed them in to station manager Sam Anderson . . . he sent \n     them over to the Interstate Grocery Company and its owner Max \n     Moore who had a flour called ``King Biscuit Flour . . .''\n       Lockwood and Williamson became the show's original King \n     Biscuit Entertainers who advertised flour and corn mean in \n     Helena and the surrounding Delta region; and after a lucky \n     break, Sonny Payne took over as program host when the \n     announcer lost his script while on the air. The program was a \n     smash hit, thanks mostly to the playing and on-air presence \n     of harp player Williamson. He became so popular that the \n     sponsor named its product ``Sonny Boy Corn Meal'' and he was, \n     and still is, pictured, smiling and with his harmonica, on a \n     burlap sack of his own brand of meal.\n       Williamson was a musical pioneer in his own right. He was \n     one of the first to make the harmonica the centerpiece in a \n     blues band. His unique phrasings, compared by many to the \n     human voice, influenced countless harp players.\n       His partner, Robert Junior Lockwood, stepson of the \n     legendary Robert Johnson, also influenced this blues style. A \n     fan of big band jazz, he incorporated jazzier elements into \n     the blues, often playing the guitar with his fingers.\n       As years passed, the due expanded into a full band, \n     including piano player ``Pine Top'' Perkins, Houston \n     Stackhouse an ``Peck'' Curtis, and musicians who played on \n     the show also advertised local appearances that gave them \n     more work.\n       With the success of ``King Biscuit Time,'' Helena soon \n     became a center for the blues. It was a key stopping off \n     point for black musicians on the trip north to the barrooms \n     and clubs of Chicago's South and West sides. Already, in the \n     thirties, the town had seen the likes of pianist Memphis Slim \n     and Helena native Roosevelt Sykes, as well as guitarists \n     Howlin' Wolf, Honeyboy Edwards, and Elmore James. And when \n     the program went on the air, it helped shape the early \n     careers of many an aspiring musician. ``Little Walter'' \n     Jacobs and Jimmy Rogers, who later played with Muddy Waters, \n     came to live and learn in Helena in the mid-1940's. Muddy \n     Waters also brought his band to Helena to play on KFFA and in \n     bars in the area. Teenager Ike Turner first heard the blues \n     on KFFA around that time, and King Biscuit pianist ``Pine \n     Top'' Perkins gave him lessons in his trademark boogie woogie \n     style.\n       The program also influenced other stations to put the blues \n     on the radio. Its initial popularity convinced advertisers \n     that the blues and commercial potential. `It was a major \n     breakthrough,'' explains folklorist Bill Ferris, director of \n     the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at Ole Miss; \n     ``King Biscuit Time was a discovery of an audience and a \n     market...that hitherto radio had not really understood.'' \n     Across the Mississippi River from Helena, radio station WROX \n     put the South's first black deejay, Early Wright, on the air \n     spinning blues and gospel records in 1947. Upriver in \n     Memphis, station WDIA the next year became the first southern \n     station with an all-black staff, including a young musician \n     named Riley ``B.B.'' King, who got an early break as a \n     deejay. And in Nashville in the late forties, station WLAC \n     reached nearly half the country with its late-night blues and \n     R shows. All of these programs and stations owe an enormous \n     debt to ``King Biscuit Time.''\n       And today, the legacy of the show continues, with blues \n     programs heard on radio stations across the U.S., the \n     recording of the many ``King Biscuit Entertainers,'' and the \n     yearly King Biscuit festival in Helena celebrating the city's \n     cultural heritage and significant role in developing and \n     promoting the blues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8197-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8197-S8198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     CONGRATULATING GLAXOSMITHKLINE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

Last month, the pharmaceutical \ncompany produced the one hundred-millionth tablet of its drug \nalbendazole for donation to LF patients, marking a significant step \ntoward eradicating this devastating disease.\n\n[[Page S8198]]\n\n  Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a disabling \nand disfiguring tropical disease caused by thread-like worms that live \nin the human lymphatic system. It mainly affects people in the tropical \nand sub-tropical areas of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Approximately \n120 million people are affected by LF, with more than one billion \npeople at risk of infection.\n  In 1998, GlaxoSmithKline and the World Health Organization formed the \nGlobal Alliance to Eliminate LF. The goals of the Alliance are to \ninterrupt transmission of LF, country by country, until LF has been \neliminated as a public health problem. GSK supports the Alliance by \ndonating its antiparasitic drug albendazole and by helping with \ninitiatives for coalition-building, planning, training, and \ncommunications.\n  LF is one of the world's leading causes of disability, affecting \npeople in nearly 80 countries. The estimated economic loss through \ndisability, illness, and missed work days is in the billions of dollars \neach year. By breaking the cycle of infection between mosquitoes and \nhumans, the administration of albendazole is an important component of \nsparing the next generation from the deforming manifestations of LF.\n  GlaxoSmithKline maintains its U.S. headquarters in Philadelphia, and \nI am proud to represent the company's 6,000 Pennsylvania employees \nsearching for cures and treatments to improve the lives of citizens \nworldwide.

AAHSA is a national association \nrepresenting mission-driven, not-for-profit health care and senior \nhousing providers.\n  The PCC is truly a unique and special place for disabled children \nthroughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky. In fact, according to the PCC, \nthe center is Kentucky's only center of excellence for children's long-\nterm nursing needs.\n  The PCC has served residents from 81 of the 120 counties in the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky as well as from the neighboring states of \nIndiana, Ohio, and Tennessee.\n  The PCC not only provides patients with medical care, but also offers \ntheir children an array of educational, social, and physical \nopportunities. The staff, ranging from speech therapists to dietitians, \nworks around the clock, 365 days a year to ensure that children's needs \nare tended to on a daily basis. They deserve special recognition for \ntheir hard work, indomitable spirit and pro-active approach to \npediatric health care.\n  I ask that my fellow Senators join me in honoring all involved with \nthe Pediatric Convalescent Center. President Bush named September a \nmonth of Service and the PCC embodies this credo. Special children need \nspecial care. At PCC, special is the only kind of care people \nknow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8198-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING DR.

Lloyd Sr., who passed away on August 27, 2002.\n  As those who knew Dr. Lloyd would attest, his strong commitment to \nthe city of Indianapolis was reflected in his successful and \ndistinguished career. Mr. Sam H. Jones, president of the Indianapolis \nUrban League referred to him as ``a giant among men, not just African-\nAmerican men, but a giant among men, period.'' State Representative \nWilliam Crawford called Dr. Lloyd ``a Renaissance Man who always \nprovided an inspirational voice.'' And U.S. Congresswoman Julia Carson, \nwho knew Dr. Lloyd for nearly 40 years, referred to her dear friend as \n``a man who went around doing so many beautiful and positive things in \nsuch a quiet way.''\n  Dr. Lloyd worked for Methodist Hospital for 25 years, beginning as \ndirector of medical research and retiring as president. During his time \nat Methodist, the hospital became the first non-university hospital in \nthe Nation to offer heart transplants and one of the very few to be \napproved for Jarvik-7 artificial heart implantation. He taught at \nIndiana University, Purdue University, and Howard University in \nWashington, D.C., where he authored several medical textbooks.\n  Without question, Dr. Lloyd was and will always be regarded as one of \nIndianapolis's most influential and dedicated civic leaders. He was the \ncatalyst in various accomplishments, such as the creation of the White \nRiver State Park, the Indiana Sports Corporation and the Indianapolis \nCircle City Classic. His ability to build bridges between corporate \nAmerica and the community were without equal.\n  Dr. Lloyd founded the former Midwest National Bank, where he was the \nChairman of the Board and CEO. He was also the Chairman of the Midwest \nNational Corporation and majority owner for a time of a local \nIndianapolis radio station, WTLC-FM.\n  In addition to his corporate success, Dr. Lloyd served on the boards \nof various civic and charitable organizations, including the Center for \nLegislative Improvement, Indiana Bell Telephone Co., Goodwill \nIndustries Foundation of Central Indiana, Inc., United Way of Greater \nIndianapolis, CTS and the Urban League of Indianapolis.\n  Dr. Lloyd is survived by his children, Shelley Lloyd Hankinson, Dr. \nFrank P.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the outstanding \naccomplishments of the men and women of Air Force Space Command, which \ncelebrates the 20th anniversary of their creation this week. On \nSeptember 1, 1982, the Air Force formally activated Space Command. This \nsingle event would forever change the way the United States fights and \nwins its wars.\n  Space Command originated as an operational command standing shoulder-\nto-shoulder with other Air Force operational commands such as the \nhistoric Strategic Air Command. Although the command was young, the \nvisionary men and women of Space Command quickly stepped up to their \nimmense task. These pioneers looked to the future and recognized the \nvast potential space-based systems could provide our nation.\n   In the two decades since Space Command was created, the Air Force's \nspace programs have come a long way. In 1983, Space Command was given \nthe responsibility for operating the Air Force's world wide network of \nsurveillance and missile warning sensors. Also in the 1980's Space \nCommand was given responsibility for command and control of its first \ntwo satellite constellations, the Defense Meteorological Satellite \nProgram and the Defense Support Program. These satellite programs \ncontinue to be a crucial element of the nation's warfighting \ncapability. The early nineties saw Air Force Space Command also take \nresponsibility of all operational space lift vehicles, followed by the \nMinuteman and Peacekeeper ICBMs.\n  In the years leading up to Desert Storm, Air Force Space Command \ncontinued to expand its capabilities and enhance our Nation's \nwarfighting forces. Desert Storm provided us the first glimpses of how \nspace-based capabilities can transform the way we fight wars. The \nDefense Meteorological Satellite Program enabled planners to avoid \nadverse weather conditions and allowed General Schwarzkopf to \nsuccessfully execute his now famous ``Hail Mary'' attack against the \nIraqis by showing him where his tanks could effectively maneuver. The \nDefense Support Program was invaluable in providing early warning of \nSCUD\n\n[[Page S8199]]\n\nlaunches. And the effectiveness of our bombing was just starting to see \nthe improvements enabled by the Global Positioning System. On the first \nnight of the war, Conventional Air-Launched Cruise Missiles descended \non Baghdad with deadly accuracy after using Global Positioning System \nto update their own internal navigation.\n  Desert Storm gave us a preview of space-based capabilities, and in \nthe years that followed the innovative men and women of Air Force Space \nCommand continued to refine these capabilities and experiment with the \nbest way to employ them. Operation Enduring Freedom showed the fruits \nof their hard effort. Communications and GPS satellites enabled the \ntremendous feat of a B-52 providing close air support to a soldier on \nthe ground within minutes of the soldier calling in a target.\n  Today Air Force Space Command is a unique command within the Air \nForce, responsible for both acquisition and operation of Air Force \nsatellite systems, launch vehicles, and missiles with over 30,000 \npeople stationed around the globe. The role of Air Force Space Command \nis continuing to grow as they develop even more sophisticated systems \nsuch as SBIRS, the Space Based Radar, and advanced communication \nsatellites, while expanding into areas such as space control. I \ncongratulate Air Force Space Command on a very successful 20 years and \nwish them the very best for the next twenty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8199-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8199-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8199-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT CONCERNING THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE AUSTRALIA GROUP AND THE \n     CONVENTION ON THE PROHIBITION OF THE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, \n STOCKPILING AND USE OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND ON THEIR DESTRUCTION--PM \n                                  106\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with the resolution of advice and consent to ratification \nof the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, \nStockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, \nadopted by the Senate of the United States on April 24, 1997, I hereby \ncertify pursuant to Condition 7(C)(i), Effectiveness of the Australia \nGroup, that:\n  Australia Group members continue to maintain equally effective or \nmore comprehensive controls over the export of: toxic chemicals and \ntheir precursors; dual-use processing equipment; human, animal, and \nplant pathogens and toxins with potential biological weapons \napplications; and dual-use biological equipment, as that afforded by \nthe Australia Group as of April 25, 1997; and\n  The Australia Group remains a viable mechanism for limiting the \nspread of chemical and biological weapons-related materials and \ntechnology, and the effectiveness of the Australia Group has not been \nundermined by changes in membership, lack of compliance with common \nexport controls and nonproliferation measures, or the weakening of \ncommon controls and nonproliferation measures, in force as of April 25, \n1997.\n  The factors underlying this certification are described in the \nenclosed statement of justification.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to promote mathematics and science education through \na mathematics and science partnership and through the establishment of \na grant program to increase student academic achievement in mathematics \nand science, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce ``The Math and \nScience Education Excellence Act.'' I have worked with my colleague \nfrom Kansas, Senator Roberts, to make sure we do everything possible to \ngive math and science education the attention, funding and assistance \nit deserves. Today, I introduce a bill to authorize programs at the \nNational Science Foundation that will help achieve that goal.\n  Under the authority of the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLBA, the \nDepartment of Education is authorized to implement a Mathematics and \nScience Partnership Program, a program I am very interested in making \nsure is a success. That program is designed to improve the academic \nachievement of students in the areas of math and science. It will \nencourage States, universities, school districts and schools to work \ntogether to: 1. improve the status of math and science teaching and 2. \ndevelop more rigorous math and science curricula.\n  The NCLBA authorized $450 million for Fiscal Year 2002 for this \nprogram, but only $12.5 million was appropriated for 2002. That level \nof funding is a huge disappointment to me, and I believe it is a \nmistake. However, last year, NSG initiated its own Program at a level \nof $160 million. Because the bulk of the funding for the Math and \nScience program is at NSF, I believe it is appropriate, even necessary, \nto authorize the MSP Program at NSF as well.\n  This is not the preferred choice. I would prefer that we fund the \nprogram at the Department of Education. In the meantime, this bill will \ngive us an opportunity to re-assert how important this program is.\n  As we all know, the No Child Left Behind Act requires that schools be \ndetermined as failing based in part on their math scores. If they are \nfailing, there will be consequences, such as public school choice, \nsupplemental services and eventual reorganization. That means that math \nteaching and math curriculum are more important than ever. And, by \n2007, science assessments will be added to the mix.\n  So I want to be sure that we are getting these funds to our neediest \nschools. I worry that without more descriptive language, NSF will not \nfocus on awarding grants to those that need it the most. I also worry \nthat the Math and Science Partnership program is not getting the \nfunding it needs. Reading, math's counterpart on the yearly tests, \nreceives over $1 billion in funding. Any many other programs authorized \nin the No Child Left Behind Act are receiving appropriations that meet, \nor even exceed the authorization levels.\n  Not the Math and Science program. Despite the importance of math and \nthe fact that schools will be determined as failing based on their math \nscores, the Math and Science Partnership Program is received a total of \nonly $172.5 million in 2002, with only $12.5 million of those funds \ntargeted to those based on need. $160 million from NSF and $12.5 \nmillion from the Department of Education. For 2003, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee recommends that only $120 million be provided \nfor the MSP program. Why? Apparently, some $30 million in funds is left \nover from last year's appropriation because NSF did not believe the \napplications met the rigors the grant program requires.\n  I am very concerned that we are leaving States, schools districts, \nschools and students confused and bewildered due to the complicated \nbureaucratic process that has been created. I believe we should make \nsure that every dollar of the math and science partnership program \nmoney is appropriately administered to ensure results. I also believe \nthat we should work toward appropriately funding this initiative. My \namendment will accomplish those two goals.\n  My bill would insert the exact Math and Science Partnership language \nfrom the No Child Left Behind Act, language which we members of the \nHELP Committee have already agreed to, with only minor changes. That \nlanguage requires targeting of the $450 million in funds to those who \nneed it the most, and it also requires accountability.\n  I have also added a section requiring the NSF to provide technical \nassistance to those eligible applicants that request it. If the quality \nof the applications is not high, the NSF should help applicants develop \nhigh-quality programs. Otherwise, applicants must guess how to improve, \nforcing math and science education to suffer in the meantime.\n  The bill also authorizes $12 million for NSF to conduct and evaluate \nresearch related to the science of learning and teaching math and \nscience. It directs NSF to develop ways to apply, duplicate and scale \nup the results of such research for use in low-performing elementary \nand secondary classrooms to improve the teaching and student \nachievement levels of mathematics and science. This investment will \nmake sure that we find out the best ways to teach math and science. \nWith that knowledge, we will have the building blocks we need to \neffectively argue for, and demand, more funding for the Math and \nScience Partnership Program.\n  This bill attempts to make the best out of a not ideal predicament \nfor math and science education. I believe it is the right thing to do, \nand I respectfully request my fellow Senators support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2902\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which was referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs:\n\n       Whereas the United States of America and Indian Tribes have \n     a unique legal and political relationship as expressed in the \n     U.S. Constitution, Treaties, Federal statutes and executive \n     orders, court decisions, and course of dealing.\n       Whereas the United States has committed itself to national \n     educational excellence including excellence in institutions \n     that educate American Indian and Alaska Native children and \n     adults.\n       Whereas Tribal Colleges and Universities are fully \n     accredited community-based educational institutions devoted \n     to the education, welfare and economic advancement of \n     American Indian communities.\n       Whereas, the populations in the communities served by \n     Tribal Colleges and Universities are among the poorest of the \n     nation, and the services provided by the Tribal Colleges and \n     Universities enable students to train for and obtain jobs \n     that offer social and economic stability, and serve to reduce \n     welfare dependence in these communities.\n       Whereas, Tribal Colleges and Universities are chronically \n     underfunded, and in addition to offering their communities \n     higher education opportunities, also function as community \n     centers, libraries, childcare centers, tribal archives, \n     career and business centers, economic development centers, \n     and public meeting places.\n       Whereas in 1970 President Nixon issued his now-famous \n     ``Special Message to Congress on Indian Affairs'' rejecting \n     the failed policies of assimilation and termination and \n     heralding the new era of Indian Self Determination.\n       Whereas in 1972 six Tribal Colleges established the \n     American Indian Higher Education Consortium to empower its \n     member institutions through collective action, construct a \n     national support and communications network, and assist \n     Indian communities and Native people in the field of \n     educational achievement, while nurturing, advocating, and \n     protecting American Indian history, culture, art and \n     language.\n       Whereas The American Indian Higher Education Consortium \n     consists of 32 Tribal Colleges and Universities located in 12 \n     states that enroll approximately 30,000 full-and part-time \n     students from over 250 Federally-recognized Indian Tribes.\n       Whereas on July 3, 2002, President Bush issued Executive \n     Order 13270 ensuring that Tribal Colleges and Universities \n     are more\n\n[[Page S8205]]\n\n     fully recognized and integrated into the American family of \n     institutions of higher education.\n       Whereas tribal Colleges and Universities provide access to \n     information technology critical to full participation in \n     America's economic, political and social life, bridging great \n     distances and transforming learning environment.\n       Whereas, Tribal Colleges and Universities and their Native \n     communities continue to play an integral role in American \n     Indian education including in assisting in the implementation \n     of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002. Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, that the Senate of the United States recognizes \n     the essential role Tribal Colleges and Universities play in \n     American Indian communities, honors the vision and commitment \n     of the founders of the American Indian Higher Education \n     Consortium, and celebrates 30 successful years of \n     implementing that vision for the benefit of American Indian \n     peoples across the United States.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Dorgan, Murkowski, Domenici, Bingaman, Conrad and Stabenow in \nsubmitting a resolution to commemorate the establishment of the \nAmerican Indian Higher Education Consortium that took place in the fall \nof 1972.\n  In the late 1960s Indian people began to realize that their futures \ndepended more on their own keen insights, beliefs and actions than on \nthose of the Federal Government or other communities.\n  This phenomenon was assisted in 1970 when President Nixon issued his \n``Special Message to Congress on Indian Affairs'' which rejected the \ntried and failed policies of assimilation and termination. Nixon's \nmessage launched the era of Indian Self Determination with a renewed \nfocus on local, tribal decision making and economic self sufficiency.\n  In 1972 six Indian tribal colleges joined forces to form the American \nIndian Higher Education Consortium, AIHEC, with the goal of creating a \nnetwork of tribally-controlled institutions of higher education.\n  The founders of the AIHEC envisioned that through collective action, \nthey could better assist Indian communities and Native people in the \nfield of education and vocational education.\n  Thirty years later, the American Indian Higher Education Consortium \nhas grown to include 32 Tribal Colleges and Universities located in 12 \nStates with an enrollment of 30,000 students from over 250 federally \nrecognized Indian Tribes.\n  Tribal Colleges and Universities provide quality higher education to \nIndian students and have become the ``hubs'' of a sort for accessing \nstate-of-the-art information technology. It is important to realize \nthat in addition to providing educational opportunities for their \ncommunities, these institutions function as community centers, \nlibraries, childcare centers, tribal archives, career and business \ncenters, economic development centers and public meeting places.\n  The communities served by Tribal Colleges and Universities are among \nthe poorest in the Nation. The training and education provided by \nTribal Colleges and Universities allows Native students to prepare for \nand obtain jobs that offer a decent salary with benefits, and help \nreduce the trap of dependency that has befallen so many Native people.\n  On July 3, 2002 President Bush issued Executive Order 13270 \nrecognizing the enduring contributions of Indian Tribal Colleges and \nUniversities and hailing their success on a wide range of issues.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution which \nrecognizes the critical role Tribal Colleges and Universities play in \nAmerican Indian communities, honors the vision and commitment of the \nfounds of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, and \ncelebrates 30 successful years of implementing that vision for the \nbenefit of American Indian peoples across the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 320--HONORING THE VALLEY SPORTS AMERICAN LITTLE \n  LEAGUE BASEBALL TEAM FROM LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY FOR WINNING THE 2002 \n                  LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL WORLD SERIES\n\n  Mr. BUNNING (for himself and Mr. McConnell) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n       Whereas on August 25, 2002 the Valley Sports American \n     little League baseball team from Louisville, Kentucky won the \n     Little League Baseball World Series;\n       Whereas this is the first time a Kentucky team has won the \n     Little League Baseball World Series in the 56-year history of \n     the series;\n       Whereas the Valley Sports team had an impressive and \n     overall undefeated record of 24 wins and 0 losses, including \n     4 victories in the playoffs, and winning the championship \n     game;\n       Whereas the Valley Sports team players, Aaron Alvey, Justin \n     Elkins, Ethan Henry, Alex Hornback, Wes Jenkins, Casey \n     Jordan, Shane Logsdon, Blaine Madden, Zach Osborne, Jake \n     Remines, Josh Robinson and Wes Walden, showed tremendous \n     dedication and sportsmanship throughout the season toward the \n     goal of winning the Little League baseball world \n     championship;\n       Whereas the Valley Sports team was managed by Troy Osborne, \n     and coached by Keith Elkins and Dan Roach, who all \n     demonstrated professionalism and respect for their players \n     and the game of baseball;\n       Whereas the Valley Sports team fans from Kentucky showed \n     enthusiasm, support and courtesy for the game of baseball, \n     and all the players and coaches;\n       Whereas in the 56th Little League Baseball World Series \n     championship game the Valley Sports American baseball team \n     faced the Sendai Higashi Japanese baseball team and came away \n     victorious by a score of 1-0: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Senate honors the Valley Sports American \n     Little League baseball team from Louisville, Kentucky for \n     winning the 2002 Little League World Series Championship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8205-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8205-S8206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4472.

No timber sale in Region 10 shall be advertised \n     if the indicated rate is deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar. Program accomplishments shall be based \n     on volume sold. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2003, \n     the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale \n     quantity called for in the current Tongass Land Management \n     Plan in sales which are not deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar, all of the western redcedar timber from \n     those sales which is surplus to the needs of domestic \n     processors in Alaska, shall be made available to domestic \n     processors in the contiguous 48 United States at prevailing \n     domestic prices. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal year 2003, \n     less than the annual average portion of the decadal allowable \n     sale quantity called for in the Tongass Land Management Plan \n     in sales which are not deficit when appraised using a \n     residual value approach that assigns domestic Alaska values \n     for western redcedar, the volume of western redcedar timber \n     available to domestic processors at prevailing domestic \n     prices in the contiguous 48 United States shall be that \n     volume: (i) which is surplus to the needs of domestic \n     processors in Alaska, and (ii) is that percent of the surplus \n     western redcedar volume determined by calculating the ratio \n     of the total timber volume which has been sold on the Tongass \n     to the annual average portion of the decadal allowable sale \n     quantity called for in the current Tongass Land Management \n     Plan. The percentage shall be calculated by Region 10 on a \n     rolling basis as each sale is sold (for purposes of this \n     amendment, a ``rolling basis'' shall mean that the \n     determination of how much western redcedar is eligible for \n     sale to various markets shall be made at the time each sale \n     is awarded). Western redcedar shall be deemed ``surplus to \n     the needs of domestic processors in Alaska'' when the timber \n     sale holder has presented to the Forest Service documentation \n     of the inability to sell western redcedar logs from a given \n     sale to domestic Alaska processors at a price equal to or \n     greater than the log selling value stated in the contract. \n     All additional western redcedar volume not sold to Alaska or \n     contiguous 48 United States domestic processors may be \n     exported to foreign markets at the election of the timber \n     sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be sold at \n     prevailing export prices at the election of the timber sale \n     holder.\n       Sec. 320. A project undertaken by the Forest Service under \n     the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program as authorized by \n     section 315 of the Department of the Interior and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1996, as amended, \n     shall not result in--\n       (1) displacement of the holder of an authorization to \n     provide commercial recreation services on Federal lands. \n     Prior to initiating any project, the Secretary shall consult \n     with potentially affected holders to determine what impacts \n     the project may have on the holders. Any modifications to the \n     authorization shall be made within the terms and conditions \n     of the authorization and authorities of the impacted agency.\n       (2) the return of a commercial recreation service to the \n     Secretary for operation when such services have been provided \n     in the past by a private sector provider, except when--\n       (A) the private sector provider fails to bid on such \n     opportunities;\n       (B) the private sector provider terminates its relationship \n     with the agency; or\n       (C) the agency revokes the permit for non-compliance with \n     the terms and conditions of the authorization.\n       In such cases, the agency may use the Recreation Fee \n     Demonstration Program to provide for operations until a \n     subsequent operator can be found through the offering of a \n     new prospectus.\n       Sec. 321.

Nothing in this section exempts the Secretary \n     from any other requirement of the Forest and Rangeland \n     Renewable Resources Planning Act (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.) or \n     any other law: Provided, That if the Secretary is not acting \n     expeditiously and in good faith, within the funding \n     available, to revise a plan for a unit of the National Forest \n     System, this section shall be void with respect to such plan \n     and a court of proper jurisdiction may order completion of \n     the plan on an accelerated basis.\n       Sec. 322.

NATIONAL DEFENSE RAIL CONNECTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) A comprehensive rail transportation network is a key \n     element of an integrated transportation system for the North \n     American continent, and federal leadership is required to \n     address the needs of a reliable, safe, and secure rail \n     network, and to connect all areas of the United States for \n     national defense and economic development, as previously done \n     for the interstate highway system, the Federal aviation \n     network, and the transcontinental railroad;\n       (2) The creation and use of joint use corridors for rail \n     transportation, fiber optics, pipelines, and utilities are an \n     efficient and appropriate approach to optimizing the nation's \n     interconnectivity and national security;\n       (3) Government assistance and encouragement in the \n     development of the transcontinental rail system successfully \n     led to the growth of economically strong and socially stable \n     communities throughout the western United States;\n       (4) Government assistance and encouragement in the \n     development of the Alaska Railroad between Seward, Alaska and \n     Fairbanks, Alaska successfully led to the growth of \n     economically strong and socially stable communities along the \n     route, which today provide homes for over 70% of Alaska's \n     total population;\n       (5) While Alaska and the remainder of the continental \n     United States has been connected by highway and air \n     transportation, no rail connection exists despite the fact \n     that Alaska is accessible by land routes and is a logical \n     destination for the North American rail system;\n       (6) Rail transportation in otherwise isolated areas is an \n     appropriate means of providing controlled access, reducing \n     overall impacts to environmentally sensitive areas over other \n     methods of land-based access;\n       (7) Because Congress originally authorized 1,000 miles of \n     rail line to be built in Alaska, and because the system today \n     covers only approximately half that distance, substantially \n     limiting its beneficial effect on the economy of Alaska and \n     the nation, it is appropriate to support the expansion of the \n     Alaska system to ensure the originally planned benefits are \n     achieved;\n       (8) Alaska has an abundance of natural resources, both \n     material and aesthetic, access to which would significantly \n     increase Alaska's contribution to the national economy;\n       (9) Alaska contains many key national defense \n     installations, including sites chosen for the construction of \n     the first phase of the National Missile Defense system, the \n     cost of which could be significantly reduced if rail \n     transportation were available for the movement of materials \n     necessary for construction and for the secure movement of \n     launch vehicles, fuel and other operational supplies;\n       (10) The 106th Congress recognized the potential benefits \n     of establishing a rail connection to Alaska by enacting \n     legislation to authorize a U.S.-Canada bilateral commission \n     to study the feasibility of linking the rail system in Alaska \n     to the nearest appropriate point in Canada of the North \n     American rail network; and\n       (11) In support of pending bilateral activities between the \n     United States and Canada, it is appropriate for the United \n     States to undertake activities relating to elements within \n     the United States.\n       (b) Identification of National Defense Railroad-Utility \n     Corridor.--\n       (1) Within one year from the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Transportation, the State of Alaska and the \n     Alaska Railroad Corporation, shall identify a proposed \n     national defense railroad-utility corridor linking the \n     existing corridor of the Alaska Railroad to the vicinity of \n     the proposed National Missile Defense facilities at Fort \n     Greely, Alaska. The corridor shall be at least 500 feet wide \n     and shall also identify land for such terminals, stations, \n     maintenance facilities, switching yards, and material sites \n     as are considered necessary.\n       (2) The identification of the corridor under paragraph (1) \n     shall include information providing a complete legal \n     description and noting the current ownership of the proposed \n     corridor and associated land.\n       (3) In identifying the corridor under paragraph (1), the \n     Secretary shall consider, at a minimum, the following \n     factors:\n       (A) The proximity of national defense installations and \n     national defense considerations;\n       (B) The location of and access to natural resources that \n     could contribute to economic development of the region;\n       (C) Grade and alignment standards that are commensurate \n     with rail and utility construction standards and that \n     minimize the prospect of at-grade railroad and highway \n     crossings;\n       (D) Availability of construction materials;\n       (E) Safety;\n       (F) Effects on and service to adjacent communities and \n     potential intermodal transportation connections;\n       (G) Environmental concerns;\n       (H) Use of public land to the maximum degree possible;\n       (I) Minimization of probable construction costs;\n       (J) An estimate of probable construction costs and methods \n     of financing such costs through a combination of private, \n     state, and federal sources; and\n       (K) Appropriate utility elements for the corridor, \n     including but not limited to petroleum product pipelines, \n     fiber-optic telecommunication facilities, and electrical \n     power transmission lines, and\n       (L) Prior and established traditional uses.\n       (4) The Secretary may, as part of the corridor \n     identification, include issues related to the further \n     extension of such corridor to a connection with the nearest \n     appropriate terminus of the North American rail network in \n     Canada.\n       (c) Negotiation and Land Transfer.--\n       (1) The Secretary of the Interior shall--\n       (A) upon completion of the corridor identification in \n     subsection (b), negotiate the acquisition of any lands in the \n     corridor which are not federally owned through an exchange \n     for lands of equal or greater value held by the federal \n     government elsewhere in Alaska; and\n       (B) upon completion of the acquisition of lands under \n     paragraph (A), the Secretary shall convey to the Alaska \n     Railroad Corporation, subject to valid existing rights, title \n     to the lands identified under subsection (b) as necessary to \n     complete the national defense railroad-utility corridor, on \n     condition that the Alaska Railroad Corporation construct in \n     the corridor an extension of the railroad system to the \n     vicinity of the proposed national missile defense \n     installation at Fort Greely, Alaska, together with such other \n     utilities, including but not limited to fiber-optic \n     transmission lines and electrical transmission lines, as it \n     considers necessary and appropriate. The Federal interest in \n     lands\n\n[[Page S8224]]\n\n     conveyed to the Alaska Railroad Corporation under this Act \n     shall be the same as in lands conveyed pursuant to the Alaska \n     Railroad Transfer Act (45 USC 1201 et seq.).\n       (d) Applicability of Other Laws.--Actions authorized in \n     this Act shall proceed immediately and to conclusion not \n     withstanding the land-use planning provisions of Section 202 \n     of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, P.L. \n     94-579.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     the provisions of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 4485.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 320, which was introduced earlier today by \nSenator Bunning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 320) honoring the Valley Sports \n     American Little League baseball team from Louisville, \n     Kentucky, for winning the 2002 Little League Baseball World \n     Series.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to take this opportunity, \nalong with my colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnelll, to speak in \nsupport of this resolution honoring the Valley Sports American Little \nLeague Baseball Team from Louisville, Kentucky for winning the 2002 \nLittle League Baseball World Series.\n  This is the first time in the 56-year history of the Little League \nWorld Series that a team from Kentucky has won the championship.\n  And all of us throughout the commonwealth are very proud of these \nyoung men and their coaches.\n  In fact, this team made it through their entire playoff run without \nlosing a single game--24 games and 24 wins. As someone who played and \nmanaged professional baseball for over a quarter-century, I can tell my \ncolleagues just how difficult it is to win 24 games in a row at any \nlevel of the sport.\n  Over the last month, when major league players were bickering with \nowners about salaries and revenue-sharing and drug-testing, the little \nleaguers showed the best of what baseball and our young people have to \noffer.\n  They played with grit, determination and great skill. They displayed \nspectacular sportsmanship along with giving us some of the finest \nbaseball you will ever see.\n  The young men from Valley Sports played America's national pastime as \nit is meant to be played.\n  I take this opportunity to congratulate all of these young men--Aaron \nAlvey, Justin Elkins, Ethan Henry, Alex Hornback, Wes Jenkins, Casey \nJordan, Shane Logsdon, Blaine Madden, Zach Osborne, Jake Remines, Josh \nRobinson and Wes Walden--along with their manager and coaches--Troy \nOsborne, Keith Elkins and Dan Roach--for this remarkable achievement.\n  Their heart and determination are models for us all. In my mind, they \nare all true all stars.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I might note just in passing, this is a \nresolution honoring the Kentucky baseball team that won the Little \nLeague World Series, and there can be no better person to do this than \nthe Senator from Kentucky, who is a member of the professional Baseball \nHall of Fame. So I think it is worth noting that a Member\n\n[[Page S8230]]\n\nof the U.S. Senate, who is a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, \noffers a resolution commending his State's team for winning the Little \nLeague World Series.\n  I ask consent that the resolution and preamble be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements thereto \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 320) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8230-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 5, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, we have two amendments also that are now \npending, the Wellstone amendment and the Smith amendment. One is \ndealing with corporate offshore locations, the other deals with guns in \ncockpits of airplanes. They are both very important amendments.\n  I hope we could vote on these tomorrow. Remember, we have the \nceremony in New York on Friday; therefore, we will not be able to get \nback on this legislation until next week.\n  I know there is some concern about the Wellstone amendment by some \nSenators, but I hope there would not be an effort to delay this very \nimportant legislation because of this amendment.\n  We are going to vote on it. It is only a question of when. People \nalready know what they are going to do on this. So I hope we could move \nthis legislation along. I think it will send a significant message to \nthe President that this week we accomplished something on this bill \nthat he feels so strongly about and that the two managers of this bill \nfeel strongly about.\n  I think it would send the wrong message if we have no votes this \nweek. The only reason we would not have votes is because the minority \nwill not allow us to have votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/04/senate-section/article/S8230-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
