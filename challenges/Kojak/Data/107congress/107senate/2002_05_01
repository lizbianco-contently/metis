Mr. President, every weekend that any of us go home, the \nfamilies we run into are talking about the cost of higher education. We \nknow that cost is going up. But this administration has just made an \nunconscionable recommendation for low- and middle-income families--to \ndeny them the opportunity to consolidate the loans they have now at a \nfixed interest rate. That possibility is there for small business, it \nis there for big business, and this administration wants to foreclose \nthat opportunity for families and new college graduates across this \nnation.\n  This is what it is going to mean for the average student loan \nborrower in America: It is going to mean an additional $3,000 in costs \non a $10,000 student loan. At a difficult and challenging time when \nstate budgets are cutting their aid to higher education, and tuition is \non the rise, it is bad education policy, and it is not in our national \ninterest. We should be doing everything in our power to make college \nmore affordable.\n  I see the Senator from Vermont. I yield to him.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I could not believe what I heard today with respect to \nwhat they are trying to do. This administration is taking a look at \neducation from the bottom up. It is ridiculous what they are doing. \nThis is a perfect example of doing something that is so against \nanybody's rational way of helping people; I could not believe it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see the Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for bringing up \nthis issue. It is so critical in my home State of Washington, where the \nUniversity of Washington is looking at increases of 11 to 12 percent. \nStudents are spending between $60,000 and $70,000 for their education. \nWe need to do everything we can in this information age economy, where \neducation is going to determine success; we need to be increasing \naccess. The elimination of a Federal fixed-rate student loan program is \na big mistake. We should be increasing Pell grants. We should be \nincreasing access to education. We should be making it more affordable.\n\n  As somebody who went to school on Pell grants and student loans, I \nthink it is a difficult challenge. In this day and age, with our \neconomy changing, access to education for low- and middle-income \nstudents at the most affordable rate must be a priority of this \nadministration and this Congress.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Procedurally, Senators may seek recognition, \nbut there is no standing order for the Senator to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Do I have 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes. The Senator may \nyield to another Senator for a question.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Will the Senator from Massachusetts yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Is the Senator aware of the amount of money that the \naverage American family already pays for college tuition and education, \nwhich as my colleague from the State of Washington pointed out is \nactually increasing faster than the rate of inflation?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I certainly am. Nationwide, college tuition have \nincreased 35 percent over the last 10 years. Today, the average student \nleaves college with $17,000 of debt. In my State, the average loan that \nwas consolidated last year was $27,000. Under the administration's \nproposal, students will lose the opportunity to consolidate their loans \nat a fixed rate and that would cost the average student thousands of \ndollars as the interest rate goes up from year to year.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. From the Senator's study of this proposal, which I have \nto confess, when I first saw it, I thought it was a misprint--I could \nnot believe the administration was about to make the cost of going to \ncollege more expensive for middle-income families--is the Senator aware \nof the impact this alleged cost savings would have on the entire \nFederal budget? What is the amount of money the administration thinks \nthey will save on the backs of young people going to college?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, $1.3 billion. This is a shell game. They \nwill use the $1.3 billion they will get from students for the tax \nbreak. And we are talking about 6 million students who would be facing \nhigher interest rates over the next decade. In my own state last year \n36,000 people consolidated their FFEL loans--with an average loan of \n$30,000. That means that a variable interest rate could cost as much as \nhalf a million dollars to students in Massachusetts.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. In one State alone, is that the Senator's information?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. One State alone; that is right.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator for bringing this very important \nissue to the attention of this body and to families throughout New York \nand America. Like so many, we were just amazed by this proposal. I \ncertainly hope cooler and more compassionate heads will prevail on the \nother end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see my friend and colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts be permitted to control his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized to speak in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes. The Senator may only yield for \nquestions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I simply ask my colleague from \nMassachusetts--and I thank him for bringing this issue before us--\nwhether or not he believes, in a moment when people are being thrown \nout of work, in a moment when the economy is down, and at the same time \nwe are talking about making education the most important issue for \nAmericans, as Americans believe it is--if at that moment it makes any \nsense at all, when more people are trying to apply to schools, when \nmore people realize the importance of education to get a high-value-\nadded job to move the economy of this country--how can one justify, I \nask my colleague, asking students in this country to pay the price of a \nlarge number of corporations getting a tax break, of a large number of \nwealthy people getting a tax break, and making it more difficult for \npeople to secure the very education the President says and others agree \nis the most important ingredient in not only moving our economy but of \ngood citizenship?\n  I ask my colleague, is there any possible way to justify that as a \ncommonsense policy?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has put his finger on it. This is a shell \ngame. The moneys that effectively will be saved will be used for the \ntax break, the tax cut for the wealthiest individuals. It is wrong \neducation policy. It is wrong national security policy.\n  American families need lower tuition rates rather than higher loan \ninterest rates. That is what the Democrats stand for, and it is \nintolerable--intolerable--that the Bush administration would go through \nthis subterfuge. The last time we faced it was in 1981 with the \naddition of an origination fee. That was a fee on all loan programs. \nThat means that a student has to pay an additional 3 percent on what \nthey have to borrow. Now students not only have to pay for tuition and \nfees, but the federal government added a 3 percent fee of their own to \nthose already high costs.\n  This administration does not get it straight when it comes to \neducating the young people in this country.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 26 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I conclude by pointing out, once again, \nthat 64 percent of all students borrow through the Federal student loan \nprograms to finance an education; 74 percent of full-time students work \n25 hours a week or more while attending school, and nearly half of all \nthese students work at levels that are likely to have a negative impact \non their academic achievement and the overall quality of their \neducation.\n  There is tremendous pressure on students now. If we tolerate this and \nlet\n\n[[Page S3583]]\n\nthe administration's program go forward, it will mean additional \npressure on these young people, and in the long run a deficit to the \nquality of education in this country.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, does the Senator from New Jersey want \nto speak as well on this subject?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I will be happy to if the Senator has time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to follow \nSenator McCain in the order, speaking later, for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is the 1st of May. It is significant \nin U.S. history for major technological achievements. On this day in \n1935, the Boulder Dam, later renamed for President Herbert Hoover, was \ncompleted. On May 1, 1947, radar for commercial and private aircraft \nwas first demonstrated. On May 1, 1844, Samuel Morse sent the first \ntelegraph message. All of these achievements represented significant \ntechnological milestones that have greatly benefited millions of \nAmericans.\n  May 1, 2002, was supposed to be a wonderful day that represented \nanother technological milestone for American television viewers. Today \nis the deadline for all commercial television stations in the United \nStates to be broadcasting a digital signal. Theoretically, consumers \nshould now be able to receive a digital signal from each and every \ncommercial broadcaster in the country. Unfortunately for consumers, a \nvast majority of broadcasters have missed today's deadline, leaving \nconsumers' digital TV tuners with little more than static. In fact, \naccording to recent figures from the FCC and the National Association \nof Broadcasters, over 1,011, or 77 percent, of commercial broadcasters \nhave failed to meet the May 1 deadline. Moreover, 834 commercial \nstations filed waiver requests with the FCC seeking an extension to \ncomplete the construction of their digital facilities.\n  The transition to digital television has been a grave disappointment \nfor American consumers but not surprising to this Member. It is nothing \nshort of a spectrum heist for American taxpayers. I will read a few \nheadlines that recently appeared in newspapers across the country: The \nBoston Globe, ``Missed Signals: Many TV Stations Seen Lagging on \nDeadline to Offer High Definition.'' San Jose Mercury News: ``Static \nBlurs HDTV Transition. Industries Squabbling Stalls Digital \nTelevision.'' USA Today: ``Digital TV Revolution Yields Mostly White \nNoise.'' And finally, the most remarkable headline from Monday's New \nYork Times: ``Most Commercial Broadcasters Will Miss Deadline For \nDigital Television.''\n  This morning's USA Today states:\n\n       Today was supposed to be a milestone in the grand \n     conversion to digital broadcast television. Instead it serves \n     as a marker for how poorly the transition is going . . . At \n     the current pace, broadcasters will be able to keep all of \n     their spectrum, digital and analogue, in perpetuity. That \n     means a substantial chunk will remain locked up in \n     broadcasters' hands instead of being put to more valuable \n     uses, such as for advanced cell phone services. Not only are \n     those needed, the spectrum also could be sold for billions, \n     aiding a deficit-laden U.S. Treasury.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial and other news items be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From USA Today, May 1, 2002]\n\n          Digital TV ``Revolution'' Yields Mostly White Noise\n\n       Today was supposed to be a milestone in the grand \n     conversion to digital broadcast television. Instead it serves \n     as a marker for how poorly the transition is going.\n       By now, every commercial broadcast station should have been \n     sending its signal digitally. With just a regular TV antenna \n     and a digital tuner, families were supposed to be getting \n     their favorite TV shows in crystal-clear pictures and \n     theater-quality sound.\n       So far, though, the revolution is a dud. Only about 25% of \n     commercial stations offer a digital version of their \n     broadcast signal, according to a report from Congress' \n     General Accounting Office. And few programs are produced in \n     the highest-quality HDTV format. Little wonder that just \n     200,000 digital over-the-air tuners were sold last year, \n     compared with more than 22 million analog sets.\n       This is all a far cry from the revolution the broadcast \n     industry promised six years ago. That's when Eddie Fritts, \n     president of the National Association of Broadcasters, \n     proclaimed that ``America will embrace digital TV quickly and \n     enthusiastically.''\n       The hype, plus a heavy dose of big-money lobbying, \n     persuaded Congress to give $70-billion worth of extra \n     spectrum to the broadcast industry for free so it could \n     transmit digital and old-fashioned analog signals during the \n     transition. By 2006, 85% or more homes were to have made the \n     switch to digital. Then the old analog signal was to be \n     turned off, and broadcasters were to return the analog \n     spectrum to the taxpayers who financed their gift.\n       At the current pace, though, broadcasters will be able to \n     keep all of their spectrum, digital and analog, in \n     perpetuity. That means a substantial chunk will remain locked \n     up in broadcasters' hands, instead of being put to more \n     valuable uses, such as for advanced cell phone services. Not \n     only are those needed, the spectrum also could be sold for \n     billions, aiding a deficit-laden U.S. Treasury.\n       Confronted with this faltering transition, broadcasters are \n     casting blame in all directions: Cable companies don't carry \n     their digital offerings, which means a big chunk of potential \n     viewers can't get high-definition broadcasts. Only a tiny \n     fraction of TVs have digital tuners. Hollywood doesn't \n     produce enough digital content. The Federal Communications \n     Commission isn't issuing enough mandates.\n       These complications have hampered the move to digital. But \n     at bottom, they are distractions designed to hide \n     broadcasters' unwillingness to fulfill the promise they made \n     in exchange for all of that free spectrum.\n       Outside the broadcast industry, in fact, the conversion to \n     digital TV is moving along pretty smoothly. More than 15 \n     million consumers subscribe to digital cable, and 17.5 \n     million homes get digital TV via small home-satellite dishes. \n     HBO produces more high-definition digital content in any \n     given week than all of the broadcast networks combined.

Howe)\n\n       Roughly three-quarters of second-tier television stations \n     in the United States are likely to miss next Wednesday's \n     deadline to begin transmitting at least some programming in \n     crystal-clear ``high-definition'' format, according to a \n     survey being released today by the General Accounting Office, \n     Congress's watchdog agency.\n       Among the more than 800 US TV stations involved are \n     Boston's channels 38 and 56, which said yesterday they have \n     been given federal waivers to miss the May 1 deadline set by \n     Congress six years ago. Station executives said because of \n     technical challenges, it will probably be early summer at the \n     soonest before they start carrying programs in the high-\n     definition format.\n       US Representative Edward J. Markey of Malden, who is the \n     ranking Democrat on the House telecommunications subcommittee \n     and commissioned the GAO study, said last evening the fitful \n     progress shows the need for federal regulators to impose \n     ``clear deadlines and real punishments'' for HDTV laggards. \n     ``Some combination of the Federal Communications Commission \n     and Congress has to force a resolution of the conflicts which \n     exist amongst industries which have paralyzed the development \n     of digital TV,'' Markey said. ``We can no longer just stand \n     on the sidelines and allow the consumer to be deprived of the \n     benefits of this remarkable technology.''\n       Six years ago, hoping to accelerate a shift many advocates \n     said would be even more radical than moving from black-and-\n     white to color TV two generations ago, Congress enacted \n     legislation calling for all 1,600 US public and commercial TV \n     stations to move by 2006 to a format that provides much \n     clearer, all digital, wide-screen images more like a cinema \n     than TV.\n       Images in HDTV are made up of nearly six times as many \n     pixels, or dots, as standard analog transmissions enabling \n     viewers to see details like individual blades of grass in a \n     baseball close-up or faces in a stadium crowd.\n       The law called for 119 large-market TV stations affiliated \n     with ABC, CBS, NBC, and\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\n     Fox to begin transmitting some HDTV content by May 1999, a \n     deadline that has largely been met--although the Sept. 11 \n     terrorist destruction of the World Trade Center towers in New \n     York knocked five digital stations off the air there.\n       The second in a series of deadlines, coming May 1, calls \n     for 1,121 stations in secondary and rural markets--and the \n     smaller stations in big markets, like Boston's WSBK-TV (Ch. \n     38) and WLVI-TV (Ch. 56)--to transmit at least some HDTV \n     programming.\n       But the GAO found that 74 percent of those stations that \n     responded to a survey said they do not expect to meet the \n     deadline. They cited the huge expense of upgrading studios \n     and transmitters for HDTV, low consumer interest in buying \n     $1,000-plus TV sets that can bring in HDTV signals, and \n     practical issues such as a shortage of specially trained \n     crews that can climb up thousand-foot towers to install \n     new antennas.\n       In Boston, a spokeswoman for WLVI-TV (Ch. 56), Kristen \n     Holgerson, said, ``We will probably be going on the air with \n     HDTV sometime in June, but there's no specific date.''\n       Bob Hess, director of engineering and operations for the \n     CBS/Viacom-owned channels 4 and 38 in Boston and 28 in \n     Providence, said setting up high-definition transmitting \n     equipment for Channel 38 has been bogged down ``for some very \n     legitimate technical reasons.''\n       Among them was that the FCC's random-allocation process led \n     to Channel 38 getting Channel 39 for its HDTV signal, \n     creating huge challenges for station technicians to figure \n     out how to install transmitters on their Needham Heights \n     tower that would not interfere with the existing analog \n     Channel 38.\n       ``I'm expecting it to be on in early summer,'' Hess said, \n     but added that ``nothing is easy and nothing is fast.''\n       Earlier this month, FCC chairman Michael K. Powell tried to \n     kick-start HDTV, using a speech at a broadcasters' convention \n     to encourage a purely voluntary effort to have television \n     networks show more HDTV programming, TV set makers produce \n     more sets that can get the signals, and cable television \n     networks--which roughly two-thirds of Americans use to watch \n     local channels--agree to add HDTV channels to their lineups.\n       Markey, however, said the GAO study shows that Powell \n     cannot rely on a market approach to get the job done. He \n     noted that a third of TV stations surveyed by the GAO that \n     have gone to HDTV said they would not have met the deadline \n     without being ordered to by the government--and many said \n     without government pressure, it would be long after 2010 \n     before a market developed.\n       ``The FCC still is standing on the sidelines without a \n     clear program,'' Markey said.\n       Dennis Wharton, a spokesman for the National Association of \n     Broadcasters, said while hundreds of stations will not make \n     the May 1 deadline, ``Most of them will be on the air within \n     three to 12 months. This is very short-term issue from the \n     broadcasting industry's perspective.''\n       Wharton predicted that by next year, officials will be \n     focusing their ire on TV set makers' and cable TV \n     conglomerates' role in slowing HDTV adoption.\n       By most estimates, fewer than 2 million US homes have been \n     willing to pay the exorbitant prices for HDTV sets that can \n     bring in special programming from the big networks only 30 to \n     40 hours a week. Fewer than 150,000 of the sets were sold in \n     the US during March, according to the Consumer Electronics \n     Association, despite the draw of CBS broadcasting college \n     basketball and the Masters Golf Tournament in high-definition \n     format.\n       Among high-end TV buyers, however, ``the consumer interest \n     is unbelievable,'' said Jeffrey Stone, president of Tweeter, \n     the 158-store home electronics chain. He said in the winter \n     quarter, 91 percent of customers buying projection-screen TVs \n     opted to pay the $300-plus premium to get HDTV capability, \n     and 60 percent of conventional ``tube TV'' sales were HDTV \n     units.\n       ``There's just no comparison'' to standard TV, Stone said, \n     recalling a basketball game he watched where ``you could \n     count the individual beads of sweat on Michael Jordan's head. \n     It looks more real than real life.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the San Jose Mercury News, Apr. 13, 2002]\n\n  Static Blurs HDTV Transition; Industries' Squabbling Stalls Digital \n                               Television\n\n                        (By Dawn C. Chmielewski)\n\n       Federal regulators are working furiously to revive the \n     faltering transition to digital television, even as two-\n     thirds of the nation's commercial stations say they will be \n     unable to meet a May 1 deadline to start digital broadcasts.\n       Some 877 commercial stations have told the Federal \n     Communications Commission they would be unable--for \n     financial, legal or technical reasons--to start digital \n     broadcasts. That leaves half the nation's population, mostly \n     those in small cities or rural areas, without access to \n     crisp, digital television signals, federal regulators say.\n       As broadcasters prepared for this week's National \n     Association of Broadcasters (NAB) convention in Las Vegas, \n     FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell outlined a series of voluntary \n     measures for broadcasters, television manufacturers, cable \n     companies and home satellite providers to avert what he once \n     described as ``a potential train wreck.'' The recommendations \n     triggered a fresh round of finger pointing, as each industry \n     blamed the other for the halting transition to digital TV. \n     Powell called on the four major broadcast networks, together \n     with cable networks HBO and Showtime, to broadcast half of \n     this fall's prime-time lineup in cinematic high-definition TV \n     or offer digital broadcasts with enhanced features, such as \n     interactivity. High-definition TV offers near-cinematic \n     picture quality while digital broadcasts are equivalent to \n     what satellite TV subscribers currently receive.\n       By January, Powell proposed, network-affiliated stations in \n     the nation's 100 largest markets would broadcast an enhanced \n     digital signal to the 2.5 million people who own digital TV \n     sets. At the same time, cable and satellite operators must \n     begin carrying the digital programming.\n       TV manufacturers, for their part, must begin to make \n     television sets with built-in tuners to receive the over-the-\n     air digital broadcasts. Only 20 of the more than 300 models \n     of digital TV sets manufactured currently come with such \n     integrated receivers. For the vast majority of consumers, the \n     only way to currently receive digital signals over the air is \n     with a separate set-top receiver and antenna.\n       ``We embrace the principles embodied in the Powell plan. We \n     encourage our friends in allied industries to do likewise,'' \n     said Edward O. Fritts, president and chief executive of the \n     National Association of Broadcasters, in the opening address \n     to the convention. ``This transition is far too important to \n     consumers to risk further delay.''\n       Industry trade groups applauded Powell for trying to spur \n     the moribund digital TV transition, even as they pointed to \n     obstacles that would make it difficult to comply with his \n     recommendations. The broadcasters say 274 stations already \n     beam digital signals into the nation's largest cities. But \n     the owners of small-market stations, such as San Jose's KKPX \n     (Ch. 65), see little point in investing a reported $1 million \n     to $2 million on the digital conversion, when fewer than a \n     half-million consumers nationwide own the set-top boxes and \n     antennas needed to tune in the digital broadcasts.\n       HDTV is widely regarded as the driving force that will \n     entice consumers to make the migration to digital. But the \n     majority of cable systems, which provide television \n     programming to 67 percent of American households, still don't \n     carry the networks' high-definition broadcasts of events like \n     the Winter Olympics or the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament \n     in fewer than a dozen markets.\n       So station owners feel little urgency to flip the digital \n     switch.\n       ``Most people don't have digital TV,'' said Nancy Udell, a \n     spokeswoman for KKPX parent Paxson Communications. The \n     station received an FCC extension to the May 1 deadline, \n     buying it time to explore a lower-cost method of \n     simultaneously transmitting the digital signal alongside its \n     analog broadcasts.\n       The National Cable and Telecommunications Association \n     (NCTA), meanwhile, says its member services will carry high-\n     definition television network programming when consumers \n     demand it--or competition from digital satellite services \n     such as EchoStar or DirecTV compels it. Indeed, they already \n     carry high-definition HBO and Showtime channels in 280 cities \n     across the country\n       ``We've said all along, when the demand is there, this will \n     take care of itself,'' said Marc O. Smith, spokesman for the \n     NCTA.\n       The consumer electronics manufacturers, meanwhile, say \n     they're unable to build cable-ready sets, because the cable \n     industry has yet to settle on a standard for digital TV \n     reception. And the set of working specifications developed by \n     the industry's research arm, CableLabs, contain content \n     protection that would give Hollywood studios the power to \n     halt home recording or, alternatively, blur the picture \n     resolution.\n       ``No manufacturer has been stupid enough to sign the \n     agreement yet,'' said Bob Perry, marketing vice president for \n     Mitsubishi Consumer Electronics America, the nation's leading \n     maker of projection televisions.\n       The Gordian knot of digital television may ultimately be \n     unraveled in the halls of Congress. Later this month, the \n     Consumer Electronics Association and legislators will convene \n     a summit to discuss strategy for speeding the rollout.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 29, 2002]\n\n  Media; Most Commercial Broadcasters Will Miss Deadline for Digital \n                               Television\n\n                          (By Stephen Labaton)\n\n       Another milestone in the nation's tortured transition to \n     digital television is about to be missed. Almost three-\n     quarters of the commercial broadcasters that were supposed to \n     be offering a digital signal by Wednesday will fail to make \n     the deadline.\n       The delay is a further indication that the federally \n     mandated transition to digital broadcasting will take longer \n     than the planners had expected in the mid-1990's. But the \n     missed deadline comes as no surprise. Hundreds of stations \n     have been filing requests for extensions recently, citing a \n     variety of financial and technical reasons. A report issued \n     last week by the General Accounting Office found that 74 \n     percent of the stations that were supposed to be emitting a \n     digital signal by the May 1 regulatory deadline would be \n     unable to do so. The report said most of the delinquent \n     stations had cited the high cost of new technology. For \n     stations in transition, the expenses averaged 63 percent of \n     annual revenue for a technology that adds nothing discernible \n     to the bottom line. The\n\n[[Page S3585]]\n\n     report also noted the relatively low consumer interest caused \n     by the high prices of digital TV sets and a host of technical \n     issues like tower constructions.\n       Despite the difficulties, 95 percent of the major network \n     affiliates in the top 30 markets are already offering digital \n     broadcasting, and their signals reach about half of the \n     population. But the failure of the smaller broadcasters is \n     symbolic of a much larger nagging problem of aligning the \n     technical and financial interests of a handful of \n     industries--broadcasters, programmers, cable operators and \n     electronic equipment makers--to make digital television \n     accessible at affordable prices to consumers.\n       ``It's a very complicated transition with lots of moving \n     parts,'' said Rick Chessen, the chairman of a regulatory task \n     force supervising the government's oversight of the \n     conversion to digital television.\n       Digital television, which Congress and policy makers have \n     been promoting the last six years, offers crisper images and \n     sound, reduced interference and the prospect of viewers \n     communicating through the set much the way they now do on the \n     Internet. But transforming TV from analog to digital has \n     public-policy significance beyond pretty pictures and greater \n     viewer participation.\n       Policy makers of varying approaches agree that, by using a \n     far smaller sliver of the electronic spectrum, digital \n     significantly frees the airwaves for more productive use by \n     other industries, including wireless communications, whose \n     proponents are clamoring for more licenses. Once digital \n     penetrates 85 percent of the nation's viewing market, the law \n     requires broadcasters to surrender their analog-spectrum \n     licenses back to the government to be reissued to other \n     commercial ventures at auction. As a result, analysts and \n     policy makers agree that the longer the digital \n     transition, the greater the economic overhang.\n       ``Spectrum is critical for us to have economic growth,'' \n     said Blair Levin, a former top official at the Federal \n     Communications Commission who is a regulatory analyst at Legg \n     Mason. ``To the extent it is tied up, it represents a huge \n     drag on the economy.''\n       The rollout of digital TV has stalled over many \n     uncertainties about how to do so profitably. Broadcasters, \n     particularly smaller ones, see little or no financial benefit \n     yet in offering digital signals. Consumers cannot find high-\n     definition television sets at affordable prices. Programmers \n     have moved slowly in offering shows of digital quality. Cable \n     operators have only just begun, in small pockets, to transmit \n     digital signals.\n       Hoping to break the logjam, Michael K. Powell, the F.C.C. \n     chairman, has called for the major industrial players to \n     impose their own voluntary deadlines.\n       ``You will get on this train in the right way, or it will \n     run you over,'' he said this month at the annual conference \n     of the National Association of Broadcasters.\n       Mr. Powell urged the four major networks and other major \n     programmers to digitally broadcast at least half of their \n     prime-time shows by this fall. He asked cable and satellite \n     companies to carry some digital programs by the beginning of \n     next year at no extra cost to subscribers. And he proposed \n     deadlines over the next four years for television makers to \n     increase their production of sets that include digital \n     tuners.\n       Others long engaged in the debate say that Mr. Powell's \n     proposal is not enough, and that in some instances it asks \n     industry players to do little more than they had previously \n     pledged. While there is no momentum on Capital Hill for the \n     imposition of sanctions on tardy industry players or \n     subsidies to encourage faster transition, some lawmakers are \n     calling for legislation to prod a faster conversion.\n       ``Our digital policy is a mess, and in the absence of the \n     federal government intervening with a comprehensive policy, \n     the American consumer is unlikely to ever receive the full \n     benefits of the digital revolution,'' said Representative \n     Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who is ranking \n     Democrat on a House subcommittee on telecommunications. \n     ``Voluntary approaches don't work. A voluntary policy is what \n     got us to today's mess. What we've wound up with now is the \n     broadcast industry and cable industry engaged in spectrum \n     hostage-taking with no end in sight, and no relief for the \n     benefit of consumers.''\n       Federal rules required the 119 largest network affiliates \n     to begin transmitting some digital programs by May 1999. That \n     deadline has largely been met.\n       By Wednesday, 1,121 smaller stations were supposed to be in \n     compliance, but nearly three-quarters will fail to meet the \n     deadline. But industry officials said that they expected most \n     of the broadcasters to be in compliance by the end of the \n     year.\n       ``We consider this a short-term issue affecting mostly \n     small and medium market broadcasters,'' said Dennis Wharton, \n     a spokesman for the National Association of Broadcasters.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Broadcasters have not only missed today's deadline but \nthey have broken their promise to Congress and American consumers. In \ntestimony before the Commerce Committee in 1997, the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters stated:\n\n       We agreed to an aggressive rollout for this new technology \n     . . . Broadcasters have made a compact with Congress \n     concerning high definition television. We will meet our \n     commitments.\n\n  I did not believe that at the time, and I know it is not true now. \nThis is a $70 billion rip-off on the part of the National Association \nof Broadcasters, pure and simple. Today it is clear that three-quarters \nof those broadcasters have not met their commitments, and their failure \nto do so is slowing the transition to digital television. A slow \ntransition affects Americans not only as consumers but also as \ntaxpayers.\n  Broadcasters were given $70 billion in spectrum to facilitate the \ntransition on the condition that they return it when the transition is \ncomplete. By failing to meet today's deadline, broadcasters continue to \nsquat on the taxpayers' valuable resource.\n  While I am generally disappointed and frustrated by the broadcasters' \nfailure to live up to their promises, I recognize some television \nnetworks are contributing to the transition. For example, CBS has been \none of the leaders in providing digital content to consumers. They \nbroadcast a large majority of their prime time schedule in high \ndefinition--approximately 16 hours a week. In addition, ABC is \ncurrently broadcasting all of their scripted prime time programming in \nhigh definition. Providing compelling content to consumers is an \nimportant component to the DTV transition. The more stations that are \nDTV capable and are broadcasting in high definition, the more consumers \nwill migrate to this new technology and purchase products that allow \nthem to view enhanced programming.\n  I believe broadcasters, as beneficiaries of this great American \nspectrum rip-off, bear heightened responsibility for facilitating the \nDTV transition. I recognize that if even the broadcasters were to meet \ntheir commitments, the transition would not necessarily be complete. \nDigital broadcast is one cylinder of the engine needed to drive the \ntransition. Many other issues still remain unsolved, and I do not \nunderestimate the amount of work that needs to be done. Michael Powell, \nchairman of the FCC, has recognized this. In what I believe is a step \nin the right direction, Chairman Powell has advanced a proposal that \nincorporates provisions for all of the industries involved with the DTV \ntransition and asks for voluntary cooperation to accelerate the \ntransition.\n  Chairman Powell has called for the top four networks to provide DTV \nprogramming during at least 50 percent of their prime time schedule \nbeginning in the 2002-2003 season and has asked DTV affiliates of the \ntop four networks in major markets to obtain and install the equipment \nnecessary to broadcast a digital signal and inform viewers that digital \ncontent is being broadcast.\n  The proposal also calls on cable operators with 750 megahertz systems \nor higher to offer to carry, at no cost, the signals of up to five \nbroadcast or other digital programming services. Additionally, the \nproposal asks the direct broadcast satellite industry to carry the \nsignals of up to five digital programming services that are providing \nDTV programming during at least 50 percent of their prime time \nschedule.\n  Finally, the proposal calls on the equipment manufacturers to include \nover-the-air DTV tuners in new broadcast television receivers between \n2004 and 2006. I understand that certain industry representatives, \nincluding broadcast networks and earlier today the cable industry, have \nexpressed a general willingness to answer Chairman Powell's call. I \nthink this is also a step in the right direction. I am hopeful these \ncommitments will lead to results. Unfortunately, the last commitments \nobviously did not.\n\n  Make no mistake, I continue to be a firm believer in market forces, \nwhich is why I believe this voluntary proposal is an appropriate step \nat this time. We must be mindful, however, that valuable public \nresources are at stake. Should the transition continue to be delayed, \nalternative measures will need to be taken in order to reclaim the \nspectrum for which so many other productive uses can be found and which \nrightfully belongs to the American taxpayers.\n  I believe, therefore, the Congress needs to be prepared to intervene, \nif necessary, to protect the taxpayers of this country. If significant \nprogress is not made in the DTV transition, then I will introduce \nlegislation that will not be voluntary. Codifying Chairman Powell's \nvoluntary proposal may be the mildest measure we should consider.\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\n  Let me emphasize the importance of this point. Significant progress \nneeds to be made on the DTV transition. If progress continues to stall, \nthen perhaps a more aggressive approach such as reclaiming the spectrum \nfrom the broadcasters beginning January 1, 2007, will be required.\n  In closing, I realize this transition has not been easy for all the \nindustries involved. Some of the industries have made intensive \nefforts, devoting significant time and resources to make DTV a reality, \nbut many difficult issues surrounding the DTV transition still remain.\n  During a 1998 Commerce Committee hearing on DTV transition, I stated \nI would not suggest the Government now ought to step up and immerse \nitself in micromanaging every piece of this process. While I still \nbelieve the Government is not good at micromanaging, I believe the hour \nis nearing when the Government should step in and find solutions to the \nmess we helped create. More importantly, I believe Congress has a duty \nto protect the taxpayers of this country and reclaim spectrum so it may \nbe put to its best use.\n  I will finish with one final observation: For the most part, the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996 has failed to live up to its promises to \nconsumers. I believe its failures can teach us a valuable lesson while \nwe watch many of the same industries involved in the passage of the act \ngrapple with conversion to DTV.\n  The lesson we should have learned from the failure of the 1996 \nTelecom Act is that the interests of major telecommunications companies \nand average American consumers are not the same. Where the interests of \nthe industries and the interests of the consumers diverge, Congress \nmust assure that the consumers come first. The failures of the \nTelecommunications Act show what happens when Congress first fails to \nsee where the interests of industries are incompatible with the \ninterests of consumers, and then fails to act once it does. I intend \nnot to let this happen and will move forward with legislation should \nprogress not be made in the coming months.\n  I say again, when we gave away $70 billion to the broadcasters, I \nknew at the time they would never meet this time schedule. It was a \ndirty little secret. They have not met it.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is on the floor. We tried to get some \nfree television time for candidates. They certainly could not afford \nthat. They are not acting in the public interest, and it is time they \nstarted acting in the public interest. There is no more powerful lobby \nin this town than the National Association of Broadcasters, and abuses \nhave never been greater.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record two editorials--one from the New York Times, and one from \nthe Minneapolis Star Tribune--about the importance of ending \ndiscrimination in mental health coverage and calling for full mental \nhealth parity.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Minneapolis Star Tribune, May 1, 2002]\n\n            Brain Storm At Last, Bush Grasps a Medical Fact\n\n       President Bush took a grand leap on Monday--one many \n     observers thought he'd never dare to take. He at last \n     acknowledged that the brain is a part of the body.\n       Scientists, of course, have suspected as much for years; \n     the president's declaration is sure to bolster their self-\n     esteem. It will also open the door to a long-awaited policy \n     change: If the brain is in fact yet another bodily organ, it \n     certainly makes sense that its disorders be covered by the \n     same medical-insurance rules that apply to every other bodily \n     dysfunction.\n       This logic is not lost on the president, and on Monday he \n     want out of his way to endorse legislation that would force \n     insurers to treat brain disorders just like other medical \n     illnesses. That would bring an end to the practice of \n     assuring ample health coverage when the pancreas peters out \n     of insulin but scrimping on care when the brain is short on \n     serotonin. That sort of discrimination keeps sick people \n     sick, Bush said, and contributes to the stigma suffered by \n     people with brain diseases. The answer, Bush made plain, is \n     ``full mental health parity''--a promise he says he'll work \n     with Congress to fulfill.\n       This is phenomenal news, and it has the bill's top backers \n     over the moon. Sen. Paul Wellstone's name may have been \n     omitted as the president pushed his concept, but the \n     Minnesota senator is too happy to care. Last year his mental \n     health parity bill died an ignominious death in conference \n     committee, after administration and Republican leaders \n     buckled to insurers' complaints that the bill would be too \n     costly.\n       Medical coverage for the brain--too costly to cover? Tell \n     that to America's epileptics, whose disability has long been \n     covered because it's no longer considered ``mental.'' \n     Besides, the claim about costliness was nonsense from the \n     start. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that \n     premiums would rise less than 1 percent if parity were \n     assured. And that calculation doesn't take into account the \n     savings that could be reaped if--as is likely--early and \n     habitual treatment of brain disorders led to fewer emergency-\n     room visits, shorter psychiatric hospitalizations and reduced \n     prison stays.\n       Of course the best reason to assure mental-health parity, \n     as Wellstone and Republican cosponsor Pete Domenici of New \n     Mexico have argued, is that it's the decent thing to do. Bush \n     said just that on Monday, lamenting the history of \n     misunderstanding, fear and shame that has haunted people \n     suffering from neglected but fully treatable brain disorders. \n     The way to banish those horrors is to treat the medical \n     afflictions with medicine--wherever in the human frame they \n     occur.\n       This is a terrific pledge from a once-reluctant president, \n     and onlookers who see parity as a no-brainer should make sure \n     he sticks by his word. As Wellstone observed earlier this \n     month while speaking to mental-health experts in Bethesda, \n     Md., much could still go awry as this measure moves through \n     Congress over the next month. Though the Wellstone-Domenici \n     bill calls for covering all mental illnesses, many foes favor \n     letting legislators or health plans pare down the list to a \n     few coverable--perhaps just the few curable--diagnoses. That \n     could leave many of the sickest entirely uncovered. There's \n     also the ominous danger posed by the possibility that \n     insurers will design health-care packages that offer no \n     mental-health care at all--a sneaky and pernicious way to \n     skirt the parity requirement altogether.\n       But why worry about such things now? Bush has become a \n     believer. Now perhaps he'll exercise a sliver of \n     compassionate conservatism and lead the fight against \n     weakening the modest mental-health parity bill. So voters \n     must hope--and insist.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 2002]\n\n                      Toward Mental Health Parity\n\n       President Bush said some encouraging words this week about \n     the need for a health care system that will treat mental \n     illness with the same urgency as physical illness. The \n     president seemed to suggest that health insurance should \n     cover mental problems on the same terms as other medical \n     problems. If the president is serious about this issue, he \n     will need to lean on recalcitrant House Republicans, the \n     chief impediment to reform, to pass a bill elevating mental \n     health coverage to a par with medical and surgical coverage.\n       Congress took the first step toward this goal in 1996 when \n     it passed legislation that prevented private plans that offer \n     mental health coverage from setting annual or lifetime limits \n     that are lower than those set for other illnesses. But the \n     law left a loophole that allowed companies to require much \n     higher deductibles and copayments for mental health \n     treatments than for other diseases. So a new bill--pioneered \n     by Senators\n\n[[Page S3587]]\n\n     Pete Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and Paul Wellstone, \n     Democrat of Minnesota--is now pending that would require \n     parity in all terms, including deductibles, co-insurance and \n     duration of treatment.\n       Although Mr. Bush shared the stage in Albuquerque with \n     Senator Domenici, a longtime supporter of full mental health \n     parity, he did not endorse the senator's progressive and \n     expansive bill, which would require parity for more than 200 \n     mental health conditions listed in the chief diagnostic \n     manual when they cause clinically significant impairment. In \n     one comment, Mr. Bush seemed to be seeking ``full mental \n     health parity,'' but in another he talked only of putting \n     ``serious mental disease'' on a par with other diseases. He \n     also called it ``critical'' that the move toward parity not \n     run up the cost of health care significantly.\n       The chief arguments shaping up in Congress involve the \n     potential cost of upgraded mental health coverage and the \n     appropriate range of mental illness to be covered. The \n     Congressional Budget Office estimated last year that the \n     Domenici-Wellstone bill would drive up premiums by about 1 \n     percent, a cost that seems bearable given the importance of \n     treating mental illness and removing the stigma attached to \n     it. The health industry suspects that costs may rise faster \n     and deplores any added cost to a system already under \n     financial strain. But surely there are compromises that would \n     install mental health parity as the norm but allow health \n     plans to abandon parity if their psychiatric costs rose \n     beyond a reasonable level. Me. Bush needs to follow his \n     rhetoric with some hard bargaining to get a bill passed by \n     Congress this year.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Both editorials are strong. They thank the President \nand my partner in this effort, Senator Domenici, for their fine work. \nBoth point out that we need to make sure we have full mental health \nparity. We need to end the discrimination and make sure our loved ones \nand other families are provided with the treatment they need. That is \nnot happening today. This would be a huge civil rights bill that would \nend discrimination and get much more coverage to people.\n  I recommend to every colleague the three-part series in the New York \nTimes, front page. I cannot even read it, it is so powerful and so \npainful with regard to what is happening to those put in homes for \nmental health coverage. Because of the coverage they are getting, there \nwill be a criminal investigation. People have taken their lives by \njumping out of windows because of no supervision. The staff is \nunderpaid and poorly trained and does not know how to provide the \npharmacological coverage.\n  People live in the homes which are supposed to be community-based \ncare, and there is absolutely no treatment, no help. These are people \nwho do not have money. They are not capable of being a political force. \nMy God, they live under the most wretched conditions. This should not \nhappen in the United States of America.\n  It is a powerful series. I have never seen a greater contribution \nthan what the New York Times has done on the front-page series.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3587-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3587-S3588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My third topic is education. I spoke yesterday almost \nwith a twinkle in my eye when I heard what this administration is \nproposing to do.\n  In Minnesota, in 1999, students took out $483 million in loans; $406 \nmillion in Federal loans. In 1987, it was $188 million, $483 million \nversus $188 million.\n  Saying the students cannot consolidate loans and keep them at 4 \npercent and not worry about interest rates going up, average students--\nif this administration has its way--are going to be charged an \nadditional $3,000 more. It is unconscionable.\n  All Senators need to understand many of our students are not 19 or \n20, living in a dorm. Even if they are, a significant number of them \nare working 30 hours a week. These are not people for whom the cost of \nhigher education for their families is easy. A lot of them are students \nnot living in the dorm--40, 45, and 50 years of age--going back to \nschool. Some of our taconite workers are going back to school to try to \nfind employment and support their families. These are hard-pressed \npeople.\n  Now, this administration doesn't want to give them a break on \ninterest rates on their loans? It is the most distorted of priorities. \nGive it all away in tax cuts. A vast majority of these tax cuts go to \nhuge multinational corporations, wealthy citizens, the top 1 percent of \nthe population. And to give them credit, many of them say: We do not \nneed it.\n  Instead, we are told we don't have enough money to fund the Pell \ngrant, so the way we will do it is to charge higher interest rates for \nstudents, many of whom are hard pressed. It is unconscionable, \nunacceptable.\n\n  I announce on the floor of the Senate, along with other Senators, \nincluding the Senator from Minnesota, the Presiding Chair, who cannot \nspeak but I can speak for him, we are not going to let it happen. It is \nnot going to happen. I say to the White House: It is not going to \nhappen.\n  Tomorrow we will talk with teachers, including teachers from \nMinnesota. I will talk about the education budget. We had all of the \nsymbolic politics ``leave no child behind,'' with all the travel around \nthe country, including in Minnesota and coming to the high school, Eden \nPrairie High School, all for education, all for the children--accept \nfor when it comes to digging in the pocket and providing resources.\n  The State of Minnesota anxiously awaits the administration living up \nto the commitment to provide the full funding for special education. We \nhad it done in the Senate. It was on a glidepath. The Presiding Chair \nand I would have liked to have seen it happen quicker. Over 5 years, it \nwould be full funding, and over the next 5 years and the rest of the \ndecade it would be mandatory, automatic full funding, $2 billion more \nin resources for education for the State of Minnesota, half of which \nwould be used for special education, and half to be used to cover other \ncosts which we incur because we do not get the funding from the Federal \nGovernment. The House Republican leadership and the White House blocked \nit.\n  We are going to have a debate on this issue. There are a lot of \ndifferent formulations. I say forego the tax cuts for the top 1 \npercent; forego giving multinational corporations breaks so they don't \npay taxes. Then we will have $130 billion, and over the next 10 years \nthat is exactly what we need to provide full funding for special \neducation.\n  I stake my political reputation on that tradeoff. I come from a State \nwhere we cut teachers, prekindergarten for children, and early \nchildhood education programs. It breaks my heart to see that happen, \nwhere class sizes are going up. My daughter, Marsha, says her advanced \nSpanish class has 50 students.\n  Colleagues, education is a compelling issue in people's lives. If you \nwant to talk about what is good for the country, good for the economy, \nand good for democracy, you are going to want to support education. We \nought to be doing this. There will be a debate and every Senator will \nbe held accountable. We need the full funding. That will be a fight. I \nknow the Democrats will fight for it, and I hope many Republicans do as \nwell.\n  Finally, ``leave no child behind,'' is the mission statement of the \nChildren's Defense Fund. It is probably too much for them to take \nbecause all we have is a tin cup budget from this administration. To \nme, education is pre-K through 65; it is not K through 12.\n  Talking about higher education, older students, talking about \nstudents going back to school, and then there is the prekindergarten, \nwhich for some reason always is put in parenthesis, that is probably \nthe most important education of all.\n  I don't want to celebrate the administration's budget. I am in \nprofound disagreement with the priorities of this administration on \nchildren and education. I celebrate the work of these childcare \nteachers, many of whom make $7 an hour, with no health care benefits. \nIt is preposterous. We say we love children, believe in children, but \nwe devalue the work of the adults who help those children.\n  We are going to be meeting with Commissioner O'Keefe, probably with \nthe Presiding Chair, as well, who has come from Minnesota. We are \ntalking about TANF and welfare reform, and the administration has a new \nformula that 70 percent of the single parents, mainly women, will be \nworking out of the home 40 hours a week, but they don't have additional \nmoney for childcare. There are a lot of other things that are wrong \nwith this reform as well.\n\n  My point is, whether it be welfare mothers, whether it be families \nwith\n\n[[Page S3588]]\n\nparents, whether it be single parents working, whether it be both \nparents working, whether it be low-income, moderate-income, or middle-\nincome, this is a huge issue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I have 3 more minutes to finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This is a huge issue for working families. Many of \nthese families pay more for childcare than they do for higher \neducation. In Minnesota, 30 percent of adult workers make under $10 an \nhour.\n  Let's talk about another issue, affordable housing. To pay for the \nrent of a two-bedroom apartment, not amounting to that much, they will \nbe lucky if they pay less than $900 in Metropolitan Minnesota and it is \npretty expensive in Greater Minnesota. If they have a 2- or 3-year-old, \nthey will be very lucky if it is less than $1,000 for childcare. If you \nhave a single parent, that is two-thirds of their income gone. I have \nnot even included health care or transportation or food. I have not \neven included, maybe once in a blue Moon, being able to take in a movie \nor maybe taking your children out to eat.\n  This administration talks about ``leave no child behind.'' Now they \nwant to expand the absolute requirement that these mothers are all \ngoing to work. They do not provide the money for childcare. Right now \nwe have about 10 percent of low-income families who can take advantage \nof childcare and get any help because we do not have the funding. In \nEarly Head Start, it is about 3 percent of these children who can take \nadvantage of Early Head Start because we don't have the funding.\n  Then there are the middle-income people who look for some assistance, \nand this administration gives us nothing. And they want to talk about \n``leave no child behind.'' In all due respect, they want to talk about \nthe importance of reading, all of which is fine, but where is the \ninvestment? Where is the investment in these children?\n  I finish in these words. I borrow in part from Jonathan Kozol but in \npart myself. This is my favorite way of putting it.\n  You help these children when they are little, not because when you \nhelp them when they are little they are more likely to graduate from \nhigh school--true; not because when you help them when they are little \nthey are more likely to go to college--true; not because when you help \nthem when they are little they are more likely to graduate and \ncontribute to our economy and be good citizens--true. You help them \nwhen they are little because they are all under 4 feet tall and they \nare beautiful and we should be nice to them. That is why we should help \nchildren when they are little. That is a spiritual argument.\n  I don't see that in the budget from this administration. I intend, as \na Senator, working with Democrats and as many Republicans as possible, \nto have amendments out here calling for a dramatic increase in \ninvestment in early childhood education, in K-12, in higher education. \nTo me it starts with education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nNew Jersey is recognized for a period of up to 30 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3588-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3588-S3589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TEACHING HOSPITALS\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, earlier this morning, Senators \nCorzine, Clinton, Schumer, and Durbin were all here to join with me in \nmaking a common case. I hope they will be joining me during the course \nof the day, if they are able to return. If not, I would like to deliver \nwhat I believe is a common concern.\n  This morning Senators heard from my colleagues about the pressing \nproblems of financing education in America in a difficult budget \nenvironment. I share in that concern.\n  I rise with a matter of equal importance for each of our States and \nall of our communities; that is, the rising pressure on medical care in \nAmerica as a result of our difficult budget circumstances.\n  In the next few months the Senate Finance Committee and then the \nSenate itself is going to be debating the question of how to fund \ndifferent components of American health care in this difficult \nbudgetary environment. That debate will affect doctors and their \nability to maintain their practices and the integrity of their \nprofession; home health care providers and their ability to provide \nservice to those who are often locked in their own homes and need \ndesperately to have care; nursing homes, in many cases not simply the \nquality of their care but whether hundreds of nursing homes around the \ncountry continue to operate at all; and teaching hospitals. It is \nteaching hospitals this morning that I want to address in detail \nbecause in some ways their plight is the most perilous and the issue \nmost immediate.\n  Since 1983, this Congress has recognized the unique role of teaching \nhospitals in the delivery of American health care. They have a \nparticular contribution to make, providing technology dealing with \ndifficult cases and providing the doctors themselves for each of our \nStates and all of our hospitals. In recognition of these unique costs, \nthe Congress created the Medicare indirect medical education funding, \nIME. For more than these 20 years, there was an adjustment for the \n1,100 teaching hospitals around the country; that is, they were given a \n6.5-percent additional payment for Medicare to fund their unique \ncontributions, recognizing that all hospitals and all communities \nbenefited by these few flagship hospitals in the Nation, these 1,100 \ninstitutions that made unique contributions. This 6.5-percent payment \nwas maintained in good years and bad years, years of deficits and \nsurpluses, because we recognized that without them the medical system \nin the country simply could not be maintained at its current quality. \nThat is until now.\n  On October 1 the 6.5-percent payment for 1,100 teaching hospitals \nwill be reduced to a 5.5-percent additional payment. It is important \nthat Members of the Senate understand the consequences. The first is to \nmedical technology. All hospitals in America are important, but all do \nnot make an equal contribution. The 1,100 teaching hospitals in America \nare the source of almost every major medical breakthrough in the \ncountry: drug-coated stents which prop open clogged arteries and \nprevent scar tissue from closing up the artery again--teaching \nhospitals; implanted cardio defibrillators, such as the one used by \nVice President Cheney, to keep heart rhythm regular--teaching \nhospitals; EKGs or heart-lung machines, open heart surgery, and \nangioplasties--teaching hospitals.\n  Indeed, if you were to go through every major medical advance of our \ngeneration, they would come back to the best minds and the best \nfacilities and the best medical departments --in teaching hospitals. \nThat is what is in jeopardy.\n\n  Certainly, as it is the leadership of technology in the medical \nprofession, so, too, it is with the most important delivery of \nservices. The chart on my left shows the difference in the burden being \ncarried by these relatively few hospitals. Crisis prevention services \nare delivered by 11 percent of other hospitals; teaching hospitals, 52 \npercent. Teaching hospitals, 91 percent of them deal with AIDS service \ndeliveries, 24 percent of other hospitals; geriatric services, 75 \npercent of teaching hospitals are in geriatric cases, 35 percent of \nother hospitals; substance abuse, 47 percent compared to 14; nutrition \nprograms, 84 percent of teaching hospitals deal with nutrition \nprograms, 58 percent of other hospitals.\n  This extraordinary concentration of the development of technology, \nand dealing with the most difficult and most pressing of the Nation's \nmedical problems, is the basis--the reason why we have additionally \nprovided 6.5 percent. This addition to Medicare is something on which \nwe have never before compromised in recognition of the higher costs and \nsocietal contributions.\n  I recognize in the Senate there is a belief that these teaching \nhospitals are simply a matter for northern New Jersey or Manhattan, \nBoston, Chicago, Los Angeles, or Miami--a few urban centers servicing a \nsmall part of the population. That could not be further from the truth.\n  Last year, teaching hospitals around the Nation admitted 15 million \npeople and provided care to 41 million Americans in emergency rooms. \nThese teaching hospitals may have elite talent and give important care \nwith advanced\n\n[[Page S3589]]\n\ntechnology, but it is not for a select few; they are facilities used by \nall Americans in every State wherever you live.\n  I cannot overstate that in my region of the country or in my State it \nwill not be a particular problem. It will be. But that burden is shared \nby all States. Because of this, when we confronted the issue of two \nprevious Medicare give-back bills to compensate for the balanced budget \namendment, Congress in 2000 and 2001 maintained the 6.5-percent IME \nadjustment. As I have noted to my colleagues, that expires on October \n1. Automatically, it will return to a 5.5-percent adjustment. This is a \n28-percent reduction in funding at teaching hospitals. The consequences \nare that over 5 years, $5.6 billion will not go for medical \nbreakthroughs in AIDS, cancer, or heart disease; $5.6 billion is not \navailable to teach and train the next generation of America's doctors; \nand $5.6 billion is not available to deal with the most difficult \nmedical problems in the country.\n  This chart illustrates the degree of loss. Mr. President, 1,116 \nteaching hospitals in America will lose next year $784 million and, \nover 5 years, $4.2 billion.\n  In my State of New Jersey, this is as acute as anyplace in the \ncountry. In some ways, it is more so. Next year, New Jersey's teaching \nhospitals will lose $31 million. This is a State where 60 percent of \nour hospitals are now losing money. Those that are making money on \naverage are making less than a 1 percent return on capital.\n  Over 5 years, New Jersey's teaching hospitals will lose $166 million. \nThis does not just mean a reduction in services. It does not mean just \na reduction in quality of care. It means that many will close.\n\n  I recognize the perception is that this is our problem, or New \nYork's, or California's, or Illinois'. Allow me to share with my \ncolleagues this information, lest you think this is our problem alone. \nWe may have more teaching hospitals than anyplace in the country, but \nthis is your problem, too. Arizona will lose $40 million; Arkansas, $13 \nmillion; Florida, $98 million; Massachusetts, $248 million; Maine, $15 \nmillion; New Mexico, $7 million; North Dakota, $3.7 million; and \nOklahoma, $30 million. My colleagues, we are in this together.\n  The infrastructure that has created the greatest medical care in the \nworld has been strained. Now it will be broken. Doctors will not be \ntrained. These medical breakthroughs do not occur by chance. It has \ntaken generations over a century to build these institutions and \ngenerations of building teaching staff and trained professionals to \ngive us the greatest medical profession in the world.\n  It may be that this is concentrated in a dozen States. But the great \nmedical centers of New York, Chicago, Massachusetts, New Jersey, \nFlorida, and California are sending doctors to every State in the \nNation. There is not one State in this country that will not this year \nor next year have had a doctor trained at a teaching hospital in New \nJersey, or several from New York, or several from Boston, or Chicago, \nor Los Angeles. They go to Montana and the Dakotas. They go to New \nMexico. They go to the Great Plains. They go to the Deep South. But \nmost of them are trained in our urban centers.\n  Their ability to continue to train is now at its end. I don't know \nhow the medical profession continues on its current basis. Doctors are \nclosing offices for insurance reasons. Because Medicare payments are no \nlonger adequate to meet the cost of service, offices are closing. \nDoctors move instead to practice at other hospitals. Now we are going \nto reduce reimbursements to hospitals. Some of those will close.\n  We have known for a long time that the current quality of medical \ncare in America and the extent of service through different levels of \nincome and class cannot be maintained. We have postponed it.\n  The inability of this Congress and the country to have a national \nsystem of health care delivery with privately or nationally based \ninsurance has strained every degree of health care delivery. We have \ndone our business to maintain it. We have even been able to maintain \nthese hospitals by maintaining the IME system. Now that is at its end.\n  There is introduced in the Senate the American Hospital Preservation \nAct which would maintain the current IME adjustment at 6.5 percent. I \nam a cosponsor. Its major provisions will be before the Senate Finance \nCommittee when we consider how to deal with the medical crisis in \nAmerica.\n  I cannot more strongly urge my colleagues to follow the leadership of \nthis legislation and consider seriously the consequences of allowing \nexpiration of IME adjustment, what it will mean to these hospitals, \nwhat it will mean to the medical care profession, and what it will mean \nto every one of your communities and every one of your States when the \nlocal doctor who went away to the big city to become trained no longer \ncomes home with his or her training and special skills and ability to \nsave lives. The spigot is closed. Everybody is on their own. The \nteaching hospital just closed.\n  That, my colleagues, is no longer on the horizon. It is no longer \nspeculation. That is exactly what we are faced with--the real \nconsequences of losing our leadership in these technological \nbreakthroughs and providing these very specially trained people.\n  I know earlier in the day Senator Schumer, Senator Clinton, Senator \nCorzine, and Senator Durbin were to be here to share in these remarks. \nRegrettably, they were delayed because our colleagues were speaking, \nunderstandably and justifiably, on other issues. I know that on other \ndays they will come to the Chamber to speak about these same concerns. \nEach of them would like to be identified with this case. We will come \nback to fight this on other days. This is not going away. We are not \ngoing to be silent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3589-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3589-S3591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to respond to \na proposal of principles that has been released this morning by our \nRepublican colleagues in the House of Representatives.\n  First of all, I commend them for speaking out in support of \nprescription drugs and lowering the costs. But I come today, along with \nother colleagues, to ask them to join with us in doing more than just \noffering principles, but, as my colleague who is now presiding has \nindicated, show me the money--show me the resources. Unfortunately, for \na senior who got up this morning and had to decide whether or not to \neat or take their medicine, a set of principles will not purchase those \nprescription drugs. What they need is action. They need action now from \nus. We have the ability, the capacity to do that.\n  The first principle that has been put forward by the Speaker of the \nHouse is to lower the cost of prescription drugs now. I could not agree \nmore. We have put forward a set of proposals to do exactly that, to \nincrease the ability to use generic drugs, to open our borders with \nCanada so that our American consumers can purchase American-made drugs \nsold in Canada for half the price. So that our business community, our \nhospitals can have free and open trade with Canada to bring back drugs \nat half the price and sell them to our consumers. We can do that right \nnow. It does not cost anything. Just take down the wall at the Canadian \nborder.\n  We also know that we need to encourage the drug companies to put as \nmuch emphasis on research as they do on advertising. Right now, they \nare allowed to write off advertising costs deduct them. Taxpayers \nsubsidize that. We know they are deducting twice as much on advertising \nas they do on research, and we know if we simply said, you can deduct \nas much on advertising as you do on research, we would save money, and \nwe could put that money into Medicare for a prescription drug benefit.\n  We also know that the State of Maine has taken leadership in bulk \npurchasing, so that, on behalf of their consumers and their pharmacies, \nhospitals, and doctors, they are going to begin the process of \npurchasing in bulk to get a group discount. It is common\n\n[[Page S3590]]\n\nsense to get a group discount. We believe we ought to make that same \napproach available to all of our States that choose to do that.\n  Right now, that is being challenged in court by the pharmaceutical \ndrug companies. So we welcome--I welcome--the House joining with us. We \nhave legislation to lower the cost now.\n  The second principle is to guarantee all seniors prescription drug \ncoverage. Certainly, our caucus--and a majority in this Senate--has \nbeen fighting very hard for this. We, again, are ready to do that right \nnow. But it has to be real. One of my concerns is that our seniors have \nbeen hearing, for a long time, about updating Medicare and that we are \ngoing to provide Medicare coverage. We all know it has to be done.\n  In 1965, when Medicare was developed, it covered the way health care \nwas provided at the time: You went into the hospital, you might have \npenicillin, you had procedures in the hospital. At that time, Medicare \ncovered the way health care was provided.\n  Health care coverage has changed. Treatment has changed. We now rely \nto a great extent on medications. We are proud that those are developed \nin our country and that we have these new opportunities for treatment. \nI am proud, as an American, to be able to have that. But we also know \nit does not work if those who use the most prescriptions, the older \nAmericans, do not have prescription drug coverage under Medicare. So \nthere is no question that we are ready to do that in the Budget \nCommittee.\n  I am very proud to have been part of the Budget Committee putting \nforward a resolution this year that would place a substantial amount--\n$500 billion--into Medicare and prescription drug coverage that we \nwould put aside, as a country, to begin to address in a very \nsubstantive way what our seniors have to deal with every single day \nwhen they are struggling to pay for their prescription drug coverage.\n  My concern is that when you add up--and we have had a chance to look \nat an initial review of some of the principles from a wire story this \nmorning that spells out the premiums, the copays, and the deductibles, \nand all of that--when you add it all up, unfortunately, what our \nRepublican colleagues in the House are talking about just isn't good \nenough. It just simply is not good enough.\n  There are not enough resources. In fact, in looking in my State at an \naverage senior who might be spending $300, as an example, per month on \nprescription drugs. For instance, a breast cancer survivor who is \nspending $136 a month on tamoxifen, and possibly needing cholesterol \nmedication or blood pressure medication, or some other combination. \nWith all those, a $300-a-month bill is not unheard of. Many of our \nseniors pay that. But if you add up what we are finding--and if this is \nnot accurate, we welcome hearing the specifics--it appears from the \npaper they are suggesting something in the range of a $37-a-month \npremium, with a $250 deductible, that 80 percent up to $1,000 would be \npaid, and that 50 percent up to $2,000 would be paid. But for anyone \nwho is spending between $2,000 and $5,000 a year--and that is many of \nour older Americans, or a family with a disabled child, or someone else \nwith a health problem--there would be no assistance whatsoever.\n  When we add that all up, for someone who might be spending $300 a \nmonth for prescription drugs, it ends up being less than 20 percent of \ntheir bill being covered under what is being talked about by our \nRepublican colleagues in the House of Representatives. It would end up, \nfor $3,600 a year, that senior being out of pocket about $2,795, \nleaving them to get $805 in support through Medicare. That is just not \nenough. That is not enough. That is not what our seniors expect. That \nis not what people have talked about. That is not what was talked about \nin the Presidential campaigns. That is not what we know we need to do \non behalf of our seniors. Less than 20 percent of the bill is just not \ngood enough.\n\n  It also appears that this is something that would be turned over to \nprivate insurance companies, which I understand actually are very \nreluctant right now to do this. We are hearing from them that the \nprivate insurance companies would administer the plans, even though \nthey are saying they are very reluctant.\n  We have had a similar experience with Medicare+Choice where HMOs and \ninsurance companies have left the plan. We know about the problems \nthere. Why in the world would we want to make the same mistakes with \nthe prescription drug benefit?\n  So I see something being proposed that is inadequate--woefully \ninadequate--being administered by those who say they do not want to \nadminister the program. We have experience that tells us it is not the \nbest way to proceed.\n  We also know that under private plans the premiums could vary and, \nfor the first time in the history of Medicare, we could have \ninconsistent premiums from region to region.\n  So there are a lot of concerns with the proposals we have seen from \nthe other side of the Capitol, from our colleagues on the Republican \nside of the aisle in the House of Representatives.\n  My biggest concern is that while we continue to see people talk about \nprinciples--principles that talk about lowering prescription drug costs \nand talk about Medicare coverage--those principles alone will not buy \none pill for a senior in Michigan. It will not buy one month's \nprescription for a family with a disabled child. It will not help one \nsmall business lower their cost and their health care premiums so they \ncan make sure they cover their employees.\n  We need action now. We need the same sense of urgency in this Senate \nand in the House of Representatives that every family in America feels \non this issue. We need the same sense of urgency that every senior \ncitizen in this country feels when they walk into that pharmacy and \ntoday pay the highest prices in the world for their prescription drugs.\n  Shame on us for not acting. Principles are fine, but they are not \nenough. I know that the people I represent in Michigan are way beyond \nprinciples. They know what the principles are. They want to know when \nwe are going to act on them, when we are going to cut the costs and \nprovide prescription drug coverage under Medicare. They want to know \nwhen we are going to stop talking and start doing.\n  So I call upon my colleagues to take those principles and put them \ninto legislation immediately. Let's make sure that it will work, that \nit covers more than 20 percent of costs under Medicare, and to join \nwith us in a focused effort to lower the costs of prescription drugs \nfor all of our citizens.\n  I thank the chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I need 1 minute to confer with the \nSenator from Michigan. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent for 1 minute when I am recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend from New \nYork, I think under the agreement, our time is about up. We have 2 \nminutes left on our time.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Then I will speak for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, there is no one here from the \nRepublican side, so there being nobody here, until someone shows up, he \ncan speak for up to 10 minutes without any problem.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I ask to speak for 10 minutes under morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Michigan \nfor the great work she has done in leading our caucus to discuss the \nissue of prescription drugs. We all know we are in a real dilemma. The \ndilemma is a very simple one. We have, praise God, these miracle drugs. \nYou take a pill and it makes you better. You take a pill and you don't \nhave to go under the knife for an operation. You take a pill and you \nlive longer and healthier and happier. It is amazing.\n  All of us recognize that those pills don't grow on trees. It takes \nlots of research and effort to come up with them. But we are facing a \ndilemma in America--a dilemma faced by senior citizens; by young \nfamilies who may have a child who needs one of these miracle pills; by \nsmall business men and women who have to pay for health care; by HMOs; \nby General Motors and the UAW. The cost of these medications is getting \nto be so high that we are living in a bifurcated society.\n\n[[Page S3591]]\n\nThere are those who can afford them because they have wealth or because \nthey are lucky enough to have a comprehensive health care plan, who \nlive better and longer, and those who can't afford them who live worse.\n  It is not part of the American credo. We are happy to say, if you are \nwealthy, you drive a Cadillac and have a five-bedroom house; if you are \npoor, you drive a Chevy and rent a flat. I don't think we are ready to \nsay in American society that if you are wealthy, you can live better \nand longer and get better medicine than if you are poor.\n  So I join my colleague from Michigan in asking, in demanding that we \nbegin to do something about prescription drugs, that we make these \ndrugs available to all people.\n  We have to do it in two ways: One, we have to make sure Medicare adds \nprescription drugs--it was the big thing left out of Medicare back in \nthe 1960s; of course, back then we didn't have these miracle pills--and \nsecond, that we lower the cost.\n\n  We can do that by the methods on which I have been focusing, generic \ndrugs, which lower the cost and provide the same availability without \ncrimping the free market. And there are other proposals out there such \nas reimportation. But we have to lower costs for everybody.\n  We are here to respond to this: ``House Republican Principles to \nStrengthen Medicare with Prescription Drug Coverage.'' First, I would \nlike to welcome my colleagues in the House, Republicans, for getting \ninvolved in the issue. With this little thing they have put out, you \nhaven't even put your little baby toe in the water. Jump in. Join us.\n  They have principles: Lower the cost of prescription drugs now--how \nare you going to do it? I don't see anything as part of this that talks \nabout that--guarantee all senior citizens prescription drug coverage. \nLet me tell my colleagues over in the House, if you are going to only \nallocate a small amount of money, you are not going to be able to do \nthis. You may be able to help the very poor and those with catastrophic \nillness, but you will leave out the huge middle class. That is where it \nseems they are headed.\n  They say: Improve Medicare with more choices and more savings. It \nseems to me I smell a little rat in that one. To rob Peter to pay Paul, \nto say we are going to pay for prescription drugs by cutting back on \nother parts of Medicare, I can tell you how our hospitals are hurting. \nI can tell you how doctors throughout New York and America are no \nlonger taking Medicare. You are going to make that worse.\n  This Republican plan seems to be saying: For a very few people we \nwill make prescription drugs available, but we will take away the \ndoctors who will be able to prescribe them.\n  Finally, they say: Strengthening Medicare for the future, yes, we \nagree with that. Making permanent a huge tax cut which has already \nthrown us more deeply into deficit than the war on terrorism and saying \nyou are going to strengthen Medicare is a contradiction. You have to \ndecide which one is more important. I think we have, many of us. I like \ncutting taxes. I voted for many tax cuts. But making it permanent now \nwhen you say we know what jeopardy Medicare is in and we know we need \nprescription drugs? I will tell you what side of the fence most New \nYorkers would be on, particularly when they know the tax cuts go \nmainly, predominantly to the very people who can afford these \nprescription drugs on their own. They don't need the tax cut to do \nthat.\n  Again, to my colleagues from the other side, from the other House, \nfrom the other party, welcome to the debate. We have been waiting for \nyou. Let's get real. Let's not have a list of high-minded and somewhat \ncontradictory principles. Put your money where your mouth is. What is \nyour plan? What are you going to do? Many of us have specific proposals \nthat we have been working towards. We would like you to support those. \nIf you don't agree with those, what do you agree with?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator from New York yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I commend the Senator for his efforts regarding generic \ndrugs. There is no question that this is the heart of the matter. I \nknow he has held hearings. He has a bill that is moving forward. I \ncommend him for going right to the heart of the issue. Hopefully, our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle and in the other Chamber will \nbe willing to embrace what is a very tangible way to cut the cost, \nwhich he has been working on, holding hearings on, and moving forward \non. I commend him on this issue to all those listening. The leadership \nof the Senator from New York has been absolutely superb on this.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague from Michigan for those nice words \nand, more importantly, for the great work she does. Our generic bill is \nbipartisan. Senator McCain and I are lead sponsors in the Senate. We \nhave sponsors in the House.\n  Can you hear me over there in the House? Hop on our bill instead of \nputting out a statement of principles. It is led by Sherrod Brown of \nOhio, but we have a number of Republican sponsors as well. Again, it is \njoint; it is not intended to be partisan. That is one way to lower the \ncosts.\n  The pharmaceutical industry is not going to like it. Again, I ask my \nHouse Republican colleagues: Are you willing to buck them? Are you \nwilling to say we are going to lower the costs and prevent the lawyers \nfrom fleecing the Hatch-Waxman Generic Act clean or not?\n  Today is a good little baby step on balance by my colleagues in the \nHouse, but they have a long way to go to convince the American people \nthey really care about this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3591-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3591-S3592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TEACHING HOSPITALS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to address a related issue. I had \ncome to join my colleague from New Jersey in addition to my colleague \nfrom Michigan on teaching hospitals. Like many of our precious \nresources, our teaching hospitals are concentrated in a few regions of \nthe country. In fact, 50 percent of the residents trained in the US are \neducated in just seven States.\n\n  New York is home to nearly 10 percent of the Nation's teaching \nhospitals which train 15 percent of our Nation's new doctors--the \nsingle greatest percentage of any state.\n  And though we train them, they don't all stay in New York. They go to \nstates where teaching hospitals are few and far between--like New \nHampshire, Vermont, Montana, Delaware, and South Dakota--States that \nhave fewer than 5 teaching hospitals each.\n  Twenty-two percent of the physicians practicing in both Vermont and \nNew Hampshire--and nearly 20 percent of those in Delaware--were trained \nin New York. Five to 6 percent of the physicians practicing in South \nDakota and Montana were trained in New York hospitals.\n  Even States that do have a significant number of teaching hospitals \nare dependent on New York for residents. Over 30 percent of \nConnecticut's physicians and 47 percent of New Jersey's were trained in \nNew York teaching hospitals. Even 10 percent of those practicing in \nNorth Carolina hailed from New York originally.\n  In fact, there's not a State in the Nation that doesn't have at least \na few doctors who were trained in New York institutions.\n  The concentration of medical education and research in New York State \ndraws world-renowned physicians to train residents in an environment of \nstate-of-the-art medical care and technology.\n  The State's teaching institutions also form the foundation of a \npowerful medical research industry, drawing 10 percent of the Nation's \ntotal National Institutes of Health grant funding.\n  But, like all our hospitals, our teaching hospitals are struggling. \nThe Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was an important piece of legislation, \nbut it cut funding for our Nation's hospitals by over $100 billion more \nthan was originally intended, and our hospitals are still reeling from \nits effects.\n  Our teaching hospitals face another 15 percent cut in Medicare \nIndirect Medical Education, IME, payments this fall. This could mean \nalmost $750 million to the teaching hospitals in New York.\n  This funding is a lifeline for our medical centers--it allows \nphysicians to train in an environment of great technical sophistication \nwhere cutting edge biomedical research and breakthrough\n\n[[Page S3592]]\n\nprocedures are a part of daily patient care.\n  And this quarter billion dollars cut in funding would be felt in \nConnecticut, in New Jersey, in Delaware, in Vermont, in South Dakota, \nin Montana--in all the States in which New York-trained doctors \npractice.\n  New York's teaching hospitals are an engine for the Nation's health \ncare system. They are too crucial a resource to let struggle under the \npressure of continued funding cuts. And I am committed to ensuring that \nthis devastating cut does not happen this year.\n  As the Senate begins to craft Medicare provider legislation, I urge \nall my colleagues to stand with me in ensuring that any Medicare \nprovider package includes a repeal of the IME cut.\n  Our teaching hospitals--and especially those in New York--are an \nengine for the Nation's health care system. I would have a very hard \ntime supporting any Medicare provider package that does not include IME \nrelief.\n  In conclusion, we need to train our doctors to be the best. Fifty \npercent of the residents trained in the United States are educated in \njust seven States. My State is home to 10 percent of the Nation's \nhospitals and trains 15 percent of our new doctors, the greatest \npercentage of any State. In fact, all over the country, 22 percent of \nthe physicians practicing in Vermont and New Hampshire and 20 percent \nin Delaware were trained in New York. Well, that is an east coast \nState. Five to 6 percent of the physicians practicing in South Dakota \nand Montana were trained in New York hospitals.\n  In 1997, there were dramatic cuts in money to teaching hospitals.\n  There is not a State that hasn't benefited from the great training \ndoctors have received in our New York teaching hospitals, or in other \nteaching hospitals throughout. Besides, the teaching hospitals are at \nthe core of our medical research industry. They brought 10 percent to \nthe NIH grants. Yet in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we dramatically \nslashed funding for teaching hospitals. This year, they face another \n15-percent cut. That could mean $750 million to the teaching hospitals \nin New York. Well, that funding is a lifeline for our medical centers, \nthe great research, and the great physicians which we are able and \nblessed to have in this country.\n  So I am here to join my colleague from New Jersey and my colleague \nfrom New York, Senator Clinton, as well as others who are coming to the \nChamber to join this effort, to stand firm in saying that we need to \nprovide the help for the teaching hospitals. We cannot allow this next \ncut from the Balanced Budget Act to go into effect. We should not allow \nany kinds of benefits and other kinds of changes in the Medicare \nProgram to occur without taking into account our teaching hospitals.\n  Many of us on both sides of the aisle will be working long and hard \nto see that that happens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Democrats have used all their time. In \nfact, the time until 12:15 that we set aside should be used by the \nminority. I have talked to my friend from Wyoming. Senator Baucus is \nplanning to be here at 12:15 to give his opening statement on this \nimportant trade bill. We have had good discussion today, and I look \nforward to the Republicans coming out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3592-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EULOGY OF THE DOG\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I talked to my brother a couple of weeks \nago. My brother is 22 months younger than I. We are very close. I talk \nto him as often as I can. He lives alone in rural Nevada.\n  The last time I talked to my brother Larry he was very despondent. \nHis dog had died--Smokey. The dog was almost a cartoon caricature, \nlittle short legs, a great big stomach. We used to make fun of my \nbrother's dog, but he loved this dog. My brother was very emotional on \nthe phone. He felt bad about his dog having died.\n  We all know that yesterday Senator Byrd's dog Billy died. My \nbrother's dog was Smokey. This caused me to reflect, of course, as we \nall do in our lives, on the past. My brother's dog was Smokey, and the \ndog I grew up with was Smokey, a wonderful dog, part Chow, a great dog. \nHe was a great fighter and protector of us. He could appear very mean, \nbut he wasn't mean at all. But he was somebody I grew up with in rural \nNevada. He was a companion and a friend. I still remember him warmly, \nour dog Smokey.\n  When I reflected on Senator Byrd yesterday, I remembered the speeches \nhe gave on the floor where he talked about Billy Byrd, his dog. It was \nobvious he cared a great deal about his dog.\n  Senator Byrd, on this floor, with the memory that he has--and I \ncannot match that--one day I heard him recite this on the Senate floor. \nIt was April 23, 1990, and this comes from the Congressional Record. \nHe, by memory, gave the ``Eulogy of the Dog'' by Senator George G. \nVest.\n  Senator Vest served in this body for 24 years. He is really not \nremembered for what he did in the Senate, but he is remembered for what \nhe did as a lawyer, because George Vest represented a farmer whose dog \nnamed Drum was shot by another farmer. A lawsuit was filed against this \nman for having killed his dog Drum. George Vest is remembered for the \nclosing statement that he gave to the jury regarding his dog.\n  This is very short and I will read this into the Record. I cannot do \nit, as Senator Byrd did, from memory. In doing this, those of us who \nhad animals, like my Smokey and my brother's Smokey and Senator Byrd's \nBilly Byrd, the little poodle he had, will reflect on really what good \nfriends these dogs have been to us. So, again, I do this in memory of \nBilly Byrd, Senator Byrd's and Erma's friend. This was given to the \njury on September 23, 1870. Mr. President, this speech is so memorable \nthat, in 1958, the town of Warrensburg, MO, where the speech took \nplace, erected a bronze statue to honor old Drum and the orator, George \nG. Vest:\n\n       Gentlemen of the jury. The best friend a man has in the \n     world may turn against him and become his enemy. His son or \n     daughter whom he has reared with loving care may prove \n     ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those \n     whom we trust with our happiness and our good name, may \n     become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has he \n     may lose. It flies away from him perhaps when he needs it \n     most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of \n     ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on \n     their knees to do us honor when success is with us may be the \n     first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its \n     cloud upon our heads. The one absolutely unselfish friend \n     that a man can have in this selfish world, the one that never \n     deserts him, the one that never proves ungrateful or \n     treacherous, is the dog.\n       Gentlemen of the jury, a man's dog stands by him in \n     prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will \n     sleep on the cold ground when the wintry winds blow and the \n     snow drives fiercely, if only he can be near his master's \n     side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer, he \n     will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter with \n     the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper \n     master as if he were a prince.\n       When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take \n     wings and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in \n     his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.

And when the last scene \n     of all comes, and death takes his master in its embrace and \n     his body is laid in the cold ground, no matter if all other \n     friends pursue their way, there by his graveside will the \n     noble dog be found, his head between his paws and his eyes \n     sad but open, in alert watchfulness, faithful and true, even \n     unto death.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have heard a number of topics discussed \nthis morning which, of course, is the purpose of morning business and \nthat is fine. We will, however, at the expiration of this time, move \nback into the topic that is before us--the one that seems to me is of \nmajor importance right now, the issue of which we are required to take \nsome action within the next week is trade promotion authority.\n  It is accompanied with several other bills, and so it has become a \nlittle more difficult to understand and more difficult to pass, in \nfact, because of the leverages. I think we ought to focus on trade, \ncreating jobs, and to the extent that trade stimulates our economy, and \nto talk a bit about that. The President has had this on his priority \nlist\n\n[[Page S3593]]\n\nfor a good long time. The basic idea here is to provide the outline for \nthe President to follow--the President and the Trade Representative and \nhis other helpers--in terms of how we negotiate trade agreements around \nthe world. Quite obviously, constitutionally, the Congress has \nauthority there, the Senate has authority over trade, trade \nnegotiations.\n  But it is also clear that 535 people are not going to be able to \nnegotiate trade agreements. Therefore, there needs to be a system, \nwhich has been in place until 1994, when it was not renewed, of doing \nthis. It provides an outline for the President to follow with regard to \ndeveloping trade negotiations and trade agreements with people around \nthe world.\n  Because of the expiration of that outline, we have fallen far behind \nthose countries making agreements, and the impact of that has been \nrather marked. Certainly the time has come for us to do something about \nthis situation.\n  In this time of economic uncertainty, when we are seeking to build \nthe economy, it is one of the bills the President has called on us to \npass. The effects of it are fairly obvious. It can expand markets for \nAmerican goods and services. It creates higher paying jobs. It taps the \nmost effective workforce in the world to compete and boost \nproductivity. It has all kinds of advantages.\n  It is clear that when we have trade, some elements in the economy do \nnot do as well, and I understand that. What we are trying to do is find \ntrade agreements that will emphasize the positive aspects, which I \nthink is very likely to happen, and to hold down to a minimum negative \nimpacts.\n  Economists say reducing tariffs by even one-third will reduce the \nworld economy by $613 billion and boost our economy by $177 billion a \nyear. All economists who are knowledgeable about this issue indicate \nthere is a great deal to be gained from moving forward with a process \nthat allows us to do what we need to do in areas where trade is \nprominent. We can stand back and let other countries have trade \nagreements, and we will find ourselves on the losing side.\n  We were involved in the committee, of which I am a member, on this \nissue. We reported out a package, the bill on which we voted this \nmorning to consider, the Andean trade bill, reauthorizing trade with \npoor countries in South America. This bill is an opportunity to renew \nthat trade. One country is Colombia, in which there are a great many \nproblems, a great many drug problems that affect us. Some other \ncountries are Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. This is not new trade. We \nhave had this agreement before, and we will, I am sure, continue it.\n\n  There is a question about the textile industry, of course, and \nSenators from those States are concerned about what it will mean to the \ntextile industry.\n  As I said, invariably there will be certain industries that will be \nimpacted more than others. We need to deal with that situation.\n  Attached to that bill, as I understand the plan, is trade promotion \nauthority and the Trade Adjustment Act. It makes sense to separate \nthese bills and deal with them independently. We dealt with them \nbefore. There is no reason we ought to be using one as leverage on the \nother. They ought to stand on their own merits. I hope we come to some \nagreement to separate these issues and deal with them independently. \nThat makes sense to me.\n  The renewal of Presidential trade promotion authority should be one \nof our top legislative priorities, and indeed it is one of the \nPresident's priorities. We have in the last few months dealt with the \nPresident's priorities. I am pleased with that, and I hope we can \ncontinue to consider his priorities. We have dealt with energy. We have \ndealt with the farm bill. We have dealt with tax reductions. We have \ndealt with education. These are issues the President has been pushing, \nand I do not see why we cannot work together to include trade promotion \nauthority, which certainly has an impact on our economy and on families \nin this country.\n  It passed the House by a very close vote; nevertheless, it passed. We \nare going to be dealing with a bill that will ultimately go to a \nconference committee to deal with the House or, as some prefer it, to \ntake the House's version so there will not have to be a conference \ncommittee. I suspect that is unlikely. Nevertheless, that is the \nsituation with which we are faced.\n  In general terms, the procedures are a little difficult to \nunderstand, but they fall into two categories: The President's \nauthority to proclaim changes in tariffs resulting from negotiations of \nreciprocal trade agreements with foreign nations and procedures for \nimplementing provisions of such agreements entailing changes in U.S. \nlaws. These procedures, commonly known as fast track, require an up-or-\ndown vote in the Senate. Again, the process is one of having the \nexperts on trade making agreements and bringing them back to the \nSenate. That process has been used for a very long time.\n  The key provisions of the bill are:\n  Establish negotiation objectives of the United States. These \nobjectives are designed to provide congressional guidance to the \nPresident in the negotiations he undertakes. He is not totally \nuninhibited when negotiating.\n  It requires Presidential consultation with Congress before, during, \nand after trade negotiations, again to make sure there is congressional \ninvolvement, as there should be.\n  It creates a congressional oversight group, a broad-based, \nbipartisan, and permanent organization to be accredited as official \nadvisers to U.S. trade negotiating delegations--again, the voice of \nCongress in negotiations.\n  It requires special consultation procedures for including \nagriculture, fishing, and textiles, recognizing these are segments of \nour economy that are impacted and need special consultation.\n  As I said, it requires an up-or-down vote by the Congress.\n  The administration, of course, is urging we pass a clean bill so we \nare able to make some adjustments with the House. Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley, the chairman and ranking member of the committee, \nhave urged we hold it to limited issues. I hope we can, indeed, do \nthis.\n\n  The trade adjustment bill is more controversial. Most people agree \nthere is merit to taking a look at the impact trade agreements will \nhave on workers in the United States and that there ought to be some \nrecognition of that impact and some assistance. Generally in the past, \nthese programs have included financial and training assistance for \nworkers displaced by import competition, assistance for firms facing a \nsignificant adjustment due to increased import competition, and \nassistance programs established in conjunction with NAFTA. This has \nbeen done in the past.\n  This Trade Adjustment Act has been in place, and I believe most \npeople believe there should be some help. However, it has generally \nbeen training, an effort to help people become reemployed, and not to \nset up a longstanding welfare relief program. That is what many of us \ntry to guard against.\n  I mentioned the programs that will expire, but there are some new \nprovisions that have been put into the bill that I think will be \ncontroversial: Health insurance subsidies. No agreement has been \nreached as to how that will be done. Some people prefer temporary \nassistance be given in tax relief or tax assistance, where payments can \nbe made for a period of time and let the workers select their health \ncare.\n  One of the proposals, however, is to have the Government pay up to 75 \npercent of continuing what is called COBRA; that is, continuing the \ninsurance program that was provided by the company. Unfortunately, \nthere are no time limits on this proposal.\n  We are developing another health care relief entitlement, which is \ntroublesome to some, when we ought to be thinking about how do we get \npeople back to work rather than providing a longstanding program.\n  In addition to that, it increases the coverage to farmers, ranchers, \nindependent fishermen, iron workers, and truck operators. Along with \nthat is what is called assistance for secondary workers, those who \nsupply the goods to the industry, whether it is upstream or downstream, \nand without a very clear definition as to what that means.\n  It would be very difficult to identify the various people who could \nbe impacted, and one can imagine how many would be suggesting they were \nimpacted.\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\n  These are the kinds of conflicts I think we have to deal with, and we \nshould. We have to do something about it. Amendments will be offered. \nThere is an amendment I was involved in, where a sugar \nanticircumvention provision was put in. What that deals with is, in the \npast, we have had a situation from Canada in which sugar was mixed up \nin molasses, brought over the border where sugar is not allowed but \nmolasses is, the sugar is then taken out, and the molasses is sent \nback. We have been able to put a stop to that, but this is a permanent \nanticircumvention provision, which all it does is go around the law. So \nI hope that is not struck.\n  There are a number of other things, of course, that could well be \nincluded.\n  This is basically an issue that is very important to the United \nStates. It is very important to the administration to be able to do \ntheir job. I do not think there is any question about that. I come from \na State that is involved in agriculture. Agriculture is very much a \npart of trade. About 1 out of every 3 acres, almost 40 percent of the \nproduction, goes into foreign markets. We produce much more than we \nconsume. So one of our real issues is to be able to develop some fair \noverseas foreign markets for agricultural products. That really has not \nhappened as it should. As well as we get along, for instance, with \nJapan, we still have very high tariffs on U.S. beef. Japan could be a \ngreat market for us.\n\n  In balance, it is like most everything else we have to face up to, \nwhich is that not everyone agrees. We will hear someone say we ought to \ndo it the right way. I do not know of anyone who wants to do it the \nwrong way, but there are differences of views as to what is the right \nway. That is the reason we come together and vote. It is perfectly \nlegitimate to have different points of view, but it is not legitimate \nto not deal with the issues that are before us.\n  We spent a very long time on energy. I am very pleased we have a \nbill, but we now have to do something in the conference committee. \nCertainly, in terms of our situation, in terms of defense, in terms of \nterrorism, in terms of our economy, these are issues that have real \nimpact. We can deal with lots of little things. We could list a number \nof major issues that have a great deal to do with the way we want to \nsee our country in the future, and what we see down the line and that \nis really what we ought to be doing, is sort of setting some goals as \nto where we want to be in terms of freedom, in terms of economy, in \nterms of safety. Having set those goals, it is then reasonable to deal \nwith the issues that are in the interim and determine whether those \nissues will lead us to the goals we have established.\n  Unfortunately, too often I think we sort of deal with the issue that \nis at hand without much thought to where it is going to be over time. \nIt is also true that we represent 50 States, and each of us is a little \ndifferent. Some this morning were talking about health care. I am \nchairman of the caucus on rural health care. Wyoming is a rural State, \nso when one talks about health care, it is different in Meeteesi, WY, \nthan it is in Pittsburgh, PA. There has to be a system to recognize \nthose differences.\n  The same is true with trade. It is different in different parts of \nthe country. Overall, it is to our advantage, and I hope we move \nforward.\n  In conclusion, we need to get on with some other things, like the \nbudget, like appropriations, some of the things that have to be done in \norder to keep our Government rolling. I am sure we can do that. I urge \nwe move forward and complete our work as soon as we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I will speak on a very important issue that affects \nevery single American. It affects people all over the world. That is, \nthe future and viability of our teaching hospitals. We know we have the \ncrown jewels of the global health care system in the teaching hospitals \nwho train our doctors and nurses and provide research that gives \nbreakthrough therapies and drugs that saves and lengthens lives. We \nknow our teaching hospitals are often the treatment of last resort for \nthe sickest of the sick and the poorest of the poor.\n  Yet if we do not act by October of this year, our teaching hospitals \nnationwide will lose $700 million next year alone. I believe that would \nbe a disastrous outcome. It certainly would undermine the ability of \nour teaching hospitals to continue to provide the funds in our health \ncare system that all of our other hospitals, all of our entire health \ncare infrastructure, rely upon.\n  New York, because we have a plethora of first-class, world-renowned \nteaching hospitals, would lose about $230 million of that $700 million, \nwith over half of that falling directly on our leading-edge teaching \nhospitals. In 1 year alone, New York teaching hospitals will lose $120 \nmillion in Medicare payments because of the effects of the balanced \nbudget amendment, which have slashed hospital reimbursements by $100 \nbillion more than the CBO originally estimated. That is a huge amount \nof money. It is often the difference between a hospital being able to \ncontinue to provide first-class service, training, and charity care, \nand having to shut departments, lay off people, and turn their backs, \nliterally, on those who need the help. Congress has already softened \nand delayed some of those reimbursement cuts, including postponing the \nreductions in the so-called indirect medical education payments, \nsometimes referred to as IME.\n  This October, the delay expires and Medicare will revert to the very \nharsh reimbursement levels that we all recognize cut much more deeply \nthan anyone predicted. The cut would amount to an automatic 15-percent \ndecrease in IME funding across the board, across all States. I oppose \nan automatic 15-percent decrease in home health payments, and I oppose \nsuch a decrease in medical education payments. That is why today a \nnumber of my colleagues and I are joining together to introduce a bill \nto call on the elimination of those cuts before they eliminate our \nacademic medical centers.\n  New York has a number of fine teaching hospitals. Everyone will \nrecognize the names. It also has 60 rural hospitals, which is more than \nsome rural States have altogether. I am always a little bit surprised \nwhen my colleagues and others do not understand that New York, with 19 \nmillion-plus people, is not only the island of Manhattan or the five \nboroughs of New York City or the beaches of Long Island or the suburbs \nthat I live in to the north. It is rolling countryside. It is dairy \nfarms with 80, 100, 120 cows. It is apple growers with the orchards \nalong the Great Lakes that form our northern and western borders. That \nis why I support a balanced package that will try to help both our \nteaching hospitals and our rural hospitals.\n  I draw our attention to a provision in this legislation that deals \ndirectly with our great centers of biomedical innovation. If we go \nforward with the cuts as planned, I believe we set back the cause of \nclinical trials, of lab research that is going on right now that might \nhold out a cure for one of us or a loved one. Make no mistake, these \ncuts will not only close departments, lead to layoffs and furloughs of \nhighly trained doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel, I believe \nit will also harm patients. If we do not act on the indirect medical \neducation amounts we need to continue to function, the scheduled cuts \nwill affect the quality of health care all over the country.\n\n  It is not only New York that benefits from New York's teaching \nhospitals; our hospitals are filled with people from all over our \nNation who are sent there because they cannot get what they need at \nhome. We are proud of that. We have people from all over the world who \ncome to New York's teaching hospitals. We train 20 percent of all \nphysicians practicing in the United\n\n[[Page S3595]]\n\nStates today. We provide both the medical education, the internship, \nthe residency, the continuing education, that 20 percent of America's \ndoctors take advantage of.\n  I was surprised to learn that 14 percent of all of Arizona's doctors \nand 25 percent of Florida doctors were trained in New York. Moreover, \nthe therapies developed and perfected in our academic medical centers \noffer hope to patients everywhere. Chances are, no matter where you \nlive, you have been touched by the work that has occurred in a New York \nteaching hospital. We have been instrumental in developing treatments \nfor heart disease, for HIV/AIDS, for developing the therapies on \ncardiac catheterization, the first to innovate new forms of laser \nsurgery, and the new minimally invasive surgical methods.\n  Many in this body support NIH funding. We want to double the amount \nof funding NIH has, but that funding is useless if the research grants \ncannot go to the top researchers to do the work we hope will come from \nadditional NIH funding.\n  The U.S. health care system delivers some of the highest quality care \nto be found anywhere. The reason that happens is because we have a \npartnership. We have our local community hospitals in small towns and \nrural areas. We have our larger hospitals in bigger cities in every \nState in the country. Then we have the so-called teaching hospitals \nthat provide what is called tertiary care. When you are really sick, \nwhen you need extra special help, that is when everybody at home has \nsaid: There is nothing more we can do for you, go to Sloan-Kettering, \ngo to New York Presbyterian, go to Mount Sinai. There is someone there \nwho can give you the help you need. We are very proud to provide that \nservice to our country.\n  I hope we will be successful in the legislation we plan to introduce \ntoday to protect our academic medical centers. I am calling on our \ncolleagues in both Houses to ensure the provision to eliminate these \nIME cuts in any Medicare package we enact this year. I hope what seems \nlike an arcane, somewhat abstract issue, is understood as being the \nextremely important, critical concern that it is.\n  If one looks at the number of physicians trained, the cures and \ntherapies that have been invented, the last resort care that saves \nlives that others had given up on, there is no doubt that our teaching \nhospitals are absolutely essential to the quality of health care in \nAmerica. We need to do everything we can to make sure they stay healthy \nand provide the kind of care we have come to take for granted.\n  Mrs. CLINTON.

Madam President, I rise to offer some comments on the \nproposed trade legislation before us, and in particular on the so-\ncalled Trade Promotion Authority provisions in that package, also known \nas fast-track.\n  As a number of my colleagues have noted, the issue of whether or not \nto enact fast-track procedures is not a question of whether one favors \nor opposes free or fair trade, but rather what role Congress plays in \ntrade agreements.\n  The fast-track proposal we are considering, and its predecessors, are \nquite recent inventions.\n  Prior to the Tokyo round of the GATT, there was no fast-track \nmechanism.\n  In fact, of the hundreds and hundreds of trade agreements our Nation \nhas negotiated and entered into, only five have used the fast-track \nprocedures.\n  This by itself should dispose of the argument that fast-track is \nnecessary for us to negotiate trade agreements at all.\n  Really, what we are saying here is that fast-track has been the \nexception, not the rule, with regard to trade negotiations.\n  The previous Administration negotiated and implemented over 200 trade \nagreements without fast-track.\n  What were some of those agreements?\n  Madam President, I don't think I really need to tell you, but they \nincluded:\n  The Market Access Agreement with Argentina for Textiles and Clothing, \nthe Market Access Agreement with Australia for Textiles and Clothing, \nthe Agreement on Bilateral Trade Relations with Belarus, the Market \nAccess Agreement with Brazil for Textiles and Clothing, an Agreement \nconcerning Intellectual Property Rights with Bulgaria, an Agreement \nBetween the United States of America and the Kingdom of Cambodia on \nTrade Relations and Intellectual Property Rights Protection, the \nAgreement on Salmon and Herring with Canada, the Agreement on Ultra-\nhigh Temperature Milk with Canada, the Agreement on Trade in Softwood \nLumber with Canada, the Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights \nProtection with Ecuador, a Memorandum of Understanding on Trade in \nBananas with Costa Rica, several agreements with the European Union, an \nAgreement on Intellectual Property Rights Protection with India, \nseveral dozen agreements with Japan, several dozen agreements with \nKorea, and many, many more agreements with dozens of other countries.\n  Just last year, this body passed legislation implementing the U.S.--\nJordan Free Trade Agreement, also negotiated and implemented without \nfast-track procedures.\n  We passed not only bilateral agreements, but multilateral agreements \nsuch as:\n  the Information Technology Agreement, which involved over 40 \ncountries, the Financial Services Agreement, and, the Basic \nTelecommunications Agreement.\n  President Clinton did not need fast track to negotiate those \nagreements, and President Bush does not need it to negotiate additional \nagreements.\n  While the ability to negotiate and enter into international \nagreements are inherently part of the President's constitutional \npowers, the Constitution grants exclusive authority to Congress ``to \nregulate Commerce with foreign nations.''\n  Congress has sole constitutional authority over setting tariff levels \nand making or changing Federal law.\n  Those who support fast-track constantly make the argument that if you \nwant free trade, you have to enact fast-track.\n  They equate fast-track with free trade. The reason is obvious. The \narguments for free trade are powerful. Indeed, I agree with those \narguments.\n  We as a nation are better off in a world with freer trade than we are \nwithout it.\n  But the underlying premise, that we need fast-track to achieve free \nand fair trade, is absolutely false.\n  I have referred to the hundreds of trade agreements negotiated \nwithout fast-track procedures.\n  That is evidence enough.\n  But let me also argue that not only is fast-track not necessary for \nfree trade, it may actually undermine it.\n  One of the greatest defects of the NAFTA and GATT agreements was the\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\nperception that those agreements picked ``winners and losers.'' I \nbelieve strongly that those perceptions are based on reality, that some \nindustries were huge winners in those agreements, while other \nindustries were effectively written off.\n  Wisconsin had more than its share of those industries that were \nwritten off, and at the top of that list, at the very top was the dairy \nfarmer.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that other industries were given a \nhigher priority than our dairy farmers, and the results of those \nagreements underscore that feeling.\n  Under the GATT, the European Union is allowed to export 20 times the \namount of dairy products under subsidy than the U.S. is allowed to \nexport.\n  Not only did we formally provide the EU this significant advantage in \nthat agreement with respect to dairy, but apparently the EU is not even \ncomplying with those incredibly generous limitations.\n  The industries given lower priority do not end with dairy, and while \nour more populous cities--Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay--experienced \nserious job loss as a result of the NAFTA agreement--over 1000 jobs \nlost in Racine, and over 2600 jobs lost in Milwaukee--the fallout from \nthe ``winners and losers'' approach extended to many smaller \ncommunities.\n  Even if we only use the extremely conservative statistics collected \nby the Department of Labor--statistics which many argue grossly \nunderstate actual job loss--smaller communities all over Wisconsin have \nbeen the victim of this ``winners and losers'' approach to trade \nagreements.\n  NAFTA's legacy of lost jobs includes places such as:\n  Baraboo, with 95 lost jobs; DeForest, with 40 lost jobs; Elkhorn, \nwith 50 lost jobs; Hawkins, with 443 lost jobs; Marinette, with 32 lost \njobs; Mauston, with 48 lost jobs; Merrill, with 84 lost jobs; Montello, \nwith 25 lost jobs; Oconto Falls, with 437 lost jobs; Peshtigo, with 221 \nlost jobs; Platteville, with 576 lost jobs; Reedsburg, with 25 lost \njobs; Spencer, with 23 lost jobs; and, Waupaca, with 132 lost jobs.\n  To trade negotiators whose focus was on advancing the prospects of \nthose industries they pre-determined to be ``winners,'' the losses \nexperienced elsewhere apparently were unfortunate but acceptable.\n  But for the communities I mentioned, those losses were real--real \nworkers with real families to support.\n  The fast-track procedures under which GATT and NAFTA were negotiated \nand implemented invite this kind of polarization at the negotiating \ntable.\n  And it is this kind of economic disparity produced by these trade \nagreements--the picking of winners and losers--that undermines broad \npublic support for pursuing free trade agreements.\n  Free trade ought to benefit all sectors of the economy.\n  Without fast-track procedures, our negotiators will know their work \nproduct will undergo rigorous Congressional scrutiny.\n  And they will know that it will be much more difficult to enact a \ntrade agreement that disproportionately benefits some while \ndisadvantaging others.\n  It is this kind of trade agreement--one that benefits the entire \neconomy--that will enhance the cause of free trade.\n  Fast-track also encourages another disturbing trend in trade \nagreements, namely advancing the short-term interests of multinational \ncorporations over those of the average worker and consumer.\n  The increasing globalization of the economy confronts us every day.\n  Few can doubt the enormous power that multinational corporations \nwield in trade agreements, from the negotiating table itself to the \nclosed-door bargaining that will go on before the implementing \nlegislation is sent to Congress.\n  Fast-track procedures make it all the easier for those interests to \nadvance an agreement that may include provisions that conflict with the \ninterests of our Nation.\n  With opposition to the entire agreement the only alternative left to \nCongress, and with the considerable weight of the multinational \ncorporate interests behind any proposal, it is likely that Congress \nwill swallow even a deeply flawed agreement.\n  What does that do for the public support necessary for free trade?\n  It severely undermines it, Mr. President, and puts future trade \nagreements that can enhance our economy at risk.\n  Let me turn to another provision in the current fast-track proposal.\n  It may surprise some to know that even provisions that have nothing \nto do with the underlying trade agreement cannot be amended or even \nstricken from the bill. Some may find this hard to believe, but in fact \nwe have seen such provisions included in fast-track protected trade \nlegislation.\n  Many of us will recall the GATT implementing measure which included \nsome controversial provisions intended to offset the costs of the trade \nagreement.\n  Among those provisions was a change in the actuarial standards of the \nPension Benefit Guarantee Corporation and a provision many viewed as a \nsweetheart deal for certain media giants that gave preferential \ntreatment with respect to FCC licenses.\n  Neither of those provisions had anything to do with the underlying \ntrade agreement. Both certainly deserved more scrutiny than they \nreceived under the constraints of fast-track procedures.\n  Whatever justification there may be for providing special procedures \nfor trade agreements, procedures which supporters argue are necessary \nto attract our trading partners to the table, there is no such \njustification for shielding unrelated provisions from thorough \nCongressional scrutiny and review.\n  Let me stress those funding provisions were not part of the trade \nagreement itself. Our trading partners do not get a say in how we \noffset the cost of a trade agreement, and one might ask, if our trading \npartners have no say in the offset provisions, why are those provisions \nincluded under fast-track procedures?\n  The fast-track proposal before us today has that same flaw. Under its \nprocedures, the most unjustified funding mechanism attached to trade \nimplementing legislation under fast-track will remain unscathed.\n  To correct that problem, I plan to offer an amendment that allows any \ntax increase included in a fast-track protected bill to be fully \ndebated and amended. There is no reason Congress cannot fully debate, \nmodify, or strike any tax increase.\n  But beyond the problem of fast-track protected tax increases, there \nmay be no limit at all on extraneous matters in fast-track bills. I am \nnot confident that as it is currently drafted the fast-track authority \nprovided in this bill protects Congress from this potential abuse.\n  If that is true, if extraneous matters are not prohibited from fast-\ntrack protected trade bills, then there is nothing to prevent a \nPresident from including language to ban all abortions.\n  If extraneous matters are not prohibited, then there is nothing to \nprevent a President from including language requiring all guns to be \nregistered.\n  In short, if extraneous matters are not prohibited, then there is \nnothing to prevent a President from including provisions, completely \nunrelated to trade, that would otherwise not pass this body.\n  I plan to offer an amendment to protect against such an abuse. It \nwould provide that a point of order could be raised against extraneous \nmatters included in a fast-track protected trade bill, and would \nrequire that they be dropped.\n  Let me reiterate that many of us who support free and fair trade find \nnothing inconsistent with that support and insisting that Congress be a \nfull partner in approving agreements.\n  Indeed, as the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, has \nnoted, support for fast-track procedures reveals a lack of confidence \nin the ability of our negotiators to craft a sound agreement, or a lack \nof confidence in the ability of Congress to weigh regional and sectoral \ninterests against the national interest, or may simply be a desire by \nthe Executive Branch to avoid the hard work necessary to convince \nCongress to support the agreements that it negotiates.\n  I can think of no better insurance policy for a sound trade agreement \nthan the prospect of a thorough Congressional review, complete with the \nability to amend that agreement.\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\n  Not only would the threat of possible congressional modification spur \nour negotiators to produce the best product possible, that potential \nfor congressional intervention could serve as an effective club in the \nhands of our negotiators when they are bargaining with our trading \npartners.\n  With hundreds of trade agreements negotiated and implemented without \nfast-track, the refrain we hear again and again, that we need to enact \nfast-track in order to negotiate trade agreements, is off key.\n  We do not need fast-track to negotiate trade agreements.\n  As I have argued today, in several important ways, fast-track invites \nbad trade agreements.\n  It produces agreements that pick winners and losers instead of \nadvancing all sectors of the economy together.\n  It produces agreements designed to respond to the short-term \ninterests of multinational corporations instead of fostering long-term \nsustainable economic growth.\n  It protects the completely unrelated funding provisions in trade \nimplementing legislation, and as such invites enormous abuse.\n  And it may provide a mechanism to enact controversial legislation, \nunrelated to trade, that would otherwise fail to pass.\n  I think fast-track is bad for free trade. We don't need it, and we \nshouldn't enact it. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this \nlegislation, and in doing so, voting for--voting for--free and fair \ntrade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3597-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3597-S3598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OTHER FAST TRACK PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, the Senate has put trade on the fast \ntrack, but there are a number of other priorities that the Senate would \ndo better to put on the fast track.\n  The Senate has put trade on the fast track, but what about a long-\noverdue increase in the minimum wage? The Senate should put the minimum \nwage on the fast track.\n  The Senate has put trade on the fast track, but what about updating \nMedicare to provide coverage for prescription drugs? The Senate should \nput prescription drug coverage on the fast track.\n  The Senate has put trade on the fast track, but what about protecting \npeople of color against racial profiling? The Senate should put racial \nprofiling on the fast track.\n  Madam President, the Senate has put trade on the fast track, but \nanother thing that should be on the fast track for Senate consideration \nis ensuring the health of Social Security. As we debate the Senate's \npriorities, let me take a few minutes to address this other matter that \nrequires the Senate's attention: the state of Social Security and \nMedicare and the well-being of the millions of Americans whom those \nimportant programs serve.\n  Madam President, since the election, the topic of Social Security, as \nyou well know, has all but fallen off the legislative agenda, and that \nis unfortunate, for at stake is little less than whether our elderly \nlive in comfort or in poverty. Before Social Security, most elderly \nAmericans lived in poverty. Before Medicare, more than a third of the \nelderly still lived in poverty--35 percent in 1959. Roughly 10 percent \ndo now.\n  Social Security and Medicare have been essential to this achievement. \nNearly two-thirds of elderly Americans rely on Social Security for most \nof their income. Social Security has been one of the most successful \nGovernment undertakings in history.\n  On March 26, the trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds issued their annual reports on the financial condition of these \ntwo important programs. These reports give us another reason to turn \nattention to Social Security and Medicare and to our efforts to protect \nthem.\n  The Social Security trustees' report indicates that to maintain \nsolvency for 75 years, we need to take actions equivalent to raising \npayroll tax receipts by 1.87 percent of payroll or making equivalent \ncuts in benefits. That is essentially equal to the long-term actuarial \ndeficit in last year's report--1.86 percent.\n  Another way of looking at these numbers is as a share of the economy, \nas measured by the gross domestic product. The Social Security \ntrustees' report indicates that the long-term shortfall amounts to \nseventy-two one-hundredths of a percent of the size of the American \neconomy that the trustees project over the next 75 years.\n  The Social Security trustees project that the assets of the Social \nSecurity trust funds will keep the program solvent through 2041, and \nthat is actually 3 years later than last year's report. When Social \nSecurity exhausts its assets in 2041, annual Social Security tax \nrevenues will be sufficient to cover about three-quarters of annual \nexpenditures.\n  So the trustees' report thus sounds a warning: We can fix Social \nSecurity for 75 years if we make changes now equal to less than 2 \npercent in payroll taxes or 13 percent of benefits. But if we wait \nuntil 2041, we will need payroll tax increases of more than 5 percent \nor benefit cuts of more than a quarter.\n\n  The Medicare trustees' report indicates that to maintain solvency for \n75 years, we need to take actions equivalent to raising payroll tax \nreceipts by 2.02 percent of payroll or making equivalent cuts in \nbenefits. That is up slightly from last year's report, which showed a \nlong-term actuarial deficit of 1.97 percent.\n  The Medicare trustees project that the assets of the Medicare trust \nfunds will keep the program solvent through 2030, and that is 1 year \nlater than last year's report.\n  The trustees' report raises a somewhat higher hurdle to keep the \nMedicare program solvent over the long run than Social Security. To fix \nMedicare for 75 years, we need to make changes now equal to about 2 \npercent in payroll taxes or 38 percent of benefits. But, once again, if \nwe wait until after the baby boom generation begins to retire in \nnumbers, we will need much larger payroll tax increases or benefit \ncuts.\n  These reports underscore the importance of working to ensure the life \nof these important programs earlier rather than later. As President \nKennedy said:\n\n       [T]he time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining.\n\n  Regrettably, during the sunnier times of last year, the Government \ntook steps that undermined the soundness of the Government's fiscal \nstructure. Rather than repair the roof, the Government actually widened \nthe hole.\n  The question of Social Security and Medicare solvency is, in large \npart, as with all budgetary questions, a question of resources. Last \nyear, the government dissipated many of the very resources that we \ncould have used and that we should have used to shore up Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  A recent analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \nestimated the long-term cost of last year's tax cuts, assuming that \nCongress extends them, as many on the other side of the aisle advocate. \nAccording to that analysis, the long-run cost of last year's tax cut \nwill equal 1.68 percent of the economy that the Social Security \ntrustees project over the next 75 years.\n  Compare that, for a minute, to the amount that we need to keep Social \nSecurity healthy over the same time period, which amounts to seventy-\ntwo one-hundredths of a percent of the size of the economy that the \ntrustees project over the next 75 years. The Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities analysis shows, therefore, that ``the long-term size \nof the tax cut is more than double the entire long-term Social Security \nshortfall.''\n  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities study goes on:\n\n       [I]f the tax cut were scaled back so that three-fifths of \n     it took effect while the funds from the other two-fifths of \n     the tax cut were used instead to strengthen Social Security, \n     the entire long-term deficit in Social Security could be \n     eliminated.\n\n  That is an incredible fact. If we had just shown some restraint on \nthis tax cut--still giving a very substantial tax cut--we could have \neliminated the entire long-term deficit in Social Security.\n  Like all budgetary questions, the question of Social Security \nsolvency is, in large part, a question of priorities.\n  I believe that we need to return to the priority of protecting the \nSocial Security trust funds.\n  This has not been a partisan issue. This is an issue upon which we \nhave had a broad consensus. We should return to that consensus \nposition.\n  We should do what, in remarks in February of 2001, President Bush \ncalled ``prudent fiscal policy;'' we should, in\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\nhis words ``set aside all payroll taxes that are designed for Social \nSecurity to be spent only on Social Security.''\n  We should preserve Social Security surpluses to reduce the debt. And \nthat debt reduction will better prepare us for the challenges of Social \nSecurity and Medicare in the future.\n  As then-Budget Committee chairman, Senator Pete Domenici explained in \nApril 2000, when we were running surpluses:\n\n       [T]here is less interest being paid because the Social \n     Security trust fund money is not being spent; it is being \n     saved, which means that we have that much less IOUs to the \n     public . . . .\n\n  Chairman Domenici continued:\n       I suggest that the most significant fiscal policy change \n     made to this point to the benefit of Americans of the future \n     . . . is that all of the Social Security surplus stays in the \n     Social Security fund . . . .\n\n  In sum, we should, as President Bush said in a March 2001 radio \naddress:\n\n       keep the promise of Social Security and keep the government \n     from raiding the Social Security surplus.\n\n  Returning to a budget where the Government no longer uses Social \nSecurity trust fund surpluses to fund other Government spending will \nrequire a change in policy. While the fiscally responsible actions we \ntook in the 1990s led to balancing the budget without using Social \nSecurity in 1999 and 2000, the Government returned, last year, to using \nthe Social Security surplus to fund other Government activities.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office's ``Analysis of the \nPresident's Budgetary Proposals,'' over the next 10 years, the \nPresident's budget would use $1.8 trillion of the Social Security \nsurplus to fund other Government spending. In the Congressional Budget \nOffice's analysis, the Government would not return to a balanced budget \nwithout using Social Security during the decade for which they make \nprojections.\n  But the Government will not have Social Security surpluses to use \nforever. Starting in 2016, Social Security will start redeeming the \nbonds that it holds, and the non-Social Security budget will have to \nstart paying for those bonds from non-Social Security surpluses. The \nbottom line is that starting in 2016, the Government will have to show \nrestraint in the non-Social Security budget so that we can pay the \nSocial Security benefits that people have earned.\n\n  That's why it doesn't make sense to enact either tax cuts or spending \nmeasures that would spend the non-Social Security surplus before we've \naddressed Social Security for the long run. Before we enter into new \nobligations, we need to make sure that we have the resources to meet \nthe commitments we already have.\n  To get the Government out of the business of using Social Security \nsurpluses to fund other Government spending, we need to strengthen our \nbudget process. At a minimum, we need to extend the caps on \ndiscretionary spending and the pay-as-you-go discipline that we began \nin 1990, and which expire in September of this year. The Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Mr. Gregg, and I will offer an amendment to extend the \nspending caps during consideration of the budget resolution, and \nperhaps on other legislation, as well.\n  But we need to do more. We need to improve the budget process so that \nit includes incentives to balance the budget without using Social \nSecurity. I am working with the senior Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, \non proposals to do that, and I expect that sometime this year we will \noffer an amendment to improve our budget process.\n  We must address the long-term challenges posed by the needs of Social \nSecurity and Medicare. As an essential first step, we must revise the \nbudget process to protect the Social Security Trust Fund. We must put \nour economic house in order, and I look forward to working with my \nColleagues to do so.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are about to have the chairman of the \nFinance Committee and the ranking member of the Finance Committee offer \na managers' package to the Andean trade bill that will be the pending \nbusiness when we complete morning business.\n  No doubt some who watch the proceedings will be confused by what is \nhappening because we have an Andean trade bill that will apparently be \namended by something called trade adjustment assistance and, more \nimportantly, will be amended by something called trade promotion \nauthority. Trade Promotion Authority is a euphemism for fast-track \ntrade authority. One would expect fast-track trade authority would be \nbrought to the floor by itself. It is a very big policy issue. Yet it \nis coming in the form of a managers' package. One amendment is a part \nof the managers' package. I regret that, but that is how we have to \ndeal with it.\n  I will speak about trade generally and explain why I do not support \ntrade promotion authority or so-called fast track. I did not support \ngiving fast-track trade authority to President Clinton, and he didn't \nget it. And I don't support giving fast-track trade authority to this \nPresident, and he should not have it.\n  Let me describe for a moment why I feel that way. This is what the \nConstitution says about international trade. Article I, section 8, \nsays: The Congress shall have the power . . . To regulate commerce with \nforeign nations.\n  Not the President, not the trade ambassador, not some trade \nnegotiator, but the U.S. Congress.\n  Fast track does away with that. Under fast track, Congress handcuffs \nits hands behind its back and says to a President, go negotiate a trade \nagreement somewhere and bring it back to the Congress, and we guarantee \nnone of us will be able to offer an amendment, no matter how flawed the \ndeal might be. Fast track means expedited procedures by which a trade \ntreaty comes through the Congress guaranteeing no one has the ability \nto offer an amendment.\n  It is undemocratic. It does not make sense. Why would Congress, being \ntold by the U.S. Constitution what their objection and their \nresponsibilities are, decide to cede those responsibilities to the \nPresident? It does not make sense to me.\n  There is an old saying, there is no education in the second kick of a \nmule. Having been through this a couple of times and been burned badly, \nCongress ought to understand when a bad trade agreement is negotiated \nand brought back. It is very hard for the Congress to turn down a \nnegotiated trade agreement. What happens is the Congress\n\n[[Page S3599]]\n\nembraces the agreement in total and rants about the specific provisions \nin the agreement that injure specific industries in the country because \nthey are unfair, but no one can do anything about it.\n  We had a speech by Trade Representative Zoellick about 5 or 6 months \nago. He was giving a speech in Chicago. Speaking to a business group in \nChicago, Zoellick described lawmakers and lobbyists who oppose trade \npromotion authority, fast track, a bill sponsored by House Ways and \nMeans Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, and said they are ``xenophobes \nand isolationists.'' That is a thoughtless way to debate this issue--\n``xenophobes and isolationists.''\n\n  A colleague of mine yesterday, in discussing this, said something \nwith which I strongly agree. This country ought not ever hang its head \nwith respect to the issue of trade. This country can, should, and will \nbe proud of its record in trade. We have led the world in opening \nmarkets, in deciding we want to lead the world in expanded trade, in \nfreer trade and in fair trade. That has always been what this country \nhas done. No one ought to point to this country with respect to trade \nissues. We have open markets, we have free trade, we have always been \nwilling to compete almost anywhere, any time, under any set of \ncircumstances. We have nothing at all to be ashamed of. We have a great \ndeal to be proud of with respect to international trade.\n  We are now moving into a different area. Globalization is here. We \nare not going to turn back the clock. Globalization is part of our \nlives. The question isn't whether to embrace it; the question is: What \nare the rules for globalization? What are the rules for the new global \neconomy? Are there rules of fair play for admission to the American \nmarketplace?\n  We have had men and women die on the streets in this country who were \nwalking the streets and demonstrating for the right to form labor \nunions early in the last century, demanding the right of workers to \nform labor unions. This country now has free labor unions. We had \npeople marching in the street to demand safe workplaces. Now we have \nrules and laws that require workplaces be safe for workers. We had \npeople marching in the streets to demand child labor laws, to take the \n10- and 12-year-old kids out of the coal mines and the factories. Now \nwe have laws in this country with respect to child labor. We had people \nmarching in the streets in America trying to prohibit those who were \nproducing chemicals from and dumping them into our water and our air \nand polluting our environment. Now we have clean air and clean water \nlaws, and we have prohibitions against those who pollute our \nenvironment. These fights have been over the conditions of production.\n  So, in a global economy, what is the admission to the American \nmarketplace, where we have already had the debate and made the \ndecisions about those issues, the issues of a fair wage, a safe \nworkplace, the right to organize, the prohibition against polluting? \nWhat is the admission to our marketplace? I ask the question, Is it \nfair trade for someone overseas in some foreign land who hires 12-year-\nold kids, pays them 12 cents an hour, and puts them in a factory 12 \nhours a day, to make a product they ship to Pittsburgh, Fargo, or Los \nAngeles? Is that fair trade for the men and women of the American \nworkforce to compete against? Twenty-cent-an-hour labor by 12-year-old \nkids? Twelve-cent-an-hour labor by 10-year-old kids? Is it fair to \ncompete against a plant overseas that can dump its chemicals in the \nwater, its pollutants in the air, hire underage children, have unsafe \nworkplaces, and prohibit their workers the right to organize? Is that \nfair competition for American workers?\n  Will those who want to produce in our world simply pole-vault over \nall of those difficult issues we have already addressed in our \ncountry--a safe workplace, child labor, a fair income, the right to \norganize, a prohibition against polluting the air and water? Can they \njust pole-vault over all of that and go to a country where they do not \nhave to abide by any of that. They can hire kids, dump chemicals in the \nwater and the air, fail to pay a living wage, and do nothing to have a \nsafe workplace. They can produce whatever product they want, and ship \nit to the American marketplace.\n\n  That is not fair trade. It is not fair to the American worker. It is \nnot fair competition. It is not fair to American businesses trying to \ncompete in those circumstances.\n  Fast-track authority will be voted on here in the next week or so, 2 \nweeks perhaps. We are told it is sweetened and made less bitter by \nsomething called trade adjustment assistance. That means help for \npeople who have lost their jobs. It's ironic, isn't it, that we are \ntold these new trade agreements they want to negotiate will be good for \nour country, but they are already making plans for all the people that \nwill lose their jobs because of these new trade agreements?\n  I guarantee that there is not one Member of the Senate who will lose \nhis or her job because of a trade negotiation overseas. Our negotiators \nwill rush overseas, if we give this authority. They will close the room \nand in secret negotiate a trade deal, and I guarantee there not one \nMember of the Senate will have his job directly threatened by that \ntrade agreement. It is just the folks who work in the factories, the \nplants, on the factory floors who are producing products that cannot \ncompete with unfair competition.\n  I am not someone who believes we ought to put up a wall or we ought \nto promote less trade. I believe we ought to have essentially free \nmarkets and expanded trade. But I demand fair trade. I just demand fair \ntrade. If we do not have fair trade, then this country ought to have \nthe backbone, the muscle, and the strength to say to other countries: \nYou must open your markets to this country's products and the products \nyou send to this country must be produced under conditions that are \nfair.\n  Whenever the subject of trade comes up, a lot of people are quick to \nclassify the different views into two camps: the larger, expansive view \nof people who are smart and get it and see over the horizon and \nunderstand the global economy; that is, the people who support fast \ntrack; and the others are xenophobes, who are stooges, who don't \nunderstand any of this, have blinders on and cannot see over the \nhorizon. They oppose fast track.\n  Those who write the editorials, those who are lobbying on behalf of \nfast track, those who make comments like Mr. Zoellick, they create \nthese thoughtless divisions of those who get it and those who don't; \nthose who are smart and those who are not. Of course that is not the \nissue at all. Let me describe what the issue is.\n  I talked about the issues we fought about in this country for years. \nThere are 2.9 million children in Brazil under the age of 15 who are \nworking, working in manufacturing plants and other circumstances that \nwill produce products that will come to our marketplace. Is it fair \ntrade to ask someone from Pittsburgh, trying to raise a family, being \npaid a decent wage, working in a factory that requires a safe \nworkplace--is it fair trade to ask that person to compete against a 12-\nyear-old? The legal minimum age for workers in Peru is 12. That is the \nlegal working age.\n  So which of our workers and in which of our States do we want to have \nto compete against 12-year-olds? Is it fair to have the product of 12-\nyear-olds sit on America's store shelves so the consumers can get a \ngood deal, buying cheap products, because 12-year-olds in some foreign \nland produced it?\n\n  And shouldn't foreign markets be open to our products, which are \nproduced under decent working conditions. Every time I come to the \nfloor, I cite the example of the Korean auto market. I know the Korean \nautomobile industry chokes on it because I have gotten several letters \nfrom them now. I use this as an example of fair trade because there is \njust such a lopsided trade imbalance with Korea when it comes to cars.\n  Last year Korea shipped 620,000 Korean cars to the United States. Do \nyou know how many American cars we were able to sell in Korea? We sold \n2,800.\n  Let me say that again. Korea shipped us 620,000 Korean automobiles \nand we were able to sell 2,800 U.S. automobiles in Korea. Do you know \nwhy? Because the Koreans don't want to buy U.S. automobiles--I am \ntalking about the Korean Government. They don't want Koreans to \npurchase U.S. automobiles, and they put a series of obstacles up\n\n[[Page S3600]]\n\nagainst us selling cars in Korea. Fair? Of course it is not fair. Is \nthere somebody going to do something about that? No. Our trade \nnegotiators are not interested in solving problems--only in negotiating \nnew agreements.\n  Will Rogers once said that the United States of America has never \nlost a war and never won a conference. He surely must have been \nthinking of our trade negotiators because they lose almost immediately \nwhen they begin negotiating.\n  If I had some feeling somebody, somewhere, someplace was going to \nsolve a problem or two here or there, then I would maybe have a little \nconfidence. But I could stand here and recite problem after problem. \nThere is the unfair trade involving wheat from Canada, that comes here \nfrom a monopoly called the Canadian Wheat Board that would be illegal \nin this country, taking money out of the pockets of our family farmers, \nand nothing is being done about it.\n  How about Brazilian sugar that undermines our sugar program? The \nsugar is shipped to Canada, where it is packed into molasses. The \nmolasses are shipped to the United States, where the sugar is taken \nout, and the molasses are shipped back to Canada. This is just a \nblatantly unfair trade practice, yet nobody is doing anything about it.\n  Or let's talk about barriers to U.S. exports of high-fructose corn \nsyrup to Mexico. The Mexicans said they would let it into their \ncountry. But they will not.\n  Every pound of beef going from this country to Japan has a 38.5-\npercent tariff, every single pound of American beef. We ought to get \nmore T-bones into Japan. Our negotiators thought it was a triumph to \nget Japanese tariffs on U.S. beef reduced to 38.5-percent. Is that a \nsuccess? I don't think so.\n  I hardly dare begin to speak of China. The problems of getting access \nto the Chinese marketplace are legion.\n  Wheat flour--try to sell wheat flour to the European Union. There is \na 78-percent tariff on wheat flour to the European Union, so our \nfarmers can't get wheat flour into the European Union. In fact, we \ncan't get U.S. beef into the European Union because it is produced with \nhormones. The European press has the Europeans thinking we produce cows \nwith two heads.\n  Do you know what happened? What happened was interesting. It is \ntypical of, in my judgment, our weak-kneed trade approach. Because \nEurope has caused us a problem on beef, we took the EU to the World \nTrade Organization. For once, the World Trade Organization actually \nruled in our favor. They ruled that we could take action against \nEurope. Do you know what action we took against Europe? We slap them \nwith penalties on truffles, goose liver, and Roquefort cheese. That \nwill sure scare the Devil out of the European Union. America is going \nto take action against their truffles or goose liver.\n\n  The fact is, our country is unwilling to stand up and exhibit the \nbackbone necessary to say to other countries: This marketplace is the \nonly one like it in the world. There is no substitute for it. We want \nit open to you. But understand this: The American marketplace is open \nto your products but your marketplace must be open to ours. No, it is \nnot open to your products if you are going to ship us prison labor \nproduction and, yes, we have had some of those goods coming from \nChinese prisons to be put on the store shelves of this country. That is \nunfair. Our marketplace isn't open to you if you are going to lock \nkids, 10- and 12-year-old kids in plants producing carpets. That is not \nfair trade. Our markets will be open to you, but you must open your \nmarkets to us.\n  Having said all of this, those who might listen will say: All right. \nSo this is someone who doesn't like trade.\n  Nonsense. I think trade is very important. I think expanded trade is \nvery important. It is just that our country has to think differently.\n  For the first 25 years after the Second World War, our trade was all \nforeign policy. It didn't have anything to do with economic policy. We \ncould tie one hand behind our back and beat anybody in the world. We \nwere the best, the strongest, and the fact is, we could out-trade \nanybody under any set of circumstances. So for 25 years our trade \npolicy was foreign policy. But the second 25 years after the Second \nWorld War things are different. Our competitors are shrewd and tough \ncompetitors--Japan, Europe, Canada, China, and others. The fact is they \nhave grown to be shrewd, tough international competitors, and our trade \npolicy can't be foreign policy anymore. It must be tough, hard-nosed \neconomic policy that requires of them what we demand of ourselves. \nRegrettably, as a country have not been willing to do that. We are \nalways interested in negotiating the next agreement, notwithstanding \nthe problems that we have created in the past agreements. We just can't \ncontinue to do that.\n  My understanding is that we are going to have a managers' amendment \noffered. When the ranking member and the chairman show up, I will be \nhappy to give up the floor. But I am going to offer an amendment, \nhopefully this afternoon--the first amendment on Trade Promotion \nAuthority. I have a number of amendments, as do many of my colleagues \non this issue. The first amendment I am going to offer is very simple. \nIt deals with the issue of the North American Free Trade Agreement that \nwe negotiated previously. It was a terrible agreement. When we started \nnegotiating with Mexico and Canada, we had a small trade surplus with \nMexico. We have managed to turn that into a huge deficit. We had a \nmoderate trade deficit with Canada, and managed to increase that many \ntimes over. That is the record of NAFTA.\n  I am going to offer an amendment that says that investor dispute \ntribunals must be opened to the public. We now have a circumstance \nwhere when you have an investor dispute with NAFTA, a tribunal is \ncreated. It is a three-person tribunal. It is done in secret. It is \nbehind closed doors. It is done in secret. The records are secret. The \ntestimony is in secret. The only thing known are the results.\n  We ought not ever allow that to happen. My amendment is going to say \nno more secrecy. My amendment is going to say if we are going to be a \npart of NAFTA, the tribunals must be open. A little fresh air and \nsunshine will disinfect that process. I hope this amendment will be \naccepted by the Senate.\n  Let me speak briefly about one of the most egregious cases being \nconsidered by one of these tribunals. A few years ago, California \ndecided to eliminate MTBE from our gasoline, and other states have done \nthe same. We have discovered that this gasoline additive shows up in \ndrinking water. It is going to injure the public health.\n  So California says: We have to get rid of MTBE. We will ban it from \ngasoline as an additive.\n  Because this country, for its own reasons, decides to stand up for \nthe health of its citizens, we are now being sued under the NAFTA \nagreement by the Canadian company that makes MTBE. We are getting sued \nfor close to a billion dollars. A tribunal is hearing that case, and is \ndoing so in secret.\n  Here we are. That is the result of trade agreements that don't pay \nnearly enough attention to fairness for this country and fairness to \ninternational trade.\n  My expectation is that we will be debating this for perhaps a week or \n2 weeks, with many amendments.\n  I heard a rumor--I don't know whether it is true or not--that the \nchairman and ranking member have reached some kind of agreement perhaps \nto oppose amendments to fast track. I hope that is not the case. My \nhope is--because most of us are not on the Finance Committee--that we \nwill be able to come to the Chamber and offer ideas perhaps they have \nnot thought of. I don't expect that committee has a monopoly on good \nideas.\n  My expectation is that perhaps there are 80 or 85 other Members of \nthe Senate who might have some ideas that could be considered \nmeritorious and that could be added to fast-track trade authority.\n  I don't support fast-track trade authority. But perhaps in the \nprocess of amending this we can change it sufficiently so that it won't \nadversely impact this country. I hope we will be able to see some \nsupport for meritorious amendments that will be offered on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  There is a lot to discuss with respect to trade. I will not try to \ntouch on every point right now. I think we are waiting for the chairman \nand ranking member to come and offer their amendments.\n  But I would like to talk for a moment about another issue on trade.\n\n[[Page S3601]]\n\nThis is something that I raised with Secretary of State Colin Powell \nyesterday in an appropriations hearing. It also has to do with trade.\n  I fought for over 3 years on the floor of the Senate and was finally \nsuccessful last year to make it legal again to sell food to Cuba. For \n40 years we have had an embargo; we couldn't sell a thing to Cuba. We \ncould not even sell food or medicine. My contention is that is \nbasically immoral for us to use food as a weapon. We sell food to \nCommunist China. We sell food to Communist Vietnam. But for 40 years we \ncouldn't sell food to Cuba.\n  So I kicked and scratched for a long while with some of my \ncolleagues. I was able to get that aspect of the embargo changed. Just \nlast year, we were able to get it changed so we can actually sell food \nto Cuba.\n  Cuba had a hurricane recently that caused a great deal of damage, and \nthey need food. They are offering to buy it, and to pay cash. Cuba has \nnow purchased $70 million worth of food from the United States in \nrecent months.\n\n  A fellow named Pedro Alvarez heads a group called Alimport, which is \nthe Cuban agency that buys food. He was going to come to this country \nand inspect some facilities, visit a number of agricultural states, \nincluding coming to my State of North Dakota. They were prepared to buy \nwheat and dried beans, I understand.\n  The State Department issued him a visa. He applied for and was given \na visa by our interest section for Cuba to come to the United States. \nYet abruptly, the visa was revoked.\n  I am trying to find out why the visa was revoked. My staff called the \nState Department. The State Department said: Well, it is our policy not \nto encourage food sales to Cuba.\n  Yesterday, I asked the Secretary of State: Is that your policy?\n  The Secretary of State said: It is news to me. I have no such policy.\n  Someone deep in the bowels of the State Department apparently defined \nfor himself the State Department's policy, and did not bother to check \nwith Secretary Powell.\n  I asked for an investigation. Why do you revoke the visa issued to \nsomeone who wants to come to our country to buy wheat, dried beans, \ncorn and eggs? Who decided that somehow that threatens our country? \nWhere does that kind of thinking come from?\n  I expect I will probably hear from Secretary Powell in the next day \nor two. I hope so. I wrote a rather lengthy letter last week. I had the \nopportunity to question him before an Appropriations Committee hearing \nyesterday.\n  At a time when agricultural prices have collapsed and our family \nfarmers are hanging on by their fingertips trying to make a go of it, \nwe have some folks somewhere behind the drapes inside the State \nDepartment deciding they really don't want to sell food to Cuba and \nthey don't want someone coming up here from Cuba to buy dried beans. If \nthere is some perceived threat about that, I wish someone would inform \nme and the Senate.\n  That is one more example of the strange approach that people take to \ninternational trade. We ought never, under any circumstance, use food \nas a weapon. It is immoral. Does anyone think Fidel Castro has ever \nmissed a meal because this country had an embargo for 40 years on the \nshipment of food to Cuba? Does anyone think he has ever missed \nbreakfast, lunch, or dinner? No. Those sorts of things hurt poor \npeople, sick people, and hungry people. They don't hurt Fidel Castro.\n  I have personally written to Mr. Alvarez saying: I am inviting you to \nthis country. I have written to the Secretary of State saying: I want \nyou to provide visas to the people who want to come up and buy food \nfrom our family farmers.\n  That is just one more piece in a long, sorry saga of international \ntrade that doesn't represent our country's interests.\n  I am very interested in having robust, strong expanded, trade. I am \nvery interested in finding ways by which we can force open foreign \nmarkets. But the record is abysmal. We agreed to NAFTA, GATT, and we do \nUnited States-Canada agreements.\n  The fact is that very little has changed in the behavior of China, \nEurope, Japan, and other countries. Our country leads the way in \nunilateral behavior in international trade that says our market is \nopen. Our country ought to use its leverage to say we are going to hold \nup a mirror. If your market isn't open to us, you go sell your \ntrinkets, trousers, and cars somewhere else. And, as soon as you \nunderstand that other marketplaces don't offer you what our market \ndoes, you come back and agree to open up your marketplace to American \nbusinesses and American workers. Then we will have reciprocal trade \nthat is fair to both sides, that is multilateral, and that is \nbeneficial to us, and the countries with whom we do trade agreements.\n  I believe we are about ready to have the chairman and ranking member \ncome.\n  I am very happy to offer an amendment as soon as they are interested \nin coming. I think they have lengthy opening statements. I will also \nhave an opening statement at some point to amplify these remarks. But I \nam anxious to offer an amendment this afternoon. I am anxious to have a \nvote on an amendment, for that matter. If they come and offer their \nmanagers' package, give their opening statements, and then let me be \nrecognized to offer an amendment, we could debate the amendment for an \nhour and then we could have a vote today. I would be happy to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The deputy majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota has been very \npatient and persuasive, as he always is. He has been in the Chamber on \nseveral different occasions wishing to speak. He has a lot to say about \nthis legislation. He has indicated he has a number of amendments. I \nhave spoken to him about some of the amendments. They sound pretty good \nto me.\n  The manager, Senator Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nshould be in the Chamber soon to lay down that managers' package. I was \nin touch with him just a few minutes ago. But he is not here now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3601-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, to this point, I have not come over and \nspoken on the issue before us; which is trade promotion authority, and \nthen all of the little cars that have been attached to this big, \npowerful, important engine. So while we are in the midst of doing these \nnegotiations, I want to simply make a few points.\n  Let me, first, say that I take a back seat to no Member of the Senate \nand to no one in public life in supporting trade. I am a free trader. I \nsupport trade. I think it is the most powerful engine for economic \ndevelopment in history. I would support a free trade policy worldwide. \nI am for trade promotion authority.\n  When Bill Clinton was President, I said it was an outrage that we did \nnot give him trade promotion authority. And I think it is an outrage \nthat we have not yet given it to President Bush. I am very hopeful we \nare going to give it to him. In fact, I am confident we are going to \ngive it to him. But I am a little bit concerned because what we have is \nsort of a gamesmanship going on. I guess ``hostage taking''\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n\nwould be the best analogy people would understand.\n  We have historically had a situation where the House has been very \nquestionable on the trade issue. Congressional districts tend to be \nsmall, especially in big States, and it is easy for individual Members \nto have very parochial interests. It is much harder for Senators \nbecause every Senator is a farm State Senator, every Senator has a \ndiversity of economic activity in their State. The net result of that \nis--not that Senators are wiser people than Members of the House; I \ndoubt if they are--we have consistently had over 70 Senators who have \nbeen pro-trade on issues we have used as measures of trade: giving \ntrade promotion authority, giving WTO membership to China, and other \ntrade-related issues.\n  So when the House passed trade promotion authority, in an \nextraordinary act of political leadership--I would have to say that \nnever in my adult lifetime have we had leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives as effective as the leadership team is today--never. \nTheir leadership, in passing trade promotion authority, was nothing \nshort of extraordinary. But once they did that, it was obvious to a \nblind man that we were going to pass trade promotion authority. And \nthen the question became, When and under what circumstances?\n  We passed a bill in the Finance Committee by an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan majority to send trade promotion authority to the floor.\n  I would have to say our trade promotion authority bill has some sort \nof silly statements in it, almost nonsensical. But the substance of the \nbill is excellent. I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member. \nAmerica is not going to get anything but richer, freer, and happier if \nwe adopt this trade promotion authority bill, and adopt it just as it \nis written. I do not intend to support an amendment to it.\n\n  If all we were doing were bringing trade promotion authority to the \nfloor, my guess is, in the end, we would get about 70 votes. But now, \nextraordinarily, we have people on my side of the aisle, who have never \nvoted for trade before, who are saying: Well, I will vote for trade \npromotion authority if you will add all these new entitlements, all \nthese new, committed, long-term spending programs. Well, great, but we \nalready have 20 too many votes. Lyndon Johnson used to say: If you can \nget more than 55 votes in the Senate, you gave away too much.\n  So I appreciate people who are willing to become the 71st or 72nd, \nbut the idea that we are going to put on all these new spending \nprograms, that will help bankrupt the country in the future, to get 71 \nvotes instead of 70, that is a nonstarter to me.\n  I also say to our Democrat colleagues, they need to pass this bill as \nbadly as we need to pass it because this bill is in America's interest.\n  When the votes are cast, we are probably going to get 44 or so, I \nguess, Republicans to vote for it, and my guess is we are going to get \n26, 27, 28 Democrats, after all is said and done, on a clean bill.\n  Republicans are more pro-trade than Democrats. But, look, Democrats \ndo not want to go to the high-tech industry of this country, which is \ncritically dependent on exports, and say: We killed fast track when the \nHouse passed it.\n  Now, why do I go to all this trouble to say both sides of the aisle \nare for this bill? The reason I do is, now that it is clear this bill \nis going to pass--it is going to pass by a big vote--all of a sudden \npeople are saying, well, look, we will not vote for it unless you pay \ntribute, unless you take some totally extraneous issue to trade \npromotion authority, and combine it, and create these massive new \nbenefits for people--and I am going to talk about that in just a \nmoment--unless you do that, we are not going to vote for it.\n  The point is, if we had a clean vote on trade promotion authority, \nunder the worst of circumstances, it would pass. It is true that the \nmajority probably could tie this up in parliamentary knots, and this \ncould go on and on and on, but who is kidding--I started to say, who is \nkidding whom, but I am not sure that is proper grammar.\n  This reminds me of the O. Henry story, Ransom of Red Chief, where a \ncouple of lowlifes kidnap a child, and this kid is a terrible brat.\n  So they contact the kid's parents asking for ransom, and they say, \nno, they don't want him back. And so the kidnappers are stuck with this \nkid. The story ends with the kidnappers paying the parents to take the \nchild back.\n  That is the game we have underway here. Our distinguished majority \nleader is saying to us: If we don't pass this new entitlement, we are \nnot going to pass trade promotion authority. Some people may be fooled, \nbut I am not fooled. I want to pass trade promotion authority, and I \nwant to pass it because I believe in it. But I don't believe I want to \npass it any worse than the majority leader wants to pass it.\n  This bluff may work. But I am a firm believer, if you know people \naren't going to shoot the hostage, don't pay the bribe.\n  Now, let's talk about the bribe. Here is where we are. We currently \nhave a law called trade adjustment assistance. In my opinion it is \nfundamentally wrong. What it says is the following: We have two \nworkers, Joe and Sarah. Sarah works for a company that is destroyed in \na terrorist attack, and Joe works for a company that becomes \nnoncompetitive and shuts down and is able to claim that foreign \ncompetition had something to do with it.\n  The person who works for the company that was destroyed in a \nterrorist attack gets unemployment insurance. That is it. But the \nperson who works for the company that became noncompetitive--something \nthat employee may well have had something to do with--gets much more \ngenerous benefits.\n  I don't understand that. We have two Americans. They both work for \ncompanies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used all his time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent for 10 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We have two workers in America. They both work. They are \nboth citizens. They are both guaranteed under the Constitution equal \nprotection of the law. Yet the worker whose business is destroyed in a \nterrorist attack--something they have had no ability to have any impact \non--gets one set of benefits. But a person who works for a company that \nbecomes noncompetitive and goes out of business gets an entirely \ndifferent and more generous set of benefits, even though we might argue \nat the margin--and I am not arguing it, but you might argue--that maybe \nthey could have had potentially some effect on it, whereas a worker \nwith a company that is destroyed by terrorism could have had no effect \non it.\n  I have always been struck with this trade adjustment assistance, how \nit can make sense to treat people differently, both of whom are \nunemployed, simply because one lost their job to foreign competition or \ncan claim it, and the other one can't.\n  Forget all that. That is an old injustice. I hadn't gotten over it. \nMaybe I should have.\n  But now we come along with a new trade adjustment assistance bill \nthat says, in addition to this more generous benefit package, we are \ngoing to give it not just to people who lose their jobs to foreign \ncompetition, we are going to give it to people who say their job was \nrelated to the job that was lost because they were suppliers, or that \ntheir job was related to the job that was lost because they were \nselling things to the people who lost their jobs. I guess in the \nextreme, if you are a dairyman and people at this factory were buying \nmilk, you could claim trade adjustment assistance.\n  Then they add a brand new extraordinary benefit, and that is the \nGovernment is now going to pay 73 percent of your health insurance when \nyou are unemployed. In fact, one of our colleagues today said that is \nthe amount you get if you are a Senator. Well, lose your election and \nfind out how much you get--zip, zero.\n  Here is the point: How can we justify taxing workers who don't get \nhealth insurance in their jobs when they are working to provide 73 \npercent of the health care cost for people who are unemployed? When we \ndon't have health insurance for many people who are working, how can we \njustify taxing them to pay for benefits for people who are unemployed? \nAnd if we provide this benefit, A, we are going to have to pay for it. \nAnd, B, how can we justify not\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\ngiving it to people who are working when we are giving it to people who \nare not working?\n  Currently only about one out of every four people who qualify for \ntrade adjustment assistance take the benefit. Most of them don't take \nit because it is more generous than unemployment, but it is generally \nnot as good as getting another job. I would say if you lost your job to \ntrade, trade promotes jobs generally, your chances of getting another \njob in the economy are probably better.\n  But in any case, I think the question we have to ask ourselves is the \nfollowing: If one-fourth of the people who are eligible take the \nbenefits now, don't you think the number will go up when the Government \nis going to pay 73 percent of their health care costs?\n  My guess is we might even see as much as a quadrupling of the people \nwho take trade adjustment assistance. We get numbers tossed around \nabout how many billions of dollars this new benefit will cost. But \nnobody knows because we don't know how we are going to change behavior \nwith it. And how many people who now go out and get a new job would not \ngo out and get a new job if they have 73 percent of their health care \ncosts being paid for while they are unemployed?\n  These are questions to which we have no answers. I remind my \ncolleagues, last week we discovered that a budget that had a huge \nsurplus last year was $130 billion in deficit this year, with us \nspending every penny of the Social Security surplus. Our colleagues \noften like to talk about it. They want to protect the Social Security \nsurplus. Yet we are talking about imposing a rider on this trade bill \nthat is going to cost billions of dollars, and every penny of it is \ngoing to come right out of the Social Security surplus. Much of it is \ngoing to be borrowed.\n  My view is that we should not pass this bill with this provision on \nit. It is subject to a point of order, or at least I believe it will be \nif we ever see the bill. It seems to me it is perfectly consistent--in \nfact, I think it is the definition of consistency--if we believe we \nneed trade promotion authority and we ought to have a freestanding vote \non it, and then if the Senate wants to bring up trade adjustment \nassistance, it ought to do that. But the idea of tying the two \ntogether--they didn't come out of the Finance Committee together--is \nfundamentally wrong.\n  There are a whole lot of other problems. For some reason, our \nDemocrat colleagues have concluded that while we are going to pay 71 \npercent of the health care bills for the people who are drawing this \ntrade adjustment assistance, we are not going to let them choose their \nhealth insurance.\n  Freedom is dangerous. If we start letting them choose their health \ninsurance, God knows what they are going to want to be able to choose \nnext.\n  So, extraordinarily, there is a provision in this bill that says you \nhave to buy exactly the same insurance you had when you had a job and \nyour company was a big part of buying the health insurance. How many \npeople who are unemployed--say you lost your job with General Motors \nwhere they are notorious for having benefits such as first-dollar \ncoverage--how many people want to be forced to buy that same benefit \nwhen they are unemployed?\n  Doesn't it seem logical to you that if you are unemployed, you might \ntake a higher deductible so the money you got from the Government would \nbuy you a larger share of your cost, so that the 29 percent you would \nhave had to pay could go to help send your children to college or buy a \ntraining program? Why do we have to make people buy the Cadillac health \ninsurance policy when they are unemployed, when they might choose to \nbuy the Chevrolet policy?\n  I have a very hard time understanding those who would impose this on \nus saying, no, you cannot let these people choose. My position is, if \nyou are going to provide this benefit, which, A, I don't believe we can \nafford and, B, I don't know how you justify giving to some people and \nnot others, why not let them pick and choose the health care coverage \nthat is best for them? Why not allow them to buy a Chevrolet policy \nwhen they were getting a Cadillac policy--when the company was paying \nfor almost all of it--when it is partly their money? I don't understand \nwhy we have to do that.\n  So I wanted to come over today to simply make a these points: One, I \nam for trade promotion authority. Two, I think we ought to pass it as a \nclean bill. Three, I assume there will be a point of order against \ntrade adjustment assistance, and it would be my intention to make the \npoint of order against that provision. There is not a point of order \nagainst trade promotion authority. So I am hopeful we can come to some \naccommodation.\n  Finally, the one thing you learn when you are a member of a \nlegislative body, such as the Senate, is that seldom do you get things \nthe way you want them, that almost always there is some kind of \ncompromise. I think we should pass trade promotion authority \nfreestanding. But if we do end up with a compromise on trade adjustment \nassistance, I think we are a long way from being there. I think it \nneeds to be very narrowly defined to be benefits for people who really \nlose their job due strictly to trade. I think you have to make this \nbenefit affordable, remembering you are going to be taxing working \npeople, who don't get health insurance, to buy Cadillac coverage for \npeople who are unemployed. How can anybody believe that is rational?\n  How would you justify at a town meeting if some guy stood up and \nsaid: I don't get it. I work at the local company that sells tires, and \nI change tires, and I don't get health insurance through my job. But \nyou are taxing me to buy first-dollar-coverage health insurance for \nsomebody who is unemployed. Why do you treat unemployed people better \nthan you treat employed people? I don't get it. I am not going to have \nto answer that question because I am going to say it is stupid, typical \nof Government, and I am not for it. Of course, normally, somebody back \nin the corner says: Yeah, but you were there when it happened. It \nalways bugs me when that happens. But it hasn't happened yet, and I am \ngoing to do my best to see that it doesn't happen. I wanted to cover \nall these issues.\n  I hope we can get on with trade promotion authority. I hope we can \nwork something out. I know the President wants this. There have been \nmore than 130 trade agreements reached worldwide, to date, of which we \nare not a part. When our trading partner, Mexico, has entered into nine \nfree trade agreements covering 26 countries and the U.S. has entered \ninto three trade agreements, NAFTA, Israel and Jordan, covering four \ncountries, and when we have not entered into these trade agreements \nbecause we don't have trade promotion authority, something is wrong. \nThis is the greatest trading country in the history of the world. I \nhope we can get on and pass the bill in a rational way.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we move more to a global \neconomy, I would note that the United States, over the course of time, \nhas been a driver of economic prosperity because of the ingenuity of \nour people, because of the technological prowess we have, and because \nof the edge we have over many other countries in our competitiveness \nwith regard to computers.\n  I think back to when we were in the great space race, after the \nSoviets had surprised us by launching the first satellite Sputnik--we \nfinally got Explorer up--and that shook the Nation to its core. Then \nsuddenly, the Soviets surprised us again by getting into orbit with a \nhuman, Yuri Gagarin, before we could ever get off the pad with Alan \nShepard trying to go into suborbit because we did not have a rocket \nthat was strong enough to get that Mercury capsule up into orbit.\n\n[[Page S3604]]\n\n  So we went into suborbit with two flights before, then 10 months \nafter, Gagarin. We finally launched John Glenn--a former Member of this \nbody--into orbit aboard an Atlas rocket, and the space race was on. \nThat was when there was that very significant leadership decision made \nby President Kennedy who said: We are going to the Moon and back in the \ndecade; and America put its efforts behind its will to succeed, and we \ndeveloped the technology which led us to get there and back safely \nbefore the Soviets did.\n  Finally, the Soviets abandoned their efforts to go to the Moon with a \nhuman because they did not have the sophistication we had in our \ncomputer technology, sophistication that could help direct a spacecraft \non reentry so that its trajectory could be such that human life would \nnot be completely eliminated because of the G forces on a spacecraft on \nreentry.\n  I give that as one illustration of America's creativity and \ninventiveness when we set our minds to it. Thus, in the globalization \nof our markets on trade, whatever the products may be, America has had \nan advantage. We use our educationally developed workforce, we develop \ntechnology, and that is what we are very good at: exporting around the \nworld. Thus, there is every reason for America to want to be engaged in \ninternational trade as long as it is free and fair trade. I am a free \ntrader. That is how I usually will vote. That is how I usually voted as \na Member of the House of Representatives over a 12-year period of \npublic service.\n\n  We are confronting an aspect of trade that concerns me because it is \nnot free and fair. It is going to affect one of the major economic \ninterests in my State of Florida. Many States have automobile license \ntags indicating something of particular interest to each State. So it \nis with the Florida automobile license tag. We have an image of an \norange emblazoned on our license tag, which is reflective of the \nconsiderable pride we have as well as the economic dominance of our \nFlorida citrus industry.\n  That industry is threatened. Its very existence is threatened. Frozen \nconcentrated Orange Juice production in Florida, is facing a life or \ndeath situation. I hope that as I continue to make speeches about the \nthreat to this industry, that the White House is listening to a State \nthat is very important to this White House. It was Florida, as we all \nknow, that won the Presidency. There is a lot at stake in our State. It \nhas to do with this trade bill.\n  Free and fair trade could quickly turn into a monopoly of trade for \nBrazil on frozen orange juice concentrate. It could turn into a \nmonopoly because Brazil produces approximately 50 percent of the world \nproduction of frozen orange juice concentrate. Florida produces 40 \npercent of the world production. That 40 percent supplies the domestic \nmarket for orange juice. Indeed, it has been the Florida Citrus \nCommission advertising over the last half century that now causes \norange juice to be a staple on breakfast tables in America.\n  We find growers in Brazil forming, in essence, a cartel, which can \nstart dumping extra product on the market, undercutting the price for \nFlorida, and running Florida out of the business if there isn't a \ntariff protecting our domestic market from the invasion of Brazilian \nfrozen orange juice.\n  That brings me to the trade bill. The trade bill puts that protective \ntariff at risk, unless we can attach an amendment to the bill offered \nby Senator Graham and myself, an amendment that would not apply just to \norange juice but to other commodities, as well. The amendment says if \nthere is an order in place by either the International Trade Commission \nor the Department of Commerce, an order in place indicating that there \nis anticompetitive behavior, then you cannot reduce the tariff until \nafter that order is taken off.\n  That is common sense. If there is anticompetitive behavior, in the \nform of dumping, and therefore trying to run down the price by dumping, \nthat is not free and fair trade. Or if there is another type of order \nfrom the Department of Commerce in place, a countervailing duty order \nthat says a foreign government is subsidizing that product of that \nforeign country in order to give them a competitive advantage, that, in \nessence, is anticompetitive market behavior. If that kind of order is \nin place, you cannot reduce the tariff until those two respective \norganizations--the International Trade Commission and the Department of \nCommerce--have removed their orders.\n  It does not have to be orange juice. It could be steel. It could be \nhoney in a State like Montana. It could be salmon production from the \nPacific Northwest. It could be any of these products on which there are \norders against foreign competitors that have been participating in \nanticompetitive activities. That is why we have the protection of these \norders from either the International Trade Commission or the Department \nof Commerce. Until those orders are lifted because the anticompetitive \nbehavior of the foreign companies disappears, we cannot reduce the \ntariff.\n\n  It is my hope the good common sense of this type of approach will be \nrecognized by the administration. They think they have the votes to \npass the trade promotion authority bill in this body--they may--but I \nam going to keep raising this issue. Somebody needs to keep raising it. \nThen, again, maybe they don't have the votes. Or maybe they don't have \nthe votes within the timeframe they think they have.\n  It is a matter of ultimate fairness of free and fair competition in \nthe global marketplace that we are trying to achieve at the end of the \nday, which is free and fair trade. Thus, I wanted to bring to the \nattention of the Senate and the White House my renewed plea on behalf \nof Senator Graham and myself, with regard to the interests of the \nFlorida citrus industry, that the administration should be willing to \nwork with Congress to accept this amendment for the protection of free \nand fair and truly competitive international trade.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson).

Madam President, I rise to discuss the U.S. Independent \nFilm and Television Production Incentive Act of 2001. We are going to \nbegin the debate about trade and the initiative of being a part of the \nglobal economy. We are going to talk about trade as an important tool \nin helping to revive and build our economy in our great Nation, as well \nas building jobs and certainly educating our workforce and building \nindustries in our country that are going to be part of this global \neconomy in which we find ourselves. The U.S. Independent Film and \nTelevision Production Incentive Act of 2001 is a bill designed for \nthose purposes.\n  This is a bill designed to address the problem of runaway film and \ntelevision production which is a major trade-related issue which costs \nour Nation billions of dollars each year.\n  Over the past decade, production of American film projects has fled \nour borders for foreign locations, a migration that results in a \nmassive loss for the U.S. economy. My legislation will encourage \nproducers to bring feature film and television production projects back \nto the cities and towns across the great United States, thereby \nstemming the loss we have seen in our economy from those runaway films.\n  In recent years, a number of foreign governments have offered tax and \nother incentives designed to entice the production of U.S. motion \npictures and television programs to their countries. Certain countries \nhave been particularly successful in luring film projects to their \ntowns and cities through such offers as large tax subsidies.\n  These governments understand the benefits of hosting such productions \ndo not flow only to the film and television industry; these productions \ncreate ripple effects, with revenues and jobs generated in a variety of \nlocal businesses: Hotels and restaurants, catering companies, equipment \nrental facilities, transportation vendors, even our State parks and \nother wonderful characteristics that each of our States has such an \nindividual way of expressing and the wonderful things they have to \noffer, and many other benefits that fall into this ripple effect.\n  What became a trickle has now become, however, a flood, a significant \ntrend affecting both the film and television industry as well as the \nsmaller businesses they support.\n  Many specialized trades involved in film production and many of the \nsecondary industries that depend on film production, such as equipment \nrental companies, require consistent demand to operate profitably.\n  This production migration has forced many small and medium-size \ncompanies out of business during the last 10 years. Earlier this year, \na report by the U.S. Department of Commerce estimated that runaway \nproductions drain as much as $10 billion per year from the U.S. \neconomy. These are dollars on which we have depended, that have been a \nvibrant part of our smalltown communities across the United States as \nwell, places where we have seen wonderful movie productions because of \nthe tremendous amount of incredible scenery our States produce.\n  These losses have been most pronounced in made-for-television movies \nand mini-series productions. According to the report, out of 308 U.S.-\ndeveloped television movies produced in 1998, 139 were produced abroad. \nThat is a significant increase from the 30 that were produced abroad in \n1990.\n  The report makes a compelling case that runaway film and television \nproduction has eroded important segments of a vital American industry.\n  According to official labor statistics, more than 270,000 jobs in the \nU.S. are directly involved in film production. By industry estimates, \n70 to 80 percent of these workers are hired at the location where the \nproduction is filmed. Those would be the workers in the small \ncommunities of my State as well as the State of the Presiding Officer.\n  While people may associate the problem of runaway production with \nCalifornia, the problem has seriously affected the economies of cities \nand States across the country, given that film production and \ndistribution have been among the highest growth industries in the last \ndecade. It is an industry with a reach far beyond Hollywood and the \nwest coast.\n  Even we in Arkansas feel it. For example, my home State of Arkansas \nhas been proud to host the production of a number of feature and \ntelevision films, with benefits both economic and cultural. Our \ncinematic history includes opening scenes of ``Gone With the Wind'' and \ncivil war epics such as ``The Blue and The Gray'' and ``North and \nSouth.'' It also includes ``A Soldier's Story,'' ``Biloxi Blues,'' \n``The Legend of Boggy Creek,'' and most recently, ``Sling Blade,'' an \nindependent production written by, directed by, and starring Arkansas' \nown Billy Bob Thornton.\n  So even in our rural State of Arkansas, there is a great deal of \nlocal interest and support for the film industry. My bill will make it \npossible for us to continue this tradition, and we hope to encourage \nmore of these projects to come to Arkansas and to other States across \nour Nation.\n  To do this, we need to level the playing field. This bill will assist \nin that effort. It will provide a two-tiered wage tax credit, equal to \n25 percent of the first $25,000 of qualified wages and salaries and 35 \npercent of such costs if they are incurred in a low-income community, \nfor productions of films, television or cable programming, mini-series, \nepisodic television, pilots or movies of the week that are \nsubstantially produced in the United States.\n  This credit is targeted to the segment of the market most vulnerable \nto the impact of runaway film and television production. It is, \ntherefore, only available if total wage costs are more than $200,000 \nand less than $10 million, which is indexed for inflation. The credit \nis not available to any production subject to reporting requirements\n\n[[Page S3606]]\n\nof section 18 of the United States Code 2257 pertaining to films and \ncertain other media with sexually explicit conduct.\n  My legislation enjoys the support of a broad alliance of groups \naffected by the loss of U.S. production, including the following: \nnational, State, and local film commissions, under the umbrella \norganization Film US as well as the Entertainment Industry Development \nCorporation; film and television producers, Academy of Television Arts \nand Sciences, the Association of Independent Commercial Producers, the \nAmerican Film Marketing Association and the Producers Guild; \norganizations representing small businesses, such as the postproduction \nfacilities, the Southern California Chapter of the Association of \nImaging Technology and Sound; equipment rental companies, Production \nEquipment Rental Association; and organizations representing the \ncreative participants in the entertainment industry, the Directors \nGuild of America, the Screen Actors Guild, and the Recording Musicians \nAssociation.\n  All of these are great Americans who want to keep their work in our \ncountry, but if it is cost prohibitive, if the objectives and the \nincentives that are provided by these other nations are given to this \nindustry that we do not provide, what other choices are they given \nother than to take those jobs, to take those wages, out of our country \nand take them somewhere else?\n\n  In addition, the U.S. Conference of Mayors formally adopted the \nRunaway Film Production Resolution at their annual conference in June.\n  Leveling the playing field through targeted tax incentives will keep \nfilm production, and the jobs and revenues it generates, in the United \nStates.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, as we talk about trade, as we talk about \nbeing a part of this global economy, as we talk about creating the jobs \nwe want, that we have, and we would like to keep in the United States, \nto join me in supporting this bill in order to prevent the further \ndeterioration of one of America's most important industries, and the \nthousands of jobs and businesses that depend on it.\n  Think of what it could do for small towns, for the main streets of \nAmerica, to have a film produced there. They would not only have the \ncultural advantage, the economic advantage but the sense of pride and \njoy in being able to keep this industry in our country and doing what \neverybody can be most proud of, and that is sharing our home States and \nall of the many things we are all proud of in our home States in the \nproduction of American films.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3606-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3606-S3607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, as in morning business, I will talk a \nlittle bit about an issue that I think is probably the most paramount \nissue in the State of Arkansas and also probably the most paramount \nissue across this great Nation, and that is the issue of the Medicare \ncoverage of prescription drugs for our elderly. We have debated this \nissue for quite some time. I advocated that Congress add a universal \nvoluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare when I first started \ncampaigning for the Senate in 1998. Five years later, we still have not \npassed a plan. We have to begin moving forward on this initiative, as I \nlook across the great State of Arkansas and recognize the number of \nelderly in my State who would benefit from such a plan.\n  More importantly, we also have to look at how we as a government, in \nthe economics of today, would benefit from a prescription drug plan for \nour elderly. If we do not want to do it for the quality of life for our \nelderly relatives, our grandparents, our parents, and all of those we \nlove and adore, we should at least want to do it for the economics of \nthis country because we know, without a doubt, particularly in rural \nAmerica, that in providing a prescription drug package we are going to \nsave dollars down the road because we prevent those elderly, when they \nare on a prescription drug, from having to have the more costly acute \nhospitalization or nursing care, or perhaps some of the more expensive \nhome health care which they might need if we can simply keep them on a \nprescription drug plan that they so drastically need.\n  Both structure and costs of the benefit have been the main issues \nholding us up, but we have to move beyond those difficulties and those \nproblems that we have in structuring cost.\n\n  I think back to last summer and some of the other members of the \nSenate Finance Committee with whom I was working. We were moving \nforward on coming together with a good compromise and working through \nthe details of what we could see as being a beneficial plan for \neveryone in this country. Then, unfortunately, the events of 9-11 \noccurred. We, in the Congress, obviously, have had a great deal to deal \nwith since then. We have talked about homeland security, our airport \nsecurity, our national security, and the foreign affairs that come \nalong with all of the issues we have dealt with since 9-11.\n  I do sincerely believe that now is the time we must remember what are \nthe most important issues with which we have to deal on the homefront, \nparticularly before we conclude this Congress. We must begin now with a \nprescription drug package if we clearly intend to come up with \nsomething by the end of this session, and I think we must look \nearnestly, not only at what we can afford but, more importantly, how we \ncan get the biggest bang for that buck and how we can be assured that \nthe majority of the elderly, particularly those who are in the greatest \nneed, will receive a benefit package. Seniors need this now more than \never. We have to enact that benefit which is adequately funded and \nguaranteed to be universal, affordable, and accessible.\n  We have looked at some of the plans that have come out recently, and, \nunfortunately, they do fall very far short of what our seniors need. \nMuch of the money has gone into some of the private areas that actually \npresent me with great concern. Medicare+Choice, for instance, the last \nthree Medicare+Choice plans in Arkansas were pulled out the end of \nDecember of last year. Not a single one of those three plans offered a \nprescription drug package. Medigap in Arkansas is disproportionately \nhigher in cost than it is nationwide. So it does not provide the \nservice, it does not provide the safety net, it does not provide the \nbenefits that Arkansans need, and it comes at an exceptionally high \nprice.\n  We have to look at putting competition in, but we have to make sure \nit is a benefit package that is going to work for all areas of this \ngreat country. We want to continue to work on this. Rural beneficiaries \nin my State are more likely to have poor health and lower incomes than \nseniors living in urban areas. They also use more prescription drugs.\n\n  That is one of the reasons I am here today. This is an extremely \npowerful issue in America and across rural America. We are only as \nstrong as our weakest link. If rural America happens to be that weak \nlink now, we must address those problems. Putting a plan into place \nthat only gets at the problems of the urban areas or the highly \npopulated areas is not going to work because it will continue draining \nthe overall system in rural areas.\n  In Arkansas, 60 percent of seniors live in rural areas. I am \nextremely concerned about the limited prescription drug coverage \navailable to them. Only 14 percent of Arkansas employers offer retiree \nhealth insurance. Only 2 percent of rural Arkansans are enrolled in \nmanaged care, which goes to show one size does not fit all. We have to \ncome up with a comprehensive plan that has enough flexibility that we \ncan make it fit all regions of this great Nation, but that we can do so \nin a way that is cost effective and cost efficient.\n  Medicare+Choice plans do not work in our rural States anymore, and \nMedigap coverage is out of reach for most seniors.\n  This is an essential issue with which we have to deal. We must come \ntogether. We must come up with a compromise. We must come up with a \nsound policy that will not only provide the quality of life we want for \nour loved ones but also a huge part of stabilizing our economy in this \ngreat country in a time when health care has blown completely out of \nproportion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend from Florida would withhold for a minute, we \nare near the time where the majority leader will come to the floor. It \nshould be\n\n[[Page S3607]]\n\nanother 10 minutes. Is that adequate time for the Senator?\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Florida be recognized for up \nto 10 minutes to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I compliment the Senator from \nArkansas for her excellent statement about health care. As the Senator \npointed out the need for a prescription drug benefit to modernize \nMedicare, it reminded me of an unbelievable story. I don't know that it \nis fact, but it sounded pretty solid.\n  The White House is floating a plan that someone on home health care \nwould have to have a copay through Medicare in order to get that \nservice. Certainly in our part of the country, home health care is an \nalternative to the more expensive care of a nursing home, and clearly \nit is a lot more expensive being in a hospital. And home health care, \ndespite the expense, is clearly a lot better quality of life for the \nsenior citizen than being in a nursing home or in a hospital if they \ncan be medically treated appropriately and successfully in home health \ncare.\n  The Senator talked so eloquently about medical care in the State of \nArkansas. Would it not be devastating to senior citizens to have a \ncopay on home health care that they now do not have under Medicare?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. In some areas, it has gotten difficult even finding \nhome health care that will serve rural areas. Certainly for myself, \nwith aging parents who are at home and independent, home health care is \nessential.\n  If the question is whether or not they will serve and whether or not \nthose individuals can afford or are able to provide a copay, it will be \ndevastating.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, 49 percent of the people have an \nadjusted gross income of $20,000 or less. We are a snapshot of what the \nrest of the Nation is going to be like. Florida has a lot of retirees \nand elderly, but for us as a percentage of our population, we rank in \nthe top three. We are clearly a snapshot of where the rest of the \ncountry is going to be in terms of the percentage of our elderly \npopulation and the lack of services. Because we are rural, we have that \nlack of services.\n  Even the urban areas will be without the services if we do not look \nat Medicare reform and we do not start now looking at the ways we can \nmake health care delivery more affordable. Prescription drugs is the \nmost reasonable place to start. We have the technology, we have the \ndevelopment of pharmaceuticals that can help provide that quality of \nlife, and we have home health care out there that can help keep down \nthe costs of acute hospitalization, acute care in nursing homes, and \nother areas.\n  Making it cost prohibitive does not increase the availability or the \naccessibility of health care. We can keep our loved ones in their homes \nand cared for at a reasonable cost, the Senator is exactly right.\n  It is so important to recognize we need to start now. We are so \nunderprepared as a nation as to what will happen in the next 15 to 20 \nyears when the baby boomers hit 65 and we have no geriatricians, no \nphysicians, and a nursing shortage. The State of Massachusetts lost 25 \nor 26 nursing homes last year, all of which were 85 percent or better \noccupied.\n  We are not preparing ourselves for what will happen with our \npopulation, which is going to increase phenomenally in the aged \ncategory. Home health care and providing it in a way that is cost \neffective is absolutely essential. The Senator from Florida knows, and \nI am with him without a doubt, we have to make sure we focus on this \nissue. We need to do it sooner rather than later.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is amazing to me where they come up with \nthe ideas from the administration to get savings out of Medicare, \nparticularly when they start talking about making senior citizens pay \ncopays on home health care, which is an activity that is desirable and \nsaves money in the long run by giving seniors an alternative to the \nhospital and nursing homes that are so much more expensive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3607-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3607-S3608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMANDER SCOTT SPEICHER\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I rise to address a subject \nthat is heavy on my heart. It goes back to 1991. The first American \nshot down and declared dead in the gulf war was Commander Scott \nSpeicher of the U.S. Navy from Jacksonville, FL. He was pronounced by \nthe Department of Defense, indeed, the then-Secretary of Defense, as \nhaving been killed in action.\n  We have learned over the intervening 11 years, the evidence strongly \nsuggests Commander Speicher survived being shot down. That credible \nintelligence report indicates that someone who drove him from the crash \nsite to the hospital has stepped forward as an eyewitness. For 11 \nyears, his family in Jacksonville have pondered the question, Is he \nalive?\n  This is truly a gripping human drama. But it is just that more \ngripping because the U.S. military has a creed among pilots that when \nyou have to punch out, you are going to have a rescue team that will \ncome get you. Against all odds, they will come, try to find you, and \nget you out alive.\n  This awful question hangs over the CDR Scott Speicher case that we \nabandoned him.\n  So 11 years later, what we need to do is to use every avenue to try \nto find out, is he alive? Is he in Iraq? If he is, we need to get him \nout. If he is not, we need to find out the specific circumstances that \nled to his death after his apparent surviving being shot down in the \nIraqi desert.\n  A couple of our Senators have been involved in this case: Senator Bob \nSmith of New Hampshire and Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas. There is a \nKansas connection with Commander Speicher. I kind of backed into this \nsituation recently when I saw an opening, and I took it.\n  I was in Damascus, Syria, and spoke to some of our Embassy staff. Did \nthey have any information? They had inquired of the Syrian Government a \nyear ago and had no reply. So later that day, I found myself with \nSenator Shelby and Congressman Cramer in a 2-hour meeting with the \nSyrian President, President Assad, the son of the long-time Syrian \nPresident who had died a couple of years ago and has been succeeded by \nhis son. I saw the opening, and I took it.\n  I asked the Syrian President if he would use his good offices and \ntask his intelligence apparatus to see what they could find out from \nIraq and their contacts with Iraqi intelligence activities.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to continue \nuntil such time as the majority leader arrives.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we do it for a time certain because he may never \narrive.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Five minutes?\n  Mr. REID. How about 5 o'clock?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from Nevada, our wonderful \nassistant majority leader.\n  This is a very important case that I wanted to explain to the Senate.\n  We were sitting there with the young President, with whom we have \nsignificant differences of opinion in the Middle Eastern crisis. We \ntalked to him about Hezbollah and suggested he should pull off his \nsupport of that terrorist activity. We thanked him for his help with \nregard to our going after al-Qaida--and they have been helpful. We \nthanked him for his support, protecting our United States interests in \nSyria, particularly our Embassy that has no setback from the street in \nDamascus. At the time we were there, there was a 100,000-person \ndemonstration. Of course, they had the riot police lined up shoulder to \nshoulder to protect our Ambassador's residence as well as the Embassy.\n  But I saw the opening. I asked him, and he said he would.\n  Later on, as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, suddenly I \nfound myself face to face, right over here in our Foreign Relations \nCommittee room in the Capitol, with the Prime Minister of Lebanon. I \ntold him the story. I told him the gripping story of a family; the \nchildren want to know, is their daddy alive? And the Prime Minister of \nLebanon, Rafic Hariri, said he, too, would see through his good offices \nand his intelligence apparatus if they could find out any information.\n  I have spoken to Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Myers,\n\n[[Page S3608]]\n\nabout asking. I have spoken to Secretary Rumsfeld, as recently as 35 \nminutes ago, about this case.\n  Because it is Iraq, it puts someone such as Secretary Rumsfeld in a \ndifficult situation because he naturally is concerned, as we all are, \nabout wanting to take out Saddam Hussein who, if he has not built, he \ncertainly will be trying to build, weapons of mass destruction. We are \ngoing to have to protect the position of the United States and the free \nworld by not letting him do that. So it makes it difficult for us at \nthis particular time, trying to get information. It is so important in \nthis gripping human drama.\n  In the late 1990s, the Department of Defense actually changed the \nstatus of Commander Speicher from ``killed in action'' to ``missing in \naction.'' At some point, with further evidence, it may well be that \nthey will consider changing the status, if the evidence is there, from \n``missing in action'' to ``prisoner of war.'' That, of course, would be \nwelcome news because that would mean that he is alive. Then we would \nhave to address the question of how to get him home to his loved ones.\n  It is going to take the attention of a lot of people. I have written \nto the Embassies in that region of the world, asking our Ambassadors to \nask their friends and their contacts, to see if we can get a little \nsnippet of information. We owe this to the family. But we owe it to \nevery military pilot, past, present, and future, who needs to have the \nconfidence to know, if they are shot down, the rescue forces are coming \nto get them and we are not going to abandon them.\n  There is now talk that Iraq will invite a delegation to come to \ninvestigate. If it is another charade, as were some of the \ninvestigations as to whether or not there are weapons of mass \ndestruction, then that is not going to be profitable. It should be a \nhigh-level delegation so it will be accorded the respect of the \nreceiving Iraqi Government in order that access will be given. For \nexample, this eyewitness account that he was driven to the hospital \nfrom the crash site--what hospital? Let's see the records of the \nhospital. If he was released from the hospital, where was he sent? Was \nhe sent to a prison? What prison? Let's see the records of that prison. \nLet's see tangible evidence so we can know the fate of CDR Scott \nSpeicher.\n  The Nation owes this to our military. The Nation owes it to Commander \nSpeicher's family.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to share this matter with the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed for 10 minutes as in morning business. I understand the leader \nand others will momentarily be on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3608-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3608-S3609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, my plea is to the brothers and sisters \nin the lodge this afternoon. It came to mind last evening, when I met \nwith the maritime folks that if our Amtrak is about to be phased out in \nOctober, and rail transportation is about to end for the passengers, \nand if the airlines are all in financial difficulty, we need more \nAmerican construction, American ships, crewed with American crews, and \nthose kinds of things. Yet we are just about to pass a wonderful farm \nbill.\n  They have gotten together in a compromise on the farm legislation. \nThis Senator has supported agriculture for nearly 50 years in public \noffice. In fact, I took my farmers to the west coast. I found out, back \n40 years ago, that our total farm income in South Carolina was around \n$380 million, and out in Orange County, CA, one county had $384 million \nin total farm income. So they knew something more about agriculture \nthan we did. And we had a 100-year start in agriculture in the little \nState of South Carolina before they had even founded California.\n  So I have been in the vanguard, in the forefront of developing our \ncorn and our soybeans. The grain elevator was constructed when I was \nGovernor. I could go on down the list of the different caucuses we have \ndeveloped and the trips we made with the farmers to the markets \noverseas.\n  Just please, I ask my farm friends, don't give me this protectionism \ntalk about we are ruining trade and trade relations and trade \nagreements, having gotten all the subsidies, all the protection you \ncould possibly imagine.\n  They have gotten this 73-some-odd-billion-dollar farm bill. They get \nall the subsidies, which I support. And I hope the Senate supports it. \nThey get the Ex-Im Bank to finance.\n  I see one of my agricultural Senator friends coming to the Chamber. I \nam sure he is not going to talk about protectionism. I am trying to get \nsome of the farm votes to help us on fast track.\n  Then they get the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. They get \nall the help.\n  I experienced this when I campaigned out in Iowa in the '80s. They \nhad me on an early morning news show there in Des Moines, and they \nsaid: Senator, how do you come from a textile State with all that \nprotection and subsidies, and you expect to get the farm vote? They had \nno idea I did not get any subsidies. I was just trying to hold on to \nthe jobs that we had.\n  So we need the farmers' help. Don't talk about Public Law 480. I know \none of the Senators from Iowa has a favorite. After he gets his \nsubsidies, then he comes on the floor and he says: No. We want to ship \nour PL-480s, our agriculture, under this Federal act to the other \ncountries of the world because we can do it cheaper.\n  Well, we can produce agriculture cheaper, too. We almost did with the \nFreedom to Farm Act, but it did not work. But it can be done. So don't \ngive us: Let's do away with it, having gotten all of mine, then I want \nyours, too. In essence, the farmers ought to wake up.\n  I want to show what has happened in agriculture with these charts I \nhave in the Chamber. This chart shows that in 1996, under the \nDepartment of Commerce figures, we exported more than $8 billion of \ncorn annually. And you can see where it has gone. It went down in the \nyear 2000 to about $4.5 billion. Now, why?\n  The Chinese are not only producing textiles, they are producing corn.\n  I followed the statistical flow downwards of wheat. I asked about the \nChinese, how do they do it? And the answer is, they are very clever. \nNow they are shipping their wheat to Korea, Japan, and other places, \nand still importing ours so as to keep an appearance of the need for \nwheat. But, actually, they are exporting more than they are importing.\n  Let's look at the agriculture surpluses from the chart I have in the \nChamber. I want everyone to know that we are not only losing our \nmanufacturing capability, our industrial backbone, but the United \nStates has lost agriculture surplus since NAFTA.\n  Beginning in 1994 we had about a $1 billion surplus with Mexico and \nCanada in agriculture. Now that we have free trade, free trade, free \ntrade, we have a deficit of close to $1.5 billion. Well, we are bound \nto lose with the higher standard of living in the United States of \nAmerica. We are bound to lose some industrial jobs. But we are going to \npick up agriculture.\n  Ah, no, sirree, we did not pick it up. They are losing their shirt \nand don't even know it. That is what we want our farmer Senators to \nknow about. They are losing their shirt and don't even know it. They \nhave been going out of business. And you are going back home and \nsaying: Look, look what we have done. We have helped you. You need even \nmore protection.\n  Here is what has happened with respect to citrus. We went from a $700 \nmillion surplus to about $650 million surplus in our exports. We have \nour Senator here who said it was sort of immoral. We had a moral \nobligation to go along with the Andean trade pact. They needed help. We \nare trying to get them out of drugs and tell them to grow bananas and \npineapples. That is what it is all about.\n  What do you think we have gotten from Colombia? Not a thing in that\n\n[[Page S3609]]\n\nagreement. From Ecuador, from Bolivia? We did not get anything in that \none-way agreement. But here is what happened with citrus.\n  Now, I do not like to be vindictive or seem to be petty, but I would \nlike to come down to the 17-percent tariff on textiles from the Andean \ncountries and bring citrus down from 50 percent--50 percent, I say to \nthe Senator--down to the 17 percent.\n  Tell these citrus boys, tell these agriculture boys, don't talk about \nChina and Japan and India, be fair, be fair; Mexico, be fair. Let's be \nfair to each other. We are all U.S. Senators. We represent one country. \nAnd we represent agriculture.\n  I have agriculture and I have textiles. I have steel. I told a story \nabout Nucor. I am glad President Bush acted.\n  Here is wheat. Where are those wheat farmers? In 1996, we exported \nmore than $6 billion in Durum wheat. In 2001, we exported less than \n$3.5 billion.\n  You are going out of business, Senator. You are gone. I am losing my \ntextiles. You are losing your wheat. They can give us a little tin cup \nand we can stand out on the sidewalk and beg because you and I are \nbeing put out of business. You are a leader here on trying to awake the \ntown and tell the people.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from South Carolina would yield \nfor a question.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would be delighted to yield, if we have time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3609-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3609-S3610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, because of the previous unanimous consent, \ntime is almost gone for the Senator. I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator be recognized for another 10 minutes. And I announce, on behalf \nof the majority leader, there will be no votes this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask the Senator from South Carolina, \nisn't it the case that the chart that the Senator shows on durum wheat \nstarts showing a collapse--actually, if the chart started back a bit, \nit would start showing a collapse almost immediately following the \nU.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. That was a Free Trade Agreement where \nClayton Yeutter, who was then our trade ambassador--he had a great \ndisposition. He smiled all the time. And you always felt like the Sun \nwas shining and everything was right, nothing was wrong.\n  So Clayton Yeutter went up to negotiate with Canada on our behalf, \nand he came back with the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement.\n  We didn't learn it until later, but he had just traded away the \ninterests of American farmers because what happened to us was an \navalanche of unfairly subsidized grain that came into our country from \nthe Canadian Wheat Board, which is a state monopoly. It would be \nillegal in this country. But in Canada they shoved all this grain into \nour country. And then when we went up to try to find out what the \nprices were so that we could take action against Canada, the Canadian \nWheat Board said: Go fly a kite. We don't intend to show you any \ninformation.\n  We have done that for years. The result is that our farmers have been \ndevastated by this unfair trade. This all comes from Clayton Yeutter's \nnegotiations with the Canadians; is that not the case?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is the case. The distinguished Senator from North \nDakota has followed this in a judicious fashion. He and I have worked \ntogether, but he has really been the leader to get some sensibility and \nattention to the dilemma. All we ask on the floor of the Senate is a \nchance to do our job. In article I, section 8 of the Constitution, it \nis not the President, not the Supreme Court, but the Congress that \nshall regulate foreign commerce. This is so we can look at these little \nside deals and the things that were negotiated that we didn't know \nabout, as the distinguished Senator points out.\n  The lawyers on K Street and the White House make the need for fast \ntrack up. They fix the vote. They don't call it until they have a 60-\nvote margin to cut off debate. Here we have been waiting dutifully to \nput up our amendments. And there has been a little difficulty on \nfinalizing the leadership amendment, but once it is filed, we are ready \nto go. We have been ready to go.\n  Don't blame us for holding this up for however many days. We are not \ntrying to hold it up. We are just asking the Senate, please kill this \nso-called fast track. We haven't had it for the past several years. \nThere have been some 200 agreements without fast track. That is what \nthe Senator from North Dakota is speaking to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for an additional question.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There are so many issues we could talk about--beef to \nJapan, automobiles from Korea. Let me talk about this issue of wheat \nfrom Canada for a moment. It is a fascinating issue. There was a woman \nfrom North Dakota who married a Canadian and moved up to Canada. She \ncame back for Thanksgiving or Christmas to North Dakota. And when she \nwas back on the farm, her father said: Take up a couple bags of wheat. \nShe was going to mill that back up in Canada and make bread because we \nhave great spring wheat for making great hard bread. She took back a \ngrocery sack full of wheat. All the way back to the Canadian border she \nmet 18-wheel trucks full of Canadian wheat coming south--hundreds and \nhundreds of trucks, millions of bushels, every day, every hour.\n  But when she got to the border with two grocery bags full of grain \nshe was going to grind in order to make bread, they told her: You can't \ntake two grocery sacks full of American wheat into Canada. She had to \npour it on the ground at the border, despite the fact that all the way \nup she met Canadian 18-wheel trucks hauling Canadian wheat south. She \ncouldn't get two grocery bags full through the border near Canada.\n  How did we end up with that? A circumstance where they are hauling \nall that grain, coming south from Canada in an unfair way, but you \ncan't get two grocery bags full into Canada because of a trade \nagreement negotiated by people who were basically incompetent and \ntraded away the interests of American farmers.\n\n  Yet here we are being told: Let's not fix the trade agreements we \nhave problems with. Let's give the President the authority to do new \ntrade agreements.\n  My message is very simple: Fix a few of the problems, just a few, \nstart fixing a few. Demonstrate that there is some backbone in this \ncountry to stand up, to have the nerve and the will to fix some trade \nproblems. Then come to us and talk about the next negotiation. But only \nthen and not until then. Fix a few problems first.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. As the Senator has pointed out, the blasphemy is that \nthe most productive farmer in the world is the American farmer. The \nmost productive industrial worker in the world is the American \nindustrial worker. What is not producing is us the Congress. Forty \nyears ago, we produced poultry in South Carolina. We produced peaches--\nin fact, more peaches than the State of Georgia. I landed in Europe. I \nhad the same experience. Leave that on the plane and destroy it. You \nare not bringing fresh peaches in here, they told me. You are not \nbringing your poultry in here.\n  Rules are rules. This isn't aid. This is trade. Everybody looks out \nfor the agricultural strength of their nations. That is what we are \nelected to office to do. But Heaven above, you would think I was a \nCommunist or something in here trying to stop fast track. Fast track is \na dirty, no good political gimmick. Everybody knows that. Yet they \ncontinue to go on with this thing to get a fix and not take the \nresponsibility. And then when they have to explain it: Well, it was \ntake it or leave it. I wanted to support the President and everything.\n  Of course, we all want to support the President. But that is the \nstory. Here it is. We are losing out agriculturally, and the Chinese \nare the ones winning. When you have 1.3 billion people, they can \nproduce more than our 280 million. They have 600 or 700 million \nfarmers, at least, or more. How many million farmers do we have?\n  We have about 3.5 million farmers in the United States of America. \nThey are outstanding. I am not belittling them in any sense. But 3.5 \nmillion can't produce what 700 million Chinese farmers produce, and at \nthe cost and everything else like that. They don't have\n\n[[Page S3610]]\n\nthe environmental rules and regs and everything else of that kind.\n  I appreciate the body yielding the floor. My plea is, let's be fair \nto each other. Just don't come here and try to do away with the Jones \nAct now when we are trying to build America. Please don't do away with \nthe industrial strength of the United States, pointing a finger: You \nare a protectionist; we are not going to start protectionism.\n  That is what built the country--good, strong protectionism.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator be given 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask if the Senator will yield for a question. The \nSenator comes to the floor often and talks about Ricardo and the \ndoctorate of comparative advantage. I used to teach a little economics \nin college. There is no doctrine of comparative advantage in most of \nthese unfair trade circumstances. Most of what has happened with \nrespect to advantage is political; that is, the political system of the \ncountry decides we are going to have a state monopoly which trades in \nyour country.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. So decisions are made to allow 12-year-old kids to work \nin a manufacturing plant for 12 cents an hour. That is unfair. \nManufacturing plants to operate without safe working places. \nManufacturers will dump chemicals into the streams and the air and send \nthe product to the store shelves in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles and \nFargo and Charlotte. That is unfair. These are political decisions in \ncountries around the world about the conditions of production.\n  People listen to the Senator from South Carolina, and some are going \nto say: It is the same old stuff. He just wants to be a protectionist.\n  In my judgment, there is nothing wrong with protecting American \ninterests and requiring fair trade. If that is what protecting is \nabout, sign me up. I want to protect our country's economic interests. \nBut I believe the Senator from South Carolina feels as I do. I support \nexpanded trade. I believe expanded trade is healthy. I believe we can \ncompete anywhere in the world. But I demand fair trade. When trade is \nnot fair, this country has a responsibility to stand up for its \nproducers. It has failed to do that time and time again. Is that not \nthe case?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is the case. The unfairness of it is here in the \n``Foreign Trade Barriers'' book from 10 years ago. I think we spotted \nit with about 260 pages and 10 years hence that we got free trade. We \nare getting rid of the barriers, remember. We are helping out \nagriculture by decimating our industrial strength. I am trying to open \nthe eyes of my farmer Senator friends. Instead of 260 pages, this book \nis 453 pages. When I held up this book yesterday, it was very \ninteresting. Oh, it just put these fleet a flitter. They gathered \naround and you can tell the fixes they got--we are trading more. Well, \nwait a minute, you are getting more trade agreements? Your debate has \nbeen all year long that you are losing out on the agreements, that we \nare passing them by. All these countries are getting agreements and we \nare not getting any. Of course, that is not the case.\n\n  Let's look now and see. For example, Korea had 10 pages of \nrestrictions here in 1992. In 2002, they have gone to 27 pages. Japan \nhas gone from 18 pages of restrictions to 42--they are not lowering \nbarriers.\n  The European economic community, 32 pages in 1992. They have come \ndown to 20 pages. We are doing pretty good there. I hope we can do \nbetter than with bananas. We don't even produce a banana. These special \nTrade Representatives ought to be embarrassed. India's was 8 pages, and \nit went up to 14. You can see what is happening in these countries--\nwhere we are supposed to be lowering the barriers, we are increasing \nthem with trade agreements.\n  So, come on, let's stop, look, and listen. Give each Senator a chance \nto stop, look, and listen. Don't give me those fast tracks and whip it \non through with the special interest lawyers. I tell my textile people, \nthe lawyers are working this thing on K street; I have nothing to do \nwith it. By the time I get a bite at the apple and a chance to even \ndiscuss it, they give me limited time, and the vote is already fixed. \nNobody listens because the vote is already fixed. So why pay attention \nto the thing? Let's move on. We have to get our work done around here. \nSo nothing happens. We are supposed to learn and exchange views from \nall parts of the country.\n  When I came here 35 years ago, I tell you it was an educational \nexperience. We didn't have TV, so if you wanted to find out what was \ngoing on, you were in the cloakroom. There were always 25 to 30 \nSenators in either cloakroom and you could engage in debate, listen to \nthe other Senators, their experience, and their constituent needs and \nthings of that kind. And then we had a concurrent majority to move \nforward for the good of the country.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for one additional question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Hollings raised the issue of bananas. I wanted to \nexplore that for a moment. Is it not the case that our country had a \nbig fight with Europe about bananas?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes. One fellow from Ohio gave a lot of political \ncontributions. We didn't have any bananas. Do you know where they grow \nbananas?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No. We were fighting with Europe because they would not \nallow bananas into the European economies. I mentioned today that we \nhad a dispute with Europe about beef. We went to the WTO and won a case \nagainst Europe. You know how we penalized Europe? We said: We are \ntaking action against your truffles and your goose liver and Roquefort \ncheese.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. They have got no embarrassment, I can tell you that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We were fighting with Europe about bananas and we don't \nproduce them. Those bananas were coming from the Caribbean, and Europe \nwould not let them in.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. John McCain is right--money controls, campaign finance \nis needed. I can tell you that right now. We haven't gotten it yet. We \nare moving in that direction about soft money, but we have doubled the \ncontributions and everything else. That was a compromise Senator McCain \nhad to make. Now I have to travel to California, maybe Nevada, and New \nYork, and maybe Missouri even to get that kind of money. I cannot find \nthat in South Carolina. Even a Republican friend--and I have some \nRepublican friends, but they don't want to contribute. If their name \nappeared in the little news squib, and they might say Saturday night \nwhen they go to the club: Why did you give to that Democrat? Why \nembarrass the family and the wife and everybody else? They just don't \ngive. So I travel around the country, and beg from my friends and try \nto stay in office. They have been good to me. Here I am. But I cannot \nget the attention of anybody.\n  I used to say I would love to serve in the Senate rather than \npractice law because I not only could make the final arguments, like I \nused to in the courtroom, but I can go in the jury room and vote. But \nthe vote means nothing. Now the way this thing is geared up, over the \npast 35 years we don't have a discussion, don't have the deliberateness \nor the consideration.\n  I appreciate the distinguished Senator from Nevada yielding. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3610-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3610-S3619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE EXPANSION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3009) to extend the Andean Trade Preference \n     Act, to grant additional trade benefits under the Act, and \n     for other purposes, which had been reported from the \n     Committee on Finance, with an amendment to strike all after \n     the enacting clause and insert the part printed in italic:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Andean Trade Preference \n     Expansion Act''.\n\n                    TITLE I--ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE\n\n     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the Andean Trade Preference Act was enacted in \n     1991, it has had a positive impact\n\n[[Page S3611]]\n\n     on United States trade with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and \n     Peru. Two-way trade has doubled, with the United States \n     serving as the leading source of imports and leading export \n     market for each of the Andean beneficiary countries. This has \n     resulted in increased jobs and expanded export opportunities \n     in both the United States and the Andean region.\n       (2) The Andean Trade Preference Act has been a key element \n     in the United States counternarcotics strategy in the Andean \n     region, promoting export diversification and broad-based \n     economic development that provides sustainable economic \n     alternatives to drug-crop production, strengthening the \n     legitimate economies of Andean countries and creating viable \n     alternatives to illicit trade in coca.\n       (3) Notwithstanding the success of the Andean Trade \n     Preference Act, the Andean region remains threatened by \n     political and economic instability and fragility, vulnerable \n     to the consequences of the drug war and fierce global \n     competition for its legitimate trade.\n       (4) The continuing instability in the Andean region poses a \n     threat to the security interests of the United States and the \n     world. This problem has been partially addressed through \n     foreign aid, such as Plan Colombia, enacted by Congress in \n     2000. However, foreign aid alone is not sufficient. \n     Enhancement of legitimate trade with the United States \n     provides an alternative means for reviving and stabilizing \n     the economies in the Andean region.\n       (5) The Andean Trade Preference Act constitutes a tangible \n     commitment by the United States to the promotion of \n     prosperity, stability, and democracy in the beneficiary \n     countries.\n       (6) Renewal and enhancement of the Andean Trade Preference \n     Act will bolster the confidence of domestic private \n     enterprise and foreign investors in the economic prospects of \n     the region, ensuring that legitimate private enterprise can \n     be the engine of economic development and political stability \n     in the region.\n       (7) Each of the Andean beneficiary countries is committed \n     to conclude negotiation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas \n     by the year 2005, as a means of enhancing the economic \n     security of the region.\n       (8) Temporarily enhancing trade benefits for Andean \n     beneficiaries countries will promote the growth of free \n     enterprise and economic opportunity in these countries and \n     serve the security interests of the United States, the \n     region, and the world.\n\n     SEC. 102.

Madam President, with the authority of the Finance \nCommittee, I withdraw the committee amendment and send an amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The committee amendment is withdrawn.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3386.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we have just sent to the desk \nlegislation that includes three components: First, the trade promotion \nauthority; second, trade adjustment assistance; and third, the Andean \nTrade Preference Expansion Act.\n  The trade adjustment assistance measures are particularly crucial \nbecause they will provide help to dislocated workers. This package \nincludes job search assistance, unemployment insurance, and, for the \nfirst time, much needed health benefits. We are now ready to begin the \ndebate on this important trade legislation and, as we have noted for \nsome time, this bill is open to amendment and we encourage Senators to \ncome forth with their amendments soon.\n  I look forward to a full and spirited debate. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, sometime when the Senate is doing its best \nwork, it is not always visible. Throughout the day, we have been having \ndiscussions that involved the managers of this legislation. They have \nbeen talking to members of the Finance Committee and communicating with \nthe administration. It is very important that we have the straight \nlegislation. There are a lot of different views on both sides of the \naisle about exactly how this should proceed, or whether it is a good \nidea.\n  There are those who say, yes, we would like to have trade promotion \nauthority, but there must be trade adjustment assistance to go with it \nfor those who might be displaced from jobs so they can get assistance \nwith training and get into the next job.\n  It is important we move forward. Everybody's options are still \npreserved. Senator Daschle and I have indicated to each other that \nthere is not going to be any precipitous move. We want to take a look \nat the actual language. Sometimes it is hard to negotiate a moving \ntarget or when there is not a clear understanding of what is involved.\n  We now have a document. We are going to take a look at it tonight. I \nhope we can begin to move forward, perhaps even with amendments \ntomorrow. We will go over the language, and we will be talking further \nwith the managers of the legislation and make sure the administration \nhas a chance to review it.\n  I look forward to a full debate and amendment process. I do wish to \nadd--and I know Senator Daschle is thinking it right now--this should \nnot take place over weeks, as we experienced with the energy bill. We \nhave some important issues, some tough issues, but once we see if we \ncan come to agreement on two or three of these issues or get votes on a \ncouple of these issues, we should be able to move it forward in an \nexpeditious way.\n  It did not work on the energy bill, but I do think this week, and \nhopefully by the end of next week, we will have an agreement on which \nwe can vote. It is worth the effort, and I am prepared to put a lot of \ntime into it.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for agreeing to lay this legislation down so \nwe can take a look at it. We will continue working together tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, first, I compliment and thank the \ndistinguished Republican leader for the cooperative effort he has put \nforth to get to this point. We have talked on many occasions over the \nlast several days, and the spirit with which he has discussed the \nimportance of this legislation, as well as the importance of a good \ndebate, is exactly the one I hold as well.\n  I encourage Senators to offer amendments, but let me also say, as the \nSenator alluded, we will be able to determine whether this is good \nfaith or not, whether we are just delaying for the sake of delaying; \nthat will not be something we can tolerate. But we certainly encourage \na good and vigorous debate with ample opportunity to offer amendments. \nThere is a difference between simply delaying for delaying sake and \namendments for the sake of changing, improving, or in some way altering \nthe legislation as it has been introduced.\n  Again, we will work with all of our colleagues to accommodate that \nand look forward to the debate beginning tonight and again tomorrow \nmorning. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3387 To Amendment No. 3386\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment. I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Mr. Craig, proposes an amendment numbered 3387 to amendment \n     No. 3386.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SECRET TRIBUNALS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Chapter Eleven of the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement (``NAFTA'') allows foreign investors to file claims \n     against signatory countries that directly or indirectly \n     nationalize or expropriate an investment, or take measures \n     ``tantamount to nationalization or expropriation'' of such an \n     investment.\n       (2) Foreign investors have filed several claims against the \n     United States, arguing that regulatory activity has been \n     ``tantamount to nationalization or expropriation''. Most \n     notably, a Canadian chemical company claimed $970,000,000 in \n     damages allegedly resulting from a California State \n     regulation banning the use of a gasoline additive produced by \n     that company.\n       (3) A claim under Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA is \n     adjudicated by a three-member panel, whose deliberations are \n     largely secret.\n       (4) While it may be necessary to protect the \n     confidentiality of business sensitive information, the \n     general lack of transparency of these proceedings has been \n     excessive.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this amendment is to ensure \n     that the proceedings of the NAFTA investor protection \n     tribunals are as transparent as possible, consistent with the \n     need to protect the confidentiality of business sensitive \n     information.\n       (c) Chapter 11 of NAFTA.--The President shall negotiate \n     with Canada and Mexico an amendment to Chapter Eleven of the \n     NAFTA to ensure the fullest transparency possible with \n     respect to the dispute settlement mechanism in that Chapter, \n     consistent with the need to protect information that is \n     classified or confidential, by--\n\n[[Page S3616]]\n\n       (1) ensuring that all requests for dispute settlement under \n     Chapter Eleven are promptly made public;\n       (2) ensuring that with respect to Chapter Eleven--\n       (A) all proceedings, submissions, findings, and decisions \n     are promptly made public; and\n       (B) all hearings are open to the public; and\n       (3) establishing a mechanism under that Chapter for \n     acceptance of amicus curiae submissions from businesses, \n     unions, and nongovernmental organizations.\n       (d) Certification Requirements.--Within one year of the \n     enactment of this Act, the U.S. Trade Representative shall \n     certify to Congress that the President has fulfilled the \n     requirements set forth in subsection (c).\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I understand the rather lengthy \nmanagers' amendment has just been offered. I do not know how many pages \nit is, but obviously we will have to study it. It is a substantial \namendment.\n  I offer my amendment in the first degree to the managers' amendment \nthat was just offered. I will describe it briefly. I understand there \nare no further votes today, and perhaps I will discuss it briefly and \nthen discuss it some in the morning. I hope perhaps tomorrow we may \nhave a vote on it. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and \nSenator Craig from Idaho.\n  The amendment is relatively simple. This amendment deals with Chapter \n11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Under Chapter 11 of \nNAFTA, secret multinational tribunals consider claims by private \ninvestors against member countries, including claims by foreign \ninvestors against the U.S. Government. This amendment would end the \nundemocratic and unfair secrecy in these tribunals.\n  My amendment directs the President to negotiate with Canada and \nMexico an amendment to NAFTA that would require transparency in these \ntribunals. The U.S. Trade Representative under this amendment is to \ncertify to Congress that this has been done within 12 months of the \nenactment.\n  Even the supporters of fast track have recognized that secrecy is not \nappropriate, and yet we have these tribunals that are secret. No one is \nallowed to understand their work; no one can be a part of their \ndiscussions; no one understands the deliberations. The door is locked. \nThree members are appointed to a tribunal. They meet in secret, make \njudgments in secret, make decisions in secret, and then we are told the \nresult. That is not the way for this country to proceed with respect to \ndispute resolutions to trade agreements.\n  U.S. Trade Representative Zoellick has recognized this secrecy is a \nproblem, and he met with his counterparts from Mexico and Canada on \nthis issue. In fact, they agreed there needed to be more openness, and \nthey announced that July 31 of last year. They said that these \ntribunals will operate as openly as possible.\n  But just last month, a NAFTA tribunal refused to open their \nproceedings once again and rejected the guidelines by Ambassador \nZoellick and his counterparts.\n  This amendment will fix a problem that everyone, including the \nadministration, acknowledges. It will require transparency. It will \nrequire an end to the secrecy, an opening up of the process so the \nAmerican people can understand how this democratic process must work.\n  We cannot and should not be a party to secret tribunals. We have \nbeen, but we should not be, and my amendment will remedy that.\n  I understand that in the negotiating objectives described in the \nmanagers' amendment, there is language that would address the secrecy \nof the tribunals going forward for future agreements. I do not know \nthat for certain. I am told that is part of the managers' amendment.\n  If it is the case, it seems logical to me that we would want to \nextend that to other agreements with which we are now engaged, \nincluding the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n  I might mention again--I do not have all the details--but we have a \nsituation in California where California understood that an additive to \ngasoline called MTBE was showing up in drinking water and ground water. \nThey discovered that is dangerous to people, and California banned MTBE \nfrom being added to gasoline in California. A couple of other States \nhave taken the same action.\n\n  A Canadian company that manufactures MTBE has filed an action under \nNAFTA and is asking for hundreds of millions of dollars against \nCalifornia and our country because we are taking action to protect our \ncitizens. They say they have been injured by this and have a right \nunder NAFTA to make the claim; then, a tribunal is developed and begins \nto meet and it is totally secret. Its proceedings are totally, \ncompletely secret. The American public is told: You are not involved; \nyou cannot see, you cannot be a part of this; it is none of your \nbusiness.\n  Talk about a bizarre set of circumstances for a democracy to enter \ninto trade agreements by which we allow someone from another country to \nchallenge a State government in our country, just because it is trying \nto protect their citizens from poisons in the drinking water, chemicals \nthat are harmful to human health. We end up being sued under a trade \nagreement for damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, just \nfor protecting our people; and we are told that this suit will be \ndetermined by a tribunal that will meet in secret. What is that about? \nDoes anybody really think this makes any sense? Can anybody really \nsupport this? We will have a vote on this and see whether people will.\n  This amendment, which is bipartisan--Senator Craig and I are offering \nit--is a simple one. It says we are a party to trade agreements--we \nunderstand that--but we cannot and should not be a party to a trade \nagreement by which investor dispute tribunals will be conducted in \nsecret. They have been in the past, they should not ever be again, and \nour amendment says, stop it, this country cannot be a part of that.\n  I will speak at greater length about the amendment and describe in \nsome more detail the MTBE saga, which I think is symbolic of the \negregious actions of tribunals meeting in secrecy. I will not do that \nthis evening. I will do that in the morning.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator offering this amendment at this \ntime. Based on what the majority leader just said, that he wanted, in \neffect, quality amendments, I think he has one here. This is the type \nof amendment people should look forward to, I hope.\n  Of what I know about the Senator's amendment--and I have spoken with \nhim off the floor--it is going to be a tough amendment to vote against. \nHow can anybody be in favor of secret meetings when they deal with some \nof the most important issues in this country and, in fact, our \nrelations with other countries? I do not think we should be doing that \nin secret. That is what the Senator is saying; is that not true?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is the case. This is an amendment I am offering, \nalong with my colleague Senator Craig from Idaho. It is bipartisan. And \nwhether you are in favor of fast track or opposed to it, you should be \nopposed to tribunals meeting in secret.\n  I think we will find agreement between both supporters and opponents \nof fast track that we ought not be a party to tribunals that are \nsecret, that are shielded from the view of the American people. I am \ngoing to use the MTBE case tomorrow morning to graphically demonstrate \nhow absurd it is that we could be sued under a trade law for taking \naction, or we can have action taken against us for our deciding we want \nto protect the health of the American people and that the dispute will \nbe resolved behind a cloak of secrecy. That is not what this country \nshould be involved in.\n  It is at this point because that is the way NAFTA works, but we can \nchange it. This Congress can change it, and I hope tomorrow by voting \nfor this amendment this Congress will change it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I will speak on the bill, but I first \nwant to make a comment not for or against the amendment of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota but to put it in context. The reason I cannot make a \ncomment for or against the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota \nis at this point I have not read it or studied it. I do think he has \nbrought up an issue of transparency, and it deals with NAFTA. On all \nagreements, particularly WTO agreements, there has been\n\n[[Page S3617]]\n\na big concern about the process not being transparent enough.\n  Senator Baucus and I, in the Finance Committee, have spoken about the \nnecessity for doing this in several different venues. We have spoken \nwith people from the European Community about it. We believe the \nprocess of the WTO, for instance, should be very much more transparent \nthan it has been in the past. So the issue of transparency is one that \ndoes fall on acceptable ears in a very general sense, not necessarily \nrelated to the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota but in a very \ngeneral sense with most of us in the Congress of the United States. \nWhere we have run into most of the opposition is from the European \nCommunity.\n  We have also had a lot of the developing nations of the world that \nare members of the World Trade Organization be highly in favor of more \ntransparency.\n  The issue of transparency was the basis for a lot of the protests in \nSeattle, and since then there has been a real determined look at the \nprocess. A lot of us have come to the conclusion that whatever we can \ndo to promote more transparency we should.\n  Speaking now on the bill and where we are at this point, particularly \nnow that we do have a substitute amendment before us laid down by the \nSenate majority leader, I am encouraged on the one hand, dismayed on \nthe other, by the action taken today in the laying down of this \namendment.\n\n  I am encouraged because, after months of delays, we are moving \nforward on trade promotion authority. The House passed TPA last year. \nUnfortunately, TPA has languished much too long in the Senate. So I \ndefinitely am glad we are moving forward. In a minute I will talk about \nbeing dismayed.\n  In regard to moving forward, the fact is, while we were sitting on \nthe sidelines for the last 5 or 6 years that our President has not had \ntrade promotion authority, the United States is a party to only 3 \nagreements out of some 130 free trade agreements negotiated worldwide. \nThat means other countries get better access to foreign markets than we \ndo. That is unfair.\n  Let me give some examples. Today, the average U.S. tariff is 4.8 \npercent. In contrast, Brazil's tariff averages 14.6 percent; Thailand, \n45.6 percent. That is much too high. We need to correct the imbalance, \nand the best way to do that is by providing our President with the \ntools he needs to tear down these barriers to our exports. The most \nimportant tool we have to accomplish that is through trade promotion \nauthority.\n  Let me go through those figures once more to emphasize the point. The \nUnited States has an average tariff of 4.8 percent. We have Brazil much \nhigher at 14.6 percent and Thailand at 45.6 percent. So if anybody in \nthis body ever wonders whether it is a benefit to the United States to \nbe involved in regimes of negotiating down barriers to trade, and \nparticularly tariffs, they ought to understand that for the United \nStates, at 4.8 percent compared to 14.6 percent, and 45 percent for \nThailand, they must be brought down, even if they are not brought down \nto where we are. That is a win-win situation for the American worker, \nas jobs that are created in international trade are good jobs that pay \n15 percent above the national average. So the President then needs \ntrade promotion authority to represent the interests of American \nworkers in international trade negotiations.\n  He has not been there for 127 of the agreements reached in the last \nfew years. He has not been there because Congress has not given him the \nauthority to be there. So I am committed to helping the President get \nthese tools.\n  Without trade agreements, the United States will lose its role as \nworld leader in setting global trade policies and standards. That means \nother nations, in no way committed to U.S. interests, will set the \nworld's future trading rules. They will do it, and it is going to \naffect us. I can guarantee those nations are not looking out for the \nbest interests of our workers.\n  TPA will help us and our President get back into the game where we \nwere practically full time from 1947 to 1994. It has only been since \n1994 that the President has not had this authority. This is why I am \nglad we have this bill before us.\n  Now I wish to state why I am dismayed about the process thus far, and \nthat is the insistence on linking trade promotion authority, which has \nstrong bipartisan support as per the 18-to-3 vote out of the Senate \nFinance Committee, but they want to link it to the controversial \nexpansion of trade adjustment assistance. I am dismayed not because \nthere is a linkage between trade promotion authority and trade \nadjustment assistance because these two bills have often been linked in \nthe past; I am dismayed that trade adjustment assistance is being \nbrought up in a partisan way.\n  Ever since President Kennedy first designed the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program in the early 1960s, the program has garnered strong \nbipartisan support. That is the way it has been. That is the way it \nshould be this year. Unfortunately, the way in which this bill is being \nbrought forward falls far short of that bipartisanship.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, which is the \ncommittee responsible for drafting both trade promotion authority \nlegislation and trade adjustment assistance, perhaps I can shed some \nlight on how we got to where we are today.\n  First, Chairman Max Baucus and I worked for months crafting a \nbipartisan trade promotion bill, and we did it in a very good way or it \nwould not have gotten a 18-to-3 vote. The end result was supported by \nthe White House, by Majority Leader Tom Daschle because he is a member \nof the committee, by Republican Minority Leader Trent Lott because he \nis also a member of the committee, and it sailed through the Finance \nCommittee.\n  In contrast to trade promotion authority, we have this other bill, S. \n1209, the trade adjustment assistance bill, that I talked about. It was \nnot a product of the committee process or bipartisan compromise. In \nfact, days before the bill was brought before the Finance Committee, \nDemocrats inserted a provision and legislation requiring large \nGovernment subsidies for company-based health care coverage for the \nfirst time in the history of trade adjustment assistance. This new and \nunprecedented provision shattered what would otherwise have been strong \nbipartisan support for trade adjustment assistance.\n  At the time, the chairman of the Finance Committee assured Members \nthat the health care provision was simply a place hold that would be \nreplaced by whatever bipartisan approach results from the debate over \nproviding health care to uninsured workers which was then taking place \nin the economic stimulus package.\n  As we all know now, a bipartisan consensus could not be achieved and \nultimately the stimulus bill passed Congress without a health care \nprovision. Now the health care fight has moved from stimulus to trade \npromotion authority. Still, no bipartisan consensus. I hope by tomorrow \nmorning I can say that there is such a bipartisan consensus. It is a \nshame that to this point there is not. We should be able to do better.\n  The trade adjustment assistance bill currently before the Senate also \nrisks jeopardizing strong public support that trade adjustment \nassistance has always had because it expands the program too far, \nopening the program to possible abuse. In my view, we need to be sure \nthat the scope of the program--and I am talking beyond the health \nprovisions suggested--is limited to those people who are truly impacted \nby negative aspects of international trade, we also need to be sure the \nprogram is fiscally prudent, and we need to be sure the administration \ncan actually administer the program we might outline in the bill. If \nthe administration cannot so administer, we will only have more worker \nfrustration as they try to use the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program.\n  American workers are too important to be reckless. We need to \nmaintain confidence in the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. We need \nto do that through this legislation, getting this legislation just \nexactly right. This may take a little longer, but it is the right thing \nto do. We can provide expanded and improved trade adjustment assistance \nto America's workers with strong bipartisan support. We can also devise \nways to provide temporary health insurance assistance for trade \nadjustment assistance workers, even\n\n[[Page S3618]]\n\nthough doing so would constitute a fundamental unfairness to the 39 \nmillion other Americans living without health insurance.\n  So all my colleagues can hear me, I know we are going to end up with \nhealth insurance provisions in the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. As \nlong as that doesn't become a pattern for what this Congress has not \nresponsibly done up to this point--and maybe we all share in that \nproblem; we have not tackled the problem of all the millions--it is \nprobably 39 to 40 million Americans--who do not have health insurance--\nit is my view we should tackle the health provision vis-a-vis trade \nadjustment assistance workers with a pool of uninsured workers in \nAmerica and not do it piecemeal. I am not going to prevail in that \npoint of view. Or if I prevail in that point of view, we will not have \ntrade promotion authority. So I am giving on it.\n  But I think it is wrong because it detracts, that we don't think 40 \nmillion uninsured Americans is a problem. We have to deal with that. \nThe President of the United States recognizes that. He has $81 billion \nin his budget for programs for the 42 million uninsured Americans.\n  How we achieve these goals is a debate I and my Republican colleagues \nare ready and willing to undertake. We are starting now with the Senate \nmajority leader laying down this trade adjustment assistance bill and \nother items related to trade promotion authority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, with respect to the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota, I have an important article I \nwill include in the Record. However, I respond to the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, pointing out the trade adjustment assistance and the \nemphasis on it. At least we now are admitting that in this proceeding \nwe are not going to win jobs, we are going to lose jobs. In every one \nof these trade debates, that is the first thing they say: This is so \nfine, it will create jobs--NAFTA was to create 200,000 jobs; we have \nlost some 670,000 textile jobs alone since that time.\n  The appeal now for this fast track and this trade agreement is: We \nwill put you on welfare reform. We will let you have health costs. We \nwill have certain benefits.\n  I am looking for jobs for my people. I am not looking for welfare \nreform. At least they acknowledge that. That is the big debate going on \nfor the past week. We were ready this morning, and they were not. After \nwe had lost that motion to proceed, they had won, so we were ready to \nproceed. However, they had not gotten together the welfare reform \nclause for lost jobs.\n  Having observed that, Madam President, let me refer to Senator \nDorgan's amendment with respect to an article that appeared in Business \nWeek, dated April 1, on page 76. It is entitled ``The Highest Court \nYou've Never Heard Of.'' I ask unanimous consent this article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Business Week, Apr. 1, 2002]\n\n                The Highest Court You've Never Heard Of\n\n                          (By Paul Magnussun)\n\n       When a Mississippi jury slapped a $500 million judgment on \n     Loewen Group, a Canadian funeral-home chain, in 1995 for \n     breaching a contract with a hometown rival, the company \n     quickly settled the case for $129 million but then decided to \n     appeal. But instead of going to a U.S. court, the Canadians \n     took their case to an obscure three-judge panel that stands \n     distinctly apart from the U.S. legal system. And that panel's \n     decision cannot be appealed.\n       Thanks to some fine print in the 1994 North American Free \n     Trade Agreement, the case of Loewen Group vs. the U.S. is \n     just one of two dozen wending their way through a little-\n     known and highly secretive process. The panels, using \n     arbitration procedures established by the World Bank, were \n     supposed to ensure that governments in the U.S., Mexico, and \n     Canada would pay compensation to any foreign investor whose \n     property they might seize. U.S. business groups originally \n     demanded the investor-protection mechanism, noting that the \n     Mexican government had a history of nationalizing its oil, \n     electricity, and banking industries, including many U.S. \n     assets.\n       But even some of NAFTA's strongest supporters say that \n     clever and creative lawyers in all three countries and \n     rapidly expanding the anti-expropriation clause in \n     unanticipated ways. ``The question in a lot of these pending \n     cases is, will the panels produce a pattern of decisions that \n     the negotiators never envisioned?'' says Charles E. Roh Jr., \n     deputy chief U.S. negotiator for NAFTA, now a partner at \n     Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLC. Some of the early indications, he \n     says, ``are troubling.''\n       In one case, a NAFTA panel issued an interpretation of the \n     Mexican Constitution, an authority the NAFTA negotiators \n     hadn't intended to give the panel. In the dispute, a \n     California waste disposal company, Metalclad Corp., was \n     awarded $16.7 million by a NAFTA tribunal after the governor \n     of the state of San Luis Potosi and a town council refused \n     the company a permit to open a toxic waste site. The company \n     had asked for $90 million in damages, insisting that the \n     state and local governments had overstepped their authority.\n       The majority of the cases are yet to be decided, but the \n     NAFTA panels are controversial nonetheless. For one thing, \n     they are already pitting environmentalists and federal, \n     state, and local government regulators in all three countries \n     against multinationals. The basic disagreement: Business \n     groups want to include NAFTA's strongest investor-protection \n     provisions in all future free-trade agreements, while many \n     environmentalists would like to scrap the entire procedure as \n     an impediment to government regulatory action. The cases are \n     also complicating efforts to negotiate free-trade agreements \n     with Chile and the hemispheric, 34-nation Free Trade Area of \n     the Americas.\n       Washington's problem: While such panels may favor U.S. \n     businesses abroad, foreign plaintiffs would enjoy the same \n     such privileges in the U.S. And that could end up giving them \n     protections against regulations far beyond those domestic \n     companies enjoy in their own courts. What's more, states and \n     municipalities have also warned that their ability to govern \n     is being compromised by ``a new set of foreign investor \n     rights.''\n       In some cases, the NAFTA suits seek damages for government \n     decisions that are clearly legal but can be questioned under \n     vague notions of international law. For example, a Canadian \n     chemical company, Methanex Corp., bypassed U.S. courts to \n     challenge California's ban on a health-threatening gasoline \n     additive, MTBE, that has been polluting municipal wells and \n     reservoirs. In its $970 million claim, the Canadian company \n     said California Governor Gray Davis had been influenced in \n     his decision by a $150,000 campaign contribution from U.S.-\n     based Archer Daniels Midland Co., the maker of a rival \n     gasoline additive. The campaign contribution was legal, but \n     Methanex' lawyers argued that the Davis decision was \n     ``palpably unfair and inequitable'' because of ADM's \n     influence. Such an argument wouldn't likely work in a U.S. \n     court.\n       No laws can be overturned by the panel, but the cost of \n     defending against a NAFTA lawsuit may run so high that it \n     could still deter agencies from imposing strict regulations \n     on foreign companies, critics charge. They point to a \n     decision by Canada not to restrict cigarette marketing after \n     Ottawa was threatened with a NAFTA case by U.S. tobacco \n     companies. In another potentially intimidating move, United \n     Parcel Service Inc. is seeking $160 million in damages from \n     Canada, arguing that the state-owned Canadian postal system, \n     Canada Post, maintains a monopoly on first-class mail and \n     delivers parcels with private Canadian partners.\n       But right now, the Loewen case is the one in the spotlight. \n     The Mississippi trial was so theatrical that Warner Bros. \n     Inc. and film director Ron Howard have acquired the movie \n     rights, according to attorneys in the case. Canadian funeral \n     chain founder Ray Loewen was vilified as a foreigner, a \n     ``gouger of grieving families,'' an owner of a large yacht, a \n     racist, a customer of foreign banks, and greedy besides, \n     according to the transcript. Yet the State Supreme Court \n     refused to waive the appeal bond, which had been set at $625 \n     million--to be posted in 10 days. (The largest previous \n     verdict in the state had been $18 million.) Loewen filed for \n     bankruptcy protection in 1999 but is hopeful that the \n     imminent NAFTA ruling will revive the company.\n       Although many of the current cases raise questions, \n     business groups insist that NAFTA-like panels are needed in \n     all trade deals because so many developing nations have poor \n     judicial systems. But they allow that the process may still \n     need some tweaking. ``Of course, if I look at the filed cases \n     so far, I could write a pretty scary story,'' says Scott \n     Miller, a Washington lobbyist for Procter & Gamble Co. And \n     Eric Biehl, a former top Commerce Dept. official, who \n     supports NAFTA, wonders, ``how does some mechanism on a trade \n     agreement that no one ever thought much about suddenly get \n     used to open up a whole new appellate process around the U.S. \n     judicial system?'' That's a question a lot more people may \n     soon be asking.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It reads: Do NAFTA judges have too much authority?\n  Let me read:\n\n       When a Mississippi jury slapped a $500 million judgment on \n     Loewen Group, a Canadian funeral-home chain, in 1995 for \n     breaching a contract with a hometown rival, the company \n     quickly settled a case for $129 million but then decided to \n     appeal.

And that panel's \n     decision cannot be appealed.\n\n[[Page S3619]]\n\n       Thanks to some fine print in the 1994 North American Free \n     Trade Agreement, the case of Loewen Group vs. U.S. is just \n     one of two dozen wending their way through a little-known and \n     highly secretive process.\n\n  Let me read that sentence one more time. That is the reason we \nopposed fast track. We will have a time agreement, 2 hours a side, or 4 \nhours, or debate it this afternoon. You never get the obscure addendum \nand other things agreed to. They don't tell you about them.\n\n       Thanks to some fine print in the 1994 North American Free \n     Trade Agreement, the case of Loewen Group vs. U.S. is just \n     one of two dozen winding their way through a little-known \n     highly secretive process. The panels, using arbitration \n     procedures established by the World Bank, were supposed to \n     ensure the governments in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada would \n     pay compensation to any foreign investor whose property they \n     might seize.

Some of the early indications, \n     he says, ``are troubling.''\n\n  But there are some examples here. There is not only the particular \nfuneral home case, but:\n\n       UPS claims that the Canadian post, the state-owned postal \n     system, uses its monopoly on letter mail to gain unfair \n     advantages in parcel deliveries.\n\n  In the matter of the Canadian manufacturer, Methanex, versus the \nUnited States:\n\n       The Canadian manufacturer of a gasoline additive sued after \n     California found the health-threatening chemical had \n     contaminated water, and banned its use.\n\n  So after the California authorities have the hearings and everything \nelse, they find out it is contaminative. As a result, they ban the use. \nNo, you take that up to the secret panel of NAFTA judges, who meet in \nsecret, decide in secret, and if you can get a fix--like you can get \nthe fix of the vote around here--what happens is the California \nproceeding, totally in the open, is overturned. The legal process is \ntotally frustrated.\n  I will read one more example. Those who are interested can follow the \nparticular article, Metalclad v. Mexico:\n\n       U.S. company sued after it obtains permits from the Mexican \n     federal government for a waste disposal site. Then localities \n     denied a permit to operate.\n\n  They said that was taking away their particular business. You can go \non and on, but it is a two-way street. Lawyers on both sides of the \nborder are using this particular secretive measure.\n\n       Although many of the current cases raise questions, \n     business groups insist that NAFTA-like panels are needed in \n     all trade deals because so many developing nations have poor \n     judicial systems.

That \nis what this amendment does. It goes to the heart of that secretive \nprocess, trying to get transparency. I think there should be a greater \nenforcement provision in this particular amendment. Maybe we can have \nthe amendment itself amended.\n  Be that as it may, this ought to receive 100 bipartisan votes in the \nSenate against the secret process of the NAFTA panels that no one ever \nheard of. ``The Highest Court You've Never Heard Of,'' says Business \nWeek.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, for the past few weeks we have been \nhearing sensationalist claims of a massacre in the Jenin refugee camp. \nIn recent days, hundreds of reporters and international relief workers \nhave descended on the camp, and not one has verified these claims.\n  In fact, the Washington Times today quotes the senior official in \nYasser Arafat's Fatah movement in Jenin as saying that the death toll \nstands at fifty six. Other reports place the number around fifty one.\n  Even one death is one too many, and there is still considerable \nexcavation work to do in the camp. But it seems apparent that there was \nno massacre in Jenin.\n  Let me say that again. It seems apparent that there was no massacre \nin Jenin.\n  There are not 500 civilian dead, as the Palestinians initially \nclaimed. What happened in Jenin was an intense battle fought at close \nquarters in which 23 Israeli soldiers also lost their lives in Jenin. \nAnd the leader of Fatah said today, trying to make the case that they \n``won'' the battle, that ``although we lost 56, they lost 23.''\n  The relatively high number of Israeli casualties is in itself an \nindicator of what went on in the camp. Had the Israelis chosen, they \ncould have easily sat back and pummeled the camp from afar, and starved \nthe terrorists. Instead, they chose to do things the hard way. They \nwent house to house to house, from booby-trapped house to booby-trapped \nhouse to booby-trapped house. In doing so to avoid civilian casualties, \nthey inflicted casualties upon themselves. That is why they went house \nto house--not to inflict civilian casualties.\n  Were there civilian casualties? Almost certainly there were. But \nthere is a world of difference between the deliberate targeting of \ncivilians and the unintentional and inevitable casualties that were \nbound to occur in a place such as Jenin where terrorists deliberately \nhid themselves among civilians.\n  Remember we got a dose of that ourselves during the gulf war. As you \nrecall, Saddam Hussein hid himself and others in the midst of civilian \npopulations in civilian centers. That is the picture I believe will \nemerge as the facts are examined in the cold light of day--that there \nwas no massacre, and that, although there were civilians killed, the \nnumber was relatively small, more in line with the number of Israelis \nkilled--that is, proportionately. And I think the world should \nunderstand that.\n  There has been considerable discussion in recent days about a United \nNations' factfinding panel assembled by Secretary General Kofi Annan. \nAs of a couple of hours ago, the U.N. officially decided not to send \nthe factfinding mission. But the impression we have heard in the world \nis that the reason the factfinding mission was not sent is because of \nIsraeli intransigence.\n  U.N. leadership, I believe under Kofi Annan, had the best intentions. \nBut Israel has voiced what I believe to be legitimate concerns about \nthe composition, the procedures, and terms of reference this team was \nsupposed to operate under. Reports indicate that the team is now \ndisbanding.\n  Unfortunately, in my view, the United Nations should have met the \nlegitimate concerns and proceeded with the mission. It is hard to blame \nIsrael for having doubts about the objectivity of a factfinding team.\n  Israel has also voiced concerns over the lack of adequate \nrepresentation on\n\n[[Page S3620]]\n\nthe U.N. team of counterterrorism and military experts. It argues, in \nmy view, with justification that the events in Jenin must be seen in \ntheir proper context.\n  Israel did not invade Jenin on a whim; it did so to destroy the \nterrorist infrastructure, and only after the Palestinian Authority--\nthis is an important point--only after the Palestinian Authority, whom \nthe Israelis and the rest of the world equipped with weapons to keep \npeace and order--only after the Palestinian Authority refused to carry \nout its obligations to destroy this terrorist infrastructure.\n  According to the Israeli Government, 23 suicide bombers came from \nJenin. These 23 were responsible for the deaths of 57 Israelis, and the \ninjury of 1,000 more.\n  Is it fair--and I think it is fair--to ask the U.N. what its \nofficials were saying to the Palestinian Authority about the use of a \nU.N.-run camp as a launching pad for terrorism? To many Israelis, it \nappears as if the U.N. turned a blind eye to Palestinian terrorism, \nwhile it seems intent on smearing Israel for its legitimate response to \nthat terror.\n  I would suggest a fairer thing to do would be for the U.N. to hold an \ninternal review and ask internally what the U.N. team in Jenin, \nresponsible for Jenin, knew or did not know about the role the \nPalestinian Authority was playing. What did they know? I am not saying \nthey were complicitous. What did they know?\n  With such a breakdown, wouldn't we be looking if it occurred here? If \nthere was a group in charge of overseeing a particular dilemma within \nthe United States, and something terrible happened, wouldn't we ask \nourselves, What did we know about what was going on?\n  Nonetheless, not withstanding this, the Israelis have not rejected \nthe U.N. team. Foreign Minister Peres of Israel, in a letter to \nSecretary of State Powell, has said the team should ``examine the \nPalestinian terrorist infrastructure and activity in the camp and \nemanating from it which necessitated Israel's military actions. In \ndoing so, the team will bear in mind the relevant elements of \ninternational law, including the right of self-defense and the \nobligation to prevent terrorism.''\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       [I]n accordance with the fact-finding nature of the team, \n     its work should be submitted as facts only, and not \n     observations. This is a vital concern for Israel in order to \n     avoid abuse and misuse of the work of the Team for political \n     purposes.\n\n  Peres then goes on to add:\n\n       Israel understands that requests for interviews with public \n     servants, past or present, or documents, will be made through \n     the government of Israel. While Israel will carefully \n     consider these requests, Israel will have the right to make \n     final determinations regarding availability to the Team. This \n     sovereign discretion is mandated by Israeli law.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the \nletter to Secretary of State Powell be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Deputy Prime Minister,\n\n\n                              and Minister of Foreign Affairs,\n\n                                         Jerusalem, 29 April 2002.\n     Mr. Colin Powell,\n     Secretary of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: Enclosed are points I raised in a phone \n     conversation with Secretary General Anman on 28 April 2002.\n       It will be incumbent upon the Team, in considering ``recent \n     events in the Jenin refugee camp'' to examine the Palestinian \n     terrorist infrastructure and activity in the camp and \n     emanating from it which necessitated Israel's military \n     actions. In so doing, the Team will bear in mind also the \n     relevant elements of international law, including the right \n     of self-defense and the obligation to prevent terrorism.\n       In accordance with the fact-finding nature of the Team, its \n     work should be submitted as findings of facts only, and not \n     observations. This is a vital concern for Israel in order to \n     avoid abuse and misuse of the work of the Team for political \n     purposes.\n       Israel understands that requests for interviews with public \n     servants, past or present, or documents, will be made through \n     the Government of Israel. While Israel will carefully \n     consider these requests, Israel will have the right to make \n     final determinations regarding availability to the Team. This \n     sovereign discretion is mandated by Israeli law. Equally, in \n     the spirit of fairness, and with a view to assuring that \n     accurate factual information is provided, Israel should have \n     the opportunity, during the fact-finding work of the Team, to \n     comment on any statements received by the Team from any other \n     Israeli individuals or organizations.\n       I emphasized the sensitive nature of Israel's present \n     situation, both here in the area and in international fora. \n     Faced with a relentless battle against terrorism, on the one \n     hand, and wishing to cooperate with the International \n     community, on the other, we are obliged to ensure that our \n     very basic interests, and those of our military and security \n     servicemen, are fully protected.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                                 Shimon Peres.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, what is so unreasonable about these \nrequests? Would any other democratic country behave any differently? \nIndeed, would any Arab country ever be subjected to a similar \nfactfinding investigation in the first place? Perhaps the false cries \nof massacre coming from Arab circles are a reflection of what they may \nhave come to expect from their own governments.\n  Was there ever a U.N. factfinding team that investigated the Syrian \nmassacre of as many as 20,000 civilians in the city of Hama in 1982? \nWas the international press corps ever able to conduct their own \ninvestigations there as they are now in Jenin?\n  Was there ever a U.N. investigation of the genocidal Anfal campaign \nlaunched by Saddam Hussein against the Kurds in the late 1980s?\n  Of course not. There is a double standard when it comes to Israel. \nAnd many of those criticizing Israel today know that Israel holds \nitself to a higher standard than the countries I mentioned.\n  And Israel is saying the U.N. team is welcome as long as it has a \nfair mandate and agreed-upon terms of reference. If there is to be true \nfactfinding, and not a witch hunt, then what is so unreasonable about \nIsrael's requests?\n  My purpose is not to apologize for Israel. As some of you know--both \nin the caucus, out of the caucus, here on the floor, and in other \nfora--I have been very critical of some of Israel's actions.\n  Indeed, many Israelis have raised questions about the military \noperation in Jenin, including allegations of disproportionate use of \nforce and the denial of medical and humanitarian access.\n  In fact, the leading Israeli newspaper editorialized yesterday that \nthe army should conduct an internal investigation about possible \ngratuitous vandalism and destruction of property.\n  Did Israel do everything right in Jenin? In all probability, no. Did \nthey engage in a wholesale massacre of innocent civilians? No.\n  How many Arab countries have the capacity for such self-examination? \nHow many Arab countries have a supreme court that would do as the \nIsraeli Supreme Court did to intervene to prevent the Israeli Army from \nremoving bodies in Jenin?\n  We are not talking about some dictatorship or puppet regime. The \nIsraeli Supreme Court--not an international organization--the Israeli \nSupreme Court intervened and said: Whoa, don't remove those bodies, \narmy. We want to know what the facts are.\n  So to give this presumption that Israel intentionally massacred, and \nthen attempted to cover up, I think is incredibly unfair and will be \nproven, beyond a reasonable doubt, to be wrong.\n  I believe we have an obligation to examine the facts before we jump \nto conclusions. Based on reports now coming from Jenin, it appears that \nfar too many reached conclusions before they had the facts.\n  In the end, Madam President, some may choose to cling to myths in \norder to perpetuate hatred and conflict. Some prefer to live in the \nrealm of fiction rather than deal with cold, hard facts. But the rest \nof us should not engage in such self-delusion. If my reading of the \nfacts is correct--and it may not be--but if it is correct, then we \nwill, in the coming days, see the Jenin massacre as the massacre that \nnever was.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, an official of the People's Republic of \nChina, who many say will be the next leader of China when the scheduled \nleadership succession occurs next fall, is making his first visit to \nthe United States this week. Mr. H.E. Hu Jintao, the current Vice \nPresident of China, will be getting his first up-front taste of \nofficial Washington. This is an opportunity to make it clear how we \nfeel about certain Chinese policies, most particularly in the area of \nChinese proliferation practices. Let's hope he takes back with him the \nright impressions.\n  President Bush made a summit visit to China, and met with President \nJiang Zemin this past February. I liked the tone that he set in the \nmeeting with Chinese leaders. He was serious and businesslike, and \neschewed what had been a practice of overly positive glad-handing which \nruns the risk of communicating the wrong message.\n  President Bush's approach, it would appear, did seem to be somewhat \nproductive with the Chinese leadership. For example, during a speech at \nTsinghua University in Beijing, the President made a strong case for \nAmerican values and religious freedom. The speech was broadcast live \nand unedited throughout China, an unprecedented event for an American \nPresident. So that is a small step forward, and I commend the President \non his speech, which I hope received wide attention in China.\n  Less successful were the President's attempts to bring the Chinese \naround on the matter of proliferation of technologies associated with \nweapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. This has been a \nbone of contention between the U.S. and China for many years, despite \nrepeated assurances by the Chinese that they would cease providing \nthese technologies to states such as Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Pakistan, North \nKorea, Libya and others.\n  For example, in November of 2000, the U.S. and China signed an \nagreement stipulating that China would stop its proliferation \npractices. The Chinese have not yet implemented that agreement. We \nshould insist on implementation. The same goes for the multilateral \nMissile Technology Control Regime, the MTCR, a voluntary agreement \namong 28 nations to restrict the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. China, although not among the 28 member nations, has \npromised to adhere to the MTCR. Let's see some delivery on that. \nAlthough President Bush has made new proposals in this area to the \nChinese leaders, to date, his efforts have been rebuffed.\n  The Chinese have also stated that they are ready to issue export \ncontrol regulations that will make it clearly illegal for Chinese \ncompanies to proliferate specific items. Where is the list? We might \nwish to consider making certain transfers of technology or other items \nthe Chinese want from us contingent on an acceptable export control \nlist plus the implementation and enforcement of export control \nregulations. This is an area where we need to close some loopholes and \ndemonstrate to the Chinese that the United States is serious about \nstopping this dangerous practice. The Chinese are very attentive to \nactions, and not overly impressed by rhetoric.\n  The Chinese seem to have the psychology backwards. In order for them \nto comply with commitments they have already made, they have said that \nthe U.S. should provide more incentives to deliver on their promises. \nThey would like, in particular, for the U.S. to free up and approve \nlicenses for satellite launches in China. I see it the opposite way: in \nthe face of noncompliance and lack of progress on the November 2000 \npledges regarding missile technology exports, we should, first, refuse \nto grant any licenses for satellite launches in China; and, second, \nwithhold or prohibit the export of additional high technology and \nscience that the Chinese badly want.\n  What is the current situation? First, the so-called sanctions regime \nwhich penalizes such behavior does not work. When a Chinese company is \nfound to have provided missile technologies to, let us say, Iran or \nIraq, U.S. law today provides that the company be prohibited from doing \nbusiness in the U.S. The prohibition may look good on paper, but it \nappears to provide no real deterrent to Chinese companies that deal on \nthe international market.\n  Second, the Chinese government makes a pretense of not knowing that \nso-called private companies in China are engaging in this behavior. \nThis boggles the mind. Of course the government knows, or can quickly \nfind out. We need to help the Chinese government focus on this matter, \nand so I propose that we consider changing our sanctions laws in this \narea to penalize the Chinese government itself for this behavior, \nregardless of whether the culprit is the government or a private \ncompany. Restrictions could be immediately slapped on exports of \nvarious technologies and scientific advances from the U.S. that are of \nhigh importance to the Chinese, such as space launch and other \ntechnologies that they covet from us. Only by immediate and painful \nsteps will the Chinese government be motivated to end this practice, \nand drop the pretense of being ignorant of these transactions.\n\n  The Chinese government is capable of practicing a very effective form \nof brutal dictatorship in areas, such as religious freedom, and freedom \nof the press and assembly, any time it chooses to do so. It has been \nvery effective, for example in crushing the Falun Gong religious \nmovement in a very short period of time throughout China. Surely \nChinese leaders can exert equal pressure to stop the proliferation of \nmissile technology and end a practice that is anathema to civilized \nnations and the international community.\n  I would remind my colleagues that the Chinese themselves do not \nhesitate to use trade sanctions to correct what they see as unfair \nactions by other nations. Recently, when the Japanese slapped high \ntariffs on Chinese mushrooms and other agricultural products, the \nChinese immediately retaliated by stopping the importation into China \nof Japanese automobiles. The Japanese got the message in very short \norder and dropped the agricultural tariffs. So the Chinese know how to \nfashion punishments to fit the crime. That is all I am suggesting here. \nWe should consider a credible sanctions regime, on items that the \nChinese really care about, that could stop in its tracks the very \ndangerous practice of the proliferation of advanced missiles systems \nand weapons to states which should not be getting them.\n  A related consideration is that the Chinese, who are relying more and \nmore on imported oil, seem to be attempting to secure long-term energy \ncontracts with the regimes which are the recipients of their advanced \nweapons technologies. To the extent that there is a quid pro quo here, \nand clearly that appears to be the case, we might consider helping the \nChinese secure contracts for energy supplies from sources other than \nrogue states, on the condition that proliferation end. This form of \ncarrot could well be used as an incentive to change behavior.\n  In sum, I am suggesting a mixed basket of disincentives and \nincentives, penalties and rewards, to encourage the Chinese to get out \nof the proliferation business.\n  Secretary of State Powell has called Chinese noncompliance on \nnonproliferation an ``irritation'' in the U.S.-Chinese relationship. I \nwould characterize it as an open wound.\n  The Chinese are dragging their feet on implementing agreements and \nassurances with the U.S. on proliferation, and hiding behind various \ntransparent excuses. It is time for Congress and the Administration to \nconsider specific changes in the laws dealing with sanctions on \nproliferation practices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3621-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3621-S3622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CHANGES TO H.

Madam President, I rise today to honor the \nmembers of the American Heart Association, AHA, for all that they have \naccomplished in this nation's ongoing struggle against heart disease \nand stroke.\n  Founded in 1924 by six cardiologists, the American Heart Association \nhas worked for more than 70 years to accurately inform the American \npublic of the dangers of heart disease and stroke. Through their \neffective fundraising efforts, the AHA has been able to perform \nextensive research on cardiovascular diseases and their effects on the \nAmerican people. Research has shown that cardiovascular diseases, \nincluding heart disease and stroke, kill nearly 960,000 Americans each \nand every year; nearly a death every 33 seconds. Cardiovascular \ndiseases also cost more than any other disease, with an estimated $330 \nbillion in medical expenses and lost productivity in 2002.\n  Yesterday, Kentucky representatives of the Ohio Valley Affiliate of \nthe AHA visited my office here in Washington. The information they \nprovided proved to be quite shocking. In the Commonwealth of Kentucky, \nheart disease is the #1 killer. In fact, heart disease and stroke \naccounted for an astounding 43.5 percent of deaths in Kentucky in 1999; \n12,098 Kentuckians died of heart disease and 2,710 died of stroke in \n1999. Furthermore, Kentucky has the 6th highest death rate from heart \ndisease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases in the nation. As \ncan be seen through statistical data, cardiovascular diseases are \nkilling Americans, specifically Kentuckians, in mass numbers every \nyear. We must realize the severity of this problem and actively join \nthe fight to ensure that future generations of Americans are well \ninformed on how to prevent these diseases from occurring.\n  I applaud the work of the American Heart Association, especially that \nperformed by the Ohio Valley Affiliate in Kentucky, and thank them for \nstriving to create a healthier America. I ask that my fellow Senators \njoin me in praising all involved with the AHA, for their work truly \nmakes a difference to current and future generations of \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3622-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3622-S3623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE ZACHARY AND ELIZABETH FISHER DISTINGUISHED CIVILIAN HUMANITARIAN \n                             AWARD FOR 2001\n\n Mr. BURNS.

The 341 Space Wing controls 200 Minuteman III missiles. I have \nhad the pleasure to speak to members of MAC on several occasions over \nthe years at their monthly luncheons held at Malmstrom Air Force Base. \nLet me tell you, as this award signifies, they are second to none. The \nsupport they show for our Malmstrom Air Force Base men and women is \nmore than just these monthly luncheons. For many years, MAC has \nsponsored a free picnic for military members and their families, with \nover 5000 people attending the annual event. At these picnics, MAC \ngives away over $15,000 in prizes, which comes from the local \nmerchants. They also sponsor annual golf tournaments, raising money for \nmilitary support programs. The leadership of MAC and\n\n[[Page S3623]]\n\nMalmstrom AFB work together as TEAM MALMSTROM to foster understanding \nof the issues facing the military and the Great Falls community.\n  As we face another round of base closings in the future, the Great \nFalls community has, once again, shown they are committed to the future \nof Malmstrom AFB and the brave men and women who serve their country \nfrom there. Malmstrom AFB's future is much brighter; the tours there by \nour Air Force men and women are better, due to the Great Falls MAC. \nNow, the entire Department of Defense knows Malmstrom AFB has \ntremendous support from the residents of the Great Falls, MT area. \nCongratulations MAC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3623-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAVID HANEY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \nAct of 1968 to ensure that chaplains killed in the line of duty receive \npublic safety officer death benefits; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today I proudly join with Senators \nCampbell, and Clinton to introduce the Mychal Judge Police and Fire \nChaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act of 2002. I want to thank \nmy colleagues for their leadership and strong support for public safety \nofficers and their families. I also commend Representative Nadler and \nRepresentative Manzullo for their leadership on the House version of \nthis bill.\n  This bill aims to restructure the Public Safety Officers' Benefits \nProgram to expressly include chaplains as members of the law \nenforcement and fire units in which they serve, and would make these \nchaplains eligible for the benefits available to public safety officers \nwho have died or who have been permanently disabled as a result of \ninjuries sustained in the line of duty. In addition, the Act would \nexpand the list of those who may receive benefits in the event of a \npublic safety officer's death in the line of duty by including as \npotential beneficiaries the persons named on the most recently executed \nlife insurance policy of the deceased officer. In short, this \nlegislation will ensure that the families of chaplains killed in the \nline of duty receive due payments through the Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits program.\n  On September 11, 2001, Father Mychal Judge, a chaplain with the New \nYork City Fire Department, was killed by falling debris as he \nministered to victims of the horrific terrorist attacks on the World \nTrade Center. He was survived solely by his two sisters.\n  Current law allows the Bureau of Justice Assistance to determine \nwhether or not a public safety officer died as a direct or proximate \ncause of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, and, if such \ncriterion is met, directs the BJA to pay a monetary benefit of $250,000 \nto the surviving family members of the officer. In the case of Father \nJudge, the BJA correctly determined that he was eligible for payment of \ndeath benefits. However, Father Judge had no wife or children, and \noutlived his parents, and no benefits were paid to his life insurance \nbeneficiaries, his sisters, as they were ineligible under existing law \nto qualify as his beneficiaries and receive death benefits. This case \nis not unique, of the approximately 450 public safety officers killed \nin the September 11 attacks, there are 10 individuals known to have \ndied without spouses, children or parents, so the $250,000 death \nbenefit will not be paid. This is simply wrong.\n  For the purpose of determining benefit eligibility, the U.S. Code \nlimits ``public safety officers'' to law enforcement officers; \nfirefighters; rescue crews; FEMA employees; and members of State, \nlocal, or tribal emergency management or civil defense agencies who \nperform official duties in cooperation with FEMA. While the language of \nexisting law could be interpreted to include chaplains, the Mychal \nJudge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act \nwould resolve any existing ambiguities. It specifically recognizes \nchaplains as public servants eligible for Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits so long as they serve as officially recognized or designated \nmembers of a legally organized volunteer fire or police department, or \nare officially recognized or designated public employees of a legally \norganized fire or police department, and was responding to a fire, \nrescue, or police emergency when injured or killed.\n  Additionally, this legislation would expand the list of those allowed \nto receive such benefits in the event of an officer's death in the line \nof duty. Current law restricts such beneficiaries to the spouse, child, \nor parent of the decedent. Our bill would expand this list, which would \nstill give priority to spouses and children, but, in the event that \nneither survived the officer, would allow the monetary benefit to be \npaid to the individual designated by such officer as a beneficiary \nunder the officer's most recently executed life insurance policy. In \nthe event that there was no such individual named or that an individual \nso named did not survive the officer, the benefit would then be paid to \nthe parents of the officer.\n  Before us we have yet another unique opportunity to provide much-\nneeded relief for the survivors of the brave public servants who \nselflessly risk and sacrifice their own lives everyday so that others \nmight live or be comforted. I look forward to continuing to work with \nmy colleagues on legislation to support our nation's public safety \nofficers who put their lives at risk every day to protect us, and I \nurge the Senate to pass this bill expeditiously.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n  S. 2432. A bill to prohibit the use of fiscal year 2003 Federal funds \nfor support of the Palestinian Authority pending the cessation of \nterrorist activities by the Palestinian Authority; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I rise today to offer a \nlong-overdue bill for the purpose of defunding terrorism by Yasser \nArafat and his supporters, by shutting off their flow of dollars from \nthe U.S. Treasury.\n  It was the belief of the previous administration that Yasser Arafat \nand his Palestine Liberation Organization would live up to their \nrenunciation of terrorism, and the newly-formed Palestinian Authority \nheaded by Arafat and his PLO cronies could operate as a responsible \ngoverning body to further peace.\n  Instead, Arafat, the PLO and the PA have used the guise of their new-\nfound political legitimacy, and agreement to the Tenet peace plan, to \nmask their real desires.\n  The reality of the situation is that the Palestinian Authority is \njoined at the hip with the PLO and other terrorist groups, such as \nTanzim, the armed wing of Fatah, the largest faction of the PLO.\n  Tanzim is headed by a member of the PA's legislature, and is believed \nto have developed an alliance with Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic \nJihad.\n  Our aid frees up other money the PA uses to pay for the bombs that \nare killing innocent men, women and children in Israel.\n  The chart was compiled by my staff from a published list of each such \nattack last year. That list is 25 pages long.\n  We dare not forget the level of terror visited upon Israel by \nPalestinian terrorists. The terror attacks in Israel in the year 2001 \nalone, from the first one on New Year's day, to the last one on \nDecember 12 are sobering: 79 separate incidents; 1220 injured; an \nadditional 160 killed.\n  It has been reported that on March 2, 1973, Yasser Arafat ordered the \nexecution of Cleo Noel, the American Ambassador to the Sudan. Arafat \nand his supporters have since been tied to countless acts of terror and \nmurder. Therefore, it is beyond belief that our country to this day \nprovides the Palestinian Authority and related entities more than $75 \nmillion dollars every year.\n\n[[Page S3628]]\n\n  There have been foreign intelligence reports that Arafat has perhaps \n$10 billion stowed away, a small fortune. He doesn't ``need'' U.S. \nhumanitarian aid.\n  It is flat out wrong to ask American taxpayers to support and \nsubsidize the PA when Yasser Arafat and the PLO have made no attempt to \nuse the resources at their disposal to provide the most basic of \nhumanitarian aid and services to their people. The interest alone from \nArafat's bank account could lift countless Palestinians out of squalid \nconditions.\n  Of course the opponents of my bill will argue that this is just \n``humanitarian aid'' for Arafat-friendly NGO's, which begs the reality \nthat those dollars free up Arafat's other money for him to then use to \npay to manufacture bombs.\n  We now have the proof, in Arafat's own handwriting, that the \nPalestinian Authority is still paying the terrorist's bills.\n  Consider the proof, on the official letterhead of the Presidential \nBureau of the Palestinian Authority, slash, Palestine Liberation \nOrganization, bearing the signature of Yasser Arafat just 8 days after \nour country was attacked on 9-11, ordering $600 be paid from the \ntreasury of the Palestinian Authority to each of three terrorists. Two \nof them are senior activists of the Fatah terrorist group, one of \nthese, Ziad Da'as, is the head of the group behind a recent deadly \nterrorist attack on a Bat-mitzvah party in Israel. The Israeli Defense \nMinistry says they recently captured this document at Arafat's office \nin Ramallah.\n  There is still more proof: an order for Yasser Arafat to the Finance \nMinistry of the Palestinian Authority from January 7 of this year. It \nwas faxed from Fatah on January 20. Here, Arafat orders the \ndisbursement of $350 to each of the 12 named Fatah activists. According \nto the Israeli Defense Ministry, who captured this document at Arafat's \nheadquarters in Ramallah, each of these 12 individuals are known \nterrorists, belonging to Fatah and or Tanzim. Arafat's approval is \ngiven in response to a request of Ra'ed Karmi, then the head of the \nFatah and Tanzim terror groups, which perpetrated numerous murderous \nattacks on innocent Israeli civilians since September 2000.\n  As recently as April 7 of this year, Tim Russert on ``Meet the \nPress'' asked the Secretary of State to deny that Arafat is funding \nterrorism. Here is what Russert said:\n\n       ``Israel says documents link Arafat and terrorism. They \n     seized documents and made them public, which liked the office \n     of Yasser Arafat with terrorist attacks carried out against \n     Israeli civilians and other targets. One of the documents, \n     said to be an invoice submitted by a leading Palestinian \n     militant group to a Palestinian official.... Among other \n     items, the invoice requested 20,000 Israeli Shekels, ($4,200 \n     American), to buy electrical and chemical components for the \n     production of a month's supply of 30 bombs. It's an invoice \n     of terrorism, said Dori Gold, an advisor to Prime Minister \n     Sharon. Mr. Secretary, do you believe the Palestinian \n     Authority harbors or supports terrorism?\n\n  Do you know what our Secretary of State replied?\n  Did he deny the authenticity of this document? He did not.\n  Did he deny that Arafat paid the bill? He did not.\n  Did he deny that our taxpayer dollars are thus funding the killing of \ninnocent men, women and children? He did not.\n  What he said was, ``It is a complex situation''.\n  There's nothing complex about it! Our tax dollars should never be \nused for terrorism. Period. End of discussion!\n  I don't care if Arafat has agreed to negotiate.\n  I don't care if Arafat has agreed to the Tenet plan.\n  I don't care that we need to keep contacts with the Palestinians, we \ncan do that anyway without subsidizing, and therefore legitimating, \ntheir activity.\n  We should not be funding terrorism, and that is all there is to it\n  The United States should not continue a policy which has utterly \nfailed to curb the violence on the part of these radical \nIslamic terrorist groups that Arafat and the PLO have sway over.\n\n  Furthermore, American taxpayers should not be fooled into footing a \nbill for ``humanitarian aid'' when Arafat and his regime have no desire \nin their hearts to co-exist peacefully with the State of Israel.\n  When our land was so brutally attacked last fall, the President set a \nnew agenda. He said, ``From this day forward, any nation that continues \nto harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as \na hostile regime.''\n  Well, my colleagues, that is what Mr. Arafat and his minions are: a \nhostile regime.\n  Even Secretary Powell, in that ``Meet the Press'' interview conceded \nas much. He said that the United States has never shrunk from the \naccusation that the Palestinian Authority supports and harbors \nterrorism.\n  So why then, why are we taking tens of millions of dollars every year \nout of our taxpayer's pockets and sending it to the P.A. where it can \nbe used to free up other money to build bombs that suicidal maniacs \nstrap on themselves to blow up a cafe, or a schoolbus?\n  The bill I am offering today will put an end to that. I say no more \nmoney should be sent to anyone that will use it in a way that frees up \nArafat to pay his bomb-building bills.\n  I say no more money that goes to de-stabilizing the powderkeg in the \nMiddle East.\n  I say no more money for Arafat's new intifada against Israel.\n  My colleagues, I strongly urge you to stand with me on the side of \nIsrael and against terrorism and to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2432\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 1590 East Joyce Boulevard in Fayetteville, Arkansas, \nas the ``Clarence B. Craft Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to designate a United States postal facility in \nFayetteville, AK in honor of one of America's greatest heroes and \nfellow Arkansan, Clarence B. Craft. This bill would name the facility \nat 1590 East Joyce Boulevard as the ``Clarence B. Craft Post Office \nBuilding.'' Mr. Craft passed away on March 28, 2002, but left behind a \nlegacy of kindness and courage. Prior to his passing he was one of only \n148 living persons to be warded our Nation's highest award for actions \nabove and beyond the call of duty, the Congressional Medal of Honor. \nClarence Craft was an extremely humble person, and rarely talked about \nthe accolades that made him a ``special man'' as he was described by \nthose who knew him well. He spent the last twenty-five years of his \nlife in northwest Arkansas giving selflessly of his time as a volunteer \nfor\n\n[[Page S3629]]\n\nthe Veterans' Affairs Medical Center in Fayetteville. He was a true and \ndedicated friend to the veterans, one who lifted their spirits with \npersonal visits, often visiting every patient in the hospital.\n  Clarence Craft's actions on May 31, 1945, are truly deserving of this \nrecognition. On the island of Okinawa, then-Private First Class Craft \nlaunched a one-man attack against the Japanese defense on Hen Hill. \nOpposed by forces heavily armed with rifles, machine guns, mortars and \ngrenades, Clarence Craft killed at least 25 enemy soldiers. His heroic \nefforts were the key to the U.S. forces' penetration of a defense that \nhad repelled repeated, heavy assaults by battalion-sized U.S. \nformations for twelve days, and resulted in the entire defensive line \ncrumbling.\n  I enthusiastically encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto support this bill in honoring Clarence B. Craft, an American hero.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2433\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to protect \nconsumers against predatory practices in connection with high cost \nmortgage transactions, to strengthen the civil remedies available to \nconsumers under existing law, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, earlier today, I had a press \nconference with a number of my colleagues, Senators Schumer, Stabenow, \nCorzine, and Clinton, as well as Mayor DeStefano of New Haven, CT, \nMayor McCollum from Richmond, VA, Wade Henderson, Executive Director of \nthe Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and Tess Canja, a member of \nthe Board of AARP, to announce the introduction of the ``Predatory \nLending Consumer Protection Act of 2002.''\n  When I took over as Chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs last year, I made it clear that one of my highest \npriorities would be to use the Committee as a way to shine a bright \nlight on the deceptive and destructive practices of predatory lenders.\n  We then held a series of three hearings, starting in July of 2001 and \ncontinuing through January of this year, at which the Committee heard \nfrom housing experts, community groups, legal advocates, industry \nrepresentatives and victims of predatory lending in an effort to \ndetermine how best to address this problem. The bill I am introducing \nthis afternoon, along with 14 of my colleagues, represents the result \nof the recent work of the Committee, as well as efforts from the \nprevious Congress.\n  In particular, this legislation builds on the excellent work of my \ncolleagues in the Senate and Representative LaFalce, with whom I \nintroduced legislation on this topic in the last Congress.\n  Homeownership is the American Dream. We say this so often that there \nis a danger of the idea becoming almost trivial, or devoid of real \nmeaning. But it pays to step back for a second and understand how true \nand fundamental this is.\n  Homeownership is the opportunity for Americans to put down roots and \nstart creating equity for themselves and their families. Homeownership \nhas been the path to building wealth for generations of Americans, \nwealth that can be tapped to send children to college, pay for a secure \nretirement, or simply work as a reserve against unexpected emergencies. \nIt has been the key to ensuring stable communities, good schools, and \nsafe streets. Common sense tells us, and the evidence confirms, that \nhomeowners are more engaged citizens and more active in their \ncommunities.\n  Little wonder, then, that so many Americans, young and old, aspire to \nachieve this dream.\n  The predatory lending industry plays on these hopes and dreams to \ncynically cheat people out of their wealth. These lenders target lower \nincome, elderly, and, often, uneducated homeowners for their abusive \npractices. And, as a study released today by the Center for Community \nChange so clearly indicates, they target minorities, driving a wedge \nbetween these families and the hope of a productive life in the \neconomic and financial mainstream of America.\n  We owe it to these hardworking families to provide protections \nagainst these unscrupulous pirates.\n  Let me share with you one of the stories we heard at our hearings in \nJuly. Mary Ann Podelco, a widowed waitress from West Virginia, used \n$19,000 from her husband's life insurance to pay off the balance on her \nmortgage, thus owning her home free and clear. Before her husband's \ndeath, she had never had a checking account or a credit card. She then \ntook out a $11,921 loan for repairs. At the time, her monthly income \nfrom Social Security was $458, and her loan payments were more than \nhalf this amount. Ms. Podelco, who has a sixth grade education, \ntestified that after her first refinancing, ``I began getting calls \nfrom people trying to refinance my mortgage all hours of the day and \nnight.'' Within two years, having been advised to refinance seven \ntimes, each time seeing high points and fees being financed into her \nnew loan, she owed $64,000, and lost her home to foreclosure.\n  Ms. Podelco's story is all too typical. Unfortunately, most of the \nsharp practices used by unscrupulous lenders and brokers, while \nunethical and clearly abusive, are perfectly legal. This bill is \ndesigned to address that problem by tightening the interest rate and \nfee triggers that define a high cost loans; the bill improves \nprotections for borrowers receiving such loans by prohibiting the \nfinancing of exorbitant fees, ``packing'' in of unnecessary and costly \nproducts, such as credit life insurance, and limiting prepayment \npenalties. Finally, it protects these consumers' rights to seek redress \nby prohibiting mandatory arbitration, as the Federal Trade Commission \nproposed unanimously in 2000.\n  We cannot extol the virtues of homeownership, as we so often do, \nwithout\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n\nseeking at the same time to preserve this benefit for so many elderly, \nminority, and unsophisticated Americans who are the targets of \nunscrupulous lenders and brokers. This legislation will help achieve \nthis important goal.\n  Before closing, let me say that, in addition to the aforementioned \nAARP, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and Center for Community \nChange, CCC, this bill has been endorsed by the National Consumer Law \nCenter, ACORN, the National League of Cities, National Consumer \nReinvestment Coalition, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, NAACP, the Self-Help Credit Union, and the U.S. Conference of \nMayors.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the Executive \nSummary of the new CCC study entitled ``Risk or Race? Racial \nDisparities and the Subprime Refinance Market.'' While predatory \nlending is not by any means exclusively a problem of racial \ndiscrimination, this study demonstrates how much more minorities are \nforced to rely on subprime lending as a source of mortgage credit. \nBecause predatory lending is concentrated in the subprime market, this \nstudy provides new evidence on why the protections provided by the \nPredatory Lending Consumer Protection Act are so important.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Risk or Race? Racial Disparities and the Subprime Refinance Market--A \n               Report of the Center for Community Change\n\n   (Prepared by Calvin Bradford, Calvin Bradford & Associates, Ltd.)\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       African-Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately \n     represented in the subprime home refinance mortgage market. \n     Surprisingly, this study finds that the disparity between \n     whites and African-Americans and other minorities actually \n     grows at upper-income levels and is greater for higher-income \n     African-American homeowners than for lower-income white \n     homeowners.\n       High levels of subprime mortgage lending represent markets \n     where borrowers are paying unusually high costs for credit, \n     while often depleting their home equity. Of particular \n     concern are the consistent and pervasive racial disparities \n     and concentration of subprime lending in communities of color \n     and to borrowers of color at all income levels. The \n     persistent racial patterns found in this analysis raise \n     questions as to whether factors other than risk alone account \n     for them.\n       These patterns exist in all regions and cities of all \n     sizes, thereby raising concerns about the absence of prime \n     conventional mortgage loans in these geographic areas. The \n     subprime market is fertile ground for predatory lending, a \n     disturbing part of the explosive growth in this market. \n     Abusive credit practices in the subprime segment of the \n     mortgage market are stripping borrowers of home equity they \n     may spend a lifetime building. Thousands of families end up \n     facing foreclosure, which destabilizes communities and often \n     shatters families.\n       The subprime market provides loans to borrowers who do not \n     meet the credit standards for borrowers in the prime market. \n     Most subprime borrowers use the collateral in their homes for \n     debt consolidation or other consumer credit purposes. The \n     growth in subprime lending has benefitted credit-impaired \n     borrowers, those who may have blemishes in their credit \n     records, insufficient credit history, or non-traditional \n     credit sources. When undertaken responsibly, subprime lending \n     offers the opportunity to further expand lending markets to \n     underserved populations.\n       However, research by the U.S. Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development (HUD) and others has documented the waive \n     of foreclosures occurring in the subprime market. High \n     foreclosure rates for subprime loans indicate that many \n     subprime borrowers are entering into mortgage loans they \n     cannot afford. Thus, high levels of subprime lending indicate \n     markets where borrowers have unusually high risks of losing \n     their homes. The sheer geographic concentration of these \n     loans, therefore, may have a significant negative impact not \n     just on individual borrowers, but on entire neighborhoods. \n     Foreclosed homes frequently remain vacant for extended \n     periods, during which they are neglected. These vacant homes \n     can depress property values and lead to neighborhood \n     deterioration and disinvestment.\n       This study represents some important differences from \n     previous work. It is national in scope, analyzing lending \n     patterns in all 331 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), \n     and ranking metropolitan areas by a variety of measures of \n     subprime lending. It also includes a regional analysis, \n     looking at the variations in lending patterns in different \n     geographic regions within the country. The study focuses on \n     single-family conventional refinance loans, where subprime \n     lending is most concentrated, using 2000 data provided by the \n     Federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. In addition to looking \n     at lending patterns based on the race and income of the \n     borrower, the study also analyzes the way these patterns play \n     out at the neighborhood level and identifies the types of \n     neighborhoods in which subprime loans are most concentrated. \n     Finally, in conjunction with this study, the Center for \n     Community Change is making available an important new \n     national database on subprime lending, which is posted on our \n     website at www.communitychange.org.\n       Our analysis is based on two key measures. One is the \n     percentage of home refinance loans made to any given racial \n     or ethnic group that are subprime. The second is a comparison \n     between this figure and the percentage of subprime refinance \n     loans made to white borrowers in the same geographic market. \n     This comparison is expressed as a ratio, the ``racial \n     disparity ratio.'' A ratio of 1.0 indicates no disparity, a \n     ratio above 1.0 indicates that minorities are receiving a \n     higher proportion of subprime loans than whites. The higher \n     the ratio, the greater the disparity between white and non-\n     white borrowers.\n\n\n                              Key Findings\n\n       This study documents the pervasive racial disparities in \n     subprime lending. Placed in the context of previous research, \n     this study supports the position that risk alone does not \n     explain these racial disparities. Our three major findings \n     are as follows:\n       1. There are significant racial disparities in subprime \n     lending, and these disparities actually increase as income \n     increases.\n       Lower-income African-Americans receive 2.4 times as many \n     subprime loans as lower-income whites, while upper-income \n     African-Americans receive 3.0 times as many subprime loans as \n     do whites with comparable incomes.\n       Lower-income Hispanics receive 1.4 times as many subprime \n     loans as do lower-income whites, while upper-income Hispanics \n     receive 2.2 times as many of these loans.\n       At a level of 5.93, St. Louis has the nation's highest \n     disparity ratio between upper-income African-Americans and \n     upper-income whites. It was one of five metropolitan areas \n     where this disparity ratio was greater than 4.0. In another \n     18 cities, this ratio was between 3.0 and 4.0.\n       2. High concentrations of subprime lending and racial \n     disparities in subprime lending exist in all regions of the \n     nation.\n       Each region contains metropolitan areas where the level of \n     subprime lending is above the national average of 25.31%.\n       In 17 MSAs, the level of subprime lending is more than 1.5 \n     times the national norm. Fourteen of these are in the \n     Southeast or Southwest, 7 are in Texas. El Paso has the \n     highest overall level of subprime loans in the nation: \n     47.28%.\n       For African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, \n     disparities exist in all regions of the country, reaching as \n     high as 3.25 or more in the Midwest and Great Plains.\n       3. High concentrations of subprime lending and racial \n     disparities occur in metropolitan areas of all sizes.\n       Twelve of the 17 metropolitan areas that have \n     concentrations of subprime lending more than 1.5 times the \n     national norm have populations below 500,000. For example, \n     Enid, Oklahoma, the nation's smallest metropolitan area, \n     ranks #12 in percentage of subprime lending. On the other \n     hand, 4 of these 17 metropolitan areas are above 1 million in \n     population.\n       When we examined disparity ratios for cities in different \n     size categories, we found the highest disparity ratios for \n     African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans in cities \n     under 250,000 in population. For example, the highest \n     disparity ratio for African-Americans is found in Kankakee, \n     Illinois, with a population of 103,833 and a disparity ratio \n     of 6.10. For Asians, the highest disparity ratios are \n     generally found in cities between 500,000 and the 1 million \n     in population.\n\n\n                       Additional Racial Impacts\n\n       In examining the racial dynamics of subprime lending, our \n     research identified three distinct dimensions to the \n     patterns: (a) high overall percentages of subprime loans made \n     to African-Americans and Hispanics; (b) high disparity ratios \n     when these percentages are compared to white borrowers; and, \n     (c) high disparity ratios for neighborhoods with significant \n     African-American and Hispanic residents as compared to white \n     neighborhoods. Examples of these patterns include:\n\n                           African-Americans\n\n       In every single metropolitan area, the percentage of \n     subprime loans made to African-American borrowers was higher \n     than the national norm of 25.31%. (Note: certain metropolitan \n     areas were excluded from this calculation because they had \n     fewer than 100 loans to African-Americans, which was the \n     number we set as the threshold for this calculation.)\n       Buffalo, New York had the highest percentage of subprime \n     loans to African-Americans, 74.53%.\n       There were no metropolitan areas where the disparity ratio \n     for African-Americans fell below 1.64.\n       The highest disparity ratio for African-Americans was \n     Kankakee, Illinois, at 6.10. This was followed by Albany, \n     Georgia, (5.69) and Dothan, Alabama (5.23)\n       Chicago had the highest disparity ratio for African-\n     American census tracts: 4.12. It was followed by Milwaukee \n     (4.04) and Philadelphia (3.40). Eight metropolitan areas had \n     disparity ratios above 3.0 for African-Americans census \n     tracts; another 65 cities had disparity ratios above 2.0.\n\n[[Page S3631]]\n\n                               Hispanics\n\n       The highest percentages of subprime loans to Hispanic \n     borrowers were found in El Paso, Texas, (52.36%) and San \n     Antonio, Texas (51.46%).\n       San Jose, California, had a disparity ratio for Hispanics \n     of 2.45, the highest in the nation. Fourteen metropolitan \n     areas had disparity ratio above 2.0.\n       In Corpus Christi, Texas, 75.48% of refinance loans in \n     Hispanic census tracts were subprime, the highest percentage \n     of subprime loans in Hispanic tracts in the nation.\n       Albuquerque, New Mexico, had the highest disparity ratio \n     for Hispanic census tracts, 2.59.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The persistent racial disparities in levels of subprime \n     lending found in this analysis do not, in and of themselves, \n     constitute conclusive proof that there is widespread \n     discrimination in the subprime lending markets. These \n     disparities do, however, raise serious questions about the \n     extent to which risk alone could account for such patterns. \n     Discrimination has been a persistent problem in the home \n     finance markets in the United States. The history of mortgage \n     lending discrimination adds weight to the need to explore \n     more fully the role that discrimination plays in the subprime \n     markets through either differential treatment of individual \n     minority borrowers or through the effects of industry \n     practices.\n       The issue of whether there is racial exploitation in the \n     subprime markets essentially rests on two issues. First, are \n     the disparities in subprime lending related to race? Second, \n     can these disparities be fully explained by legitimate risk \n     factors? Recent research suggests that risk alone does not \n     explain the huge racial disparities that this study found \n     across all income levels. Among the factors that influence \n     the racial disparities in subprime lending:\n       The absence of active mainstream prime lenders in minority \n     markets has increased the chances that borrowers in these \n     communities are paying a high cost for credit. For example, \n     the finding that racial disparities actually increase as \n     income increases suggests that a portion of subprime lending \n     is occurring with borrowers whose credit histories would \n     qualify them for lower-cost, conventional, prime loans.\n       Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the publicly chartered \n     secondary mortgage market enterprises, have questioned \n     whether risk explains the use of subprimes loans. Freddie Mac \n     has estimated that from ``10 to 30 percent of borrowers who \n     obtained mortgages from the subprime market could have \n     qualified for a conventional loan through Loan Prospector'' \n     (Freddie Mac's automated underwriting system). (See Freddie \n     Mac, ``We open Doors for America's Families,'' Freddie Mac's \n     Annual Housing Report for 1997).\n       Subprime refinance lending tends to be ``sold'' to \n     customers rather than ``sought'' by them. Subprime lenders \n     aggressively market their loans to potential borrowers. These \n     marketing techniques disproportionately target minority \n     market segments, often to homeowners with considerable equity \n     in their homes. Since mainstream prime lenders are absent \n     from many of these same communities, homeowners are more \n     susceptible to being persuaded that the more expensive \n     subprime loans are all that is available to them.\n       There is other evidence that risk factors do not explain \n     racial differences in the use of subprime lending. A recent \n     study by the research Institute for Housing America \n     concluded, ``after controlling for borrower income, debt, and \n     credit history, racial groups behave differently.'' (See \n     Pennington-Cross, Yezer, and Nichols, Credit Risk and \n     Mortgage Lending: Who Uses Subprime and Why? Research \n     Institute for Housing America (2000).) Specifically, the \n     study noted that minorities are more likely to use subprime \n     lending than whites.\n       Subprime lending may provide certain borrowers with access \n     to credit they could not otherwise obtain in the prime \n     markets. However, the wide disparities in subprime lending to \n     African-Americans and Hispanics at all income levels, suggest \n     that factors other than risk may be at work. Further, the \n     pervasiveness of subprime lending in communities of color, in \n     all regions and in metropolitan areas of all sizes, raises \n     important public policy concerns about possible adverse \n     implications stemming from these heavy geographic \n     concentrations. It also suggests that minority homeowners may \n     be particularly vulnerable to predatory lenders, which by \n     most accounts target communities with high levels of subprime \n     lending.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Miller, Mr. \n        Corzine, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Thurmond):\n  S. 2439. A bill to prohibit human cloning while preserving important \nareas of medical research, including stem cell research.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to prohibit human cloning while preserving important areas \nof medical research, including stem cell research.\n  I introduce this legislation on behalf of Senator Feinstein, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Hatch, Senator Harkin, Senator Boxer, Senator Durbin, \nSenator Thurmond, Senator Miller, Senator Corzine, Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Clinton--and I do believe there will be other cosponsors \njoining that parade.\n  Stem cells offer enormous hope for solving some of the most tragic \nillnesses confronting Americans--and for that matter people worldwide. \nIn November of 1998, stem cells burst on the scene, holding this unique \npromise. Stem cells are extracted from embryos, and they may be used to \nreplace defective cells in the human body. For example, enormous \nprogress has been made on conquering Alzheimer's, conquering \nParkinson's, on cancer, on heart ailments, and many other illnesses.\n  A controversy arose because they came from embryos and embryos can \nproduce life. Embryos are characteristically or customarily created for \nin vitro fertilization. Normally, about a dozen are created, maybe \nthree or four are used, and the rest are discarded. It is from those \ndiscarded embryos that the stem cells are extracted. If all of those \nembryos could turn into human life, that would obviously be the very \nbest use of those embryos. But there are some 100,000 in storage, and \nit is a practical impossibility for those embryos to be used for human \nlife.\n  In last year's appropriation bill coming out of the subcommittee of \nLabor, Health, Human Services and Education, where I am the ranking \nmember, $1 million was appropriated to promote adoption of embryos. We \nare now working on legislation to give a tax credit for people who use \nthe embryos for adoption. But since there are so many of these embryos \nwhich are not going to be utilized for adoption purposes, and the \nalternatives are either to discard them or to use them, then it makes \ngood sense to use them to save lives.\n  There is general repugnance against reproductive cloning. The \nlegislation which we are introducing now would ban reproductive cloning \nand impose very substantial criminal penalties.\n  Unfortunately, the scientists use a term, ``therapeutic cloning,'' \nwhich has led to confusion and has given a process known as nuclear \ntransplantation a bad name. Essentially what nuclear transplantation \nis, it is to take DNA from a cell of a person who has Parkinson's and \nthen insert that in a egg of a woman with the DNA removed. Then the \nstem cells which are produced from that egg are compatible with the \ndonor's DNA. For example, those stem cells could be used to combat the \nParkinson's which that individual has.\n  The legislation contains very substantial protections to be sure that \nin the course of this nuclear transplantation none of this will be \nimplanted in the womb of a woman or otherwise used to produce human \ncloning, reproductive cloning--cloning of a person. There are very \ntough criminal penalties attached.\n  To Reiterate, over the past 4 years, the Labor, Health and Human \nServices and Education Appropriations Subcommittee has held 14 hearings \nat which scientists, patients, and ethicists have described the promise \nof stem cell research and nuclear transplantation to produce stem \ncells. A problem arises from the fact that scientists misnamed the \npromising technique of nuclear transplantation to produce stem cells. \nIn calling this technique therapeutic cloning, scientists used a word, \nwhich for many Americans, conjures up grotesque images from bad science \nfiction movies: mad scientists, bubbling test tubes, and row after row \nof zombie-like creatures.\n  Most Americans equate the word cloning with human reproductive \ncloning, where a carbon copy of a person is created in a process that \nalso gave us Dolly the sheep and CC the cat. By this definition so-\ncalled therapeutic cloning is not really cloning at all. It is a \nprocess that creates embryonic stem cells genetically matched to a \npatient for the purpose of repairing unhealthy or injured tissue.\n  For example, if a patient has heart damage, the genetic material from \none of his cells could be transplanted into a human egg cell that has \nhad its genetic material removed. After a time, stem cells are \nproduced, coaxed into becoming heart cells, and transplanted into\n\n[[Page S3632]]\n\nthe damaged heart to restore function. Because the cells are an exact \nmatch of the patient's cells, no rejection would occur. Scientists have \nsuggested that this procedure is better termed nuclear transplantation \nto produce stem cells.\n  Embryonic stem cells can be coaxed into becoming any of the more than \n200 types of cells in the human body, and therefore may be used to \ntreat a vast array of diseases and disorders including heart disease, \nParkinson's disease, diabetes, paralysis, Alzheimer's disease, and \nsevere burns. Scientists at the National Academy of Sciences estimate \nthat the combination of nuclear transplantation and stem cell therapies \ncould spare the lives of 170,000 Americans each year.\n  History shows us the devastating effects of tying the hands of \nscientists for ideological reasons. Galileo was imprisoned for his \nsupport of Copernicus' theory that the planets revolve around the sun. \nPope Boniface VIII banned the practice of cadaver dissection in the \n1200's. This set back the understanding of human anatomy and the \npractice of medicine for over 300 years. In the 1800's, the Scottish \nCalvinist Church objected to the use of anesthesia during labor because \nthe ``pain of childbirth was God's will.'' Let us not repeat the \nmistakes of history.\n  Recently 40 American Nobel laureates stated that:\n\n       legislation [that would ban all cloning] would foreclose \n     the legitimate use of nuclear transplantation . . . and \n     impede progress against some of the most debilitating \n     diseases known to man.\n\n  Former Presidents Ford and Carter have written to President Bush \nstating their opposition to reproductive cloning and their strong \nsupport for nuclear transplantation to produce stem cells. I believe \nthat when the facts are weighed there will be strong bipartisan support \nfor such a policy.\n  As I said, today, I, along with Senators Feinstein, Kennedy, Hatch, \nHarkin, Boxer, Durbin, Miller, Corzine, Mikulski, Clinton, and Thurmond \n am introducing a bill which would prohibit human cloning while \npreserving important areas of medical research, including nuclear \ntransplantation to produce stem cells.\n  Let me review the key provisions of the bill. It would prohibit human \nreproductive cloning by imposing a criminal penalty of up to 10 years \nin prison and a civil penalty of at least one million dollars. It would \nallow medical research into nuclear transplantation to produce stem \ncells, also known as therapeutic cloning, thereby allowing promising \nresearch towards cures for a vast array of diseases to go forward. It \nwould apply strict Federal ethical requirements to all nuclear \ntransplantation research. These include informed consent, an ethics \nboard review, and protections for the safety and privacy of research \nparticipants. The legislation imposes a $250,000 civil penalty for \nviolation of the ethics requirements.\n\n  I believe that the Senate should act quickly to ban human cloning. In \nthe process, we must preserve important areas of medical research, such \nas nuclear transplantation to create stem cells. The bill that I and my \ncolleagues have introduced will do that in an ethical and moral way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2439\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Human Cloning Prohibition \n     Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Human cloning is unsafe, immoral, and unacceptable.\n       (2) Federal legislation should be enacted to prohibit \n     anyone from attempting to conduct human cloning, whether \n     using Federal or non-Federal funds.\n       (3) To deter human cloning, any attempt to create a human \n     clone should be a felony subject to severe punishment.\n       (4) The National Academies (including the National Academy \n     of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine) and the National \n     Bioethics Advisory Commission recommended that any \n     legislative action undertaken to ban human cloning should be \n     careful not to interfere with important areas of scientific \n     research, such as nuclear transplantation to produce stem \n     cells.\n       (5) The National Academies found that there are significant \n     differences between human cloning and nuclear \n     transplantation. Specifically, the Academies determined that, \n     unlike human cloning, the creation of embryonic stem cells by \n     nuclear transplantation does not involve implantation of an \n     embryo in a uterus and thus cannot produce a complete, live-\n     born animal (that is, a ``clone'').\n       (6) The National Academies found that scientific and \n     medical considerations that justify a ban on human cloning \n     are not applicable to nuclear transplantation.\n       (7) The National Academies concluded that nuclear \n     transplantation has great potential to increase the \n     understanding and potential treatment of various diseases and \n     debilitating disorders, as well as our fundamental biological \n     knowledge. These diseases and disorders include Lou Gehrig's \n     disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, spinal-\n     cord injury, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, \n     rheumatoid arthritis, and many others.\n       (8) The National Academies determined that nuclear \n     transplantation research could improve our ability to \n     transplant healthy tissue derived from stem cells into \n     patients with damaged or diseased organs. Such research could \n     greatly reduce the likelihood that a person's body would \n     reject that tissue and also help obviate the need for \n     immunosuppressive drugs, which often have severe and \n     potentially life-threatening side effects.\n       (9) Based on these expert conclusions and recommendations \n     and other evidence, nuclear transplantation is a valuable \n     area of research that could potentially save millions of \n     lives and relieve the suffering of countless others, and thus \n     should not be banned.\n       (10) The National Academies recommended that nuclear \n     transplantation experiments should be subject to close \n     scrutiny under the Federal procedures and rules concerning \n     human-subjects research.\n       (11) Given the need for additional oversight in this area, \n     strict ethical requirements for human subjects research, \n     including informed consent, safety and privacy protections, \n     and review by an ethics board, should be prescribed for all \n     research involving nuclear transplantation, whether using \n     Federal or non-Federal funds.\n       (12)(A) Biomedical research and clinical facilities engage \n     in and affect interstate commerce.\n       (B) The services provided by clinical facilities move in \n     interstate commerce.\n       (C) Patients travel regularly across State lines in order \n     to access clinical facilities.\n       (D) Biomedical research and clinical facilities engage \n     scientists, doctors, and others in an interstate market, and \n     contract for research and purchase medical and other supplies \n     in an interstate market.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to prohibit human cloning and \n     to protect important areas of medical research, including \n     stem cell research.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues Senators \nSpecter, Kennedy, Hatch, Harkin and Thurmond to introduce legislation \nbanning human cloning, but permitting valuable stem cell research to \ncontinue.\n  At the dawn of a new era in medicine, it would be unconscionable for \nCongress to prohibit medical research that offers hope to so many \npeople with crippling and often incurable diseases. There is broad \nagreement across our society that human reproductive cloning should be \nprohibited. And our bill bans human reproductive cloning. But there is \nalso widescale support to continue research that may yield cures for \nparalysis, cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's and so many other \nillnesses. And our bill allows this important research to continue. \nSimply put, nuclear transplantation research has nothing to do with \ncloning humans. Rather, it has everything to do with saving lives and \nalleviating suffering.\n  The legislation we are introducing today bans human reproductive \ncloning, that is, creating a whole-body, carbon copy of a human being. \nSuch cloning is unsafe, immoral, and unacceptable. Under the bill, \nanyone who even attempts human cloning will be subject to 10 years in \njail and a minimum $1 million fine. However, the bill does not ban \nsomatic cell nuclear transplantation. This is a technique that offers \nenormous potential for providing cures for diseases such as cancer, \ndiabetes, cystic fibrosis, and heart disease as well as conditions such \nas spinal cord injuries, liver damage, arthritis, and burns.\n  Somatic cell nuclear transportation works like this: 1. The nucleus, \nthat is, the DNA, is taken from the body cell of a sick person; 2. It \nis then injected into an unfertilized egg from which the nucleus has \nbeen removed; and 3. The egg is stimulated to divide and produce stem \ncells. These stem cells can potentially grow into any organ or tissue. \nThis ``new'' organ or tissue would have the same DNA as the sick person \nand thus can be implanted without rejection by the person's body. This \ncould save the lives of the thousands of people every year waiting for \nan organ or tissue to be donated or who receive a transplant but suffer \ncomplications from powerful immuno-suppression drugs.\n\n  Today, almost 80,000 Americans are waiting for organ transplants, \nwhile hundreds of thousands more need tissue transplants. Nuclear \ntransplantation research offers many other applications as well. It \ncould be used to produce human proteins such as blood clotting factors \nthat aid in healing wounds. It could yield information on stem cell \ndifferentiation, providing valuable information about the mechanism of \naging and the cause of cancer. It could even be used to find a cure for \ncancer by teaching us how to reprogram cells. However, we must \nacknowledge that nuclear transplantation research, like all scientific \nand medical research involving human diseases and conditions, involves \ncomplex ethical issues.\n  Currently, this research is largely unregulated in the private \nsector. That is why this legislation would impose a number of ethical \nrequirements on it, including informed consent, an ethics board review, \nand protections for the safety and privacy of research participants. \nThese regulations are found in Subparts A and B of 45 CFR 46 and are \nincorporated in full into the bill we introduce today. Currently, these \nregulations apply to any research done or funded by the federal \ngovernment. Our legislation would extend the regulations to all \nresearch involving somatic cell nuclear transplantation.\n  The bottom line is that these regulations will prevent exploitation \nof women as part of nuclear transplantation research and, more \ngenerally, require that researchers do this research in an ethical \nmanner. These regulations are already routinely applied to government-\nfunded researchers who do research on human subjects, and they seem to \nhave worked well. Moreover, the bill provides that anyone engaging in \nunethical nuclear transplantation research would face up to a $250,000 \nfine.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of Subparts A and B of 45 CFR \n46 be printed in the Record directly following my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. FEINSTEIN. I would also add that I believe that there may be a \nneed for even greater oversight over nuclear transplantation research \nthan is provided in the bill we introduce today.\n  I intend to work with my colleagues to strengthen this legislation \nfurther before it is enacted. There may well be a need to include \nadditional provisions for regulation and oversight. For one thing, I \nbelieve that we should add the full text of Subparts A and B of 45 CFR \n46 to this legislation to make clear what the bill actually says. And I \nwill work with my colleagues to do so. Unfortunately, competing \nlegislation goes far beyond such regulation. It would completely ban \nnuclear transplantation--criminalizing scientific research that offers \nthe promise of saving the lives of millions and relieving the suffering \nof countless others. In fact, it would even make it a crime for a \ndoctor to cure a patient if that cure was developed overseas from \nnuclear transplantation research.\n  I strongly oppose such legislation. I believe that passing such a \nsweeping ban would be a huge mistake. As is the case with many medical \ntechnologies, it is not stem cell research techniques that are the \nproblem, but some of their potential applications. The scientific and \nmedical evidence is overwhelming that nuclear transplantation offers \nthe promise of curing many deadly diseases and debilitating conditions. \nAs Professor Irving Weissman, chair of the National Academies' panel on \ncloning, testified before a Judiciary Committee hearing I chaired, \n``[T]here are no scientific or medical reasons [for banning nuclear \ntransplantation], and such a ban would certainly close avenues of \npromising scientific and medical research.'' In fact, over 80 major \norganizations and associations have already come out in favor of our \napproach.\n  These include the American Medical Association, National Health \nCouncil, Parkinson's Action Network, Juvenile Diabetes Research \nFoundation, and Federation of American Societies for Experimental \nBiology, which represents over 600,000 medical researchers around the \ncountry. Moreover, the leading blue-ribbon scientific and medical \npanels that have examined the cloning issue have also supported our \napproach.\n  The National Bioethics Advisory Commission, the National Academies' \nPanel on Scientific and Medical Aspects of Human Cloning, and the \nCalifornia Advisory Committee on Human Cloning all concluded that we \nshould ban human reproductive cloning, but not interfere with important \nareas of scientific research, including nuclear transplantation.\n  I have been very moved by the many sick people and their relatives \nthat have contacted me and told me that my legislation offers them \nhope. One of the most compelling stories is that of\n\n[[Page S3634]]\n\nKris Gulden who testified at our hearing on the subject. Ms. Gulden, a \nformer veteran police officer, received several awards for her \noutstanding law enforcement work. She also maintained an active \nschedule outside the office, including winning the women's triathalon \ngold medal in August 1996 at the biannual International Police Olympics \nin Salt Lake City. Tragically a car struck Ms. Gulden while she was \ntraining for the 1998 AIDS Ride, leaving her with a severe spinal cord \ninjury. That accident changed her life. Nine days before the accident, \nshe was participating in a triathalon in Memphis. Nine days after the \naccident, she was left exhausted just trying to brush her teeth. I'll \nnever forget her words: ``In my dreams, I still walk. I run, I play \nbasketball, and I wear the uniform of the Alexandria Police Department. \nWhen the sun rises each morning, it brings reality with it. I rise to \nthe sight of a wheelchair, yet I rise with the hope that maybe this \nwill be the morning that I can move my legs.''\n  In the face of the enormous promise of nuclear transplantation \nresearch, it is difficult to see why anyone wants to dash the hopes of \nKris Gulden and the millions of others facing debilitating and painful \nillnesses and ailments. As former Senator Connie Mack has testified \nbefore the Senate:\n\n       A cell isn't human life if it hasn't been fertilized by a \n     sperm and placed in the womb'' and `[t]he research value of \n     these cells is enormous. They have the potential to form any \n     cell in the body and can reproduce indefinitely. Studies in \n     animals demonstrate that this could lead to cures and \n     treatments for millions of people.\n\n  The legislation we introduce today would ban human reproductive \ncloning and preserve valuable medical research. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  I would also ask unanimous consent that several letters I have \nreceived supporting the Specter-Feinstein-Kennedy-Hatch approach to \ncloning be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Joint Steering Committee\n\n\n                                            for Public Policy,\n\n                                      Bethesda, MD, April 9, 2002.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing to seek your help with \n     efforts being made by many disease advocacy groups and by \n     many of us in the scientific community to protect highly \n     valuable scientific research from an overzealous legislative \n     proposal intended to prohibit the cloning of human beings.\n       The measure in question, S. 1899, introduced by Senator \n     Brownback and others, would, in effect, establish criminal \n     penalties for three things: (i) attempts to produce a human \n     being by methods that include transfer of a somatic cell \n     nucleus (``nuclear transfer'') and placement of any resulting \n     embryos into a uterus; (ii) the transfer of a human cell \n     nucleus into an egg cell for any purposes; and (iii) the \n     important of any products of nuclear transfer, including \n     those used for medical treatment.\n       No scientist of my acquaintance believes that it is \n     currently appropriate or safe, even if it were feasible, to \n     undertake the complex process intended to result in the birth \n     of a cloned human being. For that reason, you are unlikely to \n     hear objections to the first prohibition established by the \n     Brownback bill, even from those who may question whether \n     legislation and criminal penalties are useful instruments for \n     preventing attempts at cloning that might be undertaken by \n     irresponsible individuals.\n       The second and third prohibitions, however, are deeply \n     disturbing to many people, including those of use who have \n     given considerable thought to the difficult ethical issues \n     presented by these new technologies. The third prohibition is \n     inappropriately punitive in the more obvious way: it could \n     lead to punishment of seriously ill patients who have gone \n     abroad to seek novel treatments that are unavailable in this \n     country because they are based on nuclear transfer. But the \n     second prohibition is troubling in a more profound way. For \n     the first time in my experience, an American law would create \n     criminal penalties for the use of a highly promising \n     scientific method, regardless of the intent of the \n     investigator, and would threaten to delay development of new \n     therapies for common diseases.\n       To appreciate our concerns, it is important to understand \n     the nature of what is called ``nuclear transfer''. Recent \n     studies with experimental animals show that a cell nucleus \n     containing all, but expressing only some, of the genes of an \n     organism can undergo extensive changes, or ``reprogramming'', \n     when moved from one cell environment to another. This means \n     that a nucleus from a highly specialized cell--for example, a \n     skin call--can radically revise the set of genes that it uses \n     when it is put into another cell, such as an egg cell, from \n     which the pre-existing nucleus has been removed. In the new \n     environment of the recipient cell, the genes in the nucleus \n     appear to function as appropriate to that environment.\n       Thus, when the recipient cell is an egg, the genes regain \n     the ability to direct the progeny cells, which arise by \n     division, to form nearly any of the many cell type that are \n     found in a mature organism, if the cells are coaxed to do so \n     by appropriate stimuli. This phenomenon has the potential to \n     lead to great things a deeper understanding of human \n     development, important insights into disease mechanism, and \n     the abundant production of normal cells of virtually any \n     type, which could then be used to treat a wide variety of \n     diseases. Moreover, if a parent is the source of the \n     transplanted, reprogrammed nucleus, the normal cells could be \n     used to treat that individual without fear of immune \n     rejection.\n       Clearly we have a lot to learn before we can efficiently \n     apply nuclear transfer and reprogramming to medical \n     purposes--most obviously, we need to learn the best recipes \n     to foster reprogramming and development into the various cell \n     types. But studies with certain animal models of disease \n     already show that these strategies can work, and the \n     fundamental discoveries that have emerged from work with \n     nuclear transfer offer legitimate hope for still greater \n     discoveries in the future.\n       Unfortunately, the opportunities make such discoveries and \n     develop new therapies may well be denied to American \n     scientists because of any inappropriate equation of the \n     method used in reprogramming cells (nuclear transfer) and the \n     goal of cloning whole organisms. This confusion is based in \n     part on the use of nuclear transfer in an otherwise very \n     different multi-step process that led ultimately to the birth \n     of Dolly the sheep and other cloned animals. Indeed, S. 1899 \n     considers transfer of a human somatic cell nucleus into an \n     nucleated human egg for the purpose of reprogramming to be a \n     punishable act of human cloning.\n       It is crucial to emphasize how nuclear transfer, the \n     reprogramming step, differs from attempts to generate a full-\n     fledged organism. Absent transfer to a uterus, the cells that \n     result from nuclear transfer into an egg cytoplasm will not \n     form the complex and organized collection of cell types that \n     characterize a developing organism. The initial aggregate of \n     fewer than 200 cells, formed after introduction of a nucleus \n     into an egg, lacks the recognizable types of cells that are \n     needed to develop into the organs of a human being, and it \n     is barely visible to the naked eye. Individual cells from \n     this aggregate, however, can be used to develop stem cell \n     lines, to study development of specialized cell types in a \n     Petri dish, and to prepare materials for cell-based \n     therapies.\n       Furthermore, in the future, it is possible that cell \n     reprogramming can be carried out in ways that do not involve \n     the use of human egg cells or nuclear transfer itself. The \n     chemicals in the cytoplasm of an egg cell that guide \n     reprogramming have not yet been identified, but when they are \n     it will be possible to use other cells and even simpler \n     defined recipes to reprogram adult cells. Of course, these \n     things will never happen, at least in this country, if the \n     use of nuclear transfer to human eggs is outlawed.\n       The Brownback bill that we are worried about today closely \n     resembles a bill (S. 1601) proposed in 1998 by Senator Bond \n     and others. At that time, you helped to derail the passage of \n     that ill-considered measure with an insightful letter to one \n     of the bill's sponsors and a speech on the Senate floor. Many \n     of my colleagues and I believe that the concerns you raised \n     then about the need to ``ban cloning of human beings but do \n     so in a way that allows, to the extent ethically proper, \n     valuable research to continue'' are still valid. For that \n     reason, I hope you will join us in opposing S. 1899.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my views on this \n     important legislation. Needless to say, I am prepared to \n     discuss any of the points I have made with you or your staff \n     at any time.\n           With best personal regards,\n\n                                                Harold Varmus,\n\n                                   Chair, Joint Steering Committee\n      for Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           California Institute of Technology,\n\n                                      Pasadena, CA, April 8, 2002.\n     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing in opposition to the \n     Brownback bill on cloning.\n       I am a Nobel Laureate who has worked for 40 years in basic \n     biological science and biotechnology. I have seen how a \n     glimmer of an idea can grow to transform a technology, and I \n     have great faith in the ability of basic science to create \n     miraculous treatments for medical conditions.\n       The use of nuclear transfer into the embryonic cells for \n     reproductive purposes (so-called reproductive cloning) is a \n     technology that is a long way from being safe enough to be \n     used to create human beings. So, issues of morality aside, I \n     am totally opposed to using cloning technology for human \n     reproduction. All of my colleagues with whom I have talked \n     are equally opposed, but I am aware that there are people \n     threatening to try to carry out the procedure. Thus, I \n     support a legislative ban on reproductive cloning. I hope \n     that any such ban will have a sunset clause so that in 5 \n     years the question can be revisited.\n       There is another use of somatic cell nuclear transfer into \n     early embryonic cells\n\n[[Page S3635]]\n\n     that is quite different from the process of reproductive \n     cloning. This is often called therapeutic cloning, although \n     that is a terminology that many people find confusing. Such \n     nuclear transfer could be used to produce individual stem \n     cells that may have extraordinary medical value. It is also a \n     valuable technique for probing the causes of genetic \n     diseases. Twice this week, I have heard of new advances that \n     make such a technology increasingly promising. Furthermore, \n     the procedure whereby mouse cells derived by somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer can be used therapeutically has just been \n     described in the journal Cell, erasing any doubt about the \n     feasibility of the method. Thus, it would be a great loss to \n     medical science for somatic cell nuclear transfer for \n     therapeutic use to be legislatively banned.\n       I am aware that there are bills in the Senate that would \n     fit the requirements that I have set out. Senator Feinstein \n     of my state along with Senator Kennedy has proposed such a \n     bill as has Senators Specter and Harkin. They make the \n     distinction between banning nuclear transfer for reproductive \n     purposes and continuing to allow nuclear transfer for \n     research and therapeutic purposes. These are bills that I can \n     support.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  David Baltimore,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      American Association for the\n\n\n                                       Advancement of Science,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 28, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: The Board of Directors of the American \n     Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) recently \n     adopted a policy statement on human cloning. I am enclosing a \n     copy for your attention.\n       Citing the serious risks associated with the procedure, the \n     AAAS statement supports a legally enforceable ban on human \n     reproductive cloning. At the same time, however, it backs \n     stem cell research using cells derived with nuclear \n     transplantation techniques, a procedure sometimes called \n     therapeutic or research cloning. Such research offers \n     enormous potential health benefits. However, because it also \n     raises serious ethical, social, and religious concerns, it \n     must be conducted under close scrutiny by the federal \n     government.\n       AAAS is the world's largest general scientific society with \n     over 135,000 individual members and 275 affiliated societies \n     representing all fields of science and engineering. Founded \n     in 1848, it is also the publisher of Science magazine and has \n     long been a leader in promoting ethical and responsible \n     science.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alan I. Leshner,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n       Enclosure.\n\n                    AAAS Statement on Human Cloning\n\n       The American Association for the Advancement of Science \n     (AAAS) recognizes the intense debates within our society on \n     the issue of human cloning. Since 1997, AAAS has engaged the \n     public and various professional communities in dialogue on \n     the scientific and social issues associated with human \n     cloning and stem cell research. Those experiences form the \n     backdrop for this statement on human cloning.\n\n\n                        ban reproductive cloning\n\n       AAAS endorses a legally enforceable ban on efforts to \n     implant a human cloned embryo for the purpose of \n     reproduction. The scientific evidence documenting the serious \n     health risks associated with reproductive cloning, as shown \n     through animal studies, make it unconscionable to undertake \n     this procedure. At the same time, we encourage continuing \n     open and inclusive public dialogue, in which the scientific \n     community is an active participant, on the scientific and \n     ethical aspects of human cloning as our understanding of this \n     technology advances.\n\n\n      support stem cell research (including ``research cloning'')\n\n       AAAS supports stem cell research, including the use of \n     nuclear transplantation techniques (also known as research or \n     therapeutic cloning), in order to realize the enormous \n     potential health benefits this technology offers. Such \n     benefits are likely to be many years away. If they are to be \n     realized at all, however, it will only be through carefully \n     designed research subject to peer review. Because there are \n     religious, ethical, and social concerns raised by the \n     prospect of creating stem cells for research purposes, we \n     believe that research cloning should only proceed under close \n     scrutiny by the federal government over both the public and \n     private sectors.\n\n\n                     exercise appropriate oversight\n\n       A thorough assessment of existing guidelines and policy, \n     including consideration of possible new regulations specific \n     to this type of research, should be undertaken in light of \n     the concerns surrounding it.\n       Adopted by the AAAS Board of Directors, Boston, \n     Massachusetts, February 14, 2002.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              The American Society\n\n\n                                            of Human Genetics,\n\n                                   Bethesda, MD, February 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Society of Human \n     Genetics (ASHG) is a society of researchers and professionals \n     in human genetics that represents nearly 8000 scientists, \n     physicians, nurses, genetic counselors, and students actively \n     engaged in genetic discovery, teaching, and application of \n     knowledge of human genetics and the human genome.\n       As a major scientific organization whose members have broad \n     expertise and interest in matters related to human genetics, \n     and in the application of genetic knowledge to the well being \n     of people, the Society strives to be extremely thoughtful, \n     thorough and ethical in pondering many of the scientific \n     issues raised in public debate today. As stewards of the \n     field of human genetics elected by the membership of the \n     Society, the Board of Directors of ASHG affirms that basic \n     research and the development of future applications of that \n     research require the ongoing commitment to scientific \n     integrity and social responsibility that has served our \n     organization well for the last 50 years. In other words, \n     scientists must proceed with commitment to rigorous critical \n     evaluation and a heightened sense of responsibility to the \n     patients who entrust their life and health to us.\n       In concert with these principles, it is important for you \n     and your colleagues to know that the ASHG concurs \n     wholeheartedly with your bill ``The Human Cloning Prohibition \n     Act'' that bans reproductive human cloning but is finely \n     crafted so as not to prohibit new and evolving techniques \n     that could potentially change the course of human illness as \n     we know it today so that the collective quality of life is \n     enhanced for all of us. Dr. Bert Vogelstein, in his testimony \n     before the Labor Health and Human Services subcommittee on \n     December 4, 2001, so eloquently captured the distinction \n     surrounding two very different medical endeavors--\n     regenerative medicine and the cloning of a human--the former \n     being the potential key to the problem of immune rejection, \n     the latter being morally and medically unacceptable.\n       In closing, the Senate must be sure that any legislative \n     action only bans cloning to create a human being and does no \n     harm to legitimate biomedical research. Each Senate vote on \n     proposed legislation must make this distinction clear or any \n     ban would have profound negative impact on the advances that \n     have been made thus far in this pioneering and exciting \n     field.\n       We congratulate you and your fellow senators for your \n     insight and conviction to advancing the field of biomedical \n     research.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                     Dr. P.

Boughman,\n\n     ASHG Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 12, 2002.\n\n                  Closing Minds to Stem Cell Research\n\n       The United States Senate is about to consider legislation \n     that will determine the fate of a remarkable new form of \n     medical research known colloquially as ``therapeutic \n     cloning''. The research could lead to unprecedented \n     treatments for human disease, but has fallen prey to the \n     confused debate over human stem cell research on the one \n     hand, and the prospects of creating a cloned person on the \n     other--two very different exercises that are now intricately \n     entwined.\n       The debate has its roots in the medical potential of human \n     stem cells. All the tissues in our bodies arise from stem \n     cells that are found in the early human embryo. Over the past \n     several years, scientists have learned how to isolate and \n     propagate human stem cells. There is hope that we will \n     eventually be able to use these cells to more effectively \n     treat cancer, diabetes, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's and \n     Parkinson's diseases, and others. This prospect has inspired \n     great hope among individuals with ailments that had \n     previously seemed incurable.\n       Human stem cells can be isolated in several ways. The most \n     visionary approach utilizes a procedure that was first dubbed \n     ``therapeutic cloning'', but should more accurately be termed \n     ``somatic cell nuclear transfer'' or simply ``nuclear \n     transplantation''. To perform nuclear transplantation, \n     scientists replace the genetic material of an unfertilized \n     human egg with that from an adult cell. The egg is then \n     induced to proliferate into a primitive structure known as \n     the ``blastocyst'', from which stem cells can be harvested. \n     Tissue derived from such stem cells would be immunologically \n     compatible with the donor of the genetic material, thus \n     circumventing rejection of the tissue when it is transplanted \n     into the donor in order to renew a failing organ.\n       Blastocysts produced by nuclear transplantation can also be \n     implanted into the uterus in order to produce fully developed \n     organisms that are genetically identical to the original \n     donors--``clones'' such as the celebrated sheep Dolly. The \n     prospect of using such ``reproductive cloning'' to create \n     humans is repugnant to most scientists and the general public \n     alike. Consequently, there is widespread support for \n     legislation that would prohibit the production of human \n     clones.\n       But the use of nuclear transplantation to obtain stem cells \n     is another matter. At the time stem cells would be isolated \n     from blastocysts produced by nuclear transplantation, the \n     structures are no larger than the head of a small pin, of the \n     order of 100-150 cells, and have no distinctive tissues--in \n     particular, no neural tissue. Moreover, they have been \n     obtained artificially, without even the intervention of \n     fertilization, and will not be used to produce cloned \n     individuals. They are biologically akin to the very early \n     embryos produced in fertility clinics by fertilization in \n     test tubes, except that they contain the genes of only one \n     individual rather\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\n     than those of two. The U.S. condones the discard of surplus \n     embryos made in fertility clinics. Why should it criminalize \n     the medical use of blastocysts produced by nuclear \n     transplantation? Unfortunately, the term \n     ``therapeutic'' cloning'' was originally used to describe \n     nuclear transplantation, so the procedure is now tarred \n     with the same brush as reproductive cloning. Rarely has \n     semantic inaccuracy been more misleading.\n       The Senate will be offered two very different legislative \n     approaches to nuclear transplantation. One approach, \n     sponsored by Senator Sam Brownback, would prohibit both \n     reproductive cloning and nuclear transplantation itself. The \n     other approach, sponsored in two similar forms by Senators \n     Dianne Feinstein and Edward Kennedy, and by Senators Tom \n     Harkin and Arlen Specter, would ban reproductive cloning, but \n     permit research with nuclear transplantation to go forward. \n     Also in the wings is a proposed moratorium on nuclear \n     transplantation as an alternative to full fledged \n     prohibition, but this has yet to take legislative form.\n       The Brownback bill is an onerous piece of legislation. It \n     would criminalize a form of medical research that is intended \n     to explore the prospects for stem cell therapies, not to \n     create cloned persons; importation of treatments developed in \n     other nations by the use of nuclear transplantation; even the \n     receipt of such therapies abroad. It holds out the prospect \n     of a U.S. diabetic returning from Great Britian--where the \n     production of stem cells by nuclear transplantation is \n     authorized--with a pancrease restored through the agency of \n     nuclear transplantation and finding herself a felon.\n       The proposed moratorium is not a satisfactory alternative. \n     It raises the specter of interminable discussion and \n     political machinations, perhaps stalling research on nuclear \n     transplantation indefinitely. The proponents of a moratorium \n     argue that ``the widespread creation of clonal embryos would \n     increase the risk that a human clone would be born, and would \n     further open the door to eugenic procedures.'' But nuclear \n     transplantation itself is in no way a ``eugenic procedure''. \n     And any legislative prohibition of reproductive cloning \n     automatically forbids the use of nuclear transplantation for \n     that purpose.\n       Congress should unite around legislation that would \n     prohibit reproductive cloning, but permit research on nuclear \n     transplantation to go forward under suitable regulations and \n     oversight. The makings of such legislation are already before \n     the Senate, in the form of the Feinstein-Kennedy and Specter-\n     Harkin bills. Legislation fashioned from these bills could \n     offer a forthright, progressive and humane solution to the \n     impasse over nuclear transplantation.

The AAU \n     represents 61 leading public and private research \n     universities in the United States and two in Canada.\n       Our university membership adopted this statement \n     unanimously, and we look forward to working with you to enact \n     legislation consistent with it, which would include the \n     legislation you have introduced on this topic, S. 1758.\n       Your leadership in the fight to ensure that appropriate \n     restrictions against human reproductive cloning are enacted, \n     while allowing important research on nuclear transplantation \n     to produce stem cells to continue, is most appreciated.\n           Cordially,\n                                                    Nils Hasselmo,\n                                                        President.\n       Enclosure.\n\n                     AAU Statement on Human Cloning\n\n       The Association of American Universities has a long history \n     of supporting academic and scientific freedom. It also \n     recognizes the importance of conducting research consistent \n     with ethical, legal, and safety requirements.\n       AAU strongly opposes human reproductive cloning, and \n     supports legislation to ban this practice. The National \n     Academy of Sciences (NAS) has concluded that cloning \n     procedures are currently not safe for humans and that no \n     responsible scientists or physicians are likely to undertake \n     to clone a human. We generally do not support legislation to \n     limit fields of research, but since some organizations have \n     announced an intention to clone humans, we concur with the \n     NAS that a legal ban is more likely to deter any attempt to \n     close a human than would any voluntary system or moratorium. \n     The ban should be reconsidered at five-year intervals, based \n     on current scientific knowledge.\n       In contrast to human reproductive cloning, AAU continues to \n     support both basic and applied stem cell research. AAU \n     therefore supports nuclear transplantation to produce stem \n     cells, also known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, as \n     nonreproductive cloning, and as therapeutic cloning. AAU \n     concurs with the NAS that nuclear transplantation to produce \n     stem cells has considerable potential for advancing our \n     fundamental knowledge and developing new medical therapies to \n     treat debilitating diseases. Continuing the investigation of \n     stem cells produced by nuclear transplantation is the only \n     way to assure that the value of this nascent technology is \n     realized. Before applications to humans should be considered, \n     we need further study of cells derived from the process of \n     nuclear transplantation, subject to federal safeguards. This \n     research should proceed in parallel with other types of stem \n     cell research, including human embryonic and adult stem cell \n     research.\n       Adopted by the AAU Membership on April 23, 2002.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Patient Stories From California Supporting Specter-Feinstein Approach \n                               on Cloning\n\n\n               From Stefanie Sonico in Cathedral City, CA\n\n       ``I totally and completely support stem cell research in \n     hopes that it will lead to a cure for juvenile diabetes and \n     other such devastating diseases.

He does not \n     need to look forward to kidney failure, eye damage, heart \n     disease and stroke, and death 15 years before his time. He \n     needs to believe that the United States of America, a free \n     country, supports research, done by renowned scientists, to \n     find a cure for diabetes.

Res. 258\n\n       Whereas in the days following the September 11, 2001 \n     attacks on the United States, the United States Government, \n     its allies, and friends quickly agreed that identifying and \n     severing sources of finance to entities which support and \n     fund terrorist activities is critical to combating terrorism \n     and preventing future terrorist acts against United States \n     citizens and interests;\n       Whereas, since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on \n     the United States, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has publicly \n     condemned terrorism in all its shapes and forms;\n       Whereas on February 5, 2002, the Embassy of Saudi Arabia \n     released a statement--\n       (1) expressing the commitment of the Kingdom of Saudi \n     Arabia to preventing charitable and humanitarian \n     organizations and the funds they raise from ``being used for \n     any other purpose''; and\n       (2) confirming ``that it will take every measure possible \n     to prevent the use of these charitable efforts for any \n     unlawful activities, in accordance with international \n     resolutions in this regard'';\n       Whereas a press release on the Embassy of Saudi Arabia \n     website states that ``the Saudi Committee for Support of Al-\n     Quds (Jerusalem) Intifada has so far distributed about SR \n     123.75 million {U.S. $33 million . Minister of the Interior \n     Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz, who is the Committee's Chairman, \n     expressed his appreciation to the Saudi people for their \n     response in supporting their Palestinian brothers in Israel's \n     blatant aggression against them. Financial aid has been \n     disbursed to the families . . . of 358 martyrs, as well as \n     8,000 wounded, 1,000 handicapped, and another 102 \n     Palestinians who have received treatment in the Kingdom's \n     hospital.'';\n       Whereas an August 20, 2001, press release on the Embassy of \n     Saudi Arabia website states that the Saudi Government, in \n     2000, in support of the Al-Intifada (uprising), ``. . . \n     offered financial support to one thousand families of \n     Palestinian martyrs and those who suffered injuries in the \n     cause'';\n       Whereas an April 9, 2002 UPI.COM article states that \n     ``Saudi Arabia makes no distinction in compensation to \n     families of suicide bombers and those killed by Israeli \n     military action''; and\n       Whereas martyrs' funds, or any other source of funding, \n     explicitly designed to fund acts of violence, or to \n     compensate the family members of those individuals who engage \n     in violent activities, are recognized as acts to entice and \n     recruit individuals to undertake suicide bombings and other \n     terrorist acts, and reinforces such violence as a legitimate \n     method to air and to forward political grievances and \n     nationalistic goals: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Kingdom of Saudi Arabia should--\n       (1) immediately dissolve its ``martyrs'' fund;\n       (2) fulfill its stated commitment to combating violence and \n     terrorism; and\n       (3) eliminate the funding of terrorism in every way \n     possible.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, the legislation I am \nintroducing today addresses an important and serious subject in the \nongoing war on terrorism. The attention of the world has been focused \non the conflict in the Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians, \nand on the devastation wrought by suicide bombers. We are not focusing \nenough attention, however, on external factors which have significantly \ncontributed to the escalated violence in the Middle East, and on how we \ncan use our vast economic and diplomatic powers to effect changes, to \nend subsidies to terrorists, and to bring about peace in the Middle \nEast.\n  A good first step would be to cut off U.S. indirect aid to Yassir \nArafat and the Palestinian Authority as a sign of our displeasure with \ntheir jihad, and with their wanton destruction on innocent Israeli \ncivilians. Our aid legitimizes their terrorist activity and has not \ncontributed to a lessening of the violence, but rather, the opposite. \nIt sends very conflicted signals when we are fighting a global war on \nterrorism in the wake of 9/11, yet subsidizing Arafat, a known \nterrorist.\n  We must also cut off aid because our limited taxdollars for foreign \naid should only be directed towards the desperately needy. Arafat is \nknown to have stashed away billions of dollars he earns from taxing \nPalestinians working in other Arab countries, and none of that vast \npersonal wealth is being used to benefit his Palestinian constituency. \nI believe Arafat prefers that they live in deplorable conditions \nbecause misery contributes to strife, if Palestinians are deprived and \nimpoverished, it is easier to entice then to throw stones, or to \nsacrifice themselves by becoming human bombs.\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\n  Another important step we could take, which is the subject of my bill \ntoday, is to ask our allies in the Middle East to take meaningful \nmeasures to show that they are in solidarity with us in the war against \nterrorism.\n  Specifically, I am asking the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to dissolve its \nmartyrs fund. As President Bush said, after the terrorist attacks of \nlast September 11, ``either you are with us, or you are with the \nterrorists.'' Saudi Arabia needs to demonstrate that it is with us.\n  Just a little over a decade ago, we deployed thousands of U.S. \nsoldiers in the Gulf, to liberate Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's army, \nand to prevent Saddam Hussein from next invading the Saudi Kingdom, or \nany of our other allies in the region. The conflict was not protracted, \nbut it was costly, and we lost nearly three hundred American soldiers \nin that war. We stood side by side with the Saudis in our determination \nto stop Iraqi aggression, to preserve the independence of Kuwait, and \nto protect ours and our allies' critical energy interests. Today, our \naircraft transit the No Fly Zone from bases in Saudi Arabia, again in \nthe mutual interest of keeping the Iraqi military in check and in \npreserving sovereign governments in the region.\n\n  Newspaper reports claim that the Saudi ``martyrs'' fund is $50 \nmillion, other news sources claim it may be as high as $400 million. \nWriter Stephen Schwartz, April 8 Weekly Standard, asserts that the $400 \nmillion pledge last year for support of ``martyrs'' families was posted \non the Saudi Embassy website. Schwartz figures that at $5300 per \n``martyr,'' that works out to roughly 75,000 martyrs. The stated \npurpose of the fund is said to be for helping the widows and orphans of \nthe martyrs, the martyrs whom we define as fanatical suicide bombers \nwho have been wreaking havoc on Israeli citizens. This may sound \ninnocent and humanitarian on the surface based on the Saudi concept of \na martyr, but it is deceptive. In the April 1st issue of the Weekly \nStandard, an article by AEI fellow Reuel Marc Gerecht, a consistently \nexcellent analyst, reports that: ``In near perfect harmony, the Arab \nworld's rulers blamed Israel for the Palestinian suicide bombers, who \nare universally referred to in the Arab press as `shuhada', martyrs who \ndie in battle against infidels.''\n  The reality is that this fund for ``shuhadas'' will entice and \nsolicit more suicide bombers, giving them the assurance that their \nfamilies will be provided for in their absence. Would we set up a fund \nto reward the families of domestic terrorists in this country who \ncommit unlawful acts? Of course not! Yet the Saudis are pooling \nresources to reward, and indeed, to instigate these killings. There is \na well-known expression in conservative circles, if you want more of \nsomething, subsidize it. Is there any doubt in anyone's mind that the \nmartyrs' fund won't lead to the creation of more martyrs, and to the \ndeaths of many more innocent civilians, not just in Israel, but in this \ncountry? Does the martyrs' fund exclude perpetrators of acts by these \nfanatics against Americans, or French or British, or is it only \nreserved for those who kill Israelis? These funds are seed money for \nterrorism, and it will reap a harvest of destruction, aimed at both \nIsrael and at the United States.\n  An Associated Press story from Cairo, Egypt, mentions that the Saudi \nAmbassador to Britain, a renowned poet, praised Palestinian suicide \nbombers in a London-based pan-Arab daily publication: May God be the \nwitness that you are martyrs, You died to honor God's word. You \ncommitted suicide? We committed suicide by living like the dead.'' The \nSaudi Ambassador to London, apparently referring to Arab leaders who \nlooked to the United States for help in ending the conflict, said, ``We \ncomplained to the idols of a White House whose heart is filled with \ndarkness.'' This Saudi Ambassador and poet refers to the 18 year old \nfemale suicide bomber, Ayat Akhras, who detonated explosives she had \nfastened to her body at a Jerusalem supermarket, killing 2 Israelis and \nwounding another 25, ``Tell Ayat, the bride of loftiness . . . She \nembraced death with a smile while the leaders are running away from \ndeath. Doors of heaven are opened for her,'' he writes. In addition, \nthe Saudis have been running a telethon to raise additional funds, but \nthe Saudi Embassy in Washington is stating that the money will only be \nused for Palestinians ``victimized by Israeli terror and violence.''\n\n  The Saudis must also share in the blame for the catastrophic events \nof September 11th. Fifteen of the nineteen hijackers were Saudis. Bin \nLaden himself was a Saudi national, and contrary to the belief of some \nthat violence is born of poverty or despair, bin Laden's family is \nnotoriously wealthy. The Saudis eventually made bin Laden persona non \ngrata, but they must acknowledge that these hijackers sprang from their \nsociety. The Saudis have been funding radical schools which are the \nbreeding grounds for the fanaticism of bin Laden and his ilk, and for \nanti-American, and anti-Iraeli foment. In the international press, \nSaudi leaders were claiming that we had no proof that any of the \nhijackers were Saudi nationals!\n  The Saudi Crown Prince recently presented a peace plan for the Middle \nEast. Some suggested that it was a public relations diversion, intended \nto distract attention from the Saudi Government's responsibility for \nthe events of 9/11. I would like to believe that that is not true--and \nthat the Saudis also hope that Israelis and Palestinians can learn to \nlive in peace, but the Saudi Government would have more credibility if, \nin conjunction with devising and offering a peace plan, it would also \nreconsider its generous funding of radical religious schools and \ncharities, and would dissolve immediately its martyrs' fund. Those acts \nwould do far more to assure Americans that the Saudis are truly on our \nside in the war on terrorism, and promoting ways to reduce violence, \nrather than straddling the fence and talking out of both sides of their \nmouth.\n  We need solid allies in the war on terrorism. We do not need friends \nwho say one thing and do another. We need deeds, not words. I urge the \nKingdom of Saudi Arabia to demonstrate its stated public commitment to \nfighting terrorism, and to stop subsidizing terrorists and would-be \nterrorists through its martyrs' fund. This is not an act of \nhumanitarianism on the part of the Saudis, and it is not charity; it is \naiding and abetting terror and should be recognized as such.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3638-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3638-S3639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 259--DESIGNATING MAY 2002, AS `OLDER AMERICANS MONTH'\n\n  Mr. CRAIG submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY REGULAR BUDGET \n                   ASSESSMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of State has concluded that the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (hereafter in this section \n     referred to as the ``IAEA'') is a critical and effective \n     instrument for verifying compliance with international \n     nuclear nonproliferation agreements, and that it serves as an \n     essential barrier to the spread of nuclear weapons.\n       (2) The IAEA furthers United States national security \n     objectives by helping to prevent the proliferation of nuclear \n     weapons material, especially through its work on effective \n     verification and safeguards measures.\n       (3) The IAEA can also perform a critical role in monitoring \n     and verifying aspects of nuclear weapons reduction agreements \n     between nuclear weapons states.\n       (4) As the IAEA has negotiated and developed more effective \n     verification and safeguards measures, it has experienced \n     significant real growth in its mission, especially in the \n     vital area of nuclear safeguards inspections.\n       (5) Nearly two decades of zero budget growth have affected \n     the ability of the IAEA to carry out its mission and to hire \n     and retain the most qualified inspectors and managers, as \n     evidenced in the decreasing proportion of such personnel who \n     hold doctorate degrees.\n       (6) Although voluntary contributions by the United States \n     lessen the IAEA's budgetary constraints, they cannot readily \n     be used for the long-term capital investments or permanent \n     staff increases necessary to an effective IAEA safeguards \n     regime.\n       (7) It was not the intent of Congress that the United \n     States contributions to all United Nations-related \n     organizations and activities be reduced pursuant to the \n     Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001 (as enacted \n     into law by section 1000(a)(7) of Public Law 106-113; 113 \n     Stat. 1501A-405 et seq.), which sets 22 percent assessment \n     rates as benchmarks for the general United Nations budget, \n     the Food and Agricultural Organization, the World Health \n     Organization, and the International Labor Organization. \n     Rather, contributions for important and effective agencies \n     such as the IAEA should be maintained at levels commensurate \n     with the criticality of its mission.\n       (b) Additional Funding for the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary should negotiate a gradual and sustained \n     increase in the regular budget of the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency, which should begin with the 2002 budget;\n       (2) if a regular budget increase for the IAEA is achieved, \n     the Secretary should seek to gain consensus within the IAEA \n     Board of Governors for allocation of a larger proportion of \n     that budget to nuclear nonproliferation activities; and\n       (3) if such a reallocation of the regular IAEA budget \n     cannot be obtained, the United States should decrease its \n     voluntary contribution by $400,000 for each $1,000,000 \n     increase in its annual assessment.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--Of the funds \n     authorized to be appropriated for international \n     organizations, $60,000,000 are authorized to be appropriated \n     in fiscal year 2002 for the payment of the United States \n     assessment to the International Atomic Energy Agency, and \n     $75,000,000 shall be available for that purpose in fiscal \n     year 2003.\n\n     SEC. 308. REVISED NONPROLIFERATION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Section 308 of Public Law 102-182 (22 U.S.C. 5606) is \n     hereby repealed.\n\n   Subtitle B--Russian Federation Debt Reduction for Nonproliferation\n\n     SEC. 311. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Russian Federation Debt \n     Reduction for Nonproliferation Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 312. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is in the vital security interests of the United \n     States to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction \n     to additional states or to terrorist organizations, and to \n     ensure that other nations' obligations to reduce their \n     stockpiles of such arms in accordance with treaties, \n     executive agreements, or political commitments are fulfilled.\n       (2) In particular, it is in the vital national security \n     interests of the United States to ensure that--\n       (A) all stocks of nuclear weapons and weapons-usable \n     nuclear material in the Russian Federation are secure and \n     accounted for;\n       (B) stocks of nuclear weapons and weapons-usable nuclear \n     material that are excess to military needs in the Russian \n     Federation are monitored and reduced;\n       (C) any chemical or biological weapons, related materials, \n     and facilities in the Russian Federation are destroyed;\n       (D) the Russian Federation's nuclear weapons complex is \n     reduced to a size appropriate to its post-Cold War missions, \n     and its experts in weapons of mass destruction technologies\n\n[[Page S3644]]\n\n     are shifted to gainful and sustainable civilian employment;\n       (E) the Russian Federation's export control system blocks \n     any proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the means \n     of delivering such weapons, and materials, equipment, know-\n     how, or technology that would be used to develop, produce, or \n     deliver such weapons; and\n       (F) these objectives are accomplished with sufficient \n     monitoring and transparency to provide confidence that they \n     have in fact been accomplished and that the funds provided to \n     accomplish these objectives have been spent efficiently and \n     effectively.\n       (3) United States programs should be designed to accomplish \n     these vital objectives in the Russian Federation as rapidly \n     as possible, and the President should develop and present to \n     Congress a plan for doing so.\n       (4) Substantial progress has been made in United States-\n     Russian Federation cooperative programs to achieve these \n     objectives, but much more remains to be done to reduce the \n     urgent risks to United States national security posed by the \n     current state of the Russian Federation's weapons of mass \n     destruction stockpiles and complexes.\n       (5) The threats posed by inadequate management of weapons \n     of mass destruction stockpiles and complexes in the Russian \n     Federation remain urgent. Incidents in years immediately \n     preceding 2001, which have been cited by the Russia Task \n     Force of the Secretary of Energy's Advisory Board, include--\n       (A) a conspiracy at one of the Russian Federation's largest \n     nuclear weapons facilities to steal nearly enough highly \n     enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb;\n       (B) an attempt by an employee of the Russian Federation's \n     premier nuclear weapons facility to sell nuclear weapons \n     designs to agents of Iraq and Afghanistan; and\n       (C) the theft of radioactive material from a Russian \n     Federation submarine base.\n       (6) Addressing these threats to United States and world \n     security will ultimately consume billions of dollars, a \n     burden that will have to be shared by the Russian Federation, \n     the United States, and other governments, if this objective \n     is to be achieved.\n       (7) The creation of new funding streams could accelerate \n     progress in reducing these threats to United States security \n     and help the government of the Russian Federation to fulfill \n     its responsibility for secure management of its weapons \n     stockpiles and complexes as United States assistance phases \n     out.\n       (8) The Russian Federation suffers from a significant \n     foreign debt burden, a substantial proportion of which it \n     inherited from the Soviet Union. The Russian Federation is \n     taking full responsibility for this debt, but the burden of \n     debt repayment could threaten Russian Federation economic \n     reform, particularly in 2003 and beyond.\n       (9) The Russian Federation's need for debt relief has been \n     the subject of discussions between the United States and the \n     Russian Federation at the highest levels and is cited by \n     United States officials as one reason why the Russian \n     Federation has recognized that its future lies with the West.\n       (10) Past debt-for-environment exchanges, in which a \n     portion of a country's foreign debt is canceled in return for \n     certain environmental commitments or payments by that \n     country, provide a model for a possible debt-for-\n     nonproliferation exchange with the Russian Federation, which \n     could be designed to provide additional funding for \n     nonproliferation and arms reduction initiatives.\n       (11) Most of the Russian Federation's official bilateral \n     debt is held by United States allies that are advanced \n     industrial democracies. Since the issues described pose \n     threats to United States allies as well, United States \n     leadership that results in a larger contribution from United \n     States allies to cooperative threat reduction activities will \n     be needed.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--\n       (1) to recognize the vital interests of the United States, \n     its allies, and the Russian Federation in reducing the \n     threats to international security described in the findings \n     set forth in subsection (a);\n       (2) to facilitate the accomplishment of the United States \n     objectives described in the findings set forth in subsection \n     (a) by providing for the alleviation of a portion of the \n     Russian Federation's foreign debt, thus allowing the use of \n     additional resources for these purposes; and\n       (3) to ensure that resources freed from debt in the Russian \n     Federation are targeted to the accomplishment of the United \n     States objectives described in the findings set forth in \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 313.

CONSULTATIONS WITH CONGRESS.\n\n       The President shall consult with the appropriate \n     congressional committees on a periodic basis to review the \n     operations of the Facility and the Russian Federation's \n     eligibility for benefits from the Facility.\n\n     SEC. 325.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Nonproliferation \n     Assistance Coordination Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 332. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) United States nonproliferation efforts in the \n     independent states of the former Soviet Union have achieved \n     important results in ensuring that weapons of mass \n     destruction, weapons-usable material and technology, and \n     weapons-related knowledge remain beyond the reach of \n     terrorists and weapons-proliferating states;\n       (2) although these efforts are in the United States \n     national security interest, the effectiveness of these \n     efforts suffers from a lack of coordination within and among \n     United States Government agencies;\n       (3) increased spending and investment by the United States \n     private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent \n     states of the former Soviet Union, specifically, spending and \n     investment by the United States private sector in job \n     creation initiatives and proposals for unemployed Russian \n     Federation weapons scientists and technicians, are making an \n     important contribution in ensuring that knowledge related to \n     weapons of mass destruction remains beyond the reach of \n     terrorists and weapons-proliferating states; and\n       (4) increased spending and investment by the United States \n     private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent \n     states of the former Soviet Union require the establishment \n     of a coordinating body to ensure that United States public \n     and private efforts are not in conflict, and to ensure that \n     public spending on efforts by the independent states of the \n     former Soviet Union is maximized to ensure efficiency and \n     further United States national security interests.\n\n     SEC. 333.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On April 24, 1997, the Senate provided its advice and \n     consent to ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     subject to the condition that no sample collected in the \n     United States pursuant to the Convention would be transferred \n     for analysis to any laboratory outside the territory of the \n     United States.\n       (2) Congress enacted the same condition into law as section \n     304(f)(1) of the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation \n     Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6724(f)(1)).\n       (3) Part II, paragraph 57, of the Verification Annex of the \n     Convention requires that all samples taken during a challenge \n     inspection under the Convention shall be analyzed by at least \n     two laboratories that have been designated as capable of \n     conducting such testing by the OPCW.\n       (4) The only United States laboratory currently designated \n     by the OPCW is the United States Army Edgewood Forensic \n     Science Laboratory.\n       (5) In order to meet the requirements of condition (18) of \n     the resolution of ratification of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, and section 304 of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention Implementation Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6724), the \n     United States must possess, at a minimum, a second OPCW-\n     designated laboratory.\n       (6) The possession of a second laboratory is necessary in \n     view of the potential for a challenge inspection to be \n     initiated against the United States by a foreign nation.\n       (7) To qualify as a designated laboratory, a laboratory \n     must be certified under ISO Guide 25 or a higher standard, \n     and complete three proficiency tests. The laboratory must \n     have the full capability to handle substances listed on \n     Schedule 1 of the Annex on Schedules of Chemicals of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention. In order to handle such \n     substances in the United States, a laboratory also must \n     operate under a bailment agreement with the United States \n     Army.\n       (8) Several existing United States commercial laboratories \n     have approved quality control systems, already possess \n     bailment agreements with the United States Army, and have the \n     capabilities necessary to obtain OPCW designation.\n       (9) In order to bolster the legitimacy of United States \n     analysis of samples taken on its national territory, it is \n     preferable that the second designated laboratory is not a \n     United States Government facility. Further, it is not cost-\n     effective to build and equip another Government laboratory to \n     meet OPCW designation standards when such capability already \n     exists in the private sector.\n       (b) Establishment of Second Designated Laboratory.--\n       (1) Directive.--Not later than February 1, 2002, the United \n     States National Authority, as designated under section 101 of \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998 \n     (22 U.S.C. 6711), shall select, through competitive \n     procedures, a commercial laboratory within the United States \n     to pursue designation by the OPCW.\n       (2) Delegation.--The National Authority may delegate the \n     authority and administrative responsibility for carrying out \n     paragraph (1) to one or more of the heads of the agencies \n     described in section 101(b)(2) of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention Implementation Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6711(b)(2)).\n       (3) Report.--Not later than March 1, 2002, the National \n     Authority shall submit to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress a report detailing a plan for securing OPCW \n     designation of a third United States laboratory by December \n     1, 2003.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Chemical weapons convention.--The term ``Chemical \n     Weapons Convention'' means the Convention on the Prohibition \n     of Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical \n     Weapons and on Their Destruction, Opened for Signature and \n     Signed by the United States at Paris on January 13, 1993, \n     including the following protocols and memorandum of \n     understanding:\n       (A) The Annex on Chemicals.\n       (B) The Annex on Implementation and Verification.\n       (C) The Annex on the Protection of Confidential \n     Information.\n       (D) The Resolution Establishing the Preparatory Commission \n     for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\n       (E) The Text on the Establishment of a Preparatory \n     Commission.\n       (2) OPCW.--The term ``OPCW'' means the Organization for the \n     Prohibition of Chemical Weapons established under the \n     Convention.\n\n             TITLE VII--AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER NAVAL VESSELS\n\n     SEC. 701.

SUGAR POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the tariff-rate quotas imposed on imports of sugar, \n     syrups and sugar-containing products under chapters 17, 18, \n     19, and 21 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n     States are an essential element of United States sugar \n     policy;\n       (2) circumvention of the tariff-rate quotas will, if \n     unchecked, make it impossible to achieve the objectives of \n     United States sugar policy;\n       (3) the tariff-rate quotas have been circumvented \n     frequently, defeating the purposes of United States sugar \n     policy and causing disruption to the United States market for \n     sweeteners, injury to domestic growers, refiners, and \n     processors of sugar, and adversely affecting legitimate \n     exporters of sugar to the United States;\n       (4) it is essential to United States sugar policy that the \n     tariff-rate quotas be enforced and that deceptive practices \n     be prevented, including the importation of products with no \n     commercial use and failure to disclose all relevant \n     information to the United States Customs Service; and\n       (5) unless action is taken to prevent circumvention, \n     circumvention of the tariff-rate quotas will continue and \n     will ultimately destroy United States sugar policy.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \n     maintain the integrity of the tariff-rate quotas on sugars, \n     syrups, and sugar-containing products by stopping \n     circumvention as soon as it becomes apparent.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the \n     ``Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002''.\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The expansion of international trade is vital to the \n     national security of the United States. Trade is critical to \n     the economic growth and strength of the United States and to \n     its leadership in the world. Stable trading relationships \n     promote security and prosperity. Trade agreements today serve \n     the same purposes that security pacts played during the Cold \n     War, binding nations together through a series of mutual \n     rights and obligations. Leadership by the United States in \n     international trade fosters open markets, democracy, and \n     peace throughout the world.\n       (2) The national security of the United States depends on \n     its economic security, which in turn is founded upon a \n     vibrant and growing industrial base. Trade expansion has been \n     the engine of economic growth. Trade agreements maximize \n     opportunities for the critical sectors and building blocks of \n     the economy of the United States, such as information \n     technology, telecommunications and other leading \n     technologies, basic industries, capital equipment, medical \n     equipment, services, agriculture, environmental technology, \n     and intellectual property. Trade will create new \n     opportunities for the United States and preserve the \n     unparalleled strength of the United States in economic, \n     political, and military affairs. The United States, secured \n     by expanding trade and economic opportunities, will meet the \n     challenges of the twenty-first century.\n       (3) Support for continued trade expansion requires that \n     dispute settlement procedures under international trade \n     agreements not add to or diminish the rights and obligations \n     provided in such agreements. Nevertheless, in several cases, \n     dispute settlement panels and the WTO Appellate Body have \n     added to obligations and diminished rights of the United \n     States under WTO Agreements. In particular, dispute \n     settlement panels and the Appellate Body have--\n       (A) given insufficient deference to the expertise and fact-\n     finding of the Department of Commerce and the United States \n     International Trade Commission;\n       (B) imposed an obligation concerning the causal \n     relationship between increased imports into the United States \n     and serious injury to domestic industry necessary to support \n     a safeguard measure that is different from the obligation set \n     forth in the applicable WTO Agreements;\n       (C) imposed an obligation concerning the exclusion from \n     safeguards measures of products imported from countries party \n     to a free trade agreement that is different from the \n     obligation set forth in the applicable WTO Agreements;\n       (D) imposed obligations on the Department of Commerce with \n     respect to the use of facts available in antidumping \n     investigations that are different from the obligations set \n     forth in the applicable WTO Agreements; and\n       (E) accorded insufficient deference to the Department of \n     Commerce's methodology for adjusting countervailing duties \n     following the privatization of a subsidized foreign producer.\n\n     SEC. 2102.

COMMITTEE STAFF.\n\n       The grant of trade promotion authority under this title is \n     likely to increase the activities of the primary committees \n     of jurisdiction in the area of international trade.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Andean \n     Trade Preference Expansion Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the Andean Trade Preference Act was enacted in \n     1991, it has had a positive impact on United States trade \n     with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Two-way trade has \n     doubled, with the United States serving as the leading source \n     of imports and leading export market for each of the Andean \n     beneficiary countries. This has resulted in increased jobs \n     and expanded export opportunities in both the United States \n     and the Andean region.\n       (2) The Andean Trade Preference Act has been a key element \n     in the United States counternarcotics strategy in the Andean \n     region, promoting export diversification and broad-based \n     economic development that provides sustainable economic \n     alternatives to drug-crop production, strengthening the \n     legitimate economies of Andean countries and creating viable \n     alternatives to illicit trade in coca.\n       (3) Notwithstanding the success of the Andean Trade \n     Preference Act, the Andean region remains threatened by \n     political and economic instability and fragility, vulnerable \n     to the consequences of the drug war and fierce global \n     competition for its legitimate trade.\n       (4) The continuing instability in the Andean region poses a \n     threat to the security interests of the United States and the \n     world. This problem has been partially addressed through \n     foreign aid, such as Plan Colombia, enacted by Congress in \n     2000.

Most \n     notably, a Canadian chemical company claimed $970,000,000 in \n     damages allegedly resulting from a California State \n     regulation banning the use of a gasoline additive produced by \n     that company.\n       (3) A claim under Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA is \n     adjudicated by a three-member panel, whose deliberations are \n     largely secret.\n       (4) While it may be necessary to protect the \n     confidentiality of business sensitive information, the \n     general lack of transparency of these proceedings has been \n     excessive.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this amendment is to ensure \n     that the proceedings of the NAFTA investor protection \n     tribunals are as transparent as possible, consistent with the \n     need to protect the confidentiality of business sensitive \n     information.\n       (c) Chapter 11 of NAFTA.--The President shall negotiate \n     with Canada and Mexico an amendment to Chapter Eleven of the \n     NAFTA to ensure the fullest transparency possible with \n     respect to the dispute settlement mechanism in that Chapter, \n     consistent with the need to protect information that is \n     classified or confidential, by--\n       (1) ensuring that all requests for dispute settlement under \n     Chapter Eleven are promptly made public;\n       (2) ensuring that with respect to Chapter Eleven--\n       (A) all proceedings, submissions, findings, and decisions \n     are promptly made public; and\n       (B) all hearings are open to the public; and\n       (3) establishing a mechanism under that Chapter for \n     acceptance of amicus curiae submissions from businesses, \n     unions, and nongovernmental organizations.\n       (d) Certification Requirements.--Within one year of the \n     enactment of this Act, the U.S. Trade Representative shall \n     certify to Congress that the President has fulfilled the \n     requirements set forth in subsection (c).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/01/senate-section/article/S3688-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                subcommittee on public lands and forests\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

AUTHORITY FOR WATER QUALITY PROTECTION FROM FUELS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) since 1979, methyl tertiary butyl ether (referred to in \n     this section as ``MTBE'') has been used nationwide at low \n     levels in gasoline to replace lead as an octane booster or \n     anti-knocking agent;\n       (2) Public Law 101-549 (commonly known as the ``Clean Air \n     Act Amendments of 1990'') (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) \n     established a fuel oxygenate standard under which \n     reformulated gasoline must contain at least 2 percent oxygen \n     by weight;\n       (3) at the time of the adoption of the fuel oxygen \n     standard, Congress was aware that significant use of MTBE \n     could result from the adoption of that standard, and that the \n     use of MTBE would likely be important to the cost-effective \n     implementation of that program;\n       (4) Congress is aware that gasoline and its component \n     additives have leaked from storage tanks, with consequences \n     for water quality;\n       (5) the fuel industry responded to the fuel oxygenate \n     standard established by Public Law 101-549 by making \n     substantial investments in--\n       (A) MTBE production capacity; and\n       (B) systems to deliver MTBE-containing gasoline to the \n     marketplace;\n       (6) when leaked or spilled into the environment, MTBE may \n     cause serious problems of drinking water quality;\n       (7) in recent years, MTBE has been detected in water \n     sources throughout the United States;\n       (8) MTBE can be detected by smell and taste at low \n     concentrations;\n       (9) while small quantities of MTBE can render water \n     supplies unpalatable, the precise human health effects of \n     MTBE consumption at low levels are yet unknown;\n       (10) in the report entitled ``Achieving Clean Air and Clean \n     Water: The Report of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in \n     Gasoline'' and dated September 1999, Congress was urged--\n       (A) to eliminate the fuel oxygenate standard;\n       (B) to greatly reduce use of MTBE; and\n       (C) to maintain the environmental performance of \n     reformulated gasoline;\n       (11) Congress has--\n       (A) reconsidered the relative value of MTBE in gasoline; \n     and\n       (B) decided to eliminate use of MTBE as a fuel additive;\n       (12) the timeline for elimination of use of MTBE as a fuel \n     additive must be established in a manner that achieves an \n     appropriate balance among the goals of--\n       (A) environmental protection;\n       (B) adequate energy supply; and\n       (C) reasonable fuel prices; and\n       (13) it is appropriate for Congress to provide some limited \n     transition assistance--\n       (A) to merchant producers of MTBE who produced MTBE in \n     response to a market created by the oxygenate requirement \n     contained in the Clean Air Act;

and\n       (2) to provide assistance to merchant producers of MTBE in \n     making the transition from producing MTBE to producing other \n     fuel additives.\n       (c) Authority for Water Quality Protection From Fuels.--\n     Section 211(c) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7545(c)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)(A)--\n       (A) by inserting ``fuel or fuel additive or'' after \n     ``Administrator any'';

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Evidence continues to build that increases in \n     atmospheric concentrations of man-made greenhouse gases are \n     contributing to global climate change.\n       (2) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \n     has concluded that ``there is new and stronger evidence that \n     most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is \n     attributable to human activities'' and that the Earth's \n     average temperature can be expected to rise between 2.5 and \n     10.4 degrees Fahrenheit in this century.\n       (3) The National Academy of Sciences confirmed the findings \n     of the IPCC, stating that ``the IPCC's conclusion that most \n     of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to \n     have been due to the increase of greenhouse gas \n     concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of \n     the scientific community on this issue'' and that ``there is \n     general agreement that the observed warming is real and \n     particularly strong within the past twenty years''. The \n     National Academy of Sciences also noted that ``because there \n     is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how \n     the climate system varies naturally and reacts to emissions \n     of greenhouse gases and aerosols, current estimates of the \n     magnitude of future warming should be regarded as tentative \n     and subject to future adjustments upward or downward''.\n       (4) The IPCC has stated that in the last 40 years, the \n     global average sea level has risen, ocean heat content has \n     increased, and snow cover and ice extent have decreased, \n     which threatens to inundate low-lying island nations and \n     coastal regions throughout the world.\n       (5) In October 2000, a United States Government report \n     found that global climate change may harm the United States \n     by altering crop yields, accelerating sea-level rise, and \n     increasing the spread of tropical infectious diseases.\n       (6) In 1992, the United States ratified the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the ultimate \n     objective of which is the ``stabilization of greenhouse gas \n     concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would \n     prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate \n     system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame \n     sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate \n     change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and \n     to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable \n     manner''.\n       (7) The UNFCCC stated in part that the Parties to the \n     Convention are to implement policies ``with the aim of \n     returning . . . to their 1990 levels anthropogenic emissions \n     of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases'' under the \n     principle that ``policies and measures . . . should be \n     appropriate for the specific conditions of each Party and \n     should be integrated with national development programmes, \n     taking into account that economic development is essential \n     for adopting measures to address climate change''.\n       (8) There is a shared international responsibility to \n     address this problem, as industrial nations are the largest \n     historic and current emitters of greenhouse gases and \n     developing nations' emissions will significantly increase in \n     the future.\n       (9) The UNFCCC further stated that ``developed country \n     Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and \n     the adverse effects thereof'', as these nations are the \n     largest historic and current emitters of greenhouse gases. \n     The UNFCCC also stated that ``steps required to understand \n     and address climate change will be environmentally, socially \n     and economically most effective if they are based on relevant \n     scientific, technical and economic considerations and \n     continually re-evaluated in the light of new findings in \n     these areas''.\n       (10) Senate Resolution 98 of the One Hundred Fifth \n     Congress, which expressed that developing nations must also \n     be included in any future, binding climate change treaty and \n     such a treaty must not result in serious harm to the United \n     States economy, should not cause the United States to abandon \n     its shared responsibility to help reduce the risks of climate \n     change and its impacts. Future international efforts in this \n     regard should focus on recognizing the equitable \n     responsibilities for addressing climate change by all \n     nations, including commitments by the largest developing \n     country emitters in a future, binding climate change treaty.\n       (11) It is the position of the United States that it will \n     not interfere with the plans of any nation that chooses to \n     ratify and implement the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC.\n       (12) American businesses need to know how governments \n     worldwide will address the risks of climate change.\n       (13) The United States benefits from investments in the \n     research, development and deployment of a range of clean \n     energy and efficiency technologies that can reduce the risks \n     of climate change and its impacts and that can make the \n     United States economy more productive, bolster energy \n     security, create jobs, and protect the environment.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the United \n     States Congress that the United States should demonstrate \n     international leadership and responsibility in reducing the \n     health, environmental, and economic risks posed by climate \n     change by--\n       (1) taking responsible action to ensure significant and \n     meaningful reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases from \n     all sectors;\n       (2) creating flexible international and domestic \n     mechanisms, including joint implementation, technology \n     deployment, tradable credits for emissions reductions and \n     carbon sequestration projects that will reduce, avoid, and \n     sequester greenhouse gas emissions; and\n       (3) participating in international negotiations, including \n     putting forth a proposal to the Conference of the Parties, \n     with the objective of securing United States participation in \n     a future binding climate change Treaty in a manner that is \n     consistent with the environmental objectives of the UNFCCC, \n     that protects the economic interests of the United States, \n     and recognizes the shared international responsibility for \n     addressing climate change, including developing country \n     participation.\n\n                  Subtitle B--Climate Change Strategy\n\n     SEC. 1011.

SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title can be cited as the ``Iraq \n     Petroleum Import Restriction Act of 2002''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Government of the Republic of Iraq--\n       (A) has failed to comply with the terms of United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 687 regarding unconditional Iraqi \n     acceptance of the destruction, removal, or rendering \n     harmless, under international supervision, of all nuclear, \n     chemical and biological weapons and all stocks of agents and \n     all related subsystems and components and all research, \n     development, support and manufacturing facilities, as well as \n     all ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 \n     kilometers and related major parts, and repair and production \n     facilities and has failed to allow United Nations inspectors \n     access to sites used for the production or storage of weapons \n     of mass destruction;\n       (B) routinely contravenes the terms and. conditions of UNSC \n     Resolution 661, authorizing the export of petroleum products \n     from Iraq in exchange for food, medicine and other \n     humanitarian products by conducting a routine and extensive \n     program to sell such products outside of the channels \n     established by UNSC Resolution 661 in exchange for military \n     equipment and materials to be used in pursuit of its program \n     to develop weapons of mass destruction in order to threaten \n     the United States and its allies in the Persian Gulf and \n     surrounding regions;\n       (C) has failed to adequately draw down upon the amounts \n     received in the Escrow Account established by UNSC Resolution \n     986 to purchase food, medicine and other humanitarian \n     products required by its citizens, resulting in massive \n     humanitarian suffering by the Iraqi people;\n       (D) conducts a periodic and systematic campaign to harass \n     and obstruct the enforcement of the United States- and United \n     Kingdom-enforced ``No-Fly Zones'' in effect in the Republic \n     of Iraq;\n       (E) routinely manipulates the petroleum export production \n     volumes permitted under UNSC Resolution 661 in order to \n     create uncertainty in global energy markets, and therefore \n     threatens the economic security of the United States;\n       (F) pays bounties to the families of suicide bombers in \n     order to encourage the murder of Israeli civilians;\n       (2) further imports of petroleum products from the Republic \n     of Iraq are inconsistent with the national security and \n     foreign policy interests of the United States and should be \n     eliminated until such time as they are not so inconsistent.\n\n     SEC. 2602. PROHIBITION ON IRAQI-ORIGIN PETROLEUM IMPORTS.\n\n       The direct or indirect import from Iraq of Iraqi-origin \n     petroleum and petroleum products is prohibited, \n     notwithstanding an authorization by the Committee established \n     by UNSC Resolution 661 or its designee, or any other order to \n     the contrary.\n\n     SEC. 2603. TERMINATION/PRESIDENTIAL CERTIFICATION.\n\n       This title will remain in effect until such time as the \n     President, after consultation with the relevant committees in \n     Congress, certifies to the Congress that--\n       (1) Iraq is in substantial compliance with the terms of--\n       (A) UNSC Resolution 687; and\n       (B) UNSC Resolution 986 prohibiting smuggling of oil in \n     circumvention of the ``Oil-for-Food'' program; and\n       (2) ceases the practice of compensating the families of \n     suicide bombers in order to encourage the murder of Israeli \n     citizens; or that\n       (3) resuming the importation of Iraqi-origin petroleum and \n     petroleum products would not be inconsistent with the \n     national security and foreign policy interests of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 2604. HUMANITARIAN INTERESTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     make all appropriate efforts to ensure that the humanitarian \n     needs of the Iraqi people are not negatively affected by this \n     Act, and should encourage through public, private, domestic \n     and international means the direct or indirect sale, donation \n     or other transfer to appropriate nongovernmental health and \n     humanitarian organizations and individuals within Iraq of \n     food, medicine and other humanitarian products.\n\n     SEC. 2605.
