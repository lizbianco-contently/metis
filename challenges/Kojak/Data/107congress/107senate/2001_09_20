Mr. President, today, I am offering an amendment to the \nnational Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2002 that would \ncorrect the longstanding injustice to the widows or widowers of our \nmilitary retirees. The proposed legislation, which reflects the \nlanguage of S. 145 which I introduced on January 23, 2001, would \nimmediately increase for surviving spouses over the age 62 the minimum \nsurvivor Benefit Plan, SBP, annuity from 35 percent to 40 percent of \nthe SBP covered retired pay. The bill would provide a further increase \nto 45 percent of covered retired pay as of October 1, 2004, and to 55 \npercent as of September 2011.\n  As I outlined in my many statements in support of this important \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S9552]]\n\nthe Survivor Benefit Plan advertises, that if the service member elects \nto join the plan, his survivor will receive 55 percent of the member's \nretirement pay. Unfortunately, that is not so. The reason that they do \nnot receive the 55 percent of retired pay is that current law mandates \nthat at age 62 this amount be reduced either by the amount of the \nsurvivor's Social Security benefit or to 35 percent of the SBP. This \nlaw is especially irksome to those retirees who joined the plan when it \nwas first offered in 1972. These service members were never informed of \nthe age-62 reduction until they had made an irrevocable decision to \nparticipate. Many retirees and their spouses, as our constituent mail \nattests, believed their premium payments would guarantee 55 percent of \nretired pay for the life of the survivor. It is not hard to imagine the \nshock and financial disadvantage these men and women who so loyally \nserved the Nation for many years experience when they learn of the \nannuity reduction.\n  Uniformed services retirees pay too much for the available SBP \nbenefit both, compared to what we promised and what we offer other \nFederal retirees. When the Survivor Benefit Plan was enacted in 1972, \nthe Congress intended that the government would pay 40 percent of the \ncost to parallel the government subsidy of the Federal civilian \nsurvivor benefit plan. That was short-lived. Over time, the \ngovernment's cost sharing has declined to about 26 percent. In other \nwords, the retiree's premiums now cover 74 percent of expected long-\nterm program costs versus the intended 60 percent. Contrast this with \nthe Federal civilian SBP, which has a 42-percent subsidy for those \npersonnel under the Federal Employees Retirement System and a 50-\npercent subsidy for those under the Civil Service Retirement System. \nFurther, Federal civilian survivors receive 50 percent of retired pay \nwith no offset at age 62. Although Federal civilian premiums are 10 \npercent retired pay compared to 6.5 percent for military retirees, the \ndifference in the percent of contribution is offset by the fact that \nour service personnel retire at a much younger age than the civil \nservant and, therefore pay premiums much longer than the Federal \ncivilian retiree.\n\n  Although the House conferees thwarted my previous efforts to enact \nthis legislation into law, I am ever optimistic that this year we will \nprevail. I base my optimism on the fact that the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 included a sense of the Congress \non increasing Survivor Benefit Plan annuities for surviving spouses age \n62 or older. The sense of the Congress reflects the concern addressed \nby the legislation I am introducing again today.\n  Since I introduced S. 145, 32 of my colleagues joined as cosponsors \nto the bill. I hope my colleagues will speak in support of this \nimportant legislation and the Senate will adopt this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/20/senate-section/article/S9552-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE FIRST ENGINEER BATTALION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of a \nmilitary unit whose gallant service to our Nation extends over a \ncentury and a half.\n  The First Engineer Battalion, tracing its intrepid lineage to 1846, \nis the oldest Engineer Battalion in the United States Army. Having \nserved in both the Mexican War and Civil War, they continued their \nvalorous service to our great Nation through the Spanish American War, \nin Cuba, and in the Philippine Insurrection.\n  The First Engineer Battalion was reorganized and expanded in World \nWar I to form the First Engineer Regiment, assigned to the First \nDivision, fighting in every major engagement in France. They were cited \nby the French Government with the French Fourragere and two Croix De \nGuerres. Taking part in North African landings and invasions of Sicily \nand Normandy during World War II, they were awarded three Presidential \nUnit Citations, two additional Croix De Guerres with Palm, the Medaille \nMilitaire, and the Belgian Fourragere. Earning eight campaign \nstreamers, they distinguished themselves across two continents. They \nagain were called to Southeast Asia in support of the ``Big Red One'' \nbeing awarded three Meritorious Unit Commendations, Vietnamese Cross of \nGallantry with Palm, and Vietnamese Civil Action Honor Medal. Deploying \nto Germany as part of REFORGER exercises and to Southwest Asia as part \nof Desert Shield and Desert Storm they where again lauded for their \nactions and awarded the Valorous Unit Citation.\n  We cannot take lightly their dauntless and meritorious service to our \nNation. Nor can we forget the valiant actions of those who served in \nbuilding the necessary infrastructure for our troops under the most \nadverse and hazardous conditions. For over two-thirds of our Nation's \nhistory, their accomplishments, both individually and collectively, \nwere pivotal not only to a successful combat effort, but to \nestablishing and maintaining the legacy of which the Combat Engineers \nmay be justifiably proud.\n  I join in expressing the respect, admiration, and grateful \nappreciation of our Nation as they gather for their annual reunion in \nAshville, NC, later this month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/20/senate-section/article/S9552-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9552-S9553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SBP ELIGIBILITY FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES SERVING ON ACTIVE DUTY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on September 11, 2001, our lives were \nchanged irrevocably. It is a day none of us will forget, a day where \neach of us will remember exactly where we were when we heard our nation \nhad been attacked and our freedom had been assaulted.\n  We lost so many innocent civilians in New York and so many dedicated \nmilitary personnel in Washington, DC. The amendment I am introducing \ntoday deals with the military. Each of them has made a choice: to \ndefend our Nation, its freedom, and its principles. On September 11, we \nwere reminded of how real that sacrifice is, and how critical those \ncontributions are.\n  We all witnessed the destruction of innocent people and American \nlandmarks. These evil acts did not destroy our spirit, our faith, or \nour hope. And they will never destroy our freedom--because Americans \nare resilient, and our men and women in uniform brave.\n  It is why, in my career in public service, I have dedicated myself to \nsupporting and defending these noble men and women and their families \nwho serve our Nation in the Armed Forces. Their courage, their work, \nand their efforts are important, honorable, and inspiring.\n  We have only just started to deal with the greatest loss to our \ncountry since Pearl Harbor; only started to uncover the lasting effects \nof this heinous evil, and once again our military has been among those \ndirectly hit. In the months ahead we will respond and those who serve \nwill put their lives on the line.\n  This is why I introduced legislation in June to ensure that all \nmilitary personnel who die in the line of duty, like those who died \nserving their country at the Pentagon, are able to receive retirement \nbenefits they have earned. In the military, personnel are not vested in \nretirement benefits unless they have served 20 years or more, or unless \nthe services medically retire them before death. Clearly, someone who \ndies in the line of duty cannot fulfill either of these requirements, \nmeaning their families do not receive their pro rata share of \nretirement pensions. It is horrible enough for a family to lose a loved \none--it is an even greater hardship for them to not receive these \nearned benefits.\n  I think it is only right that those who die while defending our \ncountry and our principles can know that their families will be taken \ncare of by their country. Therefore, today I am submitting an amendment \nto the Defense authorization bill that will ensure that the surviving \nspouse receives survivors' retirement benefits commensurate with the \nnumber of years their loved one has served--effective September 10, \n2001.\n  This is the very least we can do for the families of our men and \nwomen in uniform, for the families who lost loved ones on September 11. \nThey have made the ultimate sacrifice, and we must take care of them \nnow. This is no different from a civilian worker's family receiving the \nretirement accumulated by a lost loved one.\n  Tragically, two of the very men who were working with me on this \nlegislation were killed at the Pentagon on that fateful day. Gary F. \nSmith, the Chief of Army Retirement Services and a retired Army \nLieutenant Colonel,\n\n[[Page S9553]]\n\nand Max Beilke, a member of his staff, a retired Army Master Sergeant, \nwere impressive men who had provided invaluable assistance to me and my \nstaff on this legislation. On June 15, Colonel Smith wrote my staff \nabout this legislation saying, ``Those of us who work on these issues \ndaily know how important this will be. We'll keep our fingers crossed \nand hope it will get into law.''\n  In memory of Colonel Smith and Master Sergeant Beilke, I ask that we \npass this amendment for those who died September 11 and those who will \ndie in the future in the service of our country.\n  As the true impact of September's horrifying events become even \nclearer, this legislation would offer a measure of support for families \nfacing unbelievable tragedy. It is, again, the least we can do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/20/senate-section/article/S9553-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNITION TO ONE OF GEORGIA'S FINEST: COCA-COLA COMPANY\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the spirit \nof giving and compassion exhibited by one of the world's finest multi-\nnational companies, the Coca-Cola Company. Coke's employees and \nbottlers have generously donated $12 million to the relief efforts \nongoing in New York and Washington.

The remaining $6 million will be channeled directly to \nlocal funds in New York and Washington to support humanitarian causes. \nIt is fitting that a company so associated with America and the \nAmerican spirit would come to the aid of our citizens in this difficult \ntime.\n  It is for this reason that I rise to honor the Coca-Cola Company for \nits charitable support.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to acknowledge a distinguished Rhode Islander and proven leader \nin my State's labor community, Mr. Eddie Sullivan, the President and \nBusiness Manager of the International Union of Operating Engineers, \n(IUOE), Local 57 in Providence.\n  Eddie Sullivan lives in Warwick with his wife Dolly and is a proud \nfather of four wonderful daughters, Kim, Kimberly, Kristen, and \nKatherine. Mr. Sullivan was initiated into IUOE Local 57 in January of \n1964, and has worked for various contractors in the State of Rhode \nIsland as a crane operator over the years, taking part in the \nconstruction of some of Rhode Island's most significant structures. In \n1976, Local 57 elected him as an Auditor, and due to his hard work \nappointed him as the Vice President in 1980. In just five short years, \nEddie was appointed as the Business Manager and President of Local 57 \nin 1985 and continues to serve in this capacity today.\n  In addition to his various responsibilities within the labor \nmovement, Mr. Sullivan has served as the President of the Rhode Island \nBuilding and Construction Trades Council and was elected as a Trustee \nof the International Union of Operating Engineers for the Northeastern \nStates in 1991.\n  As Local 57 celebrates its centennial of fighting for the concerns \nand needs of hard working Rhode Islanders, it is only fitting to \nacknowledge Eddie for his decades of service to the IUOE. I would like \nto take this opportunity to personally extend my deep appreciation and \ngratitude to Eddie Sullivan for his continued hard work and leadership \nover the years to the labor movement, and his efforts to improving the \nlives of so many Rhode Islanders and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/20/senate-section/article/S9553-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ALEX EUCARE\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nefforts of a patriotic American. On September 14, 2001, Senator Mitch \nMcConnell and I introduced S. 1431, a bill to authorize the Secretary \nof the Treasury to issue War Bonds in support of recovery and response \nefforts relating to the September 11, 2001 hijackings and attacks on \nthe Pentagon and the World Trade Center.\n  After the news media broadcast our efforts, Mr. Alex Eucare of \nGaithersburg, MD heard about the bill and moved to reserve the Internet \ndomain name ``warbonds.com'' and toll free telephone number ``866-WAR-\nBOND'' to ensure that others attempting to improperly profit or exploit \nAmericans would not be able to do so.\n  This action by a concerned and caring citizen such as Alex Eucare \nmakes me proud to call myself an American. His act was selfless and \nunsolicited. Patriotic efforts like this are taking place all over our \ngreat nation. There is no doubt in my mind, that with a collaboration \nof these efforts, we will prevail, both in solidifying our unity as a \nnation and in punishing those responsible for these acts of terror.\n  As my good friend Senator McConnell noted, ``Alex's foresight in \nreserving the domain name and toll free number is yet another example \nof the thoughtful and compassionate nature of Americans. It is those \nvery qualities that Senator Burns and I are confident will make War \nBonds such a success.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/20/senate-section/article/S9553-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9553-S9555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  REPORT ON RECOVERY AND RESPONSE TO TERRORIST ATTACKS ON WORLD TRADE \n         CENTER AND PENTAGON--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 43\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate a message from the \nPresident of the United States, transmitting a copy of the President's \naddress concerning the terrorist attack on New York's World Trade \nCenter and the Pentagon, delivered to a joint session of Congress on \nSeptember 20, 2001; which was ordered to lie on the table.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Mr. Speaker, Mr. President pro tempore, Members of Congress, and \nfellow Americans:\n  In the normal course of events, Presidents come to this chamber to \nreport on the state of the Union.

We have seen the unfurling of flags, the \nlighting of candles, the giving of blood, the saying of prayers--in \nEnglish, Hebrew, and Arabic. We have seen the decency of a loving and \ngiving people, who have made the grief of strangers their own.\n  My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen \nfor itself the state of our Union--and it is strong.\n  Tonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend \nfreedom. Our grief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution. \nWhether we bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our \nenemies, justice will be done.\n  I thank the Congress for its leadership at such an important time. \nAll of America was touched on the evening of the tragedy to see \nRepublicans and Democrats, joined together on the steps of this \nCapitol, singing ``God Bless America.'' And you did more than sing, you \nacted, by delivering forty billion dollars to rebuild our communities \nand meet the needs of our military.\n  Speaker Hastert and Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader \nDaschle, and Senator Lott, I thank you for your friendship and your \nleadership and your service to our country.\n  And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world for its \noutpouring of support. America will never forget the sounds of our \nNational Anthem playing at Buckingham Palace, and on the streets of \nParis, and at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate. We will not forget South \nKorean children gathering to pray outside our embassy in Seoul, or the \nprayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in Cairo. We will not forget\n\n[[Page S9554]]\n\nmoments of silence and days of mourning in Australia and Africa and \nLatin America.\n  Nor will we forget the citizens of eighty other nations who died with \nour own. Dozens of Pakistanis. More than 130 Israelis. More than 250 \ncitizens of India. Men and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico, and \nJapan. And hundreds of British citizens. America has no truer friend \nthan Great Britain. Once again, we are joined together in a great \ncause. The British Prime Minister has crossed an ocean to show his \nunity of purpose with America, and tonight we welcome Tony Blair.\n  On September the eleventh, enemies of freedom committed an act of war \nagainst our country. Americans have known wars--but for the past 136 \nyears, they have been wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in \n1941. Americans have known the casualties of war--but not at the center \nof a great city on a peaceful morning. Americans have known surprise \nattacks--but never before on thousands of civilians. All of this was \nbrought upon us in a single day--and night fell on a different world, a \nworld where freedom itself is under attack.\n  Americans have many questions tonight. Americans are asking: Who \nattacked our country?\n  The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely \naffiliated terrorist organizations known as al-Qaida. They are the same \nmurderers indicted for bombing American embassies in Tanzania and \nKenya, and responsible for the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole.\n  Al-Qaida is to terror what the mafia is to crime. But its goal is not \nmaking money; its goal is remaking the world--and imposing its radical \nbeliefs on people everywhere.\n  The terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has \nbeen rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim \nclerics--a fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of \nIslam. The terrorists' directive commands them to kill Christians and \nJews, to kill all Americans, and make no distinctions among military \nand civilians, including women and children.\n\n  This group and its leaders--a person named Usama bin Ladin--are \nlinked to many other organizations in different countries, including \nthe Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.\n  There are thousands of these terrorists in more than sixty countries. \nThey are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods, and \nbrought to camps in places like Afghanistan where they are trained in \nthe tactics of terror. They are sent back to their homes or sent to \nhide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction.\n  The leadership of al-Qaida has great influence in Afghanistan, and \nsupports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country. In \nAfghanistan, we see al-Qaida's vision for the world.\n  Afghanistan's people have been brutalized--many are starving and many \nhave fled. Women are not allowed to attend school. You can be jailed \nfor owning a television. Religion can be practiced only as their \nleaders dictate. A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not \nlong enough.\n  The United States respects the people of Afghanistan--after all, we \nare currently its largest source of humanitarian aid--but we condemn \nthe Taliban regime. It is not only repressing its own people, it is \nthreatening people everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and \nsupplying terrorists. By aiding and abetting murder, the Taliban regime \nis committing murder. And tonight, the United States of America makes \nthe following demands on the Taliban:\n  Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al-Qaida who \nhide in your land.\n  Release all foreign nationals--including American citizens--you have \nunjustly imprisoned, and protect foreign journalists, diplomats, and \naid workers in your country.\n  Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in \nAfghanistan and hand over every terrorist, and every person in their \nsupport structure, to appropriate authorities.\n  Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps, so we \ncan make sure they are no longer operating.\n  These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion. The Taliban \nmust act and act immediately. They will hand over the terrorists, or \nthey will share in their fate.\n  I also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the \nworld: We respect your faith. It is practiced freely by many millions \nof Americans, and by millions more in countries that America counts as \nfriends. Its teachings are good and peaceful, and those who commit evil \nin the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah. The terrorists are \ntraitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself. \nThe enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many \nArab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists, and every \ngovernment that supports them.\n  Our war on terror with al-Qaida, but it does not end there. It will \nnot end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, \nstopped, and defeated.\n  Americans are asking: Why do they hate us?\n  They hate what we see right here in this chamber--a democratically \nelected government. Their leaders are self-appointed. They hate our \nfreedoms--our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom \nto vote and assemble and disagree with each other.\n  They want to overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries, \nsuch as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. They want to drive Israel out \nof the Middle East. They want to drive Christians and Jews out of vast \nregions of Asia and Africa.\n  These terrorists kill not merely to end lives, but to disrupt and end \na way of life. With every atrocity, they hope that America grows \nfearful, retreating from the world and forsaking our friends. They \nstand against us, because we stand in their way.\n  We are not deceived by their pretenses to piety. We have seen their \nkind before. They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the \ntwentieth century. By sacrificing human life to serve their radical \nvisions--by abandoning every value except the will to power--they \nfollow in the path of fascism, and Nazism, and totalitarianism. And \nthey will follow that path all the way, to where it ends: in history's \nunmarked grave of discarded lies.\n  Americans are asking: How will we fight and win this war?\n  We will direct every resource at our command--every means of \ndiplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law \nenforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary weapon of \nwar--to the disruption and defeat of the global terror network.\n  This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with its \ndecisive liberation of territory and its swift conclusion. It will not \nlook like the air war above Kosovo two years ago, where no ground \ntroops were used and not a single American was lost in combat.\n  Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated \nstrikes. Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy \ncampaign, unlike any other we have seen. It may include dramatic \nstrikes, visible on television, and covert operations, secret even in \nsuccess. We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against \nanother, drive them from place to place, until there is no refuge or \nrest. And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to \nterrorism. Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. \nEither you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. From this day \nforward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will \nbe regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.\n  Our Nation has been put on notice: We are not immune from attack. We \nwill take defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans.\n  Today, dozens of Federal departments and agencies, as well as State \nand local governments, have responsibilities affecting homeland \nsecurity. These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level. So \ntonight I announce the creation of a Cabinet-level position reporting \ndirectly to me--the Office of Homeland Security. And tonight I also \nannounce a distinguished American to lead this effort to strengthen \nAmerica's security--a military veteran, an effective Governor, a true \npatriot, and my trusted friend,\n\n[[Page S9555]]\n\nPennsylvania's Governor Tom Ridge. He will lead, oversee, and \ncoordinate a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country \nagainst terrorism, and respond to any attacks that may come.\n  These measures are essential. But the only way to defeat terrorism as \na threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it \nwhere it grows.\n  Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents to intelligence \noperatives to the reservists we have called to active duty. All deserve \nour thanks, and all have our prayers. And tonight, a few miles from the \ndamaged Pentagon, I have a message for our military: Be ready. I have \ncalled the armed forces to alert, and there is a reason. The hour is \ncoming when America will act, and you will make us proud.\n  This is not, however, just America's fight. And what is at stake is \nnot just America's freedom. This is the world's fight. This is \ncivilization's fight. This is the fight of all who believe in progress \nand pluralism, tolerance and freedom.\n  We ask every nation to join us. We will ask, and we will need, the \nhelp of police forces, intelligence services, and banking systems \naround the world. The United States is grateful that many nations and \nmany international organizations have already responded--with sympathy \nand with support. Nations from Latin America, to Asia, to Africa, to \nEurope, to the Islamic world. Perhaps the NATO Charter reflects best \nthe attitude of the world: an attack on one is an attack on all.\n\n  The civilized world is rallying to America's side. They understand \nthat if this terror goes unpunished, their own cities, their own \ncitizens may be next. Terror, unanswered, can not only bring down \nbuildings, it can threaten the stability of legitimate governments. And \nwe will not allow it.\n  Americans are asking: What is expected of us?\n  I ask you to live your lives and hug your children. I know many \ncitizens have fears tonight, and I ask you to be calm and resolute, \neven in the face of a continuing threat.\n  I ask you to uphold the values of America, and remember why so many \nhave come here. We are in a fight for our principles, and our first \nresponsibility is to live by them. No one should be singled out for \nunfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or \nreligious faith.\n  I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with \nyour contributions. Those who want to give can go to a central source \nof information, libertyunites.org, to find the names of groups \nproviding direct help in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.\n  The thousands of FBI agents who are now at work in this investigation \nmay need your cooperation, and I ask you to give it.\n  I ask for your patience, with the delays and inconveniences that may \naccompany tighter security--and for your patience in what will be a \nlong struggle.\n  I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American \neconomy. Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did \nnot touch its source. America is successful because of the hard work, \nand creativity, and enterprise of our people. These were the true \nstrengths of our economy before September eleventh, and they are our \nstrengths today.\n  Finally, please continue praying for the victims of terror and their \nfamilies, for those in uniform, and for our great country. Prayer has \ncomforted us in sorrow, and will help strengthen us for the journey \nahead.\n  Tonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done \nand for what you will do. And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I \nthank you, their representatives, for what you have already done, and \nfor what we will do together.\n  Tonight, we face new and sudden national challenges. We will come \ntogether to improve air safety, to dramatically expand the number of \nair marshals on domestic flights, and take new measures to prevent \nhijacking. We will come together to promote stability and keep our \nairlines flying with direct assistance during this emergency.\n  We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it \nneeds to track down terror here at home. We will come together to \nstrengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans of \nterrorists before they act, and find them before they strike.\n  We will come together to take active steps that strengthen America's \neconomy, and put our people back to work.\n  Tonight we welcome here two leaders who embody the extraordinary \nspirit of all New Yorkers: Governor George Pataki and Mayor Rudy \nGiuliani. As a symbol of America's resolve, my Administration will work \nwith the Congress, and these two leaders, to show the world that we \nwill rebuild New York City.\n  After all that has just passed--all the lives taken, and all the \npossibilities and hopes that died with them--it is natural to wonder if \nAmerica's future is one of fear. Some speak of an age of terror. I know \nthere are struggles ahead, and dangers to face. But this country will \ndefine our times, not be defined by them. As long as the United States \nof America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror; \nthis will be an age of liberty, here and across the world.\n\n  Great harm has been done to us. We have suffered great loss. And in \nour grief and anger we have found our mission and our moment. Freedom \nand fear are at war. The advance of human freedom--the great \nachievement of our time, and the great hope of every time--now depends \non us. Our Nation--this generation--will lift a dark threat of violence \nfrom our people and our future. We will rally the world to this cause, \nby our efforts and by our courage. We will not tire, we will not \nfalter, and we will not fail.\n  It is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return \nalmost to normal. We'll go back to our lives and routines, and that is \ngood. Even grief recedes with time and grace. But our resolve must not \npass. Each of us will remember what happened that day, and to whom it \nhappened. We will remember the moment the news came--where we were and \nwhat we were doing. Some will remember an image of fire, or a story of \nrescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever.\n  And I will carry this. It is the police shield of a man named George \nHoward, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others. It \nwas given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. \nThis is my reminder of lives that ended, and a task that does not end.\n  I will not forget this wound to our country, or those who inflicted \nit. I will not yield--I will not rest--I will not relent in waging this \nstruggle for the freedom and security of the American people.\n  The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. \nFreedom and fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we \nknow that God is not neutral between them.\n  Fellow citizens, we will meet violence with patient justice--assured \nof the rightness of our cause, and confident of the victories to come. \nIn all that lies before us, may God grant us wisdom, and may He watch \nover the United States of America.\n  Thank you.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, September 20, 2001.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/20/senate-section/article/S9555-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEASURE REFERRED\n\n  The following concurrent resolution, which was being held at the desk \npending further disposition, was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n       S.

A bill to establish the Oil Region National Heritage Area; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would establish the Oil Region National Heritage Area. This bill \nis a companion to H.R. 695, introduced by Representative John Peterson, \nwhich passed the House of Representatives on September 10, 2001. This \nlegislation is significant not only to Pennsylvania's history but to \nour Nation's history and modern, commercial development.\n  The creation of a national Oil Heritage Region will support the \npreservation of many natural, cultural and historical resources \nassociated with the site of the first successfully drilled oil well.\n  The notion of drilling for oil was first considered by the \nPennsylvania Rock Oil Company who believed that ``digging'' for oil was \ntoo time consuming. Acting on the prospect of greater efficiency, the \ncompany sent Edwin ``Colonel'' Drake to Titusville, Pennsylvania in \n1858 to undertake a drilling endeavor. Throughout the next year, Drake \nspent his time convincing investors; securing financing; and laying the \ngroundwork to begin actual drilling. A year later, the derrick was \nbuilt and drilling began. Results did not come immediately, but \neventually. And so began the modern commercial petroleum industry.\n  Without a doubt, petroleum has played a major part in the history and \nultimate development and industrialization of our country. Currently, \nmore than 300,000 workers are employed in the oil industry nationwide \nwith more than 8,000 companies producing oil in the United States. The \nimportance of a national heritage region designation will ensure that \nthe vision of a Pennsylvania company and Edwin Drake's persistence and \nultimate success in oil drilling is not only preserved but shared. \nEstablishing a national heritage region will coordinate preservation \nactivities and promote the region's cultural richness through exhibits, \ndisplays, and the development of educational and recreational \nopportunities.\n  I would be remiss not to mention the significant grassroots support \nassociated with this effort. Introduction of this legislation is the \nproduct of much collaboration from individuals, businesses, and local \ngovernment. A key element to securing designations of this kind is \nassurances of the community's collective and widespread support. I am \nconfident that such support has been capably demonstrated and proven.\n  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has also recognized these local \nefforts, as well the region's historical significance, by granting a \nstate heritage park designation. Today, visitors are able to enjoy \ncultural and recreational opportunities in the scenic valleys and \nrestored rivers like the Allegheny River and Oil Creek.\n  The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is rich with historical firsts, and \nthe fruitful efforts of Edwin Drake and the Pennsylvania Rock Oil \nCompany are tops among them. I am pleased to introduce this legislation \ntoday, and to have the shared support of my fellow Pennsylvania \nSenator, Arlen Specter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/20/senate-section/article/S9558-2", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9558-S9559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 162--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 17, 2001, AS A ``DAY OF \n         NATIONAL CONCERN ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE AND GUN VIOLENCE''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. \nCantwell, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nDayton, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Jeffords, \nMr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Levin, Ms. Mikulski, \nMr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Ms. \nStabenow, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Thurmond) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 161\n\n       Whereas young people are our Nation's most important \n     resource, and we, as a society, have a vested interest in \n     enabling children to grow in an environment free from fear \n     and violence;\n       Whereas young people can, by taking responsibility for \n     their own decisions and actions and by positively influencing \n     the decisions and actions of others, help chart a new, less \n     violent course for the entire Nation;\n       Whereas students in every school district in the Nation \n     will be invited to take part in a day of nationwide \n     observance involving millions of their fellow students, and \n     will thereby be empowered to see themselves as significant \n     agents in a wave of positive social change; and\n       Whereas the observance of October 17, 2001, as a ``Day of \n     National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence'' will \n     allow students to make a positive and earnest decision about \n     their future by having the opportunity to voluntarily sign \n     the ``Student Pledge Against Gun Violence'' and promise that \n     they will never take a gun to school, will never use a gun to \n     settle a dispute, and will actively use their influence in a \n     positive manner to prevent friends from using guns to settle \n     disputes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 17, 2001, as a ``Day of National \n     Concern About Young People and Gun Violence''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the school children of the United States to \n     observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to submit with Senator \nWarner and 27 original cosponsors a resolution that establishes October \n17, 2001, as a ``Day of National Concern About Young People and Gun \nViolence.'' I wish to express my appreciation to Senator Warner in \njoining me again by shepherding this resolution on his side of the \naisle. I thank him for his assistance and support.\n  The need for this resolution could not be more clear. Every year, our \nNation loses too many young lives to school shootings and other acts of \ngun violence. These tragedies leave lasting scars on families and \ncommunities. The Senate must actively combat this violence and work to \naddress the concerns of families and communities throughout our nation \nwho worry about the safety of their children.\n  I am introducing this resolution again because I firmly believe that \nwe must involve our children and young people in working to end gun \nviolence. This resolution establishes a special day that gives young \npeople the opportunity to examine how they can help reduce gun violence \nthat targets their peers. Additionally, this special day promotes the \nStudent Pledge Against Gun Violence, an important avenue\n\n[[Page S9559]]\n\nthrough which young people can empower themselves and their friends to \ntake action against these tragedies.\n  The pledge was developed by Mary Lewis Grow, a Minnesota homemaker. \nStudents who take the pledge agree to never bring a gun to school, to \nnever use a gun to resolve a conflict, and to encourage their friends \nto do the same. Last year, more than 2.4 million students signed the \npledge. The pledge has received national support from such prominent \norganizations as the National Parent Teacher Association, the National \nSchool Boards Association, and the American Medical Association. It is \nentirely appropriate that the Senate lend its powerful voice to this \nchorus.\n  Just imagine how many young people would still be alive today if \nevery student in America had signed, and lived up to, the pledge. \nImagine how much safer children would feel as they go to school each \nday. Imagine how much happier parents would feel if they knew that \ntheir children would not be endangered as they tried to learn. It is \nclear that if the Senate's support can convince more young people to \nsign the pledge, and prevent even one more gun from coming to a school, \nthen we have taken a step in the right direction.\n  The Senate must continue to be active in addressing crime in many \nways. We must pass strong and effective anticrime legislation that gets \ncriminals off the streets. And we should, through supporting \nlegislation and by example, help parents spend more time with their \nchildren and get communities to reach out to those young people who \nhave no one to care for them.\n  Reducing and ending youth violence will certainly not be easy. But by \npassing this resolution, we take an important step in the right \ndirection. Let us join with teachers, administrators, parents, and \ncommunity members around the Nation in working to empower our young \npeople. Let us encourage all of our children to be active in reducing \ngun violence. By working together, we can make America safer and can \nsecure a better future for all of our Nation's youth.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to once again submit a \nresolution with my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray, to \nestablish October 17, 2001, as the Day of National Concern About Young \nPeople and Gun Violence.\n  We all remember the events in Conyers, GA, Littleton, CO, Pearl, MS, \nWest Paducah, KY, Jonesboro, AR, and Springfield, OR. Neighborhoods in \nthese areas have all been home to horrific school shootings. Youth gun \nviolence, however, is not limited to these all too often incidences of \nschool shootings. America has lost thousands of children in what has \nbecome the all-too-common violence of drive-by shootings, drug wars, \nand other crimes, as well as in self-inflicted and unintentional \nshootings.\n  While there is no simple solution as to how to stop youth violence, a \nMinnesota homemaker, Mary Lewis Grow, developed the idea of a Day of \nNational Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. I believe this \nidea is a step in the right direction, as do such groups as National \nSchool Boards Association, the National Association of Student \nCouncils, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Parent \nTeacher Association, and the American Medical Association.\n  Simply put, this resolution will establish October 17, 2001, as the \nDay of National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. On this \nday, students in every school district in the Nation will be invited to \nvoluntarily sign the ``Student Pledge Against Gun Violence.'' By \nsigning the pledge, students promise that they will never take a gun to \nschool, will never use a gun to settle a dispute, and will use their \ninfluence in a positive manner to prevent friends from using guns to \nsettle disputes.\n  The Day of National Concern addresses the necessity of involving \nAmerica's youth in the debate on gun violence against young people. \nWhile adults may give advice and support, it is America's youth that \nmust make the final decision to not use a firearm to resolve conflict.\n  Just last year over 2 million young Americans signed the Student \nPledge Against Gun Violence. Though this resolution is not the ultimate \nsolution to preventing future tragedies, if it stops even one incident \nof youth gun violence, this resolution will be invaluable.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join in this resolution to focus \nattention on gun violence among youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/20/senate-section/article/S9559-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1585.
