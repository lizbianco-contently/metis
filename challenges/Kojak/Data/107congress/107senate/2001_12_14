Under the previous order, the \nsenior Senator from Minnesota is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2602 TO Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2602 to amendment No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be very brief in the summary of \nthis amendment. This amendment restricts new or expanding large \nconfined animal feeding operation, CAFOs, from receiving Environmental \nQuality Incentive Program (EQIP) funds for animal waste structures. We \nwill go over the definitions as we get into this debate on Tuesday, \nbut, for example, 1,000 animals is equal altogether to 9,090 hogs. \nThese are big operations.\n  This amendment also deals with what we call multiple CAFOs. The \namendment prohibits an entity with interests in more than one CAFO from \nreceiving more than one EQIP contract, thus prohibiting double \npayments. This measure helps ensure that this Federal farm conservation \nprograms and the funds are not used to promote consolidation and \nconcentration of livestock production.\n  The third part to this amendment deals with flood plains. The \namendment restricts the use of EQIP funds for new or expanding \nlivestock waste facilities in a 100-year flood plains. Locating a large \nanimal waste facility in a flood plain is contrary to all good \nconservation common sense.\n  Fourth, the amendment requires animal operations receiving EQIP funds \nfor structures to also develop and follow a comprehensive nutrient \nmanagement plan to ensure that the conservation assistance does not end \nwith the storage of manure but that the entire operation be taken into \naccount, including the ultimate disposition of the waste in terms of \nbeing applied to the land.\n  Finally, on payments, the amendment doubles the current annual \npayment limitation for EQIP, which I would rather not do. The amendment \nincreases the annual payment from $10,000 to $20,000, and doubles the \ncurrent payment limit per 5-year contract from $50,000 to $100,000 \nwhile retaining the current law waiver authority for the annual \nlimitation at the discretion of USDA. The committee bill, by contrast, \nincreases the cap of $50,000 and also a 3-year cap of $150,000.\n  My colleagues should know that the current average EQIP contract for \nanimal waste structures is approximately $13,000. So this amendment \nwould not affect the majority of those producers who receive and need \nassistance from this program. We are really talking about the very \nlargest of operations here. And don't forget the existing CAFOs around \nthe country would not be affected, this amendment only applies to new \nor expanding CAFOs.\n  I have summarized this amendment. It deals with a growing problem in \nagriculture; that is to say, the concentration in the livestock sector, \nthe environmental pollution, and, frankly, Federal subsidies that go to \nthese large farming operations and encourage yet more consolidation and \nmore big business and, in this particular case, more environmental \ndestruction.\n  The amendment is simple. It says we in the Congress should, and will, \nwork to help alleviate the environmental and public health threats \nposed by these large-scale animal factories. However--I emphasize that \nword, ``however''--Congress should not be subsidizing the expansion of \nthese large animal confinement operations. That is what this amendment \nsays.\n  My colleagues should know that this amendment has broad support from \nboth the farm and environmental community, from groups such as the \nNational Farmers Union, Defenders of Wildlife, Environmental Defense, \nEnvironmental Working Group, Humane Society, National Wildlife \nFederation, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Sustainable \nAgriculture Coalition.\n  I look forward to debating and adopting this amendment. I wanted to \nlay the amendment down today. I will get back to this debate on \nTuesday.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Minnesota has been laid down?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is the amendment on the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program that would allow cost-share funds to all existing \nlivestock operations, but would limit it for the largest ones that are \nnew or expanded after this bill is enacted; is that right?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I rise in support of \nthe amendment. I am proud to support this amendment with my colleague \nfrom Minnesota.\n  During the 1996 farm bill debate, I successfully offered an amendment \nthat limited cost-share funding under EQIP for large confined animal \nfeeding operations. That was the 1,000-animal unit limit that has \nexisted under the farm bill since that time. I offered that amendment \nin 1996 because of the special environmental concerns associated with \nthese large operations.\n  CAFOs, as they are called, confined animal feeding operations, CAFOs, \nthese are operations of greater than 1,000 animal units. What that \nmeans--that is 455,000 broilers, 4,000 head of veal, 5,400 head of \nswine of an average weight of 185 pounds--these numbers are for the \naverage number of livestock confined for 45 days over a 12-month \nperiod. So it is not 5,400 swine for the year. It is how many are \nconfined for 45 days in any 12-month period. It could be double or \ntriple that number of hogs over the year. That is a lot of animals.\n  Again, these are large operations. Over the last several years we \nhave seen an increase in the development and enforcement of Federal, \nState, and local environmental laws regulating waste from animal \nfeeding operations. I believe we need to help producers comply or avoid \nthe need for regulations. We should provide cost-share funds to these \nexisting CAFOs to build structures that will contain waste to protect \nwater quality and to protect the environment generally. However, EQIP \nmoney was never designed to subsidize the expansion of livestock \noperations.\n  The underlying bill allows the use of cost-share funds for all \nexisting operations, and that is fine. But, it also funds for new CAFOs \nand expanding operations to CAFOs. That is what is wrong because \nobviously, if you can use the money to fund expansion, it gives you an \nincentive to get larger.\n  This amendment, the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota, does not \nprevent the use of funds for small operations or for existing CAFOs. \nBut it prohibits cost-share funding for new or expanding confined \nanimal feeding operations; that is, operations over 1,000 animal units. \nIt limits the subsidization of the growth for the very largest \nlivestock operations.\n  I believe this amendment is consistent with the underlying bill. It \nstill helps livestock producers who are now in operation who need to \nmeet ever stricter environmental standards. We have put more money into \nEQIP. We have expanded the EQIP program over six times above the \nbaseline over the next five years--from $1 billion to $6.2 billion. So \nwe are putting in a lot of money. I think this is a good way to invest \nthis money protecting the environment, helping the livestock producers \nmeet the more stringent environmental standards.\n  Again, we have more money, but that money ought to be used for the \nones that are there now, the ones that need this help now. We have \ntaken the cap off of limiting funds to large CAFOs in\n\n[[Page S13247]]\n\nthe underlying bill, we have gone above 1,000--again, that is fine. But \nwe don't want people to see the EQIP funds as an incentive. We don't \nwant people to say: Gee, I have 800 animal units, I can go up to 2,000, \n3,000 animal units now and the Government is going to come in and help \nme build these structures. If they want to expand and build facilities \non their own, we don't prohibit that, but we don't want to use \nGovernment money to encourage that.\n\n  So it is a good amendment. I think it should be adopted.\n  I understand some other people may want to debate it, but the order \nis we are going to lay this aside for other amendments; is that \ncorrect?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Arizona or his designee is recognized to offer an \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, before that occurs, since I will be the \ndesignee, I just want to make a comment about the amendment of the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone.\n  I appreciate what he is attempting to do. I find the situation--one \nin which I argued fairly strenuously, but I think without necessarily \npersuading Senators--that the farm bill, at least as it is now \nconstituted, will inevitably increase planting of corn, wheat, cotton, \nrice, soybeans--those things to which the money is directed. There is \nstrong evidence the USDA pointed out our last farm bill stimulated \nabout 4 million acres of additional production into the program crops.\n  One might argue that we were not subsidizing expansion. But the \nevidence is much of this increase in acreage came from our largest, \nmost efficient producers, whose names appear in lists receiving the \nmost subsidies. Perhaps if we were to try all this over again and look \nwith some consistency as we take a look at the livestock portion of \nagriculture at the same time we deal with the crops and various other \nparts--and that is what the Senator has sought to do, to take a whole \nfarm, whole income approach--perhaps this amendment might have some \nmore equity. It probably has value for the reasons the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, our chairman, has pointed out. Clearly, most persons \ninvolved in these reform movements, support the EQIP program. I believe \nit is an important one with regard to the environment, as well as some \nequity for livestock producers. They are loathe to admit that this \nmight produce more livestock, greater herds subsidized by the Federal \nGovernment. Obviously it does.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is trying to plug up that particular hole, \nwhile it seems to me there are gaping holes in the dike all around that \nare likely to lead to very large expenditures. I will study the \namendment carefully. I will likewise attempt to work with my colleagues \nto see if we can bring some equity in all parts of agriculture. We will \ntake a look again at the whole farm situation.\n  Does my colleague wish further debate on the Wellstone amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2603 To Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I understand the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, has an \namendment at the desk. Is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. On behalf of the Senator from Arizona, I call up the \namendment at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. McCain, for \n     himself, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Kerry, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2603 to amendment No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n         (Purpose: To provide for the market name for catfish)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the substitute, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.  . MARKET NAME FOR CATFISH.\n\n       The term ``catfish'' shall be considered to be a common or \n     usual name (or part thereof) for any fish in keeping with \n     Food and Drug Administration procedures that follow \n     scientific standards and market practices for establishing \n     such names for the purposes of section 403 of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including with respect to the \n     importation of such fish pursuant to section 801 of such Act.\n\n     SEC.  . LABELING OF FISH AS CATFISH.\n\n       Section 755 of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and \n     Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     2002, is repealed.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nthe McCain amendment. This amendment will effectively repeal a ban on \ncatfish imports which was quietly tucked into the most recent \nAgriculture appropriations bill.\n  It may seem on the face of it that a ban on catfish imports is of \nlittle consequence if you are not from a state that produces catfish. \nHowever, put in the larger context of the multi-billion-dollar U.S. \nseafood industry, the implications are clear. If this ban on catfish \nimports were allowed to stand, it would pull the rug right out from \nunder our own U.S. Trade Representative who is trying to fight similar \nprotectionist actions against the U.S. seafood industry by our trading \npartners. Regardless of the intentions of proponents of this catfish \nban, it has significant impacts for other U.S. fisheries and deserves \ngreater scrutiny than was afforded during the consideration of the \nAgriculture Appropriations bill earlier this year.\n  The specific reason why I have come to the floor to speak on this \nmatter is because of its implications for the Oregon pink shrimp \nfishery. The pink shrimp fishery in Oregon has become increasingly \nsignificant to Oregon fishers in recent years as the groundfish fishery \nhas declined. Pink shrimp, along with West Coast groundfish and \nDungeness crab form the foundation of the commercial fishing industry \nin my state. Unfortunately, the successful development of the Oregon \npink shrimp fishery will always be handicapped as long as we are unable \nto get fair treatment in the European market for the variety of pink \nshrimp harvested in the waters of the Pacific Northwest. The Europeans \nhave been able to shut Oregon pink shrimp out of their market through a \ntariff policy that is biased in favor of the shrimp varieties found in \ntheir waters. With that tariff regime in place, Oregon pink shrimp \neffectively cannot compete in the European Union. As a result, the \nsituation has had negative impacts on the price paid to Oregon pink \nshrimp fishers.\n  Recently, it has been brought to my attention that there may be a \nsimilar problem in getting access to the European market for Oregon \nsardines. The recent reappearance of sardines off of Oregon has been \nattributed to a significant ocean regime change. In any case, I want to \nmake sure that this resurgent Oregon sardine fishery has fair access to \nforeign markets as well.\n  Given time, I hope that the United States Trade Representative will \nbe able to resolve some of these issues with our friends in the \nEuropean Union. However, that simply cannot happen when we in the \nUnited States Senate invoke protectionist measures of our own to keep \nforeign seafood products from competing here. That is what happened \nwith this attempt to bar Vietnamese catfish from the U.S. market. It is \nprudent for us to act today to repeal this catfish ban. At the very \nleast, a proposal of such significance should have been subjected to a \nfull debate in the Senate during consideration of the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for putting forward this amendment. \nI hope that the Senate will act today to repeal the catfish ban and \nallow all the issues involved to be considered by the appropriate \ncommittees of jurisdiction.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I understand the order is the Chair might \nat this point lay this amendment aside. If so, I suggest that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is laid aside.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Is the amendment laid aside?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S13248]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again for the benefit of those in their \noffices, Senators who are here today, the farm bill is open right now \nfor amendment. Under the agreement made by the leaders, yesterday, I \nguess, or the day before--obviously there are no votes today. We can \nstill take the amendments. They can be laid down, we can debate them \nwith whoever is here, and they will then be in line for voting when we \ncome back on Tuesday, or further debate, also, when we come back.\n  I say to my friend, I see my friend from Kansas is here. Maybe my \nfriend from Kansas has an amendment he would like to offer on the farm \nbill and get it in line so we could, perhaps, vote on this mythical \nCochran-Roberts amendment that I keep hearing about but I can't see. It \nis sort of ephemeral--sort of out there somewhere, but we can't seem to \nget our fingers on it. Maybe we could get the Cochran-Roberts amendment \nover here today, lay it down, and start discussing it so we can have it \nhere next Tuesday.\n\n  I urge any Senators who have amendments to come over to the floor and \nlay them down.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, are we on the farm bill?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will address the Senate for a short \nperiod of time today. Next week I hope to be able to speak on this \nsubject with a potential amendment I might offer about the trade \naspects of the farm bill.\n  I start with the premise that we have a farm bill--and we have had \nfarm legislation for 60 or 70 years--with what we call a safety net to \ngive structure to the economics of agriculture, to give some certainty \nto agriculture, and to help farmers in times of low prices and \nproblems.\n  So much of farming is beyond the control of the individual farmer. \nOne of those things is international trade. Maybe we don't think of \nthat as often as we do things such as natural disasters that hit \nfarmers, domestic politics which might cause prices to go up or down, \nand decisions of the Federal Reserve which affect the value of the \ndollar. Sometimes international policies affect the value of the \ndollar.\n  There are just a lot of things out there that affect the family \nfarmer over which they don't have any control. Family farmers tend to \nbe more in the position, unlike most businesses, of having to take a \nprice the market dictates for the products they sell over which they \ndon't have any control. Also, they do not have a lot of control over \nthe cost of their input for the production of their products. They are \none of the few segments of our economy that have to pay whatever the \nmarket demands for their input, and they receive from the market \nwhatever it pays.\n  That is why we have a safety net. We have had a safety net for \nfarmers of one form or another. There hasn't been a lot of difference \nin those programs over the last 70 years.\n  We tend to speak about farm bills as if this farm bill is much \ndifferent from the previous farm bill, et cetera. I am not going to go \ninto those things. But there hasn't been that much difference. The \npremise has been very much the same. We are going to have a safety net \nfor farmers to guarantee a certain floor of income at times of low \nprices because there is so much affecting the economics of the family \nfarmer that is beyond their control.\n  I start with the premise--and the extent to which my colleagues \ndisagree with me on this, I welcome their disagreement and this debate \non it--that the farm bill, whether it is a 1950-type farm bill, or the \n1996 farm bill, or even the one we are debating right now, is meant to \nhave a safety net, is meant to sustain farmers in business during the \nperiod of time of low prices, which a lot of times is caused by things \nbeyond the farmers' control. This safety net doesn't guarantee \nprofitability. I don't think there is anything in any farm bill I have \never seen to guarantee profitability.\n  That is where trade comes in. When we produce 40 percent more than we \nconsume domestically, it means that farmers have to have the ability to \nexport. Export is very important. When there is no profitability in the \nfarm bill, then the only profitability in farming is going to come from \nthe marketplace.\n  When you produce more than you can consume domestically, that means \nthe world marketplace is where the profitability for agriculture is \ngoing to come. In other words, there is not profitability in a check \nfrom the Federal Treasury to a farmer when prices are low, as has been \nthe case in recent years, particularly in emergency bills, but there is \nprofitability in exports.\n  Let me put it this way: the only reason there is profitability for \nfarmers is due to the exportation of our surplus agricultural products. \nThat is why trade is an important part of any discussion of farm \nlegislation, even though the trade policies of this country are decided \nby other committees. One of those happens to be the Finance Committee \non which I serve. The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over all trade \npolicy. The most recent one is just about out of committee now--it had \nan 18-to-3 vote on final passage--which was trade promotion authority.\n\n  That is why sometimes when news-people ask me, what are we doing for \nfarmers in the farm bill, I give the same spiel you just heard me give \nabout the safety net aspects of farm legislation being very important \nto helping sustain farmers.\n  But there is no profitability in the check from the Federal Treasury \nwhen prices are low. The profitability for farming is going to come \nthrough trade. That is why I like to remind people that trade promotion \nauthority, and other trade policies, are probably as important to the \nfamily farmer as what is in a farm bill, and particularly when it comes \nto profitability.\n  So I try to look at a farm bill to make sure it has these \nopportunities. But the most important fact is that we have had trade \nagreements. The last General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which \ncreated the World Trade Organization, had certain limits that could be \nspent in certain categories of farm support.\n  There is a limit on what we call trade distorting expenditures, that \nif you exceed those, the United States and, in turn, the U.S. farmer, \ncan be retaliated against legally if those are exceeded. So we have to \nbe concerned about those issues.\n  I am not here to say that in every respect all of the different farm \nproposals floating around here are unconcerned with trade implications. \nIt does not matter whether it's the farm bill that is before us, it \ndoes not matter whether it is the Daschle amendment to that bill, it \ndoes not matter whether it is Senator Roberts' and Senator Cochran's \nproposal, and it does not matter even whether it is the House bill; it \nis legitimate to bring the issue of trade to the attention of our \ncolleagues.\n  For instance, in the House bill, it is my understanding--and I have \nnot read that bill in its entirety, obviously--but it is my \nunderstanding that the House Agriculture Committee was concerned about \nthis, so they put a provision in their farm bill that if the Secretary \nof Agriculture found that legislation violated the WTO agreements, that \nit could be suspended. If that is exactly how it works and we have to \nspend more on agriculture, because that would be trade distorting, due \nto the fact that prices are low and then we could be retaliated against \ndollar-for-dollar for the excess expenditure and the farm program has \nto be suspended, then you are suspending the safety net for farmers at \nexactly the time they are going to need it. What the bill does is cut \noff payments when family farmers would very likely need those payments \nthe most.\n  Now, this can be avoided. Maybe my colleagues who are writing these \nprovisions will say they are taking that into consideration and they \nare going to avoid it, or they may say the conditions under which this \nhappens are not as dangerous as maybe I lead people to believe. So I am \nnot here to question anybody's intentions or motivations or anything. I \nam just here to ask my colleagues to give further thought to ways in \nwhich the legislation that is obviously going to become law--if it does\n\n[[Page S13249]]\n\nnot become law before this year, it is going to become law early next \nyear; and whenever it becomes law, it is going to become law in ample \ntime so we have it for the next crop-year in 2003 that it is needed--to \ntake these things of trade into consideration.\n  (Mrs. CARNAHAN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Each year our farmers become more reliant on overseas \nmarkets to sell their commodities. In fact, last year, farmers in my \nhome State of Iowa exported more than $3 billion worth of corn, \nsoybeans, meat products, and even live animals.\n  Nationwide, American farmers annually export close to half of their \nsoybeans and 20 percent of their corn production. Given the importance \nof export markets to American agriculture, the United States must \nassume a leading role in eliminating tariffs, excess trade-distorting \nsubsidies, and other barriers to trade.\n  In 1994 we joined our trading partners in the World Trade \nOrganization to discipline domestic agricultural support programs and \nto facilitate more open trade. The agreement, called the Uruguay Round \nAgreement on Agriculture, capped the level of trade-distorting support \nthat WTO members can provide to producers.\n  Worldwide, agricultural tariffs were reduced by an average of 36 \npercent over a 6-year period. The United States agreed to reduce its \nown trade-distorting domestic support, or what is referred to as \n``amber box'' spending under this trade agreement, by 20 percent, down \nto a point of $19.1 billion per year.\n  The Senate must pass legislation that abides by this commitment or \nour trading partners could take retaliatory action against our farmers \nand against our agricultural exports. Unfortunately, the farm bills \nbefore us, and I think particularly the House bill--and even the bill \nthat was passed out of the Senate Agriculture Committee--leads our \nNation down a dangerous road toward exceeding our ``amber box'' limits \nand opening the door to this WTO legal retaliation. Retaliation through \nhigher tariffs on our exports and reduced market access for our farmers \nwould reduce the worldwide demand for our commodities, resulting in an \noverwhelmingly domestic surplus and depressing domestic commodity \nprices.\n  In light of the high stakes for America's farmers, I urge my \ncolleagues to carefully consider the potential impact on America's \nfarmers of a farm bill that could violate our international trade \ncommitments. We need to revisit the piece of legislation that was \npassed out of committee and work to improve it before we conference \nwith the House because, as I pointed out, I think the House bill has \nvery dramatic problems in this area as well.\n  Our farmers know how important international trade opportunities are \nfor our commodities. That is why farmers support issues such as trade \npromotion authority and trade with China. That was such a hot issue \nlast year being dealt with in the Congress. But if we don't practice \nwhat we preach regarding our World Trade Organization commitments, how \nwill we ever convince our potential trading partners around the world \nthat they should lower their trade barriers? And that is a goal of not \nonly this administration, but also we have to compliment the previous \nSecretary of Agriculture, Mr. Glickman, the previous Special Trade \nRepresentative, Charlene Barshefsky, when about 15 months ago they \ntabled in Geneva for negotiation purposes of the agricultural \nnegotiations that were going on under the WTO as it was mandated to \nhappen in 1993 to start in the year 2000. They tabled negotiation \npositions for our country's farmers that were in the best interests of \nour farmers of zero tariffs in agriculture.\n  This administration has followed through on that in the Doha Round \nthat started in early November, which is the new round of WTO \nnegotiations that are going on. And that is what trade promotion \nauthority is all about, to give the President the authority to make \nsuch an agreement. We have followed on the very good suggestions of the \nClinton appointees on what sort of direction our agricultural trade \nought to take.\n  I don't think there is any partisan disagreement on what we want to \ndo on international trade to help the American farmers. The only thing \nwe have to do is make sure we write farm legislation that is compliant \nwith the intentions of what was initiated in the Clinton administration \nand followed through on by the Bush administration.\n  As I have said in the past, the Government can provide support, but \nonly the marketplace can provide profitability. This isn't putting \nanybody in a position of political posturing if they don't agree with \nthat. I just think it is the cold hard truth about our agricultural \neconomy, if we are going to produce to our potential we must sell our \nsurplus on the world market. We surely don't want the alternative, \nwhich is to produce for the domestic market only and find ourselves in \na position of taking 40 percent of our productive capacity out of \nproduction and, through the Federal Treasury, pay the farmers for doing \nthat. I don't think the taxpayers would support that.\n  Worse yet, that might sustain farmers; you could even have support \nhigh enough to guarantee profitability. But you would ruin the economy \nof the United States if you produced 40 percent less farm machinery, 40 \npercent less input into agriculture. A lot of that comes from the small \ntown main street businesses of the America. We don't want to do \nanything negative to them. We want to keep our rural areas vibrant. \nThat means economic activity.\n  Economic activity in American agriculture is to produce and to \nproduce not only for the American people but for the hungry of the \nworld, to help our economy, but also to help the economy of other \ncountries as well.\n  It is a simple fact of life that the profitability in farming ought \nto come from the worldwide marketplace because the Federal budget is \nnot big enough to provide farmers profitable margins year after year.\n  If we don't establish a farm bill that helps us to lower trade \nbarriers, we will not be able to assist the agricultural community \ndevelop this long period of profitability.\n  Last week the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute, which \nis located on two campuses--Iowa State University and the University of \nMissouri--published a paper stating that there was over a 30-percent \nlikelihood that the farm bill coming out of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee would violate our trade commitments.\n  They could say the same thing about some other ideas floating around \nhere. They surely could say it about the House agriculture bill.\n  Think of it this way: If there was a better than 30-percent \nlikelihood that a ship would sink, you wouldn't get on board. The farm \nbill before us has the potential to impose significant harm on our \nfamily farmers by violating the current trade commitments. If this were \nto happen, our trading partners could refuse to accept our exports and \nthis action, being legal, at the same time would decimate the price of \nU.S. commodities affected. We can do better.\n  I hope as the debate on this farm bill continues or the debate on any \nfarm bill continues, these issues of compliance with our international \nobligations, which is for the benefit of American agriculture, because \nas we can reduce worldwide tariffs that average about 60 percent down \nto where U.S. tariffs are single digits on agricultural products, just \nthose facts make it a no-brainer that the United States should pursue \nfree trade policy in agriculture and that it will benefit the American \nfarmer.\n  If our tariffs are here and the worldwide tariffs average 46 percent, \nwhatever we do to negotiate to bring those down--and remember our goal \nunder the Clinton administration, now followed by the Bush \nadministration, is zero tariff--it is a no-brainer that this is going \nto affect very positively American agriculture and bring profitability \nto the farmer.\n  The only place for profitability in an industry that exports or that \nproduces more than 40 percent more than we can consume domestically, \nthe only profitability then is in the world market.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S13250]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, a few week ago, the Department of \nAgriculture announced that commodity prices had taken their biggest 1-\nmonth drop in more than 90 years.\n  It has been 5 years since Congress last passed a farm bill. Every \nyear since then, we have needed an expensive bailout bill. These \nbailouts are usually referred to as emergency disaster assistance. But \nthe real disaster has been our farm policy itself.\n  The 1996 farm bill provided farmers with flexibility in deciding \nwhat, when, and where to plant. But it left them utterly without a \nsafety net. When floods came, the farm bill gave them nothing.\n  When droughts cut their output in half, the farm bill gave them \nnothing. When the bottom fell out of prices, when the cost of fuel \nskyrocketed, when armyworms destroyed an entire crop, the farm bill \ngave them nothing.\n  Only when Congress passed emergency spending bills did farmers get \nany relief. That is a raw deal for the people who feed our Nation--and \nthe world. How can farmers and ranchers plan for the next year's crop \nnot knowing what programs will be in place?\n  It is time for Congress to act on a new farm bill--one that promoted \ncompetitiveness and consumer choice, while providing adequate income to \nfarmers.\n  This fall, I wrote to Chairman Harkin outlining my priorities for the \nfarm bill.\n  I shared with him the recommendations I have heard from farmers \nacross Missouri. I am pleased so many of these ideas were included in \nthe bill reported by the committee.\n  First and foremost, this farm bill recognizes the need for a safety \nnet. The safety net is counter-cyclical--to give farmers assistance \nwhen they need it the most. It will buffer our farm economy in \ndifficult times, and allow small producers to stay in business.\n  The bill also allows producers to update the baseline acreage used to \ncalculate these payments, to ensure they reflect the realities of \ntoday.\n  Earlier this year I proposed legislation to expand tax credits and \nother incentives to promote ethanol, soy-diesel, and other value-added \nproducts.\n  I am pleased that this new farm includes an energy title that will \nharness the potential of these clean, renewable fuels.\n  They provide valuable economic development, they give farmers a \ngreater market for their product, they cut pollution and they decrease \nour reliance on foreign oil.\n  I applaud Chairman Harkin and the committee for crafting a farm bill \nthat strongly encourage the continued development of biofuels. I hope \namendments will be added that will further promote the use of these \nfuels.\n  The farm bill passed by the Agriculture Committee makes a historic \ncommitment to conservation. It allocates $20 billion over the next 10 \nyears in new spending for conservation programs. That is $5 billion \nmore than the House passed, and we need every penny.\n  The farm bill would invest almost $750 million in conservation \nefforts for Missouri over the next 5 years.\n  The bill protects the property rights of landowners. It encourages \nproducers to remove sensitive land from agricultural production. It \nalso offers incentives for continuing conservation practices and \nadopting new ones. If offers technical assistance for farmers and \nranchers. It gives greater opportunities for private landowners to \nvoluntarily expand conservation on forested lands. And it provides \nlivestock producers with resources to build waste management systems.\n  I also believe we need country-of-origin labeling, as called for \nunder this legislation. America's farmers grow the best products. They \nare the most efficient. They sue chemicals that are proven to be safe. \nAnd they live by the strictest environmental standards in the world.\n  I believe consumers, if given the option, would choose American \nproducts every time.\n  Now more than ever, Americans are concerned about food security. They \nwant to know where their food is coming from. Country-of-origin \nlabeling would not only help our livestock producers, but would also \nassure consumers that the products that they buy are safe.\n  We need measures to help rural America and help the family farm stay \nin business. Missouri farmers have urged me to assist them in efforts \nto revitalize rural communities and promote economic development. Rural \nAmerica needs improved drinking water, telecommunications, and other \ninfrastructure. This bill provides funding to address many of these \nneeds.\n  And it increases access to capital for rural business ventures, \nparticular equity capital.\n  I am particularly concerned about our young farmers who need \nfinancing to begin farming or to stay in the business.\n  Under this bill, the Direct Loan Farm Service Agency Program of the \nFarm Service Agency will be strengthened to assist these young \nproducers.\n  In addition, a new farm bill must include a strong nutrition title. \nWe must provide the Food Stamp Program with the resources it needs. We \ncannot abandon families who have been hit hard by the recession, or \nthose struggling to move from welfare to work.\n  Chairman Harkin's bill invests more than $6 billion in this important \ntitle. The House bill provides only half that. But with so many people \nout of work, so many children going hungry, we need the full amount.\n  Chairman Harkin's nutrition title will make the Food Stamp Program \nwork better for the people it serves. It makes the process of applying \nfor food stamp benefits more efficient. It helps families moving from \nwelfare to work by extending transitional benefits. It restores the \nvalue of food stamps to help poorer families keep up with inflation. \nThese changes will mean a great deal to those who are struggling with \nthe essentials of daily life.\n  One deficiency of this bill is that it does not address the issue of \ncompetition. There is a growing problem of vertical integration and \nconcentration among agribusiness firms. The small family farm is \nbecoming an endangered species, and that's just not right.\n  We need a strong competition title to maximize consumer choices. We \nmust facilitate farmers' choices in marketing products and meaningful \nprice competition.\n  I hope that over the course of the next few days, this bill can be \nimproved with a competition title that will ensure we have a vibrant \nfarm economy.\n  Mr. President, this farm bill isn't perfect, but it makes sense for \nMissouri's farmers. And it makes sense for America. It expands markets. \nIt protects the environment. It is fair to small family farmers. And, \nmost importantly, it provides a safety net when farmers need help.\n  Fundamentally, this bill is about ensuring that the hardworking men \nand women who produce the food that feeds the world can earn a decent \nliving. These farmers deserve our full support.\n  Once again I thank the chairman and the committee, and I hope the \nSenate will act quickly on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Harkin). The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S13251]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Enzi, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2604.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To apply the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921, to livestock \n production contracts and to provide parties to the contract the right \n           to discuss the contract with certain individuals)\n\n       On page 941, strike line 5 and insert the following:\n\n                     Subtitle C--General Provisions\n\n     SEC. 1021.

I send this amendment on behalf of myself, Senators \nGrassley, Feingold, Wellstone, and Enzi. I will just take a few minutes \nto describe it because I know Senator Cochran and Senator Roberts are \nwaiting to speak.\n  With this amendment, I would like to continue on one of the important \nthemes I have stressed throughout the farm bill debate, competition \nissues in agriculture. In fact, the occupant of the chair, the Senator \nfrom Missouri, spoke about that a few minutes ago, about needing better \ncompetition in agriculture.\n  We had a competition title in the original farm bill. I thought it \nwas extremely important. That was defeated but for one provision, \ncountry of origin labeling. That succeeded on an independent vote in \ncommittee, but the rest of the title did not make it through committee.\n  Some of us vowed to resurrect a number of provisions on the floor, \nnot the whole title but a number of key provisions that were in the \ncompetition title. Beyond the amendment I speak about, two amendments \nwere agreed to yesterday which I cosponsored. Senator Feingold \nintroduced an amendment which prohibits forced arbitration in livestock \nand poultry contracts. That amendment was adopted. After that, Senator \nJohnson from South Dakota offered an amendment that prohibited the \nownership of livestock by packers. That amendment was adopted.\n  The amendment I offer today will address one more issue in the \ncompetition arena and that is livestock production contracts and the \nright of a farmer to discuss those contracts with his closest advisers.\n  As I said, the cosponsors are Senators Grassley, Feingold, Wellstone, \nand Enzi. The American Farm Bureau, National Farmers Union, as well as \ndozens of other farm, community, and religious organizations, support \nthe amendment. And for good reasons. Farmers are concerned about \ncompetition.\n  A 1999 Iowa State Extension Service Rural Life poll indicated that 89 \npercent of Iowa farmers thought there was too much power concentrated \nin the hands of a few large agribusiness firms. A similar poll recently \nreleased by Kansas State University that targeted 27 farm and ranch \nStates found that 77 percent of producers favor maintaining or \nstrengthening current antitrust laws.\n  To address just a small part of that concern, the amendment I \nintroduced today will provide some minimal protections to livestock \nproduction contract growers. The amendment does two things. First, it \ncloses a significant loophole in the Packers and Stockyards Act.\n  Presently, the act protects farmers who sell livestock to packers. \nThe Packers and Stockyards Act also protects those who grow poultry for \nothers under production contracts. That was adopted in 1935. So since \n1935, it has applied to production contracts in poultry. But the act \ndoes not protect those who raise livestock under production contracts \nfor packers in other areas, such as for swine and cattle.\n\n  Again, in 1935 production contracts were not a big issue in \nlivestock. It was a whole different world at that time. Since that time \nwe have seen the growth of production contracts, both in hogs and now \nextending into cattle. The amendment would close this loophole so \nfarmers who raise livestock under production contracts will be \nprotected by the prohibitions against unfair and deceptive practices \nunder the Packers and Stockyards Act.\n  Second, the amendment will allow a producer to share his or her \ncontract information with their business adviser, landlord, executive \nor manager, attorney, family, and State and Federal agencies charged \nwith protecting parties to the contract. I understand in some States \nfarmers already have some of these rights, but many farmers tell me \nthey feel intimidated to share their contracts with even their trusted \nadvisers, with their banker. That is because the contract specifically \nsays that none of the terms of the contract are to be discussed with \nanyone else. So the farmer feels very intimidated about discussing \nthat--and, frankly, could face either a lawsuit or the loss of the \ncontract if, in fact, that farmer does discuss that with an with a \nbanker.\n  Again, as I have said, the first part deals with production \ncontracting. Right now these arrangements--production contracting \narrangements--are like a franchisee-franchiser relationship. It is \nbecoming more prevalent in hogs and growing in the cattle industry.\n\n[[Page S13252]]\n\n  When we passed the Packers and Stockyards Act in 1921, the industry \nwas different. Livestock was owned by the farmers. They took it to the \nstockyards. The packers bought the livestock at the stockyards. That is \nwhy we passed the 1921 Packers and Stockyards Act, because the packers \nand stockyard owners were collaborating and conspiring to drive down \nprices for farmers. So Congress passed the Packers and Stockyards Act \nto prohibit these unfair practices in 1921.\n  The act currently addresses relationships only between packers and \nthose who sell livestock to packers. It does not address production \ncontracts. Right now, as I said, more and more of these production \ncontracts are becoming common.\n  An Iowa State study indicates that 34 percent of the hogs in America \nare raised under production contracts. Current law does not address \nthis current situation, and this amendment closes that loophole and \nprovides protection to livestock production contract growers.\n  Again, because of their relatively weak bargaining position, farmers \nfeel intimidated under these contracts. The amendment would \nspecifically limit livestock contractors from engaging in unfair, \ndeceptive, and unjustly discriminatory practices, section 202 of the \nPackers and Stockyards Act; and second, it gives the farmers the right \nto discuss terms of their contract with certain people: a legal \nadviser, a lender, an accountant, an executive or manager, a landlord, \na family member, or a Federal or State agency with responsibility for \nenforcing a statute designed to protect the party to the contract.\n  Importantly, this amendment doesn't require anyone to share any \ninformation. It doesn't require that the contract be made public in any \nway. It does not affect the confidentiality clauses that state farmer \ncan't share the information with a neighbor, or with the contractor's \ncompetitors. They can still do that. It is important to note the \ndistinction.\n  Again, this amendment takes a couple of small steps to protect \nfarmers against unfair and deceptive conduct in the livestock and \npoultry contracting business.\n  It will provide some protection for these growers and bring them more \nin line with the poultry growers since 1935. They have had this \nprotection since 1935. It is time now to extend it to our cattle and to \nour swine producers and other livestock producers in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the pending \nlegislation and the responsibility that we have in the Senate to \ncarefully craft our Nation's future farm program policy. Note that I \nsaid ``carefully craft.''\n  In doing so, I am being joined by the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi, my good friend and colleague, the former chairman of the \nsubcommittee on appropriations for agriculture on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, Thad Cochran. I do not know of any Senator in \nthe Senate who has been more of a champion for our farmers and ranchers \nthroughout our country. We refer to him as ``our banker'' on the \nAppropriations Committee, who has the tremendous responsibility and \ndoes it so well in making sure we meet our budget guidelines while also \nensuring the needed investments we must make in agriculture.\n  I feel quite honored and privileged to have him as a coauthor of the \nalternative amendment to the bill pending in regard to farm program \npolicy.\n  I also thank his staff, Mr. Hunter Moorhead, who has worked extremely \nhard many hours; and my two staffers, Mike Seyfert, who is sitting to \nmy right, and I would like to let his wife Christy know he is here. He \nhas been by my side early morning, day, and night for the past week. I \nwant to let her know he is really doing fine. Matt Howe, who is sitting \nin the back, has helped me tremendously. We are only as good as our \nstaff.\n  We think we have come up with a positive alternative with the current \nlegislation which makes a great deal of sense. I thank Thad Cochran for \nhis leadership and help and for being a coauthor on this amendment.\n  This legislation directly affects the daily life and well-being  of \nevery citizen in America and many throughout a very troubled and hungry \nworld. You can't read the headlines about Afghanistan and not realize \nthere is a humanitarian effort now taking place with many \norganizations. That effort is made possible by the food which is \nproduced in this country going to our troubled and hungry world--and \nthe modern miracle of productivity of American agriculture.\n\n  But more particularly, this legislation directly affects the \nlivelihood of America's farm families, those who persevere and prevail \ndespite all sorts of obstacles not of their own making and things \nbeyond their control. Yet despite the tough times, they feed us and \nthose in need, and their record of productivity is, indeed, a modern \nmiracle.\n  So here we are, my colleagues, on a Friday morning with several \nSenators present. We have had quite a debate over the last 3 or 4 days \non yet another farm bill.\n  Counting the years I have been here as a staff member, a Member of \nthe House, and a Member of the Senate, this is my sixth farm bill. I \ncan recall the former esteemed chairman of the House Agriculture \nCommittee, the venerable Bob Poage of Texas who used to describe farm \nbills in this way:\n\n       My colleagues, is this the best possible farm bill? He \n     would say:\n       No, but it is the best farm bill possible.\n\n  There is a difference.\n  That is usually the way legislation works as we try to reach a \ncompromise and pass the ``best bill possible.''\n  We need to certainly do that this time around. Our Nation's farmers \nand ranchers remain in the midst of very difficult times. We are not in \nvery good shape in regard to farm country.\n  The challenges that we face today in the domestic and global \nmarketplace and the revolutionary times we face today in agriculture \nare certainly unique.\n  I had hoped we could carefully craft a bipartisan bill and pass it \nout of the Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  As a reminder, we did that in achieving significant crop insurance \nreform just a session ago. It took 18 months. That bill was coauthored \nby myself and Senator Bob Kerrey, the former Senator of Nebraska. In \nfact, we have had more interest in that particular bill than almost any \nbill I have been associated with since I have had the privilege of \npublic office.\n  In farm country, if you call a meeting of farmers, and if I happen to \nbe the speaker, there may be 30, 50, or 100 farmers present, depending \non where you call a meeting. With crop insurance, you will have 1,000.\n  Those of us who are privileged to serve American agriculture are very \nmuch aware of the fact that we have a very disparate and independent \nbunch of farmers and ranchers. We know they are in much better hands if \nwe work together, if the agriculture posse tries to ride in the same \ndirection, more or less, despite our differences.\n  I regret to report to you, Mr. President, and my colleagues and our \nfarmers and ranchers, that I don't think that is the case today. We, \nunfortunately, are at odds both in terms of policy, and some would even \nallege there is just a tad bit of politics being played in this year's \nfarm bill deliberations. That is not only too bad, but it is downright \ncounterproductive. In fact, in Dodge City we say it is ``a dirty \nshame.''\n  For the record, I thank the chairman of the committee. I thank him \nfor asking my advice and for meeting with me and my staff to see if we \ncould reach an accord on a bipartisan bill.\n  We just had a discussion to see if there was some way we could work \nthis out. I hope we can. The chairman, his staff and mine met for \nseveral hours in private discussions. I believe we made some real \nprogress toward a bipartisan proposal that could, and I think would, \nhave garnered support of the majority of members on both sides of the \ncommittee.\n  Certainly the Harkin-Roberts bill would have caused some double takes \nand some jaw dropping on the part of a few veteran farm bill watchers. \nI am sure of that. I sincerely appreciate the effort by the chairman, \nwho is a good colleague and a friend.\n  The key was in the mailbox, according to that old Country Western \nsong. And he said: Come on in. Let us work something out.\n\n[[Page S13253]]\n\n  We left town Friday before Veteran's Day, and I believe some progress \nwas being made. Unfortunately, something happened during the weekend. \nWhen we returned the following week, both the key and the mailbox were \nmissing, and we were told to plan immediately for a very different bill \nand some different marching orders.\n  I remember an old television program called ``Name That Tune.'' They \nwould listen to the song on the record. Then two people would race down \nthe corridor and grab onto something, and say: I can name that tune in \nabout 3 seconds. I guess that is sort of dating myself. Unfortunately, \nwith regard to the new committee bill, others have named the tune--more \nparticularly, leadership--and there was a new game. It was called \n``Name Your Price''--a game that is still in progress, by the way.\n  The end result was a bill that is now going back to loan rates and \ntarget prices as income protection. And the committee bill was passed \non a party-line vote.\n  Now, I do not question the intent of people who truly believe we \nought to go back to loan rates and higher target prices. I just think \nthat is not the way we ought to go. I think we have a better \nalternative. I do not question the intent of my colleagues. But I do \nquestion the process and the policy, and both, in my view, are \ncounterproductive. That is about the nicest way I can put it.\n  It is one thing, my colleagues, to decide you are going to do a \npartisan bill, but it is another to deny the minority of the right to \nreview the language of the bill and, as a result, the right to debate \nin an effort to, once again, carefully craft policy that will better \nenable the farmer and the rancher and the consumer to survive the fast-\nchanging and dynamic environment in today's agriculture.\n  Just when farmers and ranchers need new tools and new policy, and a \nnew reality check, the committee is playing the lead role in ``Back to \nthe Future.''\n  My colleagues, we did not even receive a final copy of the commodity \ntitle of this bill until 1 o'clock a.m. on the same morning of the \nmarkup. Now, that alone is ludicrous and a black mark on the committee. \nFor those of us who have no offices to work from--I am one of those who \nis a Member of the ever-increasingly disgusted ``Hart Homeless Bunch'' \nwhere we do not have an office, no access to files, limited access to \ncomputers, limited access to telephones, and limited access to e-mail \ndue to closure of the Hart Building--the situation was impossible. One \no'clock in the morning we got the mark.\n  Markup on the committee bill started at 8:30. I was still trying to \nwrite my statement to summarize my concerns at 8:47. I noted it on the \nclock. Staff had not even had time to read the bill, let alone \ncarefully craft a substitute with Senator Cochran, which we finally \ndid. I mentioned before, I have been through six farm bills and some \npretty tough debates with strong differences of opinion, but at least I \nknew, or staff knew, what was in the bill.\n\n  Now, there is more than one way to ``skin the minority cat'' than to \nput his head in a bootjack and pull on his tail. That is no way to run \na committee. Certainly, that was not the way it was done when our \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Lugar, was chairman.\n  I understand that maybe I am erring on the side of being too harsh. \nMaybe this effort to lock up $73 billion for agriculture over 10 years, \nin a 5-year farm bill, to meet the requirements of an already outdated \nand unrealistic budget and to accommodate the party leadership and old \npartisan constituencies, and to satisfy the insatiable needs of \ndifferent commodity groups and farm organizations and your same party \ncolleagues, was just too overwhelming. I don't know. It is a daunting \ntask. It is a tremendously daunting task. I know; I have been there. \nAnd I sympathize and I empathize.\n  This task must be overwhelming, Mr. President, because the show is \nstill going on. I would like to say last-minute major policy changes \nstopped when the bill passed the committee, but it did not. This bill \nis probably about 1,000 pages. I meant to have a copy of the bill to \nsee if I could lift it, but I am not going to go through that.\n  Staff reports just a small $15 billion scoring problem with the dairy \nsection of the committee-passed bill, something that may be of interest \nto the Presiding Officer. The answer was a ``technical correction'' \nthat solved the problem that completely changed the content of the \nlanguage in the dairy section. Now, that is quite a technical \ncorrection.\n  When we have the final bill language for floor debate and action, and \nwade through it, we not only find dramatic changes to the dairy title, \nbut significant changes to the conservation title as well. It is like \nTopsy; it tends to grow with each passing day and each passing vote.\n  Mr. President, so much for process. After all, fair and reasonable \ndeliberation is in the eyes of the beholder. Process does not mean much \nto the producer down at the feedlot or the country elevator or the \ncoffee clatch. But, by golly, policy does. Policy sure counts. It \ncounts because it directly affects the farmer's pocketbook and his \nfuture.\n  Today, as I said before, we are not in very good shape. I do not \ncriticize this bill because of intent or even the politics of bringing \nback outdated farm program policies simply because it is in the \ncalcified bones of its authors and supporters. We all have our \nprejudices. I criticize this bill because I think it will be \ncounterproductive, because I do not think it is going to work, that it \nwill take us back to policy that does not fit today, and it will \nincrease additional farm assistance in the future. At the same time, \nthrough its use of front loading of spending and budget manipulation, \nthe bill mortgages what we call future baseline or our ability to write \nfuture farm bills.\n  Latest figures: $45.2 billion over 5 years in regard to the Daschle-\nHarkin bill. That leaves $28.3 billion for the second 5 years. \nBasically, if we do this, we have eliminated much of the baseline in \nthe outyears. We need to find $16.9 billion when we write the next bill \njust to get back to this first 5-year level. We are mortgaging our farm \nbill future.\n\n  There are also two other considerations of no small notice. In its \ncurrent and ever-changing form, it will be almost impossible to \nconference with the House. The President opposes it. The administration \nopposes this. They have a statement of administration policy opposing \nthis. More about that just a little bit later.\n  Let me spell it out. The bill before us takes us back to past farm \nprogram policies of trying to provide income protection with higher \nloan rates and target prices. Now, there is no question that the farmer \nneeds income protection with all the variables that he has to face and \nall that has gone on that is not talked about much in regard to critics \nof agriculture spending: the loss of the Asian market, the value of the \ndollar, different buying patterns, the European Union spending \nincredible amounts of money, and on and on and on, a glut all across \nthe world in regard to commodities, which is unprecedented. Not many \npeople really take a look at that when they try to criticize the farm \nprogram policies that are spelled out either by the distinguished \nchairman or by Senator Cochran and myself.\n  At the same time, it pays for higher loan rates and target prices by \nphasing out direct payments to the farmer and by cutting some $2 \nbillion from the bipartisan crop insurance reforms we passed last year. \nNow, I am not happy about that. We spent 18 months putting together \ncrop insurance reform as one of the tools that we promised when we \npassed the Freedom to Farm bill. The Freedom to Farm bill was passed on \none side. And then there were about six other promises that we made to \ntry to complement that bill.\n  No farm bill by itself can do what we all want to do on behalf of the \nAmerican farmer. It took 3 years to pass the crop insurance reform. \nHere we find that we are virtually phasing out direct payments. In \norder to pay a higher loan rate and target prices, we are cutting $2 \nbillion from the crop insurance reform we passed last year. That is \nwrong.\n  This business is supposed to provide a better safety net again by \nphasing out direct safety net payments and cutting crop insurance, the \none program we have passed in the last years that prompted an \noverwhelmingly positive response from farmers.\n\n[[Page S13254]]\n\n  I want to restate that. I do not think I can restate it too many \ntimes. The bill takes money from a bipartisan reform bill passed last \nyear to pay for a ``scheme''--that is not a nice word --a plan that is \nshaping up to be a party-line battle. I do not think that is progress.\n  Now, my friends, we have been down this road before, and it did not \nwork. Some continue to insist that higher loan rates will mean more \nsafety net protection for producers and will prop up prices. I know \nthat. I have listened to that argument during six farm bills. It is an \nold argument. It is a good argument, but it is a misconception, in my \nview.\n  First, our farmers only receive a payment under the marketing loan \nprogram, the loan program, if the market price is below the loan level \nand if the farmer actually produces a crop. If the producer does not \nhave a crop to harvest, if there is a crop failure, of which we have \nmany--that is why the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, in his \nrole on the Appropriations Committee, steps forward year after year, to \nmake ends meet--when farmers suffer from crop failures, all across the \ncountry, guess what. Then there is no payment. So the loan rate really \ndoes not provide any income protection for a farmer who does not have a \ncrop. When he needs it the most, the assistance is not there.\n  Second, under the target price proposal, which, by the way, does not \ntake place until 2004--until 2004--farm prices have to be below the \ntarget price level to receive a payment.\n  The problem is, crop failures often result in reduced supplies that \ncause high prices above the target price. That occurred in Kansas in \n1988 and then 1993. In 1995 there was a freeze, a drought. Again, a \nproducer may have no crop, and if prices rise because of decreased \nproduction and supplies because of crop failures, there may well not be \nthe so-called target price countercyclical payment.\n  Go through the history of past crop failures where they occurred, \ncount the bad years. It is possible that a farmer could have no crop to \nharvest, still receive no assistance through the loan deficiency \nprogram and the so-called countercyclical programs in the committee \nbill. If that happens --and I hope it doesn't--does anybody here \nbelieve those producers and their farm organizations will not be back \nasking for additional emergency assistance or, for that matter, a \nhigher loan rate or target price? It has happened before.\n  I remember the late 1970s, the American Agricultural Movement came to \nWashington. Was that an experience. As a result, we simply increased \nthe target price from $2.41 to $2.90. I think that was what it was. The \ndistinguished chairman of the committee at that particular time was \nAmbassador Tom Foley, Speaker Foley, from the State of Washington.\n  What happens is, we simply increase the loan rate or the target \nprice. That is not a safety net. Relying on loan rates and target \nprices under those circumstances is not a safety net. It is a hammer. I \nthink the farmer prefers the safety net.\n  All of the uncertainty and unfair competition and lack of an \naggressive, consistent trade and export policy is why we moved away \nfrom the higher loan rates and target prices and provided a guaranteed \ndirect payment that the producers and their lenders--don't forget the \nlenders--could count on every year, especially when they suffered a \ncrop loss.\n  We made a deal. We made a contract. We even had a colloquy on the \nHouse floor. Is this a contract? Can't take it away? No. And we wrapped \nup what we thought was a reasonable investment in regards to farmers \nand farm programs only to face unbelievable changes about two crop-\nyears after that, and we had to move to some emergency help. Even that \nwas under the rubric or the architecture of the 1996 act.\n  Again, I am very concerned that the proposal before the Senate \nbasically pays for higher loan rates and target prices through a \nvirtual phaseout of these payments by 2006. This is the wrong way to \ngo. We do not think we should take away a payment our farmers and \nlenders can bank on--no pun intended--when they are drawing up \noperating plans for each crop-year.\n  We also need to remind everyone that the commodity title before us \ntoday tends to be less environmentally and conservation friendly than \nthe proposal Senator Cochran and I will put forward. Ours is the better \nbill in this regard because it is not coupled to production. That is a \nbig difference. When you have a payment program that is more dependent \non actual production, there is a greater incentive to farm fragile land \nand use excessive chemicals and pesticides to improve yields. That is \nwhy the 1996 act was the most favorable to the environment passed up to \nthat date.\n  This bill, with some differences in conservation, will have that as a \nhallmark. I do credit the chairman of the committee for focusing on \nconservation. But if you couple production and your payments, that is \nwhat will happen under the committee-passed proposal. Here again, we go \nback to the future.\n  In addition, we made a conscious decision between two basic choices \nwhen we wrote the last farm bill. We could continue on a course of \nmicromanaged planting and marketing restrictions that have often put \nour producers at a competitive disadvantage in the world market, or we \ncould pursue a course that would eliminate these restrictions and allow \nfarmers to make their own planting decisions based on domestic and \nworld market demands, while also receiving guaranteed levels of \ntransition payments.\n\n  That, in fact, was the primary purpose, the primary goal of the 1996 \nact and the much maligned Freedom to Farm bill. It was not to take the \nGovernment payments and transition them and march the farmer off the \ncliff when the free market does not exist. It was, in fact, to give \nmore decision making power and decisions to the farmer and, with that \nflexibility, as I have indicated, five or six other initiatives: Tax \npolicy changes, crop insurance reform, regulatory reform, aggressive \ntrade policy, and sanctions reform. We might have been a little naive \nin thinking we could accomplish this, but I would hope we could \naccomplish this prior to consideration of the next farm bill. That was \nthe goal.\n  Before these changes, farmers used to put the seed in the ground \naccording to dictates issued by the Department of Agriculture. It was \nwhat I called a command-and-control farm program policy. We lined up \noutside the ASCS office, now the FSA office, walked in and talked to \nAunt Harriet. She made out all the paperwork and forms. And you set \naside this ground and then you waited on Washington to figure out how \nmuch you had to set aside and what you could plant, when you could \nplant it. We were paying farmers for not growing anything. We lost \nmarket share. We used to have 24 percent of the world market share in \nterms of global exports. Now we are down to about 18. Guess who is 17? \nThe European Union. Guess who is going to be 18 next year and we will \nbe 17, if we pass this bill? The United States. That is not right. That \nwas a dead-end street.\n  We are pleased that whatever proposal will be before us does at least \nmaintain the planting flexibility. At least we did retain that. But we \nare also concerned that because of the increased focus on loan rates \nand target prices, we may end up with budget exposures that will force \nus back to set-asides and supply management--it would be an easy thing \nto do--in order to avoid excessive budget costs. Then we are really \nback to the future. That would be one of the most counterproductive \nthings we could do for U.S. agriculture which must compete in a global \nmarketplace. We may not like it, but that is the way it is.\n  Furthermore, since the committee bill or the substitute's basic tenet \nis raising loan rates, let me reflect for a moment on what the purpose \nof a loan rate is. This seems to be the nexus of the dispute between \nthe two bills. Is the loan rate a market clearing device, or is it \nprice support? I don't think it can be both. If we set the price at $3 \non wheat and $2.08 on corn--and you could do the corresponding number \nwith other crops--it very well may become a ceiling on price.\n  We also understand the belief among many Members and some producers \nthat a higher loan rate is a greater incentive to put the crop in \nstorage and simply wait for a higher price. That is the alleged goal of \nthe loan program.\n  The question is, Would that result in a greater income for farmers, \nor does it\n\n[[Page S13255]]\n\nmean that they will simply pay higher storage and interests costs that \nwould more than offset any increase in the loan rate? We have to ask \nourselves what raising loan rates does for those producers who again \nsuffer no crops and disaster.\n  We are well aware of the problems our friends in the northern plains \nhave faced in the form of floods and blizzards, crop disease in recent \nyears. Time and time and time and time and time again, with chart after \nchart after chart, we have seen our distinguished colleagues and \nfriends across the aisle come down to the floor, 4 years, 5 years, 6 \nyears, 7 years straight, and talk to us about the blizzards and the \nintemperate weather, the infestation, and goodness knows what else. \nThese are regional weather problems that would have occurred regardless \nof the farm policy we put in place.\n  I grieve for those farmers. I empathize with those farmers. We have \nthat in high-risk country in Kansas as well; not to that extent, but at \nleast we know what they are talking about. Can we guarantee that higher \nloan rates would have done anything for these producers because they \nhad nothing to harvest? The answer is no. They wouldn't have gotten a \npayment without the crop under higher loan rates. So does it make sense \nto spend $73.5 billion on a new policy that won't provide assistance to \nproducers when they need it?\n  It is because of these concerns that Senator Cochran and I are \noffering our amendment to this legislation. Our bill is the only one of \nthese two proposals that is, No. 1, nonmarket or production distorting.\n  No. 2, it provides a guaranteed direct payment to producers when they \nsuffer a crop loss, when they need it the most.\n  No. 3, it provides a new, innovative approach to a countercyclical \nprogram, which I will describe in a moment.\n  No. 4, it creates a stronger footing for our international trade \nnegotiators by enhancing the level of green box support we are \nproviding to our producers.\n  Let me stop for a minute and indicate that on the Daschle-Harkin bill \nwe have been warned by the administration that box may not be amber, it \nmay be red. We can get to the cutoff very quickly. If we are successful \nin the WTO negotiations--and I don't know if we will be or not--it \ncould conceivably result in the WTO really taking us into the \nproceedings where the United States government and the Secretary of \nAgriculture would have to come back to our producers and ask them to \ngive money back. Senator Grassley has a bill to address that, and it is \na very important bill. I can't imagine it would come to that, but why \ngo down that road to begin with?\n  So certainly, this bill doesn't have that problem because you are in \nthe green box, not the amber box. Those are the boxes we define as to \nwhether you are WTO legal or whether you are working out an \ninternational trade agreement with which you can work.\n  No. 5, let me say this is supported by the administration, supported \nby the President, and can be conferenced. All these groups and \ncommodity organizations that have come in here and written letter after \nletter saying ``move the bill,'' if you want to move the bill, that can \nbe conferenced with the House Agriculture Committee, pass Cochran-\nRoberts, and it can be signed into law this year.\n  I think our approach is clearly the better way to go as it provides a \ndirect payment that reflects the unique and very difficult times we \nface in agriculture today. As I have said probably 10 times--and now I \nwill say it for the 11th--it ensures that our producers will get \nassistance when they need it the most, when they have no crop to \nharvest.\n  While our colleagues across the aisle have looked to the past in \ncreating their countercyclical program, we have looked to the future. \nThis is a unique program. It would ask the farmers and ranchers to pay \na little attention. We have proposed the creation of a farm savings \naccount, set up by a producer, in conjunction with the Department of \nAgriculture, at the bank of the producer's choosing.\n  Under our proposal, a producer can place a portion of their yearly \nearnings into a farm savings account. The Secretary of Agriculture will \nthen provide a matching contribution of up to $10,000, which will be \nbased on the producer's level of contribution and the total number of \nproducers who participate in the program.\n  The total level of funding in the account at any one time cannot \nexceed 150 percent of a producer's 5-year average adjusted gross \nrevenue. In addition, a producer can only pull funds out of the account \nin two instances: No. 1, when his or her adjusted gross revenue for the \nyear falls below 90 percent of their 5-year adjusted gross revenue, or \nwhen the producer retires.\n  By putting in these withdrawal triggers, we are setting up a \ncountercyclical program that will only be triggered when an individual \nproducer's gross revenues fall below their historical levels. Thus, it \nbecomes truly a countercyclical program that guarantees that a small, \nor regional, crop loss will not prohibit producers from obtaining \nassistance when they need it the most. Under the committee proposal, \nand the substitute--a thousand pages or more--producers may not receive \nassistance, again, when they need it the most.\n\n  There are three additional important points we want to make regarding \nthis farm savings account. I want to make sure our colleagues \nunderstand this.\n  First, participation is voluntary. A producer only participates if he \nwants to, but the incentive is that they will receive a matching \npayment from the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Second, specialty crop and livestock producers are eligible for this \nproposal. How many times have we heard the livestock producer and those \nwho represent specialty crop producers--more especially from the \nNortheast--complain that the farm program left them out? That is not \nthe case here. The producers of fruits, vegetables, forestry, and \nlivestock are all eligible to receive matching payments from the \nSecretary. Ours is the only proposal that will provide assistance \ndirectly to specialty crop producers.\n  While the proposal across the aisle provides for specialty crop \ncommodity purchases, where most of the funding goes to large \ncooperatives or businesses, ours goes directly into the hands of the \nspecialty crop producers.\n  Finally, we want to clear up some false statements that have been put \nforward regarding our savings accounts. They are not tax provisions. \nThese are not tax-deferred accounts as have been proposed in separate \nlegislation in this and previous Congresses--I am for those, by the \nway. However, they can earn interest at a rate determined by the bank \nwhere the account is established.\n  Mr. President, the choice between the two proposals could not be \nclearer on the commodity titles, as I have demonstrated. The proposal \nput forward by the committee takes us back to the policies of the past \nwhile our proposal looks to the future and is more consistent with the \nbipartisan proposal passed in the House that largely maintains current \nloan rates and provides reasonable direct payments to our producers.\n  We also have serious concerns with the proposed conservation title. \nIt has been changed considerably from what passed the committee, and, \nin an effort to attract votes, it is dangerously mortgaging future farm \nbills by taking funds from the budget baseline in the years beyond the \n5-year length of this proposed farm bill. I already referred to that in \nterms of the one figure, $45.2 billion over 5 years, leaving only $28.3 \nbillion for the second 5 years. So that is what we are talking about.\n  Specifically, they are jeopardizing the future of some of our most \npopular and successful environmental programs, including the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program--EQIP--Wetlands Reserve \nProgram, Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, and the Farmland \nProtection Program.\n  Their proposal frontloads funding for these programs and then \nprovides for draconian reductions in the baseline for 2006 through \n2011. At the same time, it greatly increases funding for something \ncalled the Conservation Security Act. That is a new, interesting, but \nuntested program in 2006 through 2011.\n  I don't argue that the Conservation Security Act's goal of providing \nconservation incentives on working lands is not a good one. It is a \ngood one. In fact, in our alternative we set aside a portion of our \nEQIP funds for activities\n\n[[Page S13256]]\n\non working lands. But I don't think it would be right, and I think it \nwould be a critical and unfortunate mistake, to eliminate the future of \nmany of the successful programs I just mentioned in 2006 and beyond \nand, instead, stake our conservation success on an untested program.\n  We also remind colleagues that those programs that would face the \nmost severe cuts and restrictions in the outyears are those that most \ndirectly impact wildlife, livestock, and dairy producers.\n  Is this really the way we want to go? Senator Cochran and I don't \nbelieve so. That is why you see a significant investment in current \nconservation programs and the ramping up of these conservation programs \nin our bill. We gradually increase funding for the popular programs \nthat farmers now enjoy and participate in over 5 years for all of the \nspecific purposes that certainly are commensurate with the worth of the \nprograms.\n  Let me say that we are not trying in this effort to point out the \ndifferences between the bills, to create a partisan fight in response \nto what happened regarding the process of the debate. We are simply \nputting forward what we believe is better policy and a more responsible \nuse of the funds available to it.\n  The time is short in this session of Congress, and even shorter as we \nspeak today on Friday. If we are serious about really finishing the \nfarm bill this year, we should pass our proposal, which is very similar \nto the bipartisan bill passed by the House and, again, which could be \nconferenced with that bill in a matter of days.\n  Our alternative does not slow the process. Some are trying to say we \nare slowing down the process. We point out that all the other titles of \nthe substitute proposal--Senator Cochran and I sat down and looked at \neach and every one of them--we put forth are very similar to those \ntitles passed by the Agriculture Committee. We do not have a quarrel \nwith those. We do not have any dispute.\n  Except for shifting some money from mandatory to discretionary and \neliminating the partisan use of crop insurance reform funding as an \noffset, we have largely left those titles intact. We agree with many of \nthe principles that are contained within these titles. As I said, there \nis no dispute.\n  We always try to pass the best possible bill when we are considering \nfarm bills. I do not believe the underlying bill is the best we can do. \nIt is not time to reinvent the wheel and go back to the policies of the \npast. We are at another one of those historical crossroads in \nagricultural program policy. We can look forward or we can look back. \nWe can choose to return to the failed policies of the past and put our \nfarmers and ranchers at a competitive disadvantage on the world market \nat the same time our dependence on the world market actually continues \nto increase, or we can take the necessary steps to provide our \nproducers and trade negotiators with the tools necessary to open \nforeign markets and meet the demands of the world market.\n  The critics of our proposal have in past years stated on the Senate \nfloor that one day we will wake up and discover that we are no longer \nthe leader in agricultural exports. I just mentioned that we are about \n18 percent in all of the commodity exports globally. The EU is 17, and \nthe trend is not good. It is just like we lost the market in regard to \nautomobiles. It is interesting to note that many of the pitfalls \nsuffered by the U.S. auto industry in the seventies and early eighties \nwere based on an unwillingness to change policies and adapt to the \ndesires of the consumer market.\n  Could there be a similar effect for agriculture if we proceed with \nthe proposal that is put forward by the committee and continue down the \npath of programs that will make us uncompetitive in world markets and \nhamper our bargaining power at the WTO negotiating table?\n  My colleagues are correct. The choices we make today and in the next \nfew months will affect the future of agriculture in the United States. \nMy hope is that we will continue to look, with our producers, toward \nthe future, as I have indicated, and not in the rear-view mirror and at \nthe broken policies of the past.\n  I have a letter that was addressed to the Honorable Tom Daschle, \nmajority leader of the Senate, and the Honorable Trent Lott, the \nminority leader, from quite a few commodity groups and farm \norganizations urging progress on the farm bill so we can get it done \nthis year.\n  I emphasize again that I want the best possible bill we can get. Some \nproducers in Kansas have been in touch with me and asked: Can we get \nthis done?\n  I said: I hope so. But would you support a bill that would provide \nyou $1.3 billion less over 5 years in Kansas than the bill we have \nproposed? Would you support a bill that robs crop insurance reform to \npay for higher loan rates which may depress the market? Would you \nsupport a bill that has a brand new conservation package that out on \nthe high plains we really do not know that much about? And all of the \nadditions that have actually been proposed? The answer to that is no. \nThe answer to that is we want a better bill, and if you have a better \nbill that can be conferenced more quickly and supported by the \nadministration, it seems to me that is the way to go.\n\n  Which bill has better results for Kansas farmers? There is an outfit \ncalled the Agricultural Food Policy Center--the acronym is called \nAFPC--at Texas A and M University. They estimate our proposal will \nprovide $1.3 billion more in Government assistance to wheat farmers \nfrom 2000 to 2006. It also shows sorghum producers will receive more \nfunding, and according to analysis by the Food and Agricultural Policy \nResearch Institute (FAPRI) Cochran-Roberts/Roberts-Cochran will result \nin higher market prices, i.e, overall returns from the marketplace, \nwhile the Daschle-Harkin bill will actually drive prices lower than \nwhat would occur if the current farm bill remains in place with no \nchanges.\n  It is the same in Montana and in other areas of the country, \naccording to the FAPRI study, an independent study.\n  Sure, I want a bill. I want to get it done. I want to get it done as \nfast as possible, but I do not want to support the worst possible bill \nof the two.\n  I thank my colleagues for allowing me to speak at great length. I \napologize to my colleagues for taking this much time. I have not had an \nopportunity to talk about this yet. I have amendments to offer, but I \nwanted to take this time to fully explain my personal view and the hard \nwork that went into the alternative that I think certainly merits the \nsupport of the majority in regard to where we go with the next farm \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas in offering a substitute, an alternative, to the \nDaschle proposal for agriculture legislation. It is important we \nrecognize we are involved in a process that does naturally and \nroutinely, whenever Congress addresses farm legislation, take a \nconsiderable amount of time.\n  At the outset, I am disturbed by hearing news conferences are called \nfor the purposes of highlighting how Republicans are obstructing or \nslowing down the consideration of this farm bill and are putting in \njeopardy the passage of a farm bill before this session of Congress \nadjourns. That is totally unfair and unjustified.\n  If we look over the history of farm bill consideration, the 1996 farm \nbill, for example, under which we are now operating, there were over \n300 amendments considered to that farm bill during the consideration by \nthe Senate. There have been only a handful of amendments considered so \nfar during this farm bill debate. They have all been germane \namendments, all conscience efforts to improve the bill or change it in \na way that will help provide more support that is needed by farmers in \nthis perilous economic situation we are in, or in other ways changes \nfarm policy the Senate has a right to consider.\n  There are going to be amendments. I do not know how many amendments \nare now pending. I am told there are over 30, according to our count \nlast night. The point is, this is a serious issue. It has huge \nramifications, not only for those involved in agricultural production \nbut also for American consumers and the agricultural economy worldwide. \nSo it is not a subject that ought to be flippantly or quickly\n\n[[Page S13257]]\n\nrammed through the Senate under the pressures of the last closing days \nof the session.\n\n  If this was thought to be an appropriate time to bring up a farm bill \nby the Democratic leadership, under the obvious constraints of the time \nwe have available, why did they wait so long? Why did they wait until \nthe last few weeks of a session of Congress to bring up a bill such as \nthis? The House passed a bill much earlier in the year, even though at \nthe time many of us thought it was not necessary to pass a bill that \nearly. The legislation we are under now does not expire until next \nSeptember. Farmers are worried, and justly so, that because of \ndeclining balances in the Federal Treasury, more pressure on the budget \nto wage a war against terrorism, to deal with the realities we have to \nconfront on that subject, it may be more difficult to get the level of \nfinancial support for production agriculture than we may be able to get \nif we could act during this year. So that is really one of the reasons.\n  Another reason is so there can be a predictable level of support \ncommitted by the Federal Government to production agriculture, those \nwho are involved in planting the crops, those who are involved in \nfinancing the planting of the crops, a level of certainty and \npredictability so they can make plans for this next crop-year. So that \nis a legitimate concern as well.\n  So we are trying to accommodate those concerns and interests, but it \nis very difficult. The pressures are tremendous to get this done and to \nget it done quickly and get it to the President so it can be signed and \nenacted into law.\n  That brings into question, which process or which proposal, which \nalternative, will likely serve that goal? I suggest it is the Cochran-\nRoberts bill and not the Daschle substitute. The Daschle substitute has \nan enormously high level of loan rates in it. That is one of the big \nproblems because that is not going to become law. That is just not \ngoing to happen. That is pie in the sky. It is not a realistic \nexpectation, under the circumstances we have today, for a new farm \npolicy to be enacted quickly without people understanding all the \nramifications. It is such a dramatic departure from current law, past \npolicies, and the impact it is going to have on commodity prices, the \nproduction levels of commodities will distort the world market to such \nan extent it is unacceptable. That is the big problem.\n  There are other problems with this bill as well. There are huge \nnumbers of new mandatory spending programs contained in this Daschle \nbill. In the rural development section of the bill, which we considered \nin our committee, there are numerous new mandatory spending programs. \nWhat is that? These are programs where the spending of the money is \ndirected by law at prescribed levels for certain activities in rural \ndevelopment. Those programs that have been authorized in the past \nauthorized funding levels, and the appropriations process then analyzes \nthe availability of funds, tries to deal with the allocation of \nresources in a fair and justifiable way, after hearings and \nconsideration of what the needs are each year, so annually we make a \ndecision as to how much money is to be spent.\n  This bill is going to predict and mandate over 5 years how much money \nhas to be spent for each of those rural development programs. That is \nnew. That is a dramatic change. That is really not good policy. The \nSenate had not heard about that, had not talked about it, but that is \nin this bill. That is in the Daschle substitute.\n  I complained about it during the markup. We received the markup \npapers in the middle of the night before we marked up at 9 a.m. This is \nanother part of this rush to legislate. The committee did not take time \nto have hearings, to consider carefully the options for a new farm as \ndid the House. The House had hundreds of days of consideration prior to \nthe beginning of the markup of the House bill. They had hearings all \nover the country, hearings in Washington. Our committee had some \nhearings.\n\n  There was a transition that made some difference. In March, the party \nmajority switched in the Senate and the new leadership of our committee \nhad the responsibility of taking over abruptly. That made it a little \nmore difficult. There was a startup problem. We have had the anthrax \nbusiness in the Senate. Senators have been displaced from their \noffices. Staff members have been displaced from their offices. There \nhave been problems. There have been challenges to the ability of the \nSenate to work quickly to respond to the legitimate needs we have for \nappropriations legislation and other legislation. That is the reality \nof the situation.\n  There are amendments that I may offer on the rural development side. \nIn fact, the Cochran-Roberts bill changes these mandatory spending \nprograms into authorized spending programs so we can annually make \ndecisions about the level of funding available and justified. Instead \nof being able to project a long period into the future of budget \nsurpluses, which was the case, we are confronting a new reality. We are \nnot going to have as much money in surplus in the Federal budget as we \nexpected. That may affect the funding levels realistically available \nfor some of these rural development programs. All of them sound good, \nbut we have to view them in the context of budget realities and \nlegitimate needs and how effectively these funds will be used to try to \naddress the problems they are designed to solve.\n  One other aspect of difference between the Cochran and Roberts bill \nand the Daschle substitute is the conservation title. We have a very \nstrong conservation title in our bill. The commodity title is \ndifferent, as well, not only in the loan rates I mentioned but also in \nthe predicted constant level of Government support made available, \ndirected to producers of agricultural commodities.\n  Let me point out in some detail the differences in the commodity \ntitle in Cochran-Roberts compared with the Daschle substitute. Our bill \nmaintains planting flexibility with a fixed payment throughout the 5-\nyear life of the bill. In the last few years, Congress has provided \nproducers with supplemental assistance because of the depressed prices \nand because of natural disasters which have struck many States. The \ncombination has created disastrous situations. Congress has responded. \nThere is no guarantee under the budget realities of today that we are \ngoing to be able to continue that level of ad hoc special emergency \nfunding to provide those levels of support in the future. That is \nanother reason the Cochran-Roberts bill determines in advance and sets \nout in clear language and numbers in the bill the amount of payments \nthe Federal Government will make to producers of agricultural \ncommodities.\n\n  Another aspect of our bill that is different is we maintain the \nsuccessful marketing loan programs with loan rates that do not distort \nmarket prices. They do not encourage overproduction and therefore have \na depressing effect on market prices.\n  A new farm savings account is authorized in this legislation. This \nwill be money available to farmers from the Government to match their \nown savings they invest in order to cushion the effect of years where \ncommodity prices are lower. There are naturally going to be ups and \ndowns in market prices in agriculture as there are in a lot of other \neconomic activities. This account creates a new 401(k) program for \nfarmers. The Federal Government will match the money that the farmers \nput into these accounts.\n  Another change that farmers will appreciate in this legislation we \nare proposing is a provision allowing them to update their base acres. \nA lot of farmers are convinced the system, the way it works now and the \nway the program is administered, penalizes them because it contains \nout-of-date information and is not an accurate reflection of the number \nof base acres that are farmed and on which the payments can be \ncalculated under this program. This process allows farmers to be paid \non a more recent production list.\n  The conservation title I mentioned briefly. Let me point out \nspecifics in the conservation title in Cochran-Roberts and why it is a \nvery strong commitment to the conservation of soil and water resources \nin our country. There are higher levels of authorization for the \nprograms that have proved to be successful in encouraging farmers to \nproduce their crops in environmentally friendly ways. The centerpiece \nof the conservation title is the Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram, known as EQIP. Under the current EQIP, there is an \nauthorization\n\n[[Page S13258]]\n\nlevel of $200 million per year, or $1.2 billion over the 6-year life of \nthe bill. The Cochran-Roberts substitute raises that authorization by \n$450 million, to a level of $1.65 billion for the life of the bill. The \nConservation Reserve Program is also increased from 36.4 million acres \nto 40 million acres. The Wetlands Reserve Program is increased to \n250,000 acres annually. The Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program \nauthorized at $25 million annually is increased to $100 million each \nyear. The Cochran-Roberts substitute contains a generous level of \nsupport for conservation programs.\n  In summary, these are the reasons why the Cochran-Roberts bill is a \npreferred alternative to the Daschle substitute. It is trade friendly; \nit is consistent with the WTO rules; loan rate levels are consistent \nwith the House bill, which makes the bills more easily conferenced. The \nDaschle-Harkin approach is not going to be easily conferenced with the \nHouse. In my view, it will be impossible to conference with the House. \nIt cannot be reconciled with the House because of that fundamental \nmajor departure. Cochran-Roberts provides a strong commitment to \nconservation. I mention that again because some are suggesting we are \nnot providing enough support for conservation programs in our \nalternative. That is just not true.\n  We have a farm savings account which will help counter adverse price \ncycles. The administration supports our bill. The President will sign a \nbill that is based on the principles of the Cochran-Roberts bill. \nSupport for Cochran-Roberts will produce a bill and a new farm law, not \njust a campaign issue.\n  I urge Senate support.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the last few years have been very hard on \nall of Agriculture because what farmers are getting for crops often \ndoes not cover the cost of production, let alone make a profit.\n  Because of the prolonged slump in commodity prices, earlier this year \nwe were on the floor debating additional assistance to farmers. I \nsupported the $5.5 billion in emergency farm aid for the last 3 years, \nbecause I believe if we want our farmers to stay in business and our \nrural communities to survive, we must help them until prices come back. \nHowever, Congress cannot keep doing these ad hoc disaster bills. We \nmust provide more certainly to farmers across the Nation, which is why \nI am pleased Congress is taking up the farm bill. However, I am \ndisappointed that such a bipartisan issue has been made partisan. It is \nmy hope that we still have time to pass a farm bill with good \nagriculture policy to help our farmers, ranchers, and rural \ncommunities. That is why I support the Cochran-Roberts alternative. A \nproposal that will provide support for our farmers when they need it \nand not send signals to produce when the market can not bear the \nproduction. Harkin has high loan rates which cause farmers to produce \nfor the loan deficiency payment, the over production cause prices to be \nfurther depressed.\n  I also support the improvements to the sugar program. The authority \nfor inventory management will help restore balance to U.S. sugar market \nand prevent more of our farmers from going out of business. The \nelimination of the marketing assessment was long over due, as sugar was \nthe only commodity to be taxed for debt reduction. Sugar is an \nimportant crop to my state and these improvements will help it remain a \nviable part of Idaho agriculture. Harkin does all of this and gets rid \nof the loan forfeiture penalty. This proposal does not contain a so-\ncalled national dairy program that benefits some dairy farmers at the \nexpense of farmers in my State. We should work on a national policy \nthat is fair to all farmers and that makes us more competitive on the \nworld market. I am pleased that dry peas, lentils, and chickpeas were \nincluded as a farm program. Loan rates and LDP's will help these crops \nremain competitive with wheat and canola in rotations along the \nnorthern tier states, this is in Harkin. I also support the nonrecourse \nloans for wool and honey. Our wool growers have seen wool become an \nexpense rather than additional income from their sheep, this program \nwill help to overcome that. Both wool and honey, as other commodities, \nhave been adversely impacted imports and it is time these commodities \nhave programs as other commodities do. I am pleased with the increases \nin EQIP, Environmental Quality Incentives Program, funding and the \nimprovements to this program that is vital to our cattlemen who are \nworking to comply with water quality issues.\n  The grasslands reserve program is a proposal I introduced earlier \nthis year and I am pleased that it was incorporated in this amendment. \nThis proposal will help keep working landscapes intact which will \nbenefit the ranchers, rural communities and wildlife that are dependent \nupon them. There is much more to this amendment in all of the other \ntitles but I will not go into detail, rather I would like to \ncongratulate Senators Cochran and Roberts for assembling a well-\nbalanced piece of legislation that works to address the different needs \nin every region of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Cochran-\nRoberts approach to this problem. I think it is a middle-of-the-road \napproach to where we are under today's policies, what was proposed and \nwhat was voted out of the Agriculture Committee.\n  Yesterday there were a few of us who believed the cloture vote was \nnot a good experience. Most of us who had amendments, and substantive \namendments, had not been able to talk about those amendments or even \nfile them. We believe they are very important. We all have the habit, \nin this debate, of being a little bit provincial. We look at what we \nneed in our States. What we have experienced in the State of Montana--\nin the last 3 years especially, but basically we are in the middle of a \n5-year drought. That cycle does not appear to be breaking in our State. \nWe had a little snow here 3 weeks ago, but since then the temperatures \nhave moderated and, again, we are into a very dry fall. It is unusual \nfor Montana.\n  We have had winters when it has been very good in my State, even \nthough we are on the northern tier. Nonetheless, it has been a dry fall \nand of course we live in the part of the country where, if it does not \nwinter, it does not summer. We are afraid of that again.\n  The present legislation, the Daschle substitute, still offers some \nvery troubling proposals. The day before yesterday, an extended debate \nwas headed by our good friend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. In the \nconservation title there is a section title dealing with CRP, to thrust \nthe Government into a position where they can buy out, or coerce out, a \nfarmer or rancher's water rights. This would involve going around the \nState water adjudication process, going around water trusts that have \nbeen set up for States such as Oregon and Montana and other Western \nStates.\n  We are still looking at that section. Even though it was amended to \nallow States to opt into the program, we are still looking at it \nbecause I think the whole subsection of the conservation title should \nbe stricken. We could talk about that and offer another amendment on \nthat, but that would not be productive during this debate. But I do \nhave a couple of amendments I am going to offer now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that other pending amendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  In my capacity as a Senator from New Jersey, I object.\n  Mr. BURNS. While we are in the process of reviewing that, there are \nother areas of this legislation where we could offer amendments, areas \nwhich I believe have to be addressed by this body and by this \nGovernment.\n  We have a situation on the northern border with our good friends in \nCanada that is intolerable when it comes to movement of farm chemicals \nback and forth across the border. We have farmers in Montana who farm \nboth sides of that international boundary. We would like to normalize \nthose labels of like chemicals that are labeled to do the same things. \nSo far, we have not been able to do that. I think it would be \ninappropriate, again, to offer an amendment, hard and fast, where we \ncould deal with that problem. But I will be submitting some language \nbecause this does involve the EPA, the Department of Agriculture, and \nit also involves our International Trade Representative. To\n\n[[Page S13259]]\n\nget them involved, report language is going to be needed in order to \ndeal with that problem.\n  We could also talk about captive shipper in those areas where we only \nhave one railroad. There is an old saying in Montana that you farm the \nfirst year for the Government, the second year is for yourself, and the \nthird year is for the railroad, because they take about a third of your \ncrop just to move it to the processor or to the export terminals. We \nare in a position where it costs us more than it should. It is funny \nthat you can ship grain from Omaha to Minneapolis or Portland cheaper \nthan you can ship it from Montana. We have to deal with that, and so \nfar we have not been able to come to grips with how to deal with \nmonopolies in a State, especially when it impacts the movement from a \nState that produces raw materials.\n  Of course, we have that situation in grain. We have the situation in \ncoal. It impacts the cost of energy. It also impacts the cost of \nfarming. We forget around here that agriculture buys retail and sells \nwholesale, and usually pays the freight both ways.\n  We could also get on the old populist line, that what is lacking in \nagriculture today is that for years--and I suggest this to my friend \nfrom Kansas--for years we lived on the part of the consumer dollar that \nranges from 15 cents to 20 cents. That is not true today. We are down \nto 9 cents or 10 cents.\n  We have no lever in the market. We can't just go to the marketplace \nand say: No, it cost me $4 to produce the grain. I am not going to sell \nit for less than $4; that would be silly. Because that is like going to \na store or tractor dealer or fertilizer guy, who can say: No, it cost \nus so much for the fertilizer, and this is what it is going to cost \nyou. And guess what. We pay them. But a farmer doesn't have that \nleverage in the market that he once had.\n  Yesterday we had an amendment dealing with packer concentration, \nbasically, saying the packers could not own livestock, or, if they did, \nthey could only own it for 14 days prior to the scheduled slaughter. I \ndon't know how you get 14 days and I don't know how you define that--\nthat is yet to be determined.\n  There is a reason for this. There is going to be a reason we should \ndeal with the Packers and Stockyards Act, because that is a law that \nwas written way back in the 1930s and it has never been amended or \nchanged in a substantive way. Back in those years when I was a lad, I \nwould say 80 percent of the livestock that was marketed went through \nterminal markets. We can remember the great stockyards in Kansas City, \nOmaha, Chicago, Minneapolis, or South St. Paul, Sioux Falls, and Sioux \nCity, East St. Louis--all the great terminal markets. Over 80 percent \nwere marketed that way. Packers specifically in that law were \nprohibited from owning a commission house or stockyards.\n  There was a reason for it. Back then, we had the ``big five.'' There \nwas Wilson, Swift, and Cuttahay. I have a fantastic memory, but it is \nshort. Back in those days we had the five major ones when we talked \nabout livestock marketing and processing. Now the movement of slaughter \nanimals to market is reversed. The chicken industry is a horizontal and \nvertical entry. In fact, I would say it is done 75 percent of the time \nin the hog business. They have ``chickenized'' the hog business. But in \ncattle, they have not. If 80 percent of the cattle are going to move to \nthe plants without going through a stockyard, or commission house, or \nan auction market, then another firewall has to be built.\n  There is a very good reason for that. The intent of the law was good, \nand it worked. It worked to benefit the producer. That is why the \namendment that was voted on yesterday in the Chamber which came from \nthe livestock area was successful.\n  I ask the Chair, How are we doing? Can I offer my amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may offer his amendments.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent to set the pending amendment \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.\n  I offer this amendment, and I will talk more about it later. But it \nis a limitation on the amount of acres that one landowner could put \ninto CRP.\n  The CRP is a well-intentioned program, but it has been changed. I \nguess it evolved. It has been done mostly through Executive order \nrather than through legislation.\n  I think it is about time that we get the Conservation Reserve Program \nback to its original intent. The intent was to set aside those \nundesirable or highly erodible acres, and the Government would \nreimburse the farmer for good conservation practices. It was very \nsuccessful. I don't know of a time in Montana when we have had a better \nhabitat for our upland game birds--grouse and pheasant.\n  We had the situation where some people under farm programs were \nplowing from fence row to fence row. Lands that should have never ever \nbeen broken were going into cropland.\n  We kind of killed two birds with one stone. We said: OK. Let us set \nsome of those lands aside. Maybe that will cut back a little bit on \nproduction. That will give us a better market. But those highly \nerodible and marginal lands could also be used for a very good use--for \nthe environment and the maintenance of our habitat for our wildlife.\n  I don't know of a farmer or rancher who doesn't like a little bit of \nwildlife around. I know I do. My father even planted little areas of \nlespedeza, and put four rows of crops around it. It was covered with \nquail in those areas. They are a marvelous bird.\n  This amendment deals with the amount of land you can put into CRP.\n  There is also another reason for this amendment. We have seen in \nrural areas that our smaller towns have dried up. We have seen very \ngood productive land put into the Conservation Reserve Program. Instead \nof the farmer selling the land to a young farmer, they have put it in \nthere. And they go where the snow does not fly.\n  It is really not a bad deal, when you think about it. But it is \ncounterproductive to our communities when the biggest base is \nproduction agriculture. Those lands should be kept in production. After \nall, the American people have decided they want their insurance policy, \ncalled ``plentiful food.'' They want the quality and the quantity. They \nalso want the grocery store open 24 hours a day. That is the reason for \nthis amendment.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2607 To Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2608 to amendment No. 2471.\n\n\n[[Page S13260]]\n\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To direct the Secretary of Agriculture to establish certain \nper-acre values for payments for different categories of land enrolled \n                  in the conservation reserve program)\n\n       On page 212, strike lines 13 through 15 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     reduce the amount of payments made by the Secretary for other \n     practices under the conservation reserve program.\n       ``(j) Per-Acre Payment Levels.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall conduct a \n     study to determine, and promulgate regulations that establish \n     in accordance with paragraph (2), per-acre values for \n     payments for different categories of land enrolled in the \n     conservation reserve program.\n       ``(2) Values.--In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary \n     shall ensure that--\n       ``(A) the per-acre value for highly erodible land or other \n     sensitive land (as identified by the Secretary) that is not \n     suitable for agricultural production; is greater than\n       ``(B) the per-acre value for land that is suitable for \n     agricultural production (as determined by the Secretary).''.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this amendment also deals with conservation \nreserve. The original intent was to take those marginal and erodible \nacres out of production and set them aside.\n  This amendment pays the landowner more for the acres that he sets \naside that are the lower class lands and soils and pays less for the \nproductive land.\n  This is an incentive for the farmer or rancher to set aside the land \nthat we really want to see in the Conservation Reserve Program, and it \nwill do everything that we wanted to do that I spoke of on the first \namendment.\n  It is fairly straightforward. If we think this program is important, \nthen we must fulfill the intent of the program and give the producer \nthe incentive to carry it out. I think that is what this does.\n  I will offer amendments as we go along, but those are the two main \namendments that I wanted to offer to the Daschle substitute of the farm \nbill.\n  I hope as we march down this road to try to craft this legislation \nthat we can at least take a commonsense look at these amendments.\n  It seems in agriculture when you start talking about a farm bill \neverybody becomes a farmer. Sometimes we get led astray when we are not \nliving in the real world on what it is like in the country.\n  I want to tell you that there is only one problem in the country; \nthat is the price. Everything else would go away if we were getting a \nfair price for the product. The price we get now has very little to do \nwith the cost of the final product we buy in the grocery store.\n  As I said, we were very happy when we used to receive 15 to 20 cents \nof the consumer dollar. Now we are down around 9 or so. That becomes a \nreal strain.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my good friends who are managing this \nbill because it is difficult to do that, at best. But we will start \ntalking about two other items and offering some report language that \ndeals with those items so that we can start the process to deal with \nthat. Those items deserve to be debated. I think everybody in this body \nneeds to know the particulars of what is involved with captive shippers \nand the problem we have in the normalization of labels when we talk \nabout farm chemicals and fertilizers.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent that \nmy amendments be set aside and we return to the amendment that was \nconsidered before I offered my two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning we have had a generous \ndiscussion of farm policy. Some see me come to the floor of the Senate \nand say: Oh, no, here comes the farm speech again. Probably that is the \ncase because family farming is very important to this country, to its \nfuture, and the passion I have for trying to do something to keep a \nnetwork of food producers in our country represented by families living \non farms in America is a passion that doesn't dim. And so I will \nrespond to some to the discussion to date.\n  We have been debating the farm bill all week. Today we are in a town \nlargely vacated. We don't have record votes. The Chamber is largely \nempty. We are in a situation where we will now take the farm bill into \nnext week because we had a cloture vote to try to cut off a filibuster \nyesterday, and we did not succeed. Fifty-four Members of the Senate \nvoted to restrict debate so we could finish the farm bill, and that was \nnot enough. It requires 60 votes.\n  We have some in this Chamber who have decided to slow-walk this farm \nbill. While that is not unusual--that happens on legislation--no one \nhas actually confessed to that strategy. They just have done it. \nActually, on a good day no one accuses the Senate of speeding. But on \nbad days, this is almost glacial in terms of its movement. That is what \nhas happened in recent days with respect to the farm bill.\n  I listened carefully to the discussion this morning and to the \ndiscussion earlier in the week with respect to those who don't like the \nfarm bill that came out of the Senate Agriculture Committee. I am \nreminded of the person who knows the cost of everything but the value \nof nothing.\n  We have had a lot of discussion with respect to a farm bill, and it \nis about numbers--carryover stocks, loan rates, direct payments, a \nwhole range of numbers. No one really talks of values.\n  This debate is much more than just a discussion about numbers. It is \na discussion about values: What kind of a country do we want to be. \nWhat kind of an economy do we want to have? Who do we want to produce \nAmerica's food? Does it provide security to have a network of family \nproducers scattered across this country, producing America's food? Does \nthat produce a more secure food supply? Those are the questions we also \nought to be discussing.\n  I have expressed to my colleagues previously my feelings about \nfarming and family farmers and ranchers in my State and other States. \nThe Presiding Officer today is from the State of New Jersey. It is a \nlarge State, an urban State. His experience and background would be \ndifferent than mine. I come from a town of 300 people. The Presiding \nOfficer likely grew up in a town slightly larger than that.\n  It seems to me that all of us coming together in this Chamber \nrepresent the gridwork of America, bringing different perspectives and \ndifferent values from different parts of the country together in a \ndiscussion about who it is we are and what we want to be. That is why I \nrise to talk for a moment about family farming in North Dakota and what \nit provides for our rural lifestyle.\n  My little town of 300 people just had their last high school prom \nlast May. It was the last high school prom because it was the last year \nof their high school. I graduated many years ago from that same school \nin a class of nine. There were seven boys and two girls.\n  (Mr. INOUYE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, the years passed and passed, and some more years \npassed, and they came to last May when the high school in Regent, ND, \nwas closed. They held their last high school proposal. So the Regent \nRanger basketball team and that high school are history. That is \nhappening across much of the Farm Belt in the small towns that are \nshrinking like a plum to a prune, just shrinking up.\n  So the question for many is, Does it matter? Isn't that the \ninevitable march of progress, the drumbeat of moving ahead? Isn't that \ninevitable? Why not just accept it?\n  There are things that we lose in this country when we decide that \nthat which is rural doesn't matter. I will give you some examples. I \nhave mentioned before these examples. Nonetheless, they are important. \nIf you are in need of a hotel room and are in Marmarth, ND, this \nevening, there is a hotel in Marmarth, ND. No one works there, however. \nYou just go in and you take a bed, and the next morning when you leave, \nthere is a cigar box attached to the inside of the door and they would \nlike you to put some money in it, if you can. That is how you get a\n\n[[Page S13261]]\n\nhotel room in Marmarth. Admittedly, it is a small town. Marmarth has 70 \nor 80 people now. It is an old railroad bunkhouse that they use as a \nhotel. The door is open for you if you need a place to sleep. Just put \nsome money in the cigar box.\n  That is part of a system of rural values that I think is important to \nunderstand. Another part of my State, down the road, also in the \nsouthern part of the State, is Havana, ND. People magazine did a story \nabout Havana. They have a cafe in Havana, a little restaurant, but it \nis also a very small community. I believe it is under 100 people--\nperhaps just under 200. In any event, in order to keep the restaurant \nopen, because they can't afford to keep it open under regular \ncircumstances, they asked the townspeople to sign up each week for when \nthey can work there for 2 hours--for free, for nothing. That is the way \nthe community keeps the small town cafe open.\n  In Tuttle, ND, a little town of less than 100 people, they lost their \ngrocery store. That wasn't satisfactory to the people in Tuttle, so the \ncity council decided they would build their own grocery store. So you \nhave a city-owned grocery store there. Some would call that socialism, \nbut they simply wanted a grocery store, so the city built it. I was \nthere the day they opened the new grocery store. They asked me to come. \nThey cut a ribbon on Main Street. They had the high school band out on \na beautiful day. The sun was shining, the wind was blowing gently, and \nthe high school band played on the streets to celebrate the opening of \nthe city-owned grocery store. Good for them.\n  In my hometown of Regent, they had a robbery. They had not had one \nfor an awful long time. The county sheriff from Mott came rushing over \nin his car. He had his lights and siren on because he doesn't get a \nchance to use them that much. He came rushing in and discovered someone \nhad stolen some money from a home. He investigated and announced that \nthere was no sign of forced entry because these folks had gone on \nvacation for 2 weeks and had not locked their house. They had left some \ncash in their home and someone had stolen some cash. But there was no \nsign of forced entry because, having left for vacation for 2 weeks, \nthey didn't lock their home.\n  The county sheriff said to the residents: There are two things you \nought to consider doing. One, if you are going on vacation, consider \nlocking your home. Two, if you are going to leave your vehicle on Main \nStreet, consider taking your keys. The people in my hometown down at \nthe cafe talking about that discovered there was a practical problem \nfor the first suggestion. Most people didn't have keys for their homes. \nRegarding the second recommendation, the county newspaper pointed out \nthat the county sheriff thought people should remove keys from vehicles \non Main Street when they parked. They asked a rancher how he felt about \nthat. His response was: Well, the question I have about the sheriff's \nsuggestion is, what if somebody needs to use my pickup truck?\n\n  So that is where I come from. That is a set of rural values that you \nwon't find in some other parts of the country. These are wonderful \nplaces in which to live and raise children, places with good neighbors. \nSo this is more than just about dollars and cents. It is more than just \nabout graphs and charts that people show with lines and bars on them. \nIt is about values, a value system.\n  Let me speak for a minute about what is happening in rural America. \nThe discussion we have heard this morning is about our plan versus \ntheir plan. Well, look, every plan that existed in the last 30 years \nhad been a plan during which, when implemented, we have had this \nrelentless march away from rural America.\n  There is a Lutheran minister in New England, ND, who told me that she \nconducts four funerals for every wedding. She says: For every wedding I \nconduct in my Lutheran Church, I conduct four funerals.\n  I thought, that is the opposite of that movie, ``Four Weddings and a \nFuneral.'' In rural America, it is four funerals and a wedding. Why is \nthat the case? Because the population is growing older, young people \nare leaving, family farmers are going broke. This rural lifestyle of \nours is decaying and atrophying. The question is whether the Congress \ncares about it, whether there is a public policy in Congress that \nmatches the kind of public policy Europeans have already embraced that \nsays: Do you know what we want for our future? We want a network of \nfood producers represented by families, producing food on the land \nacross Europe. We want that for food security purposes and for economic \nand cultural and social purposes. They have done it. Go to Europe and \ngo to a small town and ask yourself whether that town is living or \ndying. It is alive. Do you know why? Because families out there are \nmaking a living on the land producing crops.\n  This country points to Europe and says it provides subsidies to its \nfarmers, as if it is an accusation. Yes, it does, because that is the \nkind of economy it wants. When prices for food collapse on the \ninternational markets, Europe says they want to maintain a network of \nfarmers in rural Europe. So, too, should the United States decide that \nfamily farmers matter. Family farming is much more than just the act of \nplanting a seed. Family farming produces communities. It is the blood \nvessel that creates small communities. It is where we raise children \nand educate children, and those family values that start on the farm \nand roll from family farm to small towns to big cities nourish and \nrefresh the value system of this country. That is why this issue is \nimportant to some of us.\n  We can ignore this, we can pretend the problem doesn't exist, and we \ncan say everything is just fine. But that ignores the truth--the \nfundamental truth that somewhere all across rural America this morning \nfamilies were waking up on farm after farm after farm wondering how \nlong it is going to be before they lose their farm. How long before \nthey lose their hopes and dreams of trying to make a living by \nscratching the land and planting a seed, how long?\n\n  You can't imagine the letters we receive from people who have lost \neverything. A woman called me a while ago. She and her husband got \nmarried just out of high school and started a farm. That was about 25 \nyears ago. It was a dairy operation. If anybody knows anything about \ndairy, you know how hard that is. You milk every day, twice a day, \nearly in the morning and at night. She said for 25 years they have \nscrimped on everything; they don't go to town on weekends or at night, \nand they don't spend money foolishly on anything. They wait an extra \nyear to buy Levis for their kids for school. They called me and told me \na story.\n  She said: The bank says they are going to foreclose on us because the \nprice of milk is too low and we can't make a living milking 80 cows. \nWhat are we going to do? It is the only thing we know. It is what we \ndecided to do after high school. Our dream was to run a family farm. We \nhave done it for a quarter century. We are not trained for other \nthings. Can you help us?\n  That plaintiff cry, ``Can you help us,'' comes from all corners of \nrural America to the U.S. Congress, asking: Do you care whether family \nfarms produce America's food? If you do, give them a decent opportunity \nto make a living if they are good managers.\n  That brings me to the point of the numbers. When a family farm in \nrural America today raises a bushel of wheat, they are paid a pitiful \nsum for that bushel of wheat by the grain trade because the grain trade \nsays that food they produce isn't worth anything.\n  It is inexplicable to me that in a hungry world where half a billion \npeople go to bed at night with an ache in their belly because it hurts \nto be hungry, our farmers are told their food has no value. It is just \ninexplicable. That is what the grain trade says to the family farmer, \nbut that food the grain trade tells the family farmer has no value is \nput on a railroad that in most places charges monopoly rates to a \nfarmer to haul that grain to the market.\n  From that market, a cereal manufacturer will take from that bushel of \nwheat a kernel and puff it, and by the time they get that puffed kernel \nof wheat and stick it in a cereal box, seal it up, put bright colors on \nthe box, send it to the grocery store, and put it on the shelf, they \nwill sell that for $4 for a small box. All of a sudden that food does \nhave value. It just had no value for the person who bought the tractor \nand planted the seed and took the risk.\n  The value is to the company that took the kernel of wheat and puffed \nit, or the rice or the corn and flaked it\n\n[[Page S13262]]\n\nand created the pop and the crackle, and then sold it for $4 or $5 a \nbox. That is where the value is, apparently.\n  Farmers have increasingly lost their share of the food dollar as they \nare pressed from above and pressed from below by increasing monopolies \nin virtually every direction that a farmer looks--hauling their \nproduct, selling their product, buying their chemicals, buying their \nseed in virtually every direction. Then when the Federal Government \ngets about the business of dealing with trade, saying to farmers, by \nthe way, we will let you sell overseas that grain you raised, we \ndiscover the trade agreements this country has negotiated with others \nare fundamentally bankrupt in the way they treat family farmers.\n  We negotiated one with Canada and sold out American farmers, just \nsold them out. We negotiated one with Mexico and sold out American \nfarmers. And the list goes on.\n  Farmers need a little help. Farmers are asking Congress to stand on \ntheir side for a change.\n  Let me go to this question of what kind of plan will work. We have a \nplan before the Senate that comes from the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee. I know the administration does not like it. I also know some \nof our colleagues who spoke this morning do not like it very much. The \nadministration wrote a statement of administration policy; it is called \nSAP. There is an acronym for everything in this town. They said \nsupporting prices is self-defeating.\n  The point is, we really should not support prices for family farmers. \nAnd I fundamentally disagree with that. If a big economic interest has \na headache, this town is ready to give them an aspirin, fluff up their \npillow, and put them to bed. This town is ready to help them at the \ndrop of a hat.\n  How about a family farmer who does not have much power? How about a \nfamily farmer who discovers the grain they sell has no value? \nColleagues say: Supporting prices is self-defeating. It is not self-\ndefeating. Supporting prices for family farmers is an effort to help \nthis country maintain a network of food production that promotes \ndomestic security in this country, promotes a lifestyle and a culture \nin America that is very important. It is not self-defeating at all.\n  We have brought this bill out of the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nand Senator Harkin and many others brought it to the floor of the \nSenate. It was reported out unanimously. Every title of the bill but \none was voted on unanimously, and that was the commodity title. That \ntitle was voted on and had a Republican vote, so it has a bipartisan \nflavor to it. This bill was virtually unanimous coming out of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee.\n  Despite the fact there is an urgency to get this done and get it done \nnow--we are trying to get it done by the end of the year--yesterday we \ncould not break a filibuster because some do not like the price \nsupports in the bill.\n  Today we have a discussion by some who say they want to offer an \namendment. We have been waiting for that amendment for, I believe, 4 \ndays now; the amendment will reduce price supports for every single \ncommodity. It will reduce the price supports for wheat, corn, barley, \noats, oil seeds, and soybeans.\n  It seems to me reducing price supports--and the bill that came out of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee, in my judgment, is not generous \nenough, but at least it gets us at the starting line of what we need to \ndo to help family farmers--reducing price supports from that level, in \nmy judgment, would make no sense at all.\n  The proposition is: Let's have a direct payment to farmers that has \nno relationship to price. That is Freedom to Farm, too. That is the \ncurrent farm law. The current farm law, Freedom to Farm--which title is \nsort of incongruous, in my judgment, but nonetheless that is the title \nto it--has nearly bankrupted rural America.\n  Every single year Freedom to Farm has been in force, we have had to \ndo an emergency bill at the end of the year to keep people afloat. Why? \nBecause the underlying farm legislation is awful. It does not work, and \neverybody in the country knows it does not work.\n  The proposal that says what we really need to do now is have a fixed \npayment, notwithstanding what prices are in the marketplace, is saying: \nLet's continue what we have been doing. Freedom to Farm is a proposal \nthat says: Let's have 7 years of declining payments. It does not matter \nwhat the market is.\n\n  If the market is $5.50 a bushel for wheat and you do not need the \nhelp, you are going to get it anyway. That is what Freedom to Farm is. \nThey did not calculate that instead of $5.50 a bushel for wheat, it \ncollapsed to $2.50, and Freedom to Farm was a miserable pittance in \nterms of what farmers needed to stay out of bankruptcy.\n  The circumstances are that a substitute is going to be offered that \nsays: Let's go back to a fixed payment, and if prices improve, we will \nstill give payments. That is not my interest. In my judgment, family \nfarmers do not want a payment. If they get $5.50 for a bushel of wheat, \nthey do not want, they do not need a payment, and they should not get a \npayment. It is just very simple.\n  What we ought to be doing for family farmers is something that is a \ncountercyclical program that when prices are collapsing and times are \ntough, we help. When times are good, we do not need to help. That is \ncommon sense, in my judgment.\n  The bill that was brought to us by Senator Harkin does exactly that. \nIt makes a policy U-turn and says: Let's understand Freedom to Farm did \nnot work, and let's put in place something that is truly \ncountercyclical. It retains all the things farmers want; that is, \nplanting flexibility. They want the flexibility to make their own \nplanting decisions, and they should have that. Absolutely. They have it \nunder the current law. They will have it under the new law. That makes \ngood sense.\n  It does not make any sense to begin, even before this bill is passed, \npulling the rug out from under price supports saying somehow we want to \nprovide less to family farmers than they need to survive.\n  This is an extraordinarily important time. We are not in session \ntoday with votes. We are in session but have no votes. We return with \nvotes on Tuesday. We will be working Wednesday and through the \nremainder of the week, I expect. We expected and hoped we would get \nthis farm bill that came out of the Senate Agriculture Committee passed \nby yesterday or the day before. We were not able to break a filibuster. \nSo now we have to, on Tuesday, come back and see if we can--or perhaps \nMonday with no votes but then Tuesday with votes--see if we can provide \nsome additional votes on amendments and get to the end stage.\n  My hope is those who have been developing this slow-motion strategy \nwill understand that it serves no real interest. We are going to finish \nthis bill. The only thing that will have been accomplished is we will \nhave delayed dramatically the ability to pass a farm bill, and we will \nnot have had the opportunity to have a conference with the House of \nRepresentatives if this goes much longer.\n  We have a Republican chairman on the House side who is anxious to get \nto conference. Congressman Combest--good for him--told the White House \nand the administration some months ago when they said, Don't write a \nfarm bill this year; we do not want you to write a farm bill, \nCongressman Combest said to his own party: It does not matter what you \nwant; we need a new farm bill, and I am going to do it. Good for him. I \ncommend him. He is a good, strong guy who pushed ahead and did it. He \nwants to go to conference with us; the sooner the better.\n  My colleague, Senator Harkin, has now brought a bill out of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, and we should be in conference today had \nwe not had a filibuster.\n  Hopefully we can be in conference next Wednesday. We owe it to the \nfamily farmers in this country to get this bill done and get it done \nright.\n  We will, I suspect, hear from a lot of family farmers in the coming \ndays through their farm organizations. Every farm organization in \nAmerica, every one that I am aware of, has asked this Congress to do \nthis job now. Farm organizations and commodity groups have said: We \nsupport this job being done now. It is just inexplicable to me that on \nbehalf of family farmers this Congress will not rush to good policy. If \nthis were some other economic sector with big companies and lobbyists \nfilling the hallways, Congress would be rushing off and saying, When\n\n[[Page S13263]]\n\ncan we get this done? But somehow when it comes to the farm bill, we \nhave people who do not seem very anxious to complete the work.\n  I began by talking about small towns and values, and let me end again \nby saying this is about values. What does this country want for its \nfood production in the future? Does it want family producers? If it \ndoes, then it has to develop public policy that complements those \ndesires. I mentioned before that Europe has done it. We have not. Some \nof our friends point to Europe and say they are subsidizing their \nfarmers. Yes, they are doing that. Good for them.\n  Do you know why they are doing it? Because Europe has been hungry, \nand it has decided it is never going to be hungry again. We have people \nwho are just benign about family farmers. We have people who say it \ndoes not matter who farms America. We have big agrifactories that can \nline up tractors on farms from California to Maine. That would be fine. \nAll that has been lost is families. Yard lights are not needed if there \nis nobody living out there. One can fly from Los Angeles to New York \nand see almost no lights then. I do not think that advances America's \ninterest. I think that retards it.\n  I think there is a difference in terms of this country's future about \nwho produces America's food, and if we stand with family farmers and \nbelieve in a future with family farmers producing America's food and \nbelieve the values that come from rural America are important to our \ncountry's future, then it seems to me we have an obligation and an \nopportunity now to do the right thing.\n  Doing the right thing is passing the bill that came out of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, getting it into conference, and joining with \nCongressman Combest and Senator Harkin in getting this bill to the desk \nof the President. I do not know whether the President will sign it. \nThat is up to him. It is not our job to anticipate what this President \nmight or might not do in agricultural policy. It is our job to write \nthe best farm bill possible, and that is what we should be about doing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I take the remaining few minutes we are in \nsession today to respond to earlier statements of my colleagues, \nSenator Roberts and Senator Cochran.\n  Before I do that, I will respond to the editorial in the Washington \nPost today at the bottom of the editorial page, entitled ``A Piggy Farm \nBill.'' I thought in honor of that I would wear my piggy tie today. I \nhave a tie with pigs on it, but they are little pigs, not big pigs. \nThat is what the farm bill is about--helping the little person, helping \nthe family farmer who does not have a lot of economic power like the \nbig corporations and the big businesses all over this country.\n  The Washington Post has it all wrong. They say the farm bill ``would \ninstitutionalize the insupportable excesses of the past few years. . . \n.'' Excessive spending in the farm bill is what they are alleging. They \nsay we are spending too much money, we should not do this because it is \ntoo much money going out to our farmers.\n  I had my staff do a little research. I thought I would put it in \nlight of what we are spending in this country. During the Depression, \npublic support to farmers was first established. In 1940, Federal farm \nsupport accounted for 3.9 percent of the Federal budget and .4 of a \npercent of the U.S. gross domestic product. In 1963, farm support \naccounted for 3.1 percent of the Federal budget and .55 of U.S. GDP. \nOver the last 3 years, Federal farm support has accounted for about 1.1 \npercent of the Federal budget and .2 of a percent of U.S. GDP.\n  In the farm bill we have before the Senate, S. 1731, for the next 5-\nyear period, Federal farm support is projected to account for about .65 \npercent of the Federal budget, the lowest ever, and .1 percent of U.S. \nGDP, the lowest ever. In 1963 it was .55 percent of U.S. GDP.\n  When the Washington Post says we are spending too much of our \nnational income on agriculture, I have to wonder, what are they talking \nabout? Look at the past. We are spending less and less of our national \nincome on agriculture. I will have more to say about that next week.\n  Now I will respond to Senator Roberts and Senator Cochran, and \nSenator Grassley, my colleague from Iowa, who spoke this morning about \nthe possibility that this bill would violate the WTO. He was greatly \nconcerned about making sure we maintain our support to agriculture \nwithin the WTO limitations. I agree. I believe we should. We helped \nhammer out the WTO; we should remain within it. However, we should not \nbe slaves to it to the point of neglecting the interests of U.S. \nfarmers just because of WTO limitations.\n  Here is the data. This chart is complex, but under the so called \n``amber'' box we are allowed every year $19.1 billion to spend on \nsupport for agriculture in this category. That is what the concern is \nabout. Right now the ceiling is $19.1 billion. That is what we are \nallowed to spend under WTO annually. Right now, the yellow is where we \nare, at a little over $11 billion. Under the projections of S. 1731, \nthe bill before the Senate, under the baseline projection, we will go \nup to slightly less than $15 billion over the 5 years, in any given \nyear over the 5 years; the maximum would likely be right at $16.6 \nbillion--a lot less than the $19.1 billion we are allowed.\n  To hear some Members talk, one would think our support to U.S. \nfarmers ought to be way down here. But as my colleague from North \nDakota, Senator Conrad, pointed out, time and time again, if we are \ndown there, we are unilaterally disarming against the Europeans who are \nway up here. My point is, under the bill in the Senate, we are nowhere \nnear coming to the $19.1 billion allowed under the WTO. I hope people \ndo not have some kind of scare tactics out there that we cannot do \nanything to have an effective farm program. We cannot have loan rates. \nNo, we cannot do that. We cannot have countercyclical payments. No, \nthat might disrupt WTO. I will point to this chart next week to show we \nare nowhere near the $19.1 billion.\n\n  My main objective on this farm bill is to have a sound farm bill for \nour farmers. My principal goal is not to satisfy the bureaucrats at the \nWorld Trade Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. I repeat that: My \nprincipal goal is to help farmers in America, it is not to satisfy the \nbureaucrats at the World Trade Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. We \nwant to stay under the $19.1 billion. And we will. But there is no \nreason we have to be so intimidated that we do not design a program \nthat utilizes fully our ability to operate within that $19.1 billion.\n  We have a safety valve in our bill. If the Secretary of Agriculture \nat any time estimates we are going to be above the $19.1 billion, she \ncan take action ahead of time, in an orderly manner, to limit our \nsupport to U.S. agriculture.\n  Second, in response to trade, we have been diligent in our farm bill \nin responding to the needs of our farmers to sell their products \nabroad. In this bill for five years, we devote $1.1 billion in added \nfunding to promote trade overseas, such as through the Market Access \nProgram and in the Foreign Market Development Program, Food for \nProgress, and a new biotechnology and trade program. Over 10 years, the \nCBO estimates that our bill would provide a total of $2.1 billion in \nadded funding for advancing our trade opportunities overseas.\n  Again, the bill we have before the Senate, S. 1731, came out of the \ncommittee on a voice vote and with a unanimous vote on all titles--you \ncannot get much more bipartisan than that; every single title was \nunanimous, except the commodity title. It was not unanimous, but it was \nbipartisan.\n  Senator Roberts earlier this morning said our bill would take us back \nto the failed agricultural policies of the past. I have heard that \nphrase so many times before--I thought we had given up on that phrase. \nWhich farm policy is he talking about that failed? Obviously the most \nfailed farm income protection policy we have had is the so-called \nFreedom to Farm policy of the last 5 years. Don't take my word for it. \nAsk\n\n[[Page S13264]]\n\nany farmer in America what they think about the Freedom to Farm bill. \nThey have suffered through years of depressed incomes and have had to \nrely on the uncertain prospect of emergency farm income assistance year \nafter year. You will not find a more failed agricultural policy in this \ncountry than Freedom to Farm.\n  But the Cochran-Roberts bill continues Freedom to Farm. That is all \nit is. It is the son or the daughter of Freedom to Farm. It is Freedom \nto Farm II. I say to all my friends in agriculture, if you like Freedom \nto Farm, you will love Cochran-Roberts because that is exactly what it \nis.\n  When my friend from Kansas, Senator Roberts, says the farm bill will \ntake us back to the failed policies of the past, he must be talking \nabout his own proposal because it is Freedom to Farm that has failed \nus.\n  What we do is we build four strong legs for farm income support in \nour bill. Yes, we do keep direct payments, but not as much as what \nCochran-Roberts does. Then we have modestly higher loan rates to help \nfarmers when they need it the most. We have a countercyclical payment \nto farmers when prices are low. And we have conservation payments to \nfarmers for being good stewards on their land.\n  The Cochran-Roberts bill is really focused on only one thing, direct \npayments, exactly what we have had under the failed Freedom to Farm. \nThere is a farm income stabilization account proposal, but it is only \nan add-on to the direct fixed payments. So if you have low prices, you \nget the same payment as you got when you had high prices.\n  I will admit that if we have high prices for the next 3 or 4 years, \nthe Cochran-Roberts bill will give farmers more money than what they \nwould get under S. 1731. That is what they told farmers in 1996. In \n1996 we had high prices for agricultural products. It was a good year \nfor farmers. So they said: Oh, what we will do is we will have these \ndirect payments out there. No matter what you get, we will have the \ndirect payments. It looked good to farmers. Then commodity prices went \nin the toilet, we had very low prices, and every year for the past four \nyears Congress has had to come in with an emergency bailout, emergency \nmoney for farmers. Is that what Cochran-Roberts wants? More of that? \nWhere every year we have to come back, again and again, for more \nemergency money for a failed farm program? That is what will happen. \nThat is what will happen if Cochran-Roberts is adopted. It will be just \nlike we had in the last 5 years.\n  At least under our bill we have better loan rates, loan rates that \nwill guarantee farmers that they will not get any less than a certain \namount. Couple that with our countercyclical payments, and farmers will \nknow that no matter how low that price goes, they will have income \nprotection at a set level. They are going to have that support in our \nlegislation.\n  My friend from Kansas said the problem with loan rates is you have to \nproduce the crop to get the loan rate. If you do not produce it, if you \ndo not get a crop, you don't get a loan rate. Every farmer knows that. \nThat doesn't come as any big revelation.\n  What he is saying is their direct payment is better because they put \nmore money into direct payments than into loan rates. So if the \nproducer does not have a crop, there is at least the higher direct \npayment. I am surprised to hear my friend from Kansas say that the \ndirect fixed payments are needed to cover crop loss. He has been taking \ncredit, with former Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, for being the author \nof the crop insurance reform bill that we passed last year. That bill \nbeefed up the crop insurance program, both in terms of loss of crops \nand in revenue protection. So not only do you have crop insurance but \nyou have revenue loss insurance. That is what crop insurance is there \nfor. That is why we put money into it.\n  The Senator from Kansas with good reason touted his crop insurance \nbill last year. Now he must be saying that crop insurance is not enough \nafter all to protect against crop losses. I don't know for certain if \nthat is what he is saying. I look forward to hearing from him on that \nquestion next week.\n  So that is what crop insurance is for. If you have a lost crop, that \nis why we have a very sound, good, crop insurance program. The reason \nwe have a loan rate is so at harvest time, when prices are the lowest, \nthat is when farmers need the money and that is when they can get that \nloan rate. And it goes to the farmer. It doesn't go to the landlord in \nthe way direct payments do. It goes to the farmer. That is where the \nloan rate goes.\n  The Senator from Kansas said farmers and lenders can bank on direct \npayments. He forgot one thing: And landlords can bank on it, too. There \nis probably nothing that has driven up land prices more and created \nmore of a land price bubble in the last few years than Freedom to Farm \npayments. AMTA payments are creating a land price bubble out there that \nhas created real uncertainty and risk.\n  So what our bill does is provide direct payments that phase down but \ncontinue. We also have modestly higher loan rates. We keep those loan \nrates at the set level. We don't allow the Secretary to reduce them.\n  Under the current farm bill, the Secretary may reduce loan rates. We \nsay she cannot any longer. We also establish a good countercyclical \npayment in case of low prices. And of course we have our direct \npayments under the conservation program.\n  So, again, that is why I believe S. 1731 is a more balanced bill. It \nis one that has a safety net for farmers. Yes, I will be the first to \nadmit that if prices are high--they aren't now--but if prices are high, \nfarmers will receive more payments under Cochran-Roberts. If you \nbelieve the prices will be high, as they were in 1996, you may want to \nvote for Cochran-Roberts. But if you think we will have some years \nwhere prices are low, as they are now our bill is the better bill. And \nlook at the projections. We are not having projected huge increases in \nprices in our commodities in the next few years. S. 1731, the bill that \nis before us, the committee-passed bill, is the one that provides that \nsafety net to farmers.\n  Last, I want to thank so much our majority leader, a valuable member \nof our committee. He is someone who knows agriculture intimately, who \nhas spent his entire adult life, in both the House and the Senate, \nworking on behalf of farmers. Senator Daschle has provided the \nleadership that we need to get this farm bill through committee and \nhere on the floor. He has taken that leadership position to make sure \nthat our farmers have that safety net, that we have good conservation \nprograms, and other programs in this bill, including especially the new \nenergy title in this farm bill.\n  I pay my respects to Senator Daschle for his great leadership on \nthis. He has provided that leadership because he knows what the \nfarmers, not only of South Dakota, need, but he knows what farmers all \nacross this country need. They need the bill we passed out of \ncommittee. And we need to get it done.\n  We are here on Friday. We will be back again the first of the week. \nWe will have another cloture vote on Tuesday, and we will see if our \nRepublican colleagues are willing to let us come to closure on this \nbill.\n  I say to my good friend from Indiana--and he is my friend; I know we \nhave a little disagreement here on some aspects of this bill, but this \nis the crucible of democracy, to work these things out. Senator Lugar \nknows I respect him highly and have great admiration for him.\n  I hope we can obtain a finite list of amendments; I hope we can list \nthose amendment and bring this bill to closure early next week. The \nfarmers and rural communities of America are demanding this. They need \nit. They need it before the new year comes. I am hopeful next week we \ncan bring this to a close and we can give the farmers the Christmas \npresent they need and they deserve, and that is a farm bill that they \ncan count on, one that will shore up farm income, one that will keep us \nwithin the WTO limits, but also one that will make sure that if there \nare low prices, we are going to be there for our farmers and we are \ngoing to have a countercyclical payment and we will have that safety \nnet there for farmers which we have not had in the present farm bill.\n  Again, I hope we can bring this matter to a close early next week.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2604, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send to the desk a technical \nmodification of my amendment No. 2604.\n\n[[Page S13265]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dorgan).

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate the comprehensive statement \nthe chairman has just concluded. Likewise, I have appreciated the \nstatements of Senator Roberts and Senator Cochran because they have \nalso given a comprehensive view of their thinking regarding their \nsubstitute amendments. Senator Burns of Montana offered constructive \namendments this morning, as did Senator Wellstone, to initiate our \nprocess earlier in the morning.\n  I believe it has been a good day, a constructive debate. Senators who \nare following the farm bill debate have a pretty good idea of the \nparameters of the present discussion and likewise the choices that are \ngoing to be before us on Tuesday when amendments come up for further \ndebate and votes.\n  Let me interject into the debate today what I thought was a timely \neditorial which appeared in the editorial page of the Washington Post \nthis morning. I was startled by the headline of the editorial, which \nis: ``A Piggy Farm Bill''.\n  It says:\n\n       The Farm bill that Democratic leaders--Majority Leader Tom \n     Daschle, Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin--are \n     trying to push through the Senate before Congress adjourns \n     for the holidays is obscene.\n\n  Those are very strong words to describe legislation we are now \ndiscussing.\n\n       It would institutionalize the insupportable excesses of the \n     past few years, in which billions of dollars in supposedly \n     emergency payments have regularly been made to some of the \n     nation's largest and least-needy producers.\n       In the House, the Republican leadership won approval of a \n     similar bill over mild administration objections in October. \n     Senate passage would make the indulgent policy hard to alter \n     when Congress reconvenes and the bills are put before a \n     House-Senate conference committee next year. Farm lobbyists \n     and their congressional supporters would far rather the \n     Senate vote now than then, when the excessive supports in the \n     bill are likely to look less affordable. But that's all the \n     more reason why the Senate should delay.\n\n  I am not in agreement that the Senate should delay, but I do take at \nleast some cognizance of the Washington Post's evaluation of where \nthings stand to date.\n\n       Congressional Republicans passed a farm bill in 1996 that \n     was supposed to reduce producers' reliance on government \n     payments; they would provide for the market instead. Still in \n     effect, that act provides basic payments mainly to grain and \n     cotton producers of roughly $10 billion a year. In each of \n     the past few years, however, Congress has also provided \n     billions of additional ``emergency'' payments. The effect of \n     the new bill would be to regularize those, thereby abandoning \n     the five-year experiment in supposed market reform.\n\n  That is a severe indictment that this farm bill abandons the \nphilosophy of Freedom to Farm in 1996.\n  I continue with the editorial:\n\n       Some of the extra money in the Harkin bill--a couple of \n     billion a year--would be directed to conservation programs. \n     The policy is good, and the political effect has been to buy \n     off environmental groups that might otherwise have opposed \n     the broader pig-out in which they now share. A little of the \n     extra would also be used to shore up the food stamp and \n     lesser feeding programs for the poor. But these are \n     relatively small amounts and a sop to conscience.\n       Sen. Richard Lugar tried the other day to change the \n     priorities in the bill--limit the farm supports, spread them \n     across more producers and use the bulk of the savings to \n     strengthen the feeding programs, especially food stamps, \n     which have been allowed to wither a bit. He lost 70 to 30; \n     only three Democrats supported him. It's possible there will \n     be other such efforts before the bill is passed. This bill is \n     not redeemable, but it is improvable. At the very least, a \n     larger share of the enormous sum could be spent on people in \n     need instead of on large producers who love to preach free \n     enterprise but not to practice it. Is that not something \n     Democrats support?\n\n  We still have an opportunity to make substantial improvements on the \npriorities as well as the aspects of programs in which moneys provide a \nsafety net, provide proper incentives to produce for the market, and \nprovide support for our trade negotiators.\n  Each one of us at one time or another has given many speeches about \nthe salvation of American agriculture coming from the great productive \nmechanism of our farm situation and exports and feeding people around \nthe world--the humanitarian aspects as well as the commercial ones. \nThat has been elusive for a great number of reasons--some beyond our \ncontrol as the European Community and others have stymied these \nefforts. Nevertheless, our farm bill should not do so.\n  I appreciate the chairman's careful attention to the green and amber \npayment situation of the WTO. I have no doubt this is going to come \ninto play in the event we pass a farm bill coincident with that which \nnow lies before us without taking more precautionary measures. That \nconcerns me and a good number of others who are simply interested in \nthe prosperity of this country generally. Movement of goods and \nservices in foreign trade I believe will enhance all of our wealth, \nespecially that of agricultural America.\n  I think we have to take a look at priorities. I thought the initial \namendment offered this morning by Senator Wellstone of Minnesota was \nvery interesting. It clearly has the effect of limiting payments to \nlarge feeding operations. The whole intent of it was to suggest that \nthe import of the current bill that lies before us might stimulate \noverproduction of livestock and further subsidize the overproduction. I \nthink he is probably right.\n  What we are doing with regard to the row crops--the so-called program \ncrops--in a very big way stimulates overproduction, and has for the \npast 5 years, and is bound to do more of this. That is what I find to \nbe very difficult as I look at the future and see a farm bill \ndeliberately creating overproduction and low prices.\n  The cycle of this, Mr. President, as you well know, is that prices go \nlower,\n\n[[Page S13266]]\n\nand people give speeches that they can't ever think of a time when they \nwere lower and, therefore, an emergency payment is needed. And it is \ndebated first in June, July, and August with regularity, fully \npredictable. It is fully predictable now in the event we pass this \nbill.\n  Despite all the protestations to the contrary, we will be back. The \ndistinguished chairman will hear the drumbeat of persons who want him \nto bring another farm bill out 6 months after he passes this one to \nremedy the deficiency. There will be low prices created by \noverproduction and stagnation in world trade, which exacerbates the \nproblem.\n  There could be a year in which the weather situation is truly \ndisastrous. I remember such a year in 1988 in which as many as 20 \nStates, as I recall, had such severe weather problems, and a delegation \nof Senators talked to President Reagan in the White House and advised \nhim that literally half the country and most of the agricultural \ncountry had been devastated by drought in particular. And the President \nsupported a fairly large emergency proposition at that time.\n\n  Usually, as the distinguished chairman has pointed out, the weather \ndevastation situations are less than 20 States, and therefore Senators \ncome a crop at a time, or whatever happens to have been in harm's way.\n  As Senator Harkin complimented Senator Cochran earlier on, Senator \nCochran, at least in recent years, often had been there to add money to \nthe Agriculture appropriations bill to help those folks out. But that \nreally has not been enough.\n  The general proposition is that prices are low and, therefore, a \ndouble AMTA payment has been sent out. The chairman has pointed out \ncorrectly, the AMTA payments may not be the proper vehicle for total \nequity. They may include people who no longer are in farming but had a \nhistory, as in the 1996 bill. But for purposes of efficiency, so money \nwould get to farmers, the rolls are there at USDA. They have been \nutilized. The money was gone as of the end of August of this year. It \nwas received, to the applause of country bankers who were assured of \ngetting repaid and farmers who were thinking about getting back in the \nfield again. I understand that, as does the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer.\n  All I am pointing out is that I had hoped, in this farm bill, we \nwould not repeat this cycle of predictable results. It does not do \njustice to farmers in the United States who, at some point, do want to \nproduce for the markets and do want to have a safety net that is not \nunpredictable. And any safety net based upon loan rates is certainly \nunpredictable. It may, in fact, be a cap on prices as opposed to a \nsupport.\n  I hope that some version, at least, of the concept I presented--\nnamely, that farmers have assurance of some percentage of income every \nyear, some money with which to purchase that assurance--I think, in \nfact, mechanisms, through bipartisan wisdom, have been set up in the \ncrop insurance program that provide the mechanics for that kind of \nsafety net.\n  I had attempted to propose a formula in which--using whole farm \nincome applicable to all 50 of our States equally and to all crops and \nall livestock operations--money would be provided through a voucher, \nbut money, indeed, from the Federal Government, a transfer payment from \ntaxpayers to assure a safety net for farmers, but with assurance, year \nin and year out, of a certain stream of revenue.\n  If Senators were to suggest that perhaps 80 percent, as a \nproposition, is too low a net, I would certainly be prepared to take \npencil and paper in hand with any Senator and try out 85 percent. That \nis the level of crop insurance that I purchased for my own farm \noperation this year under the policies we have adopted. I think that is \na sound thing to do, and to have a marketing strategy based upon the \ncertainty you have 85 percent of your crop before you even plant it. \nThat is possible under current legislation and, in fact, I think to be \nencouraged with producers all over the country who are always at risk.\n  But I hope we will move toward more of a basis as I have suggested as \nwe proceed through the debate. I certainly will encourage that as I \nlisten to alternatives that are presented.\n  Mr. President, this concludes at least my thoughts for the day on the \nagriculture bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will just take a couple of minutes, not \nso much in response to the Senator. But as I listened to my friend from \nIndiana--the very thought-provoking speech he made--I had some further \nthoughts.\n  My friend, the Senator from Indiana, said that under the bill we \nhave, we could expect more emergency farm assistance bills. I know he \nsaid farmers will be coming to the chairman saying: We have to have an \nemergency bill.\n  If we continue on the present course, that will be true. But we have \nbuilt into S. 1731 a countercyclical payment program that has an income \nsupport wherein we should not have to come back.\n  I will say this: The reason we had--I believe for each of the last 4 \nyears--to come in and provide for emergency funding for agriculture for \nfarmers was because there was no effective safety net under Freedom to \nFarm.\n  I would ask my friend from Indiana to go back before Freedom to Farm, \nto go back before that was enacted--and I could be wrong; I have not \nresearched this thoroughly--but I cannot remember in all the years I \nhave been here that we came in with that kind of annual emergency \nfunding because of low prices for farmers. We came in, sometimes, with \ndisaster payments for a drought, flood or a hurricane, or something \nlike that, but we did not as far as I can remember--and I can be proven \nwrong--but I cannot remember coming in with legislation because prices \nand income were so low we had to pass emergency legislation to get \nmoney out to farmers broadly based all over America. That started with \nFreedom to Farm, when we took away that safety net.\n  If we continue on with the Freedom-to-Farm type program, I dare say, \nyes, you are right, they are going to be coming to me and saying: We \nneed emergency funding.\n  That is why I feel so strongly about the safety net provisions we \nenacted in S. 1731 with the countercyclical type of payments. If prices \nare low--and the lower they go, the larger the payment. On the other \nhand, if prices are good, then there is not the need for payments that \nmagnitude.\n  So under that scenario, I really do not see why we would have to come \nin with emergency legislation other than some naturally occurring \ndisaster or something like that, I say to my friend.\n  Mr. LUGAR. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator, I think, is historically correct. Within my \nmemory, we had the 1988 crisis with the 20 States. As I recall, we \npassed some legislation to alleviate that during the appropriations \nprocess. That is, at least, my recollection.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Wasn't that the credit bill we did then?\n  Mr. LUGAR. No. It was this huge emergency created by the drought. And \nmany of us were involved, in a bipartisan way.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Probably the Senator himself. The memory grows dim as you \ngo 13 years back in the farm business.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suppose my query is just this: You are correct, we have \nhad all these annual situations since the 1996 legislation. But in this \nparticular year, the Secretary of Agriculture, at the time we were \ndebating the emergency in August, pointed out the net farm cash income \nwas $61 billion. And this is historically an all-time high in terms of \nincome in the country. It was higher than last year, but the last year \nwas more than the year before that. In essence, even in the face of \nmuch higher net farm cash income, we have been reappearing.\n  The safety net under the bill we now have, of course, was these AMTA \npayments. These were the fixed payments that went to farmers regardless \nof what else happened. They were to diminish after 7 years, and have \nbeen heading down from, say, $5 billion of Federal expenditures into \nthe $4 billion range, and so forth, each year, and then the loan \ndeficiency payments, at least for certain of our rural crops.\n\n[[Page S13267]]\n\n  For example, in my State $1.89 for corn is the loan deficiency \npayment level, which means you have $1.89 regardless of what the market \nprice is, however low it may be recorded. At the time, admittedly, \n$1.89 seemed like a price that would not be approached as frequently as \nit now is.\n  During harvest time, we are regularly below $1.89 in terms of people \ncoming into the elevator at that point. So this has led to much greater \nFederal Government expenditures; $6 billion, I think, last year to loan \ndeficiency, and not just for corn but for other crops. But that was \nmeant to be the safety net. And it is arguable as to whether it should \ngo higher or lower. It depends upon the Federal outlays, I suspect, \nquite apart from the fact that more production occurs.\n  I saw yesterday, as perhaps the chairman did, on the cover of USA \nToday, their first page, a chart on soybean production in the country. \nSoybean production, right through the Freedom to Farm experience, had \nbeen going up every year. This year's crop is prophesied to be a \nwhopper and, clearly, an all-time high. Given planting intentions, it \nmight appear that next year's would follow.\n\n  I mention this because I hope the chairman is right. Let us say, for \nexample, his bill and the Daschle substitute are adopted, but as it \nturns out farmers think their incomes are not adequate. My point, I \nsuppose, has been that a part of the reason, even in the face of what I \nthink have been fairly record incomes in the aggregate, although not \nfor all States and not for all crops, and a fairly good safety net, is \nthat both of the political parties represented in this body have been \ncompetitive for the allegiance of farm voters and people who were \nsympathetic to farmers.\n  I admit, throughout these emergency bills, it has been my privilege \nto serve as chairman. I have stood with you or with Senator Leahy \nmanaging these bills. I was perfectly aware on our side of the aisle \nthat a large majority of our Members wanted more money for farmers. It \nappeared that was true on your side of the aisle. Whoever was managing \nthis legislation was left with at least the thought of trying to get it \nright technically so the farmers got the money in as soon a time as \npossible so, if there were emergencies, these were met, right now as \nopposed to the hereafter.\n  So we strove to expedite a process that clearly our membership \nwanted. That seemed to be true on the other side of the Capitol as \nwell.\n  None of these bills were vetoed by whoever was President during this \nperiod of time. If the White House had a budget objection to these, it \nwas pretty mild or nonexistent.\n  I mention all this because I think that helps explain a part of the \nimpetus for this bill. In other words, there is almost an annual \nexpectation of correction or of enhancement of whatever may have \noccurred. Most of us have voted for that. The two of us may even have \nhelped manage it in one form or another, to try to bring it into clear \nchannels, to have the proper hearings and committee meetings. It may \nvery well be--you are not discovering this but sort of enduring the \nprocess--that the expectations of Members on both sides of the aisle \nare very large when it comes to their States and their constituents. As \nyou strive to find a majority to vote for a farm bill, for a final \nproduct, to get the bill out and on to conference, you are forced daily \nto take into consideration the needs of various Members, some of them \nvery legitimate and poignant. In the same way on our side of the aisle, \nwe attempt to do likewise.\n  I say this not in sympathy because the chairman is a strong person \nand fully able to take care of himself and the situation. But I had \nhoped perhaps to try to guide the process in a different direction.\n  I would admit, having heard the debate and having seen the votes as \nrecorded dutifully by the Washington Post and others, 70 to 30 is not \nclose. I understand that. On the other hand, we were trying to find \nsomething that, as the chairman has pointed out, may have been too much \nof a change all at one time, may not have been completely understood in \nterms of the arithmetic, how people come out. So I accept that fact. \nBut nevertheless, I thought it was important to try to make some \narguments for maybe a new day somewhere over the horizon.\n  In the meanwhile, I will continue to work with the chairman with the \nproduct we have at hand.\n  One reason why it has not moved expeditiously is that I suspect there \nare still some lingering thoughts on both sides of the aisle about \nlimiting payments, for example. We heard a little bit of that from \nSenator Wellstone this morning with regard to the EQIP program and \nspecific extensions of livestock. I think we will hear more from the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair and maybe others who have been \nconcerned about the equities here involved. Therefore, in part, \nperhaps, the land bubble situation created not only, as the chairman \nsays, by the AMTA payments but by overextension, as people plant for \nthe program, fully supported by this, but sometimes at the expense of \ntheir smaller competitors who do not have the research background, the \ncapitalization, even the managerial skills, but for whom our farm bills \nhave been dedicated, the saving of the small family farm or even the \nmedium-size farm in a situation that appears to be more consolidated as \ntime goes on.\n\n  Each of these amendments that deal with limits will get into this \nphilosophically, and they are important to hear.\n  Senator Grassley's comments today about trade--and the chairman has \nresponded to that very ably--this is still a troubling area in which \nall the ramifications are not clear, and they do bump dangerously into \nthe 19.1 or the area of the charts that the chairman had which were \nhelpful in giving some idea as to where all of these different lights \nappear. We will have to be careful there because clearly we need to \nexport. We need if not an overall WTO breakthrough, at least a good \nnumber of bilaterals that will be helpful to us.\n  These are issues that are not easily resolved, but I think they will \nbe as we have debates commencing again on Tuesday, as these issues come \nup again.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman in a vigorous attempt as \nwe proceed on Tuesday.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate my friend's comments. Quite frankly, I find \nlittle with which I can disagree. Everything you have said is basically \ncorrect in terms of the historical analysis, where we are, and the \nvarious pressures that go on in the Chamber. We all understand that. I \nwill take a little bit of sympathy anyway. I don't mind. But we all \nhave these different demands and expectations, as the Senator full well \nknows from his stewardship of this committee in the past.\n  The only further thing I might point out again is the old numbers \ngame. Last year was the highest net cash income, things like that. We \nhave heard that before. I think I mentioned this to the Secretary one \ntime. I said: If your income last year was $1 million and mine was \nzero, our average is $500,000, so why should I have any help? So last \nyear the livestock sector in America did pretty darn well. The crop \nsector was low, but if you averaged it all out, it looked pretty good. \nIf you just look at the crops, we weren't in very good shape. That is \nbasically what this bill is about, the crops.\n  The last thing I will say again to my friend, I am not so upset about \nthe amount of money we spend on agriculture. The Washington Post \neditorial this morning, I know, called it a piggy bill. I said earlier, \nin honor of that I wore my piggy tie today. It has little pigs on it. \nWe are in favor of the little pigs.\n  I pointed out earlier--I don't know if my friend from Indiana caught \nthis--that I looked at historically how much of our GDP we spent on \nagriculture: In 1940, about four-tenths of a percent of U.S. GDP on \nagriculture; in 1963, .55 percent of U.S. GDP on agriculture; over the \nlast 3 years, two-tenths of a percent of U.S. GDP; under our bill, S. \n1731, projected about .13 percent of GDP. I don't think that is a lot \nof our gross domestic product, .13 percent to spend on agriculture. I \ndon't think that is a lot.\n  Again, we can debate on how the funds are spent. I do not agree on \nhow it all has gone out. The bigger you are, the more you get. Almost \nevery day we have had a hearing in the committee, I always ask the same \nquestion: Should we support every bushel, bale, and pound that is \nproduced in this country?\n\n[[Page S13268]]\n\n  That is what I think the debate ought to be--how we fashion those \nprograms to help shore up a safety net, but not to encourage people to \nget bigger and actually use the Government largess to help people get \nbigger and to artificially boost up land prices. Certainly, that is a \nprinciple motivation for my focus on greater support for conservation \nand on a new program of income assistance tied to conservation.\n  I have said enough on this matter today. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nimportance of the Food Stamp Program addressed in the farm bill. I was \nrecently surprised and dismayed to discover that a recent USDA study \nfound Oregon to have the highest rate of hunger in the nation. I think \nmy colleagues would also be surprised to discover how many people in \ntheir own home States go to bed hungry.\n  I have long been concerned that in many cases, children across the \ncountry are going to bed hungry simply because America's families do \nnot know about the resources available to them through the Food Stamp \nProgram. It is astounding to note that among persons eligible for this \nimportant program, participation rates dropped from 74 percent in 1994 \nto 57 percent in 1999. More worrying is the fact that participation \nrates are also low among working poor families with children and the \nelderly. With additional outreach and targeting, the Food Stamp Program \ncan make it easier for families to access the food support they need \nwith dignity. I am pleased that improvements to this vital program are \ncurrently being addressed on the Senate floor as part of the \nreauthorization of the farm bill.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity today to recognize the \nother side of nutrition support: our Nation's network of food banks. \nPlaces like the Oregon Food Bank in my home State are filling the \nplates of America. The Oregon Food Bank and its coalition partners have \nbeen working overtime to identify and address the root causes of \nhunger. Today, I would like to salute them for their hard work and \ndedication, which has come to fruition in the recent opening of a \nstatewide food recovery and distribution center, all under one roof. \nFood banks are a vital component of the safety net for America's \nfamilies, but they alone cannot meet every need. They are straining \nunder the growing demand for emergency food, but we can help them by \nmaintaining a strong Food Stamp Program.\n  In a country as blessed with abundance as ours, no family should go \nhungry, and I encourage my colleagues to support improvements to the \nFood Bank Program in the farm bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for years I have worked to decrease our \nreliance on foreign sources of energy to accelerate and diversify \ndomestic energy production. I believe public policy ought to promote \nrenewable domestic production that burns clean energy. That's why, \nearlier this year, I introduced the Providing Opportunities With \nEffluent Renewable, or POWER Act, which seeks to cultivate another \nhomegrown resource: swine and bovine waste nutrients.\n  The benefits of swine and bovine waste nutrient as a renewable \nresource are enormous. Currently there are at least 20 dairy and hog \nfarms in the United States that use an anaerobic digester or similar \nsystem to convert manure into electricity. These facilities include \nswine or dairy operations in California, Wisconsin, New York, \nConnecticut, Vermont, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Colorado, \nMinnesota, and my home State of Iowa.\n  By using animal waste as an energy source, a livestock producer can \nreduce or eliminate monthly energy purchases from electric and gas \nsuppliers. In fact, a dairy operation in Minnesota that uses this \ntechnology generates enough electricity to run the entire dairy \noperation, saving close to $700 a week in electricity costs. This dairy \nfarm also sells the excess power to their electrical provider, \nfurnishing enough electricity to power 78 homes each month, year round.\n  The benefits of using an anaerobic digester do not end at electricity \nproduction. Using this technology can reduce and sometimes nearly \neliminate offensive odors from the animal waste. In addition, the \nprocess of anaerobic digestion results in a higher quality fertilizer. \nThe dairy farm I referenced earlier estimates that the fertilizing \nvalue of the animal waste is increased by 50 percent. Additional \nenvironmental benefits include mitigating animal waste's contribution \nto air, surface, and groundwater pollution.\n  The amendment I am offering will allow livestock producers the option \nof developing methane recovery systems as a structural practice under \nthe Environmental Quality Incentives Program. This option will provide \nlivestock producers another opportunity when determining what is best \nfor the future of their family farms. Livestock producers will have the \nability to meet their own individual energy needs and possibly supply \ngreen, renewable energy to other consumers.\n  Using swine and bovine waste nutrient as an energy source can \ncultivate profitability while improving environmental quality. \nMaximizing farm resources in such a manner may prove essential to \nremain competitive and environmentally sustainable in today's livestock \nmarket.\n  In addition, more widespread use of this technology will create jobs \nrelated to the design, operation, and manufacture of energy recovery \nsystems. The development of renewable energy opportunities will help us \ndiminish our foreign energy dependence while promoting ``green energy'' \nproduction.\n  Using swine and bovine waste nutrient is a perfect example of how the \nagriculture and energy industries can come together to develop an \nenvironmentally friendly renewable resource. My legislation will foster \nincreased investment and development in waste to energy technology \nthereby improving farmer profitability, environmental quality, and \nenergy productivity and reliability.\n  This amendment is good for agriculture, good for the environment, \ngood for energy consumers, and promotes a good, make that great, \nrenewable resource that will reduce our energy dependence on foreign \nfuels. It is my hope that all of my colleagues join with me to advance \nthis important piece of legislation\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the consensus that \nhas been reached on dairy programs within the farm bill we are \nconsidering today. The farm bill, which needs authorization every 5 \nyears, not only addresses farm income and commodity price support \nprograms, but also includes titles on agricultural trade and foreign \nfood aid, conservation and environment, nutrition and domestic food \nassistance, agricultural credit, rural development, and agricultural \nresearch and education.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Harkin bill before us restores the \nsafety net for diary farmers in Maine and in 11 other States in the \nNortheast and Mid-Atlantic with a provision that will again give \nmonthly payments to small dairy producers only when fluid milk prices \nfall below the Boston price of $16.94 per hundredweight.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the successful Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact was allowed to expire on September 30. Throughout New England, \nthis compact literally kept small dairy farms in production. When it \nwas in effect, this compact paid for the program by adding a small \nincremental cost to the price of milk already set by the current \nFederal milk marketing order system, which determines the floor price \nfor fluid milk in New England.\n  Along with 38 of my Senate colleagues and the legislatures and \nGovernors of 25 States, I have made numerous attempts throughout this \npast year to have the compact reauthorized and a new Southern Compact \nauthorized. Dairy compacting is really a States rights issue more than \nanything else, as the only action the Senate needed to take was to give \nits congressional consent under the Compact Clause of the United States \nConstitution, Article I, section 10, clause 3, to allow the 25 States \nwho requested to compact to proceed with these two independent \ncompacts.\n  Unfortunately, we could not get a majority of votes for the Senate's \npermission to allow dairy compacting to go forward even though half of \nthe States in the country had requested this approval. So, since my \nnumber one agricultural priority has been to assure that Maine dairy \nfarmers have a safety net when prices are low that would\n\n[[Page S13269]]\n\nallow them to stay on their small family farms, I have attempted to \nbridge the gap with opponents of compacts.\n  I am very pleased that we were able to forge a compromise that is \nincluded in the Harkin amendment in the nature of a substitute to the \nAgriculture Committee-passed farm bill that pledges $2 billion to help \ndairy farmers throughout the Nation. Most important to me, the \nprovision provides $500 million to establish the very safety net for \nNew England dairy farmers, and also for farmers in the States of New \nYork, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and West Virginia, \nthat was provided by the Northeast Dairy Compact, that of monthly \npayments to producers when the price of Class I, or fluid, milk drops \nbelow the Boston, MA price of $16.94. These States \nproduce approximately 20 percent of the Nation's milk and under this \nprovision will receive about 20 percent of the funding, so this is a \nvery fair balance of payments.\n\n  Dairy farmers from other States will also benefit through a $1.5 \nbillion provision that will extend the current national dairy price \nsupport system for farmers in the other 36 contiguous States, requiring \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, to purchase surplus nonfat dry \nmilk, cheese, and butter from dairy processors, thus protecting the \nindustry from seasonal imbalances of supply and demand.\n  The authority for this price support system that pays $9.90 per \nhundredweight was due to expire this December, but was extended for 5 \nmonths, or until May 2002, in the fiscal year 2002 Agriculture \nappropriations bill. The farm bill before us extends both of these \ndairy programs for 5 years.\n  Do I believe this is the best way to fund dairy programs? In my \nestimation, the Northeast Dairy Compact was preferable because not one \ncent came out of Federal funds and it also had no appreciable effect on \nconsumer prices.\n  So, the provisions in the farm bill we are considering, \nunfortunately, will cost the Government $2 billion. This is not much \nconsidering the billions of dollars that go to for price supports for \nother farm commodities, but it is Federal money nonetheless. But, the \nreality is that compromises must be made to ensure that the majority of \nSenators feel that a consensus has been reached that they can live \nwith, and I thank the Senators from the upper Midwest, who did not want \na compact-like dairy program for their region but preferred direct \nyearly Federal payments, for working together with us on the dairy \nprovisions.\n  My motive throughout this year has been a simple one: I do not want \nto see one more small family dairy farmer in Maine, or in any other \nrural area of the country, go out of business. And I do not want to see \nany more acreage of pastoral farmland in New England, most of which has \nbeen in families for three generations, turned over to suburban sprawl. \nSo I am pleased with the compromise and feel that my goal has been \nreached, not for myself, but for the dairy farmers to whom I have \npledged not to give up the fight.\n  The farm bill before us also recognizes the diversity and regional \ndifferences in agriculture, and shifts $1 billion to voluntary \nagriculture programs, especially in regions that have been \ntraditionally underserved by past farm bills, such as my State of \nMaine, I want to thank the bipartisan group that worked with me through \nthe ``Eggplant Caucus'', an ad hoc group of bipartisan Northeast \nSenators, to make these funds a reality and for bringing regional \nequity through an increase in Federal funding to our States.\n  This conservation funding, for which Maine stands to receive a \nminimum of $12 million a year for the next 5 years, will help our \nfarmers improve water quality, restore wildlife habitat and stave off \nsuburban sprawl. In the past, more than half of our farmers have been \nturned away from conservation assistance because these popular programs \nhave not had the funding to meet the applcations.\n  More funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or \nEQIP, for instance, will allow many more farmers to enroll in contracts \nto manage natural resource concerns. The voluntary program offers cost \nshare and incentive payments and technical assistance to design and \ninstall practices for locally-designated natural resource priorities.\n  Another aspect of regional equity in the bill are provisions that \nimprove assistance to our Nation's fruit and vegetable growers, the \nspecialty crop sector. This growing sector of the U.S. farm economy \nrepresents almost one-fifth of all farm cash receipts and a growing \nportion of our Nation's agriculture exports. I am very pleased to note \nprovisions for a fruit and vegetable pilot promotion program and a USDA \npurchase program for specialty crops, providing funds so that the USDA \ncan purchase those fruits and vegetables that are the most prevalent \ncrops grown in the Northeast to be used in the Federal nutrition \nprograms, such as potatoes, blueberries and cranberries from my State \nof Maine.\n  I would like to add that I have heard from farmers in my State of \ntheir support for the creation of tax-sheltered savings accounts, or \n`'rainy day accounts'', to which farmers could contribute during \nprosperous years, and from which they could draw during lean years. \nWhile not contained in the Harkin bill, I believe this idea should be \nfurther explored on its merits, and would hope that the Senate would \nconsider hearings on this in the near future.\n  Taken in its totality, the Harkin bill gives our dairy producers a \nsafety net through a mutually agreeable dairy program, regional equity \nin the disbursement of federal funding for voluntary conservation \nprograms, funding for a variety of forestry programs important to our \nprivate landowners, and promotion for specialty crops grown in Maine. \nAdditionally, if Maine participated in all the options for the Food \nStamp Program, the State would realize approximately as much as $32 \nmillion over the next 10 years.\n  I believe the Harkin bill before us gives needed assistance to the \nagricultural community throughout the Nation. We should never forget \nthat these hard working men and women are responsible for providing our \nNation with the highest quality of a tremendous variety of quality food \nproducts easily accessible at our local markets and at the lowest cost \nof any nation in the world.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the farm \nbill before us.\n  While we have heard about many components of the bill today, I would \nlike to focus my remarks on the title that is of particular importance \nto me, the nutrition title. it is easy to forget how many people go \nhungry in the United States. The Department of Agriculture classifies \n31 million Americans as ``food insecure,'' meaning that they do not \nknow from month to month whether they will be able to get enough food \nfor themselves and their families.\n  Families with children are disproportionately more likely to \nexperience hunger. Last year, over 3 million children and 6 million \nadults in the United States were hungry to malnourished. Without the \nFederal Food Stamp Program, which provided nutrition assistance to over \n17 million people, the majority of them children, elderly people and \nthe disable, the number would have been far higher.\n  I am also acutely aware of the role the Food Stamp Program plays in \nhelping families leave welfare for work. The typical mother leaving \nwelfare is earning about $7 an hour and may not be able to get 40 hours \nof work a week. For a parent like that, food stamps can make a \ndifference between being able to feed the family and having to return \nto public assistance. A single mother with two children and a typical \npostwelfare income can double her income if she gets food stamps and \nthe EITC. If she gets both, she can almost reach the Federal poverty \nline. Without them, she often cannot make ends meet.\n  I supported the 1996 welfare reform law. Some of my original interest \nin the Food Stamp Program grew out of my desire to see welfare reform \nsucceed.\n  Knowing how important it was for people leaving welfare to stay \nconnected to programs like Food Stamps and Medicaid, I was disturbed to \nfind out that food stamp participation had dropped by more than a third \nsince we passed welfare reform, and the improved economy accounted for \nonly about half of the drop.\n\n[[Page S13270]]\n\n  Among single-parent families with earnings, the most common \ndemographic of people leaving welfare, food stamp participation dropped \n12 percentage points between 1995 to 1998. A recent study the General \nAccounting Office conducted identified a ``growing gap'' between the \nnumber of children in poverty and the number of children receiving food \nassistance. At the same time, emergency food providers reported that \ntheir clientele had changed since 1996.\n  On November 14, America's Second Harvest, the organization \nrepresenting our Nation's food banks, released it's annual ``Hunger in \nAmerica'' report, its results were chilling. The study found that in \n2001, 23.3 million Americans nationwide sought and received emergency \nhunger relief from our Nation's food bank network. This is nearly 2 \nmillion more people than sought similar services in 1997. And this, on \nthe heels of one of the longest periods of economic growth in recent \nhistory.\n  In addition to showing increased requests for aid, ``Hunger in \nAmerica'' report punctures the myth that hunger is only a problem of \nthe inner cities, homeless, or the chronically unemployed. The study \nfound that nearly 40 percent of the households that received assistance \nfrom us in 2001 included an adult who was working. Fully 19.7 percent \nof all the clients served by our network are seniors. This is up from \n16 percent in 1997.\n  The facts about children are even more disturbing. More than nine \nmillion children received emergency food assistance this year, which is \nroughly 2 million more people than the total population of New York \nCity.\n\n  The bill before us today takes steps toward recognizing that \nAmerica's food banks, churches, synagogues and mosques can play a part \nin feeding America, they cannot bear the burden alone, the Federal \nGovernment must play its part.\n  The nutrition title in the Harkin farm bill allows the Senate to step \nup to the plate so that we can play a real role on the team fighting \nhunger in our Nation.\n  Last year, working with many of you, the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee, and the former administration we were able to designate \n$5.5 million to be used for food stamp outreach and education, to get \nsome of these eligible families and children back on the program, $3.5 \nmillion has already been awarded to community organizations and \nemergency food providers across the country. These groups are taking \nimaginative steps to reach out to families in need, I encourage all of \nyou to find out more about the grantees in your area.\n  Last month, USDA announced that it would award an additional $2 \nmillion to State-community partnerships that wanted to test strategies \nfor enrolling more senior citizens in the food stamp program. \nCurrently, only 30 percent of eligible seniors participate. I am here \ntoday because outreach, while critical, is only the first step. We need \nto restore some of the cuts to food stamps made in 1996, and we need to \nimprove the program to make it work better for working families. The \nHarkin bill provides new funds to do just that.\n  Cuts in food stamp benefits were not part of achieving our basic \nwelfare reform goal of moving people from welfare to work. In fact, \nmany Republican and Democratic Members agree that one of the most \ndisturbing outcomes of the 1996 law is the one-third drop in food stamp \nparticipation and what GAO described as the ``growing gap'' between the \nnumber of children in need and the number of children getting food \nassistance.\n  A provision of the 1996 law also cut off food stamps to legal \nimmigrants. This was unnecessary to achieve the goals of the law, since \nover 90 percent of legal immigrants are working. We have succeeded in \nrestoring eligibility for children and elderly people who were here \nbefore 1996, but much more needs to be done. One of the results of the \ncutoff of adult legal immigrants has been a 74 percent drop in the \nnumber of citizen children of immigrants who get food stamps.\n  As we debate this bill, I would urge my colleagues to remember the \nmillions of children and families who depend on the Food Stamp Program \nto help them purchase the food our farmers grow. Without the Food Stamp \nProgram, it seems likely that the 17 million people currently getting \nbenefits would join the 9 million Americans who are hungry or \nmalnourished.\n  I would also urge my distinguished colleagues to consider the many \nprovisions in this bill that will improve the Food Stamp Program to \nbetter assist working families and finish the work of welfare reform by \ngetting families out of poverty.\n  I would call particular attention to would accomplish the following: \nrestoration benefits to legal immigrant children--most of whom are \nmembers of working families; making outreach and education a permanent \npart of the program; reforming the quality control system, making the \nprogram simpler and more accessible to working families; and providing \n3 more months of transitional food stamps for families moving off \nwelfare for work.\n  This important legislation would improve basic benefits for senior \ncitizens, people with disabilities, and working citizen and legal \nimmigrant families with children.\n  We have an obligation to our Nation to pass this title as it is, in \ntact. It is the least that we can do to do our part to accomplish our \ncollective goal of abolishing hunger in America once and for all.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the very real \nimportance of completing action on the farm bill, the Agriculture, \nConservation, and Rural Enhancement Act of 2001, which is now before \nthe Senate. It is my desire that we pass a comprehensive farm bill \nwithin the next few days to ensure that America's family farmers, \nranchers, consumers, and rural citizens have greater economic security. \nI wish to applaud my good friend and South Dakota colleague, Senator \nDaschle, for his superb and steady leadership on this issue, and for \nmaking certain this important farm bill legislation made it to the \nfloor for consideration before we adjourn. It is critical for us to act \npromptly, to conference with our House colleagues in an expeditious \nmanner, and for the President to sign a bill into law, as soon as \npossible. Much of the credit for our being able to discuss this bill on \nthe floor today has to do with our chairman, Senator Harkin, for his \nability to craft what is perhaps the most complex piece of legislation \none can imagine, and for his work to ensure the committee completed its \njob on the farm bill. Chairman Harkin included a number of items in \nthis farm bill that will serve to benefit South Dakota's family \nfarmers, ranchers, and rural communities, and I thank him for a job \nwell done.\n  Unfortunately, stall tactics are being employed by some in the U.S. \nSenate to prevent us from passing this comprehensive farm bill. While \nfamily farmers and ranchers are working hard to keep their operations \ncompetitive and running smoothly, some Senators are stalling, delaying, \nand placing road blocks in front of the ultimate passage of this bill. \nJust yesterday, on a vote to end excessive debate and delay on the farm \nbill, we did not garner the 60 votes necessary to remove the procedural \nslow-down hurdle known as a filibuster. This needless delay must stop \nand Congress must take action to pass a farm bill now.\n  I have repeatedly said it is crucial for Congress to complete action \non the farm bill, conference with the House, and send a bill to the \nPresident for his signature this year, if not very early next year, in \norder to ensure two very important things.\n  First, that we capitalize upon the $73.5 billion in additional \nspending authority provided by this year's budget resolution, because \ngiven the shrinking budget surplus and unprecedented demands on the \nfederal budget now, there are no assurances this money will be \navailable in 2002, when a new budget resolution will be carved out of a \nvery limited amount of resources. Second, that we mend the farm income \nsafety net now because the experience of the 1996 farm bill has \npainfully taught us that it does not provide family farmers and \nranchers a meaningful income safety net when crop prices collapse. \nThus, the need for a new farm bill is clear.\n  In the course of the last 4 years, the economic setting for family \nfarmers and ranchers in South Dakota and across the nation has reached \na serious and depressed level. Most farmers I talk to in South Dakota \nbelieve the combination of poor returns for crops\n\n[[Page S13271]]\n\nand livestock combined with an inadequate safety net in the current \nfarm bill may have inflicted irrevocable results, a loss of family \nfarmers, an economic recession in small, rural communities, and growing \nmarket power by a few, mega-operators and agribusinesses. While the \nfarm bill probably isn't intended to correct all of the problems in our \nrural economy, it should better sustain the lives of family producers \nand rural communities. Additionally, it should provide a more \npredictable safety net than the current farm bill.\n\n  The outlook for positive indicators in farming and ranching has been \ndimmed by a number of factors. For several years now, commodity prices \nhave collapsed, production costs have skyrocketed, and harsh weather \nhas destroyed agricultural production. Furthermore, meatpacker \nconcentration and unfair trade agreements have crippled the ability for \nindependent farmers and livestock producers to prosper. While some of \nus wanted to change the underlying farm bill in a way to alleviate \nthese tough conditions, we were told the 1996 farm bill was a sacred \ncow that could not be touched, and efforts to amend it or to provide a \nbetter economic safety net were defeated. I am not suggesting the 1996 \nact was the source of all the problems farmers faced these last few \nyears, but the lack of a real safety net and low loan rates in the bill \ndid not provide fair support for America's agricultural producers.\n  Four years of ad hoc emergency assistance for farmers and ranchers \ntotaling approximately $23 billion, over and above farm program \npayments contained in the 1996 farm bill, has painfully taught us that \ndepressed conditions in rural America matched with an inadequate safety \nnet resulted in a very expensive price tag for U.S. taxpayers as well. \nFortunately, today we have a chance to improve farm policy, providing \nfamily farmers and ranchers with a better farm bill containing a more \nmeaningful safety net. Moreover, it is my hope this bill provides \ntaxpayers with some assurance that the need for multi-billion dollar ad \nhoc emergency programs will be forestalled.\n  While it is not perfect, I am pleased that a number of my farm bill \npriorities, and the priorities of South Dakota farmers and ranchers, \nare included in S. 1731, the Senate farm bill. First, the bill passed \nout of the Senate Agriculture Committee includes my legislation, S. \n280, the Consumer Right to Know Act of 2001, requiring country of \norigin labeling. It requires country of origin labeling for beef, pork, \nlamb, and ground meat, fruits, vegetables, peanuts, and farm-raised \nfish. The House farm bill only includes country of origin labeling for \nfruits and vegetables. Also, my carcass grade stamp legislation was \nadded to the Senate farm bill. It prohibits the use of USDA quality \ngrades, such as USDA Prime or USDA Choice, on imported meat. This \nprovision is not in the House farm bill. The country of origin labeling \nlanguage in the bill is supported by a clear majority of American \nproducers and consumers, as is demonstrated by the fact the largest \nconsumer and farm groups in the country have written me in support of \nthis bill.\n  I would like to insert in the Record a series of four letters \nexpressing strong support for my country of origin labeling language in \nthe Senate farm bill. The letters are as follows: first, a letter \nsigned by the overwhelming majority of cattle producing groups in the \nUnited States, signed by 55 cattle organizations, from Alabama to \nIdaho, from California to New Jersey, and everywhere in between. These \n55 cattle groups say, ``The U.S. cattle industry has invested \nconsiderable time, effort, and money to improve, promote, and advertise \nits finished product U.S. beef. The cattle industry now needs the \nability to identify its beef from among the growing volume of beef \nsupplied by foreign competitors. The ability to differentiate domestic \nbeef from foreign beef is necessary to ensure that U.S. cattle ranchers \nhave a competitive, open market that allows consumer demand signals to \nreach domestic cattle producers. It is now time to take the next \nlogical step and require country-of-origin labeling so consumers can \nidentify the beef U.S. cattlemen have worked so hard to promote.''\n  Second, a letter from the two largest farm organizations in the \nUnited States, the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National \nFarmers Union. It is comforting to know we have the full support of \nthese two groups. Third, I also received a letter signed by 87 farm, \nranch, and consumer organizations, in support of my country of origin \nlabeling legislation which was added to the farm bill in the \nAgriculture Committee. Some of the 87 groups signing this letter \ninclude most of the Florida and California fruit and vegetable \nassociations, the major consumer groups in the United States, and \nnational farm and ranch groups. Moreover, approximately half of all the \nFarmers Union and Farm Bureau state organizations signed this letter. \nThese 87 groups say, ``We seek your support for inclusion of a measure \nto provide mandatory country of origin labeling for fresh produce and \nmeat products in the Senate farm bill. American consumers prefer to \nknow where their food is grown.''\n\n  Finally, I have a letter from three of the largest consumer groups in \nthe United States, the Consumer Federation of America, the National \nConsumers League, and Public Citizen, expressing their strong support \nfor country of origin in the farm bill. These groups say, ``When the \nSenate takes up the farm bill, please support legislation to require \ncountry of origin labeling at retail for meat and fresh fruits and \nvegetables. We thank Senator Johnson for introducing this legislation, \nthe Consumer Right to Know Act of 2001, S. 280. Please oppose efforts \nto water down country of origin labeling legislation by allowing \ndomestic origin labels on beef that has been slaughtered and \nprocessed--but not born--in this country.''\n  Some of the other groups supporting my country of origin labeling \nlanguage include; all of the SD farm, ranch, and livestock groups, the \nNational Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nNational Farmers Union, Ranchers Cattlemen Legal Action Fund of the \nUnited States, RCALF-USA, the American Sheep Industry Institute, the \nConsumer Federation of America, the National Consumers League, the \nWestern Organization of Resource Councils, the Organization for \nCompetitive Markets, the American Corn Growers Association, and 55 of \nthe State cattlemen and stock grower organizations. The National \nCattlemens Beef Association supports the carcass grading provision in \nthe Senate farm bill, which ensures that imported meat carcasses do not \ndisplay USDA quality grades at the retail level.\n  It has been brought to my attention that there are unique concerns \nabout how perishable agricultural commodities are labeled under the \ncountry of origin labeling provision in the farm bill. Unlike meat \nproducts that are oftentimes either wrapped or displayed behind glass, \nshoppers physically handle produce to evaluate such characteristics as \nsize or ripeness. Quite honestly, after being handled by a consumer, a \nfruit or vegetable item is not always returned to the original bin in \nwhich the product was displayed. For this reason, each individual \nproduce item may need to be labeled when physically possible to ensure \naccuracy about the country of origin information. I am confident the \nmethod of notification language in the labeling provision in the farm \nbill will ensure responsibility in information-sharing on the part of \nprocessors, retailers, and others under this act. Our language requires \nany person that prepares, stores, handles, or distributes a covered \ncommodity for retail sale to maintain records about the origin of such \nproducts and to provide information regarding the country of origin to \nretailers. Nonetheless, I understand retailers have some concerns about \nmaking sure they are provided with accurate information. Therefore, so \nthat we can be confident this is workable for retailers and others, I \nwould like to recommend to my lead cosponsor of this legislation, \nSenator Graham of Florida, that we consult with the growers, packers \nand retailers to develop a means to provide such labels or labeling \ninformation to the grocery stores.\n  Finally, I have learned that identical language for country of origin \nlabeling has been included in the proposed alternative amendment to be \noffered by Senator's Cochran and Roberts. After\n\n[[Page S13272]]\n\nreviewing that proposal and confirming that my provision is included \nword-for-word, I am driven further to see the farm bill conference \nreport finalized with the same country-of-origin labeling language. I \nfeel confident that the final version between my colleagues in the \nSenate and House will include the exact language for country-of-origin \nlabeling that is included in both S. 1731 and the Cochran-Roberts \nproposal. I believe that my colleagues will recognize the importance of \nnot only keeping the provision in the final farm bill, but to ensuring \nthat the language is not watered down by outside interests. Anything \nless is unacceptable to America's consumers and livestock producers.\n  Country of origin labeling and quality grade certification were \nintegral components in the proposed ``Competition Title'' which \nChairman Harkin included in his farm bill proposal. I led a bipartisan \neffort to include the Competition Title in the farm bill when one-fifth \nof the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, signed a letter I \nauthored to Chairman Harkin seeking this new Competition Title. \nRegrettably, the Competition Title was defeated, resulting in a win for \nlarge agribusinesses to continue to muscle their way into the \nmarketplace, only to hurt family farmers and ranchers. This is very \nfrustrating, considering the record profits made by agribusiness \nrecently; Cargill increased profits by 67 percent in the last quarter, \nHormel increased profits by 57 percent, and Smithfield increased \nprofits nearly 30 percent. Finally, Tyson, now the single largest meat \nprocessor in the world with its purchase of IBP, tripled profits in its \nmost recent quarter.\n  Conversely, crop prices took a nose dive so severe in September that \nit marked the worst 1-month drop in crop prices since USDA has been \nkeeping records, some 90 years now. We must inject some real \ncompetition, access, transparency, and fairness into the marketplace if \nwe are to see these tragic circumstances change.\n  That is why I authored an amendment which was accepted by a 51-46 \nvote in the Senate yesterday to prohibit meatpackers from owning \nlivestock prior to slaughter. This amendment was modeled after \nlegislation I crafted last year, S. 142, the Rancher Act. I thank \nSenators Grassley, Wellstone, Harkin, Thomas, Dorgan, and Daschle for \ncosponsoring this amendment. It prohibits meat packers from owning \ncattle, swine or sheep more than 14 days before slaughter. However, it \nexempts cooperatives as well as all producer owned plants with less \nthan 2 percent of the national slaughter. Packer ownership and control \nof livestock has been disrupting markets and hampering competition at \nthe farm gate level for a long time. This amendment is a major first \nstep towards correcting the problem. If this passes, packers will now \nhave less opportunity for self dealing and giving preference to their \nown supplies. Rather, they will have to go out on the market and \ncompete for livestock.\n  In addition to competition, another new farm bill strategy I promoted \nwas to increase the capacity of renewable energy produced on American \nsoils. Agricultural producers in South Dakota are poised to \ndramatically increase the production of ethanol and biodiesel for our \nNation, and the farm bill's energy title will provide incentives to \nmove those value-added opportunities along. Everyone should recognize \nthat home-grown, renewable fuels need to become an integral part of our \nnational security strategy, which is why I asked Chairman Harkin to \ninclude a new ``energy title'' in the farm bill. The energy title in \nthe Senate bill includes loan and grant programs to promote the \nincreased production of ethanol, biodiesel, biomass, and wind energy. \nThis is a landmark change to farm policy because neither the current \nfarm bill nor the new proposal in the House contains this innovative \nenergy title.\n  Farmers, ranchers, and their lenders also need some assurances that \nprice supports in the new farm bill will be predictable and meaningful, \nespecially in times of woefully low crop prices and rising input costs. \nAgain, this farm bill is not perfect, but, I remain confident the \nchanges made in the Senate proposal will better stabilize farm income, \nminimize the impact of catastrophic market losses, and reduce the \nfinancial risks associated with production agriculture. Specifically, I \nbelieve that the commodity support provided through loan rates, \ncountercyclical payments, and direct payments in the Senate farm bill \nis a significant improvement over the current farm bill.\n  The Senate bill retains total planting flexibility which has proven \nextremely popular among the Nation's farmers, moreover, it allows \nproducers the option to update their base acres and yields, using \nplanted acreage and yield data from 1998-2001, for the purpose of \nreceiving both direct (AMTA-like), payments and the new countercyclical \npayment, which is made when crop prices fall below a certain target \nlevel. While an outside observer may think it is only fair to base \npayments on a farm's current yields from crops that are actually \nplanted on a farm, remarkably, this is not the case with the 1996 farm \nbill. Rather, the current farm bill bases payments on what farmers \nplanted 20 years ago and calculates payments upon 20-year-old yields.\n\n  Therefore, this significant change to update yields and planted acres \ncontained only in the Senate farm bill may prove one of the most \nimportant ways we can improve support to South Dakota's farmers. Crop \nyields in South Dakota have made enormous advances over the last twenty \nyears, primarily because South Dakota farmers have become more \nproductive, efficient and prolific in their use of innovative cropping \nmethods and practices. I am very pleased that the Senate farm bill \nproposal offers a reward to South Dakota farmers for these yield \nimprovements. The direct and countercyclical payments will be made on \n100 percent of a farmer's updated base acreage and yield.\n  I am troubled by the fact that the alternative expected to be offered \nby Senators Cochran and Roberts, as well as the House-passed farm bill, \ndoes not reward farmers with an allowance to update their yields for \nbasing payments--yields used to make payments under the Cochran-Roberts \nand House bill will remain at 1985 levels. While updating base acres \nfor calculating payments, the House farm bill and Cochran-Roberts \nalternative do not benefit South Dakota family farmers for yield \nincreases or an update on yields to calculate support under the fixed \npayment and countercyclical programs. Moreover, the House farm bill and \nthe Cochran-Roberts alternative simply make payments on 85 percent of a \nfarmer's 20-year-old yields and updated acres. Unfortunately, these \nproposals perpetuate some of the most glaring failures of the 1996 farm \nbill.\n  Finally, the Senate bill continues the availability of 9-month \nmarketing loans or loan deficiency payments for program crops: wheat, \nfeed grains, soybeans, oilseeds, and new marketing loan authority for \nwool, honey, lentils, and chickpeas. The loan rates in the Senate bill \nare set higher than both the House bill, and the Cochran-Roberts \nalternative, because both proposals freeze loan rates at levels in the \n1996 farm bill. It appears to me that the Cochran-Roberts and the House \nfarm bill fail to recognize the desire that most producers have for a \nmodest increase in loan rates, as marketing loans and are one form of \ncountercyclical support.\n  As we take this legislation up in the Senate, I may work with my \ncolleagues to provide for more targeted payment limitations. The \ncurrent farm bill essentially contains meaningless payment limits, and \nthe House and Senate proposals aren't a whole lot better. We must \ntighten the payment limits and redirect benefits to small and mid-sized \nfamily farmers. The single most effective thing Congress could do to \nstrengthen the fabric of family farms across the Nation is to stop \nsubsidizing mega farms that drive their neighbors out of business by \nbidding land away from them. From 1996 to 2000, the top 10 percent of \nindividuals and farm corporations in the U.S. snagged two-thirds of all \nthe Federal farm payments and disaster aid, averaging $40,000 annually \nper individual. Conversely, the bottom 80 percent of farmers averaged a \nmere $1,089 per year. The current program especially hurts beginning \nfarmers because it increases the cost of getting a start in farming. \nCurrent farm legislation subsidizes and induces large farmers to engage \nin aggressive competition for market share by bidding up land values in \nhopes of becoming the high-volume, low-cost producers. By reducing the \nnumber of middle-size and\n\n[[Page S13273]]\n\nbeginning farmers, the current payment structure has deprived rural \ncommunities and institutions of the population base they need to \nthrive. We have the opportunity to stop millions of dollars going into \nthe pockets of large farms, in which the end result will be viability \nof family-sized farms and ranches.\n  Additionally, I may work to provide an amendment to the farm bill \nthat permits farmers to elect a pre-harvest `lock-in' price for loan \ndeficiency payments, LDP, prior to the time in which they harvest a \ncrop. Currently, when the local cash price for corn or wheat falls \nbelow a commodity's loan rate price, producers are able to receive a \nloan deficiency payment as one means of counter-cyclical support. \nHowever, experience under current legislation has uncovered some \nregional inequities in the marketing loan and LDP provisions. For \ninstance, when wheat harvest begins in Texas and Oklahoma in the \nSpring, the winter wheat crop in South Dakota and other Northern Plains \nStates is virtually still in its developing stage. During this time, \nwheat stocks are often low and local cash prices have been below the \nloan rate, therefore, wheat growers in southern States have enjoyed the \nopportunity to trigger large counter-cyclical support by receiving \nsizable LDP payments early in the harvest season.\n  Unfortunately, the farm bill prohibits wheat farmers across the rest \nof the country from receiving this same kind of support through an LDP \nat that same time. So, by the time July or August rolls around and \nwheat is ripe for harvest in South Dakota and other States in the Upper \nMidwest, oftentimes, a different set of market conditions limits \nfarmers' choices to secure an LDP. This is due to the fact that harvest \nis nearly complete, a surplus of wheat may be hanging over the market, \nand the difference between the cash price and the loan rate is not as \nlarge as in the Spring. Therefore, I may offer an amendment to allow \nfarmers to select an LDP prior to harvest.\n  The farm bill is about many national priorities, and I am pleased the \nrural development title of this bill addresses the small, rural \ncommunities that serve as the backbone of our economy. It is important \nthat our farm bill provide opportunities for value-added agriculture, \nsmall businesses, and rural communities. The level of funding for rural \ndevelopment initiatives in S. 1731 is a huge win for rural citizens and \ncommunities in South Dakota. Namely, I am pleased with the $75 million \nper year for value-added grants. South Dakota has been on the cutting \nedge of developing value-added projects in recent history. With the \nexpansion of funding for these grants, we can expect to see profits \nfrom value-added agriculture increase in South Dakota. As in much of \nthe Upper Midwest, unpredictable weather is a way of life for South \nDakotans. With $2 million in funding to acquire more weather radio \ntransmitters, people in rural communities can rest easy knowing they \nwill have better access to accurate and up to the minute weather \nreports as a result of the farm bill.\n  Additionally, South Dakota is one of the States included in the \nreauthorized Northern Great Plains regional authority in the rural \ndevelopment title. This Authority has access to $30 million per fiscal \nyear to provide grants to states in the Northern Great Plains Authority \nfor projects including transportation and telecommunication \ninfrastructure projects, business development and entrepreneurship, and \njob training. I applaud the chairman for all of his hard work in \nmaintaining a priority for America's rural communities.\n  A priority of mine, the Senate farm bill provides more emphasis on \nconservation than any farm bill passed by the House or Senate \nheretofore. Our bill contains a number of conservation programs, \nincluding a reauthorization of the very successful Conservation Reserve \nProgram and an increase in the total acreage eligible for the program \nto 41.1 million acres. While this is not the 45 million acre cap that I \nhave advocated with legislation in the past, it is a step in the right \ndirection. As we move forward to expand CRP, it is my belief that \nCongress and USDA must look at the criteria chosen by USDA to award \ncontracts to landowners. Too often, South Dakota producers and \nlandowners have been penalized by the Environmental Benefits Index \nwhich now requires very costly mixtures of seed varieties to be planted \non new CRP tracts. It is my hope we can apply some greater flexibility \nto the EBI so this program can be effective in South Dakota. I believe \nthe farm bill must direct more attention towards programs such as CRP \nwhich protect soil and water, promote habitat and wildlife growth, and \ncompensate family farmers and ranchers for taking measures to conserve \nour resources. Additionally, the bill includes a version of the Harkin-\nJohnson Conservation Security Program which is a new initiative placing \nemphasis on conservation practices that are compatible to working lands \non farms and ranches. Furthermore, the conservation title includes a \nreauthorization of my Farmable Wetlands Pilot, which is reauthorized \nthrough the life of the new farm bill, 2002 to 2006. This Farmable \nWetlands Program was crafted last year by South Dakotans to protect \nsmall and sensitive farmed wetlands and to compensate producers for \ntaking these acres out of production. When USDA would not \nadministratively implement this idea, Senator Daschle and I introduced \nlegislation which was signed into law. The legislation called for a \ntwo-year pilot program to enroll small, farmed wetlands, up to 5 acres \nin size, into CRP. I am very proud that South Dakota common-sense left \nan imprint on the conservation title of this farm bill with the \nextension of this Farmable Wetlands program. Finally, the conservation \ntitle contains a new Grassland Reserve Program to protect prairie and \ngrasslands across the country.\n\n  Finally, I am also pleased with the nutrition title within the Senate \nfarm bill that would ease the transition from welfare to work, increase \nbenefits for working families and children, simplify regulations \nwithin, and increase outreach for the Food Stamp Program. Given our \nNation's current economic conditions, it is especially important now \nthat we reach out and provide services to our South Dakota neighbors in \nneed. I would like to make special note of a provision included in this \nbill that would prevent the School Lunch Program from losing at least \n$100 million over the next 2 years by adjusting the way the program \ncounts the value of commodities in the program. I introduced \nlegislation earlier this year to prevent this problem, and I am pleased \nthat this provision was included in the committee version of the bill.\n  In agriculture, I think the best economic stimulus is a long-term \nstrategy that provides a meaningful income safety net for family \nfarmers and ranchers. Therefore, the farm bill is the economic stimulus \nfor rural America and family farmers and ranchers. The facts about the \nneed to act are clear. In September, crop prices experienced the most \ndramatic one-month price drop in recorded history. We must enact a farm \nbill to provide greater economic security to our Nation's family \nfarmers and ranchers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letters in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 2, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n         Forestry, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \n         and Forestry, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Larry Combest,\n     Chairman, House Agriculture Committee, House of \n         Representatives.\n     Hon. Charles W. Stenholm,\n     Ranking Member, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin and Combest, Senator Lugar, and \n     Representative Stenholm. The U.S. cattle industry invested \n     considerable time, effort, and money to improve, promote, and \n     advertise its finished product--U.S. beef. The U.S. cattle \n     industry now needs the ability to identify its beef from \n     among the growing volume of beef supplied by its foreign \n     competitors. The ability to differentiate domestic beef from \n     foreign beef is necessary to ensure that U.S. cattle \n     producers have a competitive, open market that allows \n     consumer demand signals to reach domestic cattle producers.\n       We strongly support the mandatory country-of-origin \n     labeling language passed by the Senate Agriculture Committee. \n     Specifically, we strongly support the following key elements: \n     (1) Mandatory country of origin labeling for beef, lamb, \n     pork, fish, fruits, vegetables, and peanuts. (2) Only meat \n     from animals exclusively born, raised, and slaughtered in the \n     United States shall be eligible for a USA label. (3) The USDA \n     Quality Grade Stamp cannot be used on imported meat.\n\n[[Page S13274]]\n\n       Several importing and processing industry groups are \n     aggressively working to weaken the Senate Farm Bill's \n     mandatory country-of-origin labeling language. They want to \n     eliminate the exclusively born, raised, and slaughtered \n     definition of origin. They also want to exempt ground beef \n     from among the meat covered by the legislation. We strongly \n     oppose any such changes as they would severely impair the \n     competitiveness of U.S. cattle producers.\n       Since 1987, the U.S. cattle industry has invested millions \n     toward a mandatory check-off program to research, promote, \n     and advertise beef. It is now time to take the next logical \n     step of requiring country-of-origin labeling so consumers can \n     identify the very beef U.S. cattle producers have worked so \n     hard to promote. Proper labeling of beef will benefit all \n     check-off contributors. The identification of meat in the \n     marketplace is also becoming increasingly important given the \n     global threat of bio-terrorism. Without labeling, we cannot \n     segregate or recall meat now flowing through our food \n     distribution channels if a contamination or outbreak were \n     announced by any one of our many trading partners. Finally, \n     consumers deserve to have accurate country-of-origin labeling \n     so they can make informed purchasing decisions.\n       We respectfully urge you to fully support the mandatory \n     country-of-origin language passed by the Senate Agriculture \n     Committee and now included in the Senate Farm Bill.\n           Sincerely,\n         Adams County Cattlemen's Association (Washington), \n           Alabama Cattlemen's Association, American Indian \n           Livestock Association, Baker County Livestock \n           Association (Oregon), Beartooth Stockgrowers \n           Association (Montana), Belgian Blue Beef Breeders, \n           Bent-Prowers Cattle and Horsegrowers' Association \n           (Colorado), Big Horn Cattlemen's Association (Wyoming), \n           Bitterroot Stockgrowers Association (Montana), Black \n           Hills Angus Association (South Dakota), Bonner-Boundary \n           Cattle Association (Idaho), British White Cattle \n           Association of America, LTD, Cattlemen's Weighing \n           Association (North Dakota), Colstrip Community \n           Stockyard Association, Crazy Mountain Stockgrowers \n           (Montana), Eagle County Cattlemen's Association \n           (Colorado), Fallon County Stockgrowers' and Landowners' \n           Association (Montana), Grant County Cattlemen's \n           Association (Washington), Holy Cross Cattlemen's \n           Association (Colorado), Idaho-Lewis Cattle Association \n           (Idaho).\n         Independent Cattlemen's Association of Texas, Kansas \n           Cattlemen's Association, Kansas Hereford Association, \n           Kootenai Cattlemen's Association (Idaho), Lane County \n           Livestock Association (Oregon), Livestock Marketing \n           Association, Minnesota Cattlemen's Association, \n           Mississippi Cattlemen's Association, Missouri \n           Stockgrower's Association, Montana Stockgrowers \n           Association, Nevada Cattlemen's Association, Nevada \n           Live Stock Association, New Jersey Angus Association, \n           New Mexico Cattlegrowers' Association, North Central \n           Stockgrowers Association (Montana), North Dakota \n           Stockmen's Association, North-East Kansas Hereford \n           Association, North Idaho Cattlemen's Association \n           (Idaho), Owyhee Cattlemen's Association (Idaho).\n         Pennsylvania Cattlemen's Association, Pueblo County \n           Cattlemen Association (Colorado), Ranchers-Cattlemen \n           Action Legal Fund, United Stockgrowers of America (R-\n           CALF USA), Sheridan County Stockgrowers (Wyoming), \n           South Dakota Livestock Auction Markets Association, \n           South Dakota Stockgrower's Association, Southeastern \n           Montana Livestock Association, Southern Colorado \n           Livestock Association, Spokane County Cattlemen's \n           Association (Washington), Stevens County Cattlemen's \n           Association (Washington), Utah Cattlemen's Association, \n           Valier Stockmen's Association (Montana), Virginia \n           Cattlemen's Association, Washington Cattlemen's \n           Association, Western Montana Stockgrowers Association, \n           Western Ranchers Beef Cooperative (California), Wyoming \n           Stock Growers Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 December 4, 2001.\n     Member,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the members of the American Farm \n     Bureau Federation (AFBF) and the National Farmers Union \n     (NFU), we write to urge your support for country of origin \n     labeling when you vote for the farm bill. The Senate \n     Agriculture Committee-passed farm bill requires mandatory \n     country of origin labeling for fresh fruits and vegetables, \n     peanuts, and meat products including beef, lamb, pork and \n     farm-raised fish.\n       Producers and consumers both benefit. Country of origin \n     labeling is a valuable marketing opportunity that may improve \n     the ability of U.S. producers to compete in a highly \n     regulated market and costly environment. Likewise, consumers \n     have expressed strong support for country of origin labeling \n     for agricultural products. According to a March 1999 Wirthlin \n     Worldwide survey, 86 percent of consumers support country of \n     origin labeling for meat products.\n       The U.S. General Accounting Office has reported that, \n     according to surveys conducted by the fresh produce industry, \n     between 74 and 83 percent of consumers favor country of \n     origin labeling for fresh produce. The Farm Foundation's, \n     ``The 2002 Farm Bill: U.S. Producer Preference for \n     Agricultural, Food and Public Policy'' indicates that support \n     for labeling the country of origin on food products is nearly \n     unanimous, with 98 percent in agreement, among producers.\n       The Senate Agriculture committee-passed farm bill requires \n     meat products, peanuts, and perishable agricultural \n     commodities to be labeled as to the country of origin. In \n     order to qualify as U.S.-produced, meat products must come \n     from an animal born, raised and slaughtered in the U.S. and \n     fresh produce and peanuts must be exclusively grown and \n     processed in the U.S. Language is included stating that there \n     will not be a system of mandatory identification imposed and \n     that a system will be based on a current program used by USDA \n     to verify that the animals are born, raised and slaughtered \n     in the U.S.\n       A significant number of U.S. trading partners have country \n     of origin labeling laws for produce and meat products. \n     According to the USDA's 1998 Foreign Country of Origin \n     Labeling Survey, the United States is among only six of the \n     37 reporting countries that do not require country of origin \n     labeling on processed meat. Since the time of the 1998 \n     survey, additional countries, such as Japan, have begun \n     requiring country of origin labeling of meat. In addition, \n     some 35 out of the 46 surveyed countries require country of \n     origin labeling for fresh fruits and vegetables.\n       Farmers and ranchers believe consumers have a right to know \n     where their food is produced. We hope that you will support \n     country of origin labeling as it moves to the Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Stallman,\n       President, American Farm Bureau Federation.\n     Leland Swenson,\n       President, National Farmers Union.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 October 30, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \n         Forestry U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition \n         and Forestry, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin and Senator Lugar: We are writing to \n     ask for your support for an initiative that will allow \n     consumers to make more informed choices about their purchases \n     of fruits, vegetables and meats. We seek your support for \n     inclusion of a measure to provide mandatory country-of-origin \n     labeling for fresh produce and meat in the Senate version of \n     the farm bill.\n       American consumers prefer to know where their food is \n     grown. In multiple national surveys, more than 70 percent of \n     produce shoppers support country-of-origin labeling for \n     fruits and vegetables. In Florida, where such labeling has \n     been the law for more than 20 years, more than 95 percent \n     favor produce origin labeling in stores. Consumer surveys \n     also indicate that 86 percent of Americans prefer labeling \n     country-of-origin for meat products.\n       The Consumer Right to Know Act of 2001 (S. 280) would \n     mandate point-of-purchase labeling for fruits, vegetables and \n     other fresh perishables, as well as meat products such as \n     beef, lamb and pork. Food service establishments would be \n     exempt. The bill grants USDA the authority to coordinate \n     enforcement with each state.\n       Of course, manufactured goods sold in the U.S. have carried \n     mandatory country-of-origin labels since the 1930s. Today, at \n     a time when retailers sell fresh produce from dozens of \n     countries, our nation's fruits and vegetables need to carry \n     that same important information. Furthermore, consumers are \n     misled into thinking the USDA inspected grade equates a \n     country of origin label for meat products.\n       Recently, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly \n     passed a similar country-of-origin labeling measure \n     (mandating labeling for fresh produce only) as part of the \n     farm bill package.\n       We urge you to consider the benefits of S. 280 and support \n     inclusion of it in the Senate version of the farm bill.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alaska Farmers Union, American Corn Growers Association, \n     Alabama Farm Bureau Federation, Arizona Farm Bureau \n     Federation, Arkansas Farm Bureau Federation, Arkansas Farmers \n     Union, Burleigh County Farm Bureau, California Asparagus \n     Commission, California Citrus Mutual, California Grape & Tree \n     Fruit League, California Farm Bureau, California Farmers \n     Union, Center for Food Safety, Consumer Federation of \n     America, Desert Grape Growers League of California, Florida \n     Citrus Mutual, Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer \n     Services, Florida Farm Bureau Federation, Florida Farmers & \n     Suppliers Coalition, Inc., Florida Fruit and Vegetable \n     Association.\n       Florida Tomato Exchange, Georgia Farm Bureau Federation, \n     Georgia Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association, Idaho Farm \n     Bureau Federation, Idaho Farmers Union, Illinois Farmers \n     Union, Independent Cattlemen's Association of Texas, Indiana \n     Farmers Union, Indian River Citrus League, Intertribal \n     Agriculture Council, Iowa Farmers\n\n[[Page S13275]]\n\n     Union, Kansas Cattlemen's Association, Kansas Farmers Union, \n     Livestock Marketing Association, Louisiana Farm Bureau \n     Federation, Maryland Farm Bureau, Michigan Asparagus Advisory \n     Committee.\n       Michigan Farmers Union, Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation, \n     Minnesota Farmers Union, Missouri Farmers Union, Mississippi \n     Farm Bureau Federation, Montana Farm Bureau Federation, \n     Montana Farmers Union, National Catholic Rural Life \n     Conference, National Consumers League, National Family Farm \n     Coalition, National Farmers Organization, National Farmers \n     Union, National Onion Council, National Potato Council, \n     Nebraska Farmers Union, New York Farm Bureau, New York Beef \n     Producers' Association, New York State Forage & Grassland \n     Council, New Jersey Farm Bureau, Nevada Livestock \n     Association.\n       North Dakota Farm Bureau, North Dakota Farmers Union, North \n     Idaho Cattlemen's Association, Northwest Horticultural \n     Council, Ohio Farm Bureau Federation, Ohio Farmers Union, \n     Oklahoma Farmers Union, Oregon Farm Bureau Federation, Oregon \n     Farmers Union, Organization for Competitive Markets, Public \n     Citizen, Pennsylvania Farm Bureau, Pennsylvania Farmers \n     Union, Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund (R-CALF USA), \n     Rhode Island Farm Bureau Federation, Rocky Mountain Farmers \n     Union, South Carolina Farm Bureau.\n       South Dakota Farm Bureau Federation, South Dakota Farmers \n     Union, Southern Colorado Livestock Association, Texas Farmers \n     Union, United Fruits and Vegetable Association, Utah Farmers \n     Union, Virginia Farm Bureau, Washington Farmers Union, \n     Washington State Farm Bureau, Western Organization of \n     Resource Councils (WORC), Wisconsin Farmers Union, Wyoming \n     Farm Bureau Federation, Wyoming Stock Growers Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 November 6, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: When the Senate takes up the 2001 farm bill, \n     please support legislation to require country-of-origin \n     labeling at retail for meat products and fresh fruits and \n     vegetables. Senator Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) has introduced this \n     legislation as S. 280, the Consumer Right to Know Act of \n     2001. Please oppose efforts to water down country-of-origin \n     labeling legislation by allowing domestic origin labels on \n     beef that has been slaughtered and processed--but not born--\n     in this country.\n       While not a food safety program, country-of-origin labeling \n     will give consumers additional information about the source \n     of their food. As a matter of choice, many consumers may wish \n     to purchase produce grown and processed in the United States \n     or meat from animals born, raised and processed here. Without \n     country-of-origin labeling, these consumers are unable to \n     make an informed choice between U.S. and imported products. \n     In fact, under the Agriculture Department's grade stamp \n     system, they could be misled into thinking some imported meat \n     is produced in this country. Country-of-origin labeling may \n     also assist small producers, many of whom are suffering from \n     low prices, consolidation among processors, and weather-\n     related problems.\n       Several food industry trade associations and two farm \n     organizations have proposed a voluntary ``Made in the USA'' \n     label for retailers who want to promote and market U.S. beef. \n     Their effort falls short on two counts. First, industry \n     already has voluntary labeling authorization and it has not \n     resulted in country-of-origin labeling for beef. In addition, \n     the industry proposal allows meat from cattle that have been \n     in this country for a few as 100 days to be labeled ``U.S. \n     Beef.'' This could mislead consumers into thinking a product \n     is of U.S. origin when, in fact, it is not. Meat products \n     identified as ``U.S. Beef'' or ``Made in the U.S.A.'' should \n     originate from animals born, raised, slaughtered and \n     processed here.\n       When country-of-origin labeling is discussed, two \n     additional issues invariably come up: cost and trade \n     retaliation. On cost, the General Accounting Office concluded \n     that country-of-origin labeling would increase costs for both \n     industry and government but that ``the magnitude of these \n     costs is uncertain.'' Federal law, however, already requires \n     country-of-origin markings on the packaging of all meat and \n     produce imported into this country. In addition, slaughter \n     plants already segregate beef carcasses by grade and grade \n     levels already following products to the retail level. How \n     costly would it be to expand these efforts to include \n     country-of-origin labeling at retail? In Florida, which has \n     had country-of-origin labeling for produce since 1979, it \n     reportedly costs less than $10 per month per store. In terms \n     of compliance, Florida says its program is ``not costly if \n     conducted by the same inspection authority that is usually in \n     food stores.'' Florida put statewide industry compliance \n     costs for country-of-origin labeling through 1998 at less \n     than $300,000 per year. Costs of this magnitude would be a \n     reasonable tradeoff to assure accurate labeling of meat and \n     fresh produce.\n       On trade, numerous foreign countries have their own \n     country-of-origin labeling requirements for perishable \n     agricultural commodities. Twenty-two of our own trading \n     partners--including Canada, Mexico, Japan and many members of \n     the European Union--have country-of-origin labeling for \n     produce. If our trading partners have these requirements, why \n     shouldn't we? In addition, many other consumer products, \n     including automobiles, must meet country-of-origin labeling \n     requirements in this country. Why should agricultural \n     products be exempt?\n       Many polls, including a 1998 CBS News poll and two polls by \n     the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, have found \n     overwhelming consumer support for country-of-origin labeling. \n     In Florida, more than 95 percent favor labeling produce by \n     country of origin.\n       Earlier this fall, the House of Representatives included \n     country-of-origin labeling for produce as part of its farm \n     bill. The amendment adding this provision passed by a wide \n     margin. Please support S. 280 or similar legislation when the \n     Senate debates its farm bill.\n                                                    Arthur Jaeger,\n                                   Consumer Federation of America.\n                                                     Patty Lovera,\n                                                   Public Citizen.\n                                                   Linda Golodner,\n                                        National Consumers League.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the past few weeks, the Committee on \nthe Judiciary has examined the administration's proposal to use \nmilitary tribunals to try suspected terrorists. I think our work has \nbeen very helpful and productive. We used the constitutional oversight \npowers of the Senate to hold a series of hearings on a number of recent \ndevelopments. Assistant Attorneys General asked to testify and we \naccommodated them. The Attorney General responded to a bipartisan \nrequest and we accommodated him with respect to the date and timing of \nhis participation. We had a dialog on the question of military \ntribunals. We heard from other witnesses at our earlier hearings and \nthrough the course of the last few weeks informally from literally \nthousands of people.\n  We did this because it appeared to many of us that we had sort of a \nunilateral edict on the part of the administration regarding military \ntribunals. We were hearing, from the left to the right, concern that it \nwas so unilateral that it might not stand constitutional muster. So in \nseeking as many voices on this as possible, we heard from some who \nendorsed wholeheartedly the use of military tribunals, others who said \nwe should only use our court system--the tried and tested method of the \ncourt system, and still others who said--and I find myself in this \ncategory--sometimes military tribunals can be appropriate provided they \nare duly authorized and provided there are reasonable limits and proper \nsafeguards for them.\n  I will put in the Record a copy of a letter from a large number of \nlawyers and law professors on this issue, and also a summary of some of \nthe things we found in our committee hearings. I also include a \nproposal. I put this in the Record because I know Senators have been \nconsidering proposals for a military tribunal. Several Members of both \nparties have come forward with very constructive suggestions. I want to \nmake sure if we are going to use military tribunals, we bring the \nprocedure into compliance with international law, but with treaty \nobligations we have elsewhere. I want to make sure we set out very \nclearly the question of what our limits are, what the U.S. says about \nmilitary tribunals.\n  We all know our various Presidents over the years have had to call \nother countries and say: You are holding an American. You can't put \nthat American before a secret military tribunal. There have to be \nsafeguards and we have to know what is going on. Certainly, you must \ncarry out your own laws, but let's do it in the open and make sure they \nhave a chance to speak, that they know what the evidence is against \nthem, and that they have a chance for appeal.\n  A military tribunal is not a court-martial. Our courts-martial in the \nUnited States follow very specific procedures--in fact, some of the \nbest in the world. If it is simply a question of these being, in \neffect, a court-martial, I don't think there would be any problem.\n  But what is a military tribunal? Senators have asked: Does it mean \nthat a bare majority, or even less, could vote for the death penalty? \nWhat is the standard of proof? Is it mere suspicion, or is it \npreponderance of the evidence,\n\n[[Page S13276]]\n\nor is it beyond a reasonable doubt? Does the person accused have any \nchance to give any kind of a defense? These are all issues that should \nbe laid out.\n  If we are going to use military tribunals, let's make sure we are \nputting forth the best face of America. We have so much for which to be \nproud. We have a great deal to be proud of in our civil courts and in \nour military courts. At a time when we are asking nations around the \nworld to join us in our battle against these despicable acts of \nterror--the acts we saw on September 11 in New York, the Pentagon, and \nin a lonely field in Pennsylvania--as we properly and appropriately \ndefend ourselves and seek to eradicate the source of this terror, let's \nmake sure, as we line up countries around the world to join us in that \nbattle, that we keep those countries as our allies for further battles. \nEven after bin Laden is gone--and eventually he will be--there will be \nother terrorists--if not now, in later years. We want to make sure that \ncountries join with us in the battle against terrorism, respecting the \nfact that we uphold our Constitution and our highest ideals as \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13276-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13276-S13280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE CONTINUING DEBATE ON THE USE OF MILITARY COMMISSIONS\n\n  Assistant Attorney General Chertoff testified on November 28 before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee that ``the history of this Government in \nprosecuting terrorists in domestic courts has been one of unmitigated \nsuccess and one in which the judges have done a superb job of managing \nthe courtroom and not compromising our concerns about security and our \nconcerns about classified information.''\n  I am proud that the Senate Judiciary Committee is playing a role in \nsponsoring this national debate, and I appreciate the participation and \ncontributions of all members of the committee--no matter their point of \nview. Leading constitutional, civil rights and military justice experts \nhave generously shared their time and analyses with the committee, as \nwell as the Attorney General and other representatives of the \nDepartment of Justice. No one participant, no one person, and no one \nparty holds a monopoly on wisdom in this Nation. I know that spirited \ndebate is a national treasure. I know what the terrorists will never \nunderstand, that our diversity of opinion is not a weakness but a \nstrength beyond measure.\n  I do not cast aspersions on those who disagree with my views on this \nsubject. I do not challenge their motives and seek to cower them into \nsilence with charges of ``fear mongering.'' I challenge their ideas, \nand praise them as patriots in a noble cause.\n  Already, our oversight has provided a better picture of how the \nadministration intends to use military commissions. According to \nWilliam Safire of the New York Times, Secretary of Defense Donald \nRumsfeld called the discourse over military commissions ``useful'' and \nis reaching outside the Pentagon for input. It now appears that the \nadministration is reconsidering some of the most sweeping terms of the \nPresident's November 13 military order. On its face, that order has \nbroad scope and provides little in the way of procedural protections, \nbut the more recent assurances that it will be applied sparingly and in \nfar narrower circumstances than is suggested by the language of the \norder have been helpful. While the Judiciary Committee hearings were \nongoing, the administration clarified its plans for implementation of \nthe military order in five critical aspects.\n  First, as written, the military order applies to non-citizens in the \nUnited States, which according to testimony before the committee would \ncover about 20 million people. Two days after we began our series of \nhearings, the President's counsel indicated that military commissions \nwould not be held in the United States, but rather ``close to where our \nforces may be fighting.'' Anonymous administration officials have also \nindicated in press reports that there is no plan to use military \ncommissions in this country but only for those caught in battlefield \noperations.\n  Second, the White House counsel has also indicated that the order \nwill only apply to ``non-citizens who are members or active supporters \nof al-Qaida or other international organizations targeting the United \nStates'' and who are ``chargeable with offenses against the \ninternational laws of war.''\n  Third, while the military order is essentially silent on the \nprocedural safeguards that will be provided in military commission \ntrials, the White House counsel has explained that military commissions \nwill be conducted like courts-martial under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice. I have great confidence in our courts-martial system, \nwhich offers protections for the accused that rival, and in some cases \neven surpass, protections in our Federal civilian courts and includes \njudicial review.\n  Fourth, nothing in the military order would prevent commission trials \nfrom being conducted in secret, as was done, for example, in the case \nof the eight Nazi saboteurs that has most often been cited by the \nadministration as its model for this order. However, Mr. Gonzales \nassured us that ``Trials before military commissions will be as open as \npossible, consistent with the urgent needs of national security.'' Mr. \nChertoff's testimony before the committee was along the same lines.\n  This is in sharp contrast to the statements before our hearings that \nthe ``proceedings promise to be swift and largely secret, with one \nmilitary officer saying that the release of information might be \nlimited to the barest facts, like the defendant's name and sentence.''\n  Finally, the order expressly states that the accused in military \ncommissions ``shall not be privileged to seek any remedy or maintain \nany proceeding, directly or indirectly . . . in (i) any court of the \nUnited States, or any State thereof, (ii) any court of any foreign \nnation, or (iii) any international tribunal.'' Yet, the \nadministration's most recent statements are that this is not an effort \nto suspend the writ of habeas corpus.\n  These explanations of the military order by both anonymous and \nidentified administration representatives suggest that, one, the \nadministration does not intend to use military commissions to try \npeople arrested in the United States; two, these tribunals will be \nlimited to ``foreign enemy war criminals'' for ``offenses against the \ninternational laws of war''; three, the military commissions will \nfollow the rules of procedural fairness used for trying U.S. military \npersonnel; and four, the judgments of the military commissions will be \nsubject to some form of judicial review. We hope that the Attorney \nGeneral's responses to written questions from the committee will \ncontinue to clarify these critical matters.\n  The administration apparently contends that an express grant of power \nfrom this Congress to establish military commissions is unnecessary. \nThe Attorney General testified before the Judiciary Committee on \nDecember 6 that, ``the President's power to establish war-crimes \ncommissions arises out of his power as Commander in Chief.'' A growing \nchorus of legal experts casts doubt on that proposition, however. \nNevertheless, the administration appears to be adamant about going it \nalone and risking a bad court decision on the underlying legality of \nthe military commission. Why take a chance that the punishment meted \nout to terrorists by a military commission will not stick due to a \nconstitutional infirmity in the commission's jurisdiction?\n  I have received a letter signed by over 400 law professors from all \nover the country, expressing their collective wisdom that the military \ncommissions contemplated by the President's Order are ``legally \ndeficient, unnecessary, and unwise.'' More specifically, these hundreds \nof legal scholars point out that Article I of the Constitution provides \nthat Congress, not the President, has the power to ``define and punish \n. . . Offenses against the Law of Nations.'' Absent specific \ncongressional authorization, they say, the order ``undermines the \ntradition of the Separation of Powers.''\n  At our last hearing with the Attorney General, some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle suggested that the administration had \n``essentially won'' the argument on military commissions. This \nimpression is wholly mistaken and I would urge my colleagues to review \nthe record of the hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on \nthis issue.\n\n[[Page S13277]]\n\n  This debate is not about following the polls and playing a game of \npolitical ``gotcha'' when the cameras are rolling. When more than 400 \nlaw professors speak with one voice, and anyone who has been to law \nschool knows that it is no easy matter to get even two law professors \nto agree on something, we must carefully consider their opinion that \nthere are serious legal and constitutional problems with the \nPresident's course of action.\n  Their views are consistent with the concerns raised by the \nconstitutional and military justice experts who testified before the \ncommittee. Let me just cite a few examples.\n  Retired Air Force Colonel Scott Silliman and law professor Laurence \nTribe argued that the legal basis of the President's Military Order is \nweak and should be remedied by Congress.\n  Cass Sunstein of the University of Chicago recommended that basic \nrequirements of procedural justice be met if commissions are \nestablished.\n  Neal Katyal of Yale Law School opined that the order ``usurps the \npower of Congress'' and ignores the focus of our Constitution's \nframework.\n  Kate Martin, Director of the Center for National Security Studies \nstates that the military order ``violates separation of powers as the \ncreation of military commissions has not been authorized by the \nCongress and is outside the President's constitutional powers.'' She \ncompares this current situation to that ``[w]hen the Supreme Court \napproved the use of military commissions in World War II'' and \n``Congress has specifically authorized their use in Articles of War \nadopted to prosecute the war against Germany and Japan.''\n  Phillip Heymann of Harvard Law School testified that he regards the \nMilitary Order ``as one of the clearest mistakes and one of the most \ndangerous claims of executive power in the almost fifty years that [he \nhas] been in and out of government.''\n  Kathleen Clark of Washington University Law School, St. Louis, in \nsubmitted testimony, examines each of the four sources cited by the \nPresident for authority for the order and concludes, ``None of these \nauthorize the creation of this type of military tribunal.'' She \nconcludes that ``In this time of uncertainty and fear, it is as \nimportant as ever for Congress to ensure that the executive branch \nabides by the constitutional limits on its authority.''\n  Timothy Lynch, Director of the CATO Institute's Project on Criminal \nJustice contends that ``because Article I of the Constitution vests the \nlegislative power in the Congress, not the Office of the President, the \nunilateral nature of the executive order clearly runs afoul of the \nseparation of powers principle.''\n  Legal experts around the country are concerned that the President's \norder does not comport with either constitutional or international \nstandards of due process. As pointed out in the letter from over 400 \nlaw professors, this defect has both practical and legal consequences. \nLegally, it means that the order may be inconsistent with our treaty \nobligations, which under our Constitution are the ``supreme Law of the \nLand.'' Practically, it give political cover to those less democratic \nregimes around the world to mistreat foreign defendants in their \ncourts, and thereby places Americans around the world at risk.\n  On December 5, I forwarded to the Attorney General in advance of the \nJudiciary Committee hearing proposed legislation to authorize the \nPresident to establish military tribunals to try terrorists captured \nabroad in connection with the September 11 attacks. In that proposal I \noutlined a number of procedural safeguards to fulfill the President's \ncommand in his military order for a ``full and fair hearing.'' These \nprocedures would bring these tribunals into compliance with our \nNation's obligations under international law and treaties to which the \nUnited States is a party.\n  The authorization for and literal terms of the order present serious \nquestions and require some corrective action. That is why I have \noffered to work with the administration and other members to draft and \npass legislation that will clearly authorize and establish procedures \nfor military commissions.\n  Those of us who take an oath of office to uphold the Constitution, \nboth in the Congress and the administration, have a duty to do more \nthan just listen to the polls. The important thing, after all, is not \nwho wins some political debate the important thing is that America gets \nthis right.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the law professors' letter dated \nDecember 5, 2001, and an outline of safeguards and the sources for them \nbe printed in the Record.\n                                                 December 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate Office \n         Bldg., U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: We, the undersigned law professors and \n     lawyers, write to express our concern about the November 13, \n     2001, Military Order, issued by President Bush and directing \n     the Department of Defense to establish military commissions \n     to decide the guilt of non-citizens suspected of involvement \n     in terrorist activities.\n       The United States has a constitutional court system of \n     which we are rightly proud. Time and again, it has shown \n     itself able to adapt to complex and novel problems, both \n     criminal and civil. Its functioning is a worldwide emblem of \n     the workings of justice in a democratic society.\n       In contrast, the Order authorizes the Department of Defense \n     to create institutions in which we can have no confidence. We \n     understand the sense of crisis that pervades the nation. We \n     appreciate and share both the sadness and the anger. But we \n     must not let the attack of September 11, 2001 lead us to \n     sacrifice our constitutional values and abandon our \n     commitment to the rule of law. In our judgment, the untested \n     institutions contemplated by the Order are legally deficient, \n     unnecessary, and unwise.\n       In this brief statement, we outline only a few examples of \n     the serious constitutional questions this Order raises:\n       The Order undermines the tradition of the Separation of \n     Powers. Article I of the Constitution provides that the \n     Congress, not the President, has the power to ``define and \n     punish . . . Offenses against the Law of Nations.'' The \n     Order, in contrast, lodges that power in the Secretary of \n     Defense, acting at the direction of the President and without \n     congressional approval.\n       The Order does not comport with either constitutional or \n     international standards of due process. The President's \n     proposal permits indefinite detention, secret trials, and no \n     appeals.\n       The text of the Order allows the Executive to violate the \n     United States' binding treaty obligations. The International \n     Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by the \n     United States in 1992, obligates State Parties to protect the \n     due process rights of all persons subject to any criminal \n     proceeding. The third Geneva Convention of 1949, ratified by \n     the United States in 1955, requires that every prisoner of \n     war have a meaningful right to appeal a sentence or a \n     conviction. Under Article VI of the Constitution, these \n     obligations are the ``supreme Law of the Land'' and cannot be \n     superseded by a unilateral presidential order.\n       No court has upheld unilateral action by the Executive that \n     provided for as dramatic a departure from constitutional \n     norms as does this Order. While in 1942 the Supreme Court \n     allowed President Roosevelt's use of military commissions \n     during World War II, Congress had expressly granted him the \n     power to create such commissions.\n       Recourse to military commissions is unnecessary to the \n     successful prosecution and conviction of terrorists. It \n     presumes that regularly constituted courts and military \n     courts-martial that adhere to well-tested due process are \n     unable to handle prosecutions of this sort. Yet in recent \n     years, the federal trial courts have successfully tried and \n     convicted international terrorists, including members of the \n     al-Qaeda network.\n       It is a triumph of the United States that, despite the \n     attack of September 11, our institutions are fully \n     functioning. Even the disruption of offices, phones, and the \n     mail has not stopped the United States government from \n     carrying out its constitutionally-mandated responsibilities. \n     Our courts should not be prevented by Presidential Order from \n     visibly doing the same.\n       Finally, the use of military commissions would be unwise, \n     as it could endanger American lives and complicate American \n     foreign policy. Such use by the United States would undermine \n     our government's ability to protest effectively when other \n     countries do the same. Americans, be they civilians, peace-\n     keepers, members of the armed services, or diplomats, would \n     be at risk. The United States has taken other countries to \n     task for proceedings that violate basic civil rights. \n     Recently, for example, when Peru branded an American citizen \n     a ``terrorist'' and gave her a secret ``trial,'' the United \n     States properly protested that the proceedings were not held \n     in ``open civilian court with full rights of legal defense, \n     in accordance with international judicial norms.''\n       The proposal to abandon our existing legal institutions in \n     favor of such a constitutionally questionable endeavor is \n     misguided. Our democracy is at its most resolute when we meet \n     crises with our bedrock ideals intact and unyielding.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n       Benjamin Aaron, Professor of Law Emeritus, University of \n     California-Los Angeles School of Law; Kenneth Abbott, \n     Elizabeth Froehling Horner Professor of Law and Commerce, \n     Director, Center for International\n\n[[Page S13278]]\n\n     and Comparative Studies, Northwestern University; Richard L. \n     Abel, Visiting Professor, New York University Law School, \n     Connell Professor, University of California-Los Angeles \n     School of Law; Khaled Abou El Fadl, Acting Professor, \n     University of Califorina-Los Angeles School of Law; Bruce \n     Ackerman, Sterling Professor of Law and Political Science, \n     Yale Law School; Bryan Adamson, Associate Professor of Law, \n     Case Western Reserve University School of Law; Raquel Aldana-\n     Pindell, Assistant Professor of Law, University of Nevada-Las \n     Vegas, William S.

Mr. President, I found in the current issue of the \nNational Journal a very important article entitled ``Nuclear \nNightmares,'' by James Kitfield, who has written knowledgeably in the \npast about matters of national security, and particularly those \ninvolving nuclear energy and weapons of mass destruction.\n  I want to place this article by James Kitfield into the Record. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the Article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the National Journal, Dec. 14, 2001]\n\n                           Nuclear Nightmares\n\n                          (By James Kitfield)\n\n       The recent disclosure that documents about nuclear bombs \n     and radiological ``dirty bombs'' had been found at captured \n     Al Qaeda terrorist network facilities in Kabul, Afghanistan, \n     immediately triggered alarms among the nuclear scientists who \n     work atop the high desert mesas in this remote region of New \n     Mexico. For more than 50 years, nuclear experts at Los Alamos \n     and at nearby Sandia National Laboratories have studied \n     terrorist and criminal groups for any signs that they were on \n     the verge of cracking the nuclear code first broken here. \n     Everything they knew about Al Qaeda told them that these \n     terrorists might be drawing too close to a terrible \n     discovery.\n       Indeed, ever since members of the Manhattan Project tested \n     the first atomic bomb in New Mexico in 1945, scientists at \n     Los Alamos have been the pre-eminent keepers of the nuclear \n     flame. When the former Soviet Union created the secret \n     nuclear city ``Arzamas-16'' as the birthplace of its own \n     atomic bomb, it hewed closely to the Los Alamos blueprint. So \n     much so, in fact, that Russian residents later jokingly \n     referred to their town as ``Los Arzamas.''\n       Almost from the inception of the nuclear age, no one \n     understood better the apocalyptic threat of these weapons \n     than the nuclear scientists who made them. J. Robert \n     Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project and the \n     father of the atomic bomb, eventually feel out of favor with \n     the U.S.\n\n[[Page S13281]]\n\n     military at least partly over his strident support for arms \n     control and his opposition to development of the much more \n     powerful hydrogen bomb. The scientists at Los Alamos \n     developed and help train and man the Energy Department's \n     secretive Nuclear Emergency Search Teams that for 30 years \n     have stood poised to respond to the threat of nuclear terror \n     or the smuggling of a nuclear weapon onto U.S. soil.\n       Most important, the scientists at the Los Alamos, Sandia, \n     and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories helped devise a \n     U.S. nuclear doctrine designed to strictly limit the spread \n     of nuclear weapons and technology, and to render their use \n     unthinkable through the dynamic tension of ``mutually assured \n     destruction.'' And for the past decade, they have watched \n     with growing concern as unpredictable world events have \n     repeatedly tested the tolerances of that careful calculation \n     and narrowed its margins for error.\n\n\n                           Weakened Security\n\n       The breakup of the former Soviet Union, followed by the \n     fundamental restructuring of a Russian society that accounted \n     for the world's largest stockpile of both nuclear weapons and \n     the fissile material necessary to make them, created a gaping \n     hole of vulnerability in terms of nuclear proliferation. U.S. \n     experts concede that hole remains open to this day.\n       ``We've been worried about Russia for 10 years, because \n     initially the Russians insisted they didn't need any help \n     securing their weapons and nuclear material, which was a \n     ludicrous assertion,'' Siegfried Hecker, a senior fellow and \n     former longtime director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, \n     told National Journal. ``The Russians simply failed to take \n     into account how dramatically their country had changed with \n     the breakup of the Soviet Union. With the evolution toward an \n     open society, the old Soviet security system based on guns, \n     guards, and gulags was simply not good enough anymore. So \n     we've spent a lot of time educating the Russians about the \n     gaps in their own security system, and I still don't think \n     the Russian leadership fully appreciates just how real the \n     continued vulnerabilities are in the Russian nuclear \n     complex.''\n       On top of Russian instability has come the rise of Islamic \n     fundamentalism particularly the Taliban regime in \n     Afghanistan, which has--or had, until recent weeks--strong \n     links with the government of Pakistan, an emerging nuclear \n     power. Pakistan's detention of two of its nuclear \n     scientists for suspected connections to Osama bin Laden \n     and his Al Qaeda network, and recent news reports \n     suggesting previously undisclosed contacts between other \n     Pakistani nuclear weapons experts and Al Qaeda, underscore \n     the difficulty such societies have in safeguarding their \n     nuclear secrets in times of extreme turmoil.\n       John Immele, a deputy director of Los Alamos, said: ``The \n     biggest security threat in terms of nuclear weapons or \n     expertise falling into the wrong hands has always been the \n     ``inside job,'' because it short-circuits so many of the \n     traditional barriers to nuclear proliferation. From that \n     standpoint, the threat to the Pakistani government from \n     Islamic fundamentalists, and the close ties between \n     fundamentalists inside the government and Pakistan's nuclear \n     weapons program, are obviously causes for concern. If a \n     terrorist group were to get its hands on nuclear fissile \n     material,'' he said, ``the main impediment to making a bomb \n     would be to find an expert to assemble it. As cases \n     concerning Pakistani and some Russian nuclear scientists in \n     the past have shown, there are an increasing number of \n     nuclear experts out there, and some find themselves in \n     desperate circumstances. That's one more way the bar to a \n     terrorist group acquiring a nuclear device has dropped.''\n       Perhaps the greatest disruption to the equilibrium of the \n     nuclear ``balance of terror'' is the emergence of criminal \n     and terrorist organizations with a level of power and \n     technological sophistication once associated only with \n     nation-states. Should Al Qaeda or another one of these \n     terrorist groups with global reach succeed in acquiring \n     nuclear weapons, experts say, it would turn on its head a \n     nuclear doctrine that is based on the deterrent value of \n     mutually assured destruction. Doomsday cults or religious \n     zealots bent on martyrdom may not care much about traditional \n     theories of deterrence.\n       Roger Hagengruber, the senior vice president for national \n     security at Sandia, has spent much of his career \n     contemplating the threat of nuclear terror. ``For 50 years, \n     the United States has closely watched various terrorist \n     organizations for telltale indications that they might become \n     a nuclear threat,'' he told National Journal. Possible \n     warning signs include evidence of state sponsorship, a \n     display of rapidly increasing technological sophistication, \n     or persistent attempts to acquire materials or expertise \n     associated with nuclear weapons.\n       ``The reason we've been so concerned about Al Qaeda for \n     some time is because all the warning indicators are \n     positive,'' Hagengruber said, citing bin Laden's statements \n     that acquiring nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction \n     was a ``religious duty'' for Muslims, and intelligence \n     reports of persistent attempts by Al Qaeda operatives to \n     acquire nuclear fissile material. `'You have a large, \n     seemingly well-funded terrorist organization that has \n     persisted over a long period of time. They have operated with \n     either direct or indirect state support in a region of the \n     world where the security infrastructure guarding nuclear \n     materials is under significant stress. And they have an \n     unprecedented degree of enmity toward the United States. I \n     still think it's relatively unlikely that bin Laden actually \n     acquired a crude nuclear weapon, or even significant amounts \n     of weapons-grade fissile material, but that is not a set of \n     circumstances that engenders either confidence or \n     complacency. The consequences of being wrong or not paying \n     the requisite attention are just too catastrophic.''\n\n\n                             Suitcase Bombs\n\n       Even a brief visit to the National Atomic Museum at the \n     Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., reveals \n     the degree to which the nuclear flame threatened to become a \n     wildfire during the arms race of the 1950s and `60s. On \n     display are full-scale models of both of the original nuclear \n     bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ``Little Boy'' and \n     ``Fat Man,'' and a mockup of a Titan II intercontinental \n     ballistic missile with multiple thermonuclear warheads, \n     arguably the most fearsome weapon ever devised. In between \n     sit replicas of virtually every nuclear weapon designed at \n     Los Alamos and fielded by the U.S. military: nuclear air-to-\n     air missiles, atomic mines, atomic depth charges and \n     torpedoes, nuclear artillery shells--even the equivalent of \n     an atomic bazooka to put atom-splitting destructiveness into \n     the hands of the U.S. infantry.\n       Implied by this exhibit of nuclear inventiveness run amok, \n     but not on display at the museum, are perhaps the least-\n     talked-about of all nuclear weapons--portable atomic \n     demolition charges, or nuclear ``suitcase bombs.'' \n     Speculation has been heated, although unsubstantiated, that \n     Al Qaeda may have acquired such weapons from the former \n     Soviet arsenal.\n       Gen. Aleksandr Lebed, a former Russian national security \n     adviser, sparked the speculation in 1997 when he told CBS's \n     60 Minutes that the Russian military had lost track of more \n     than 100 suitcase-sized nuclear weapons, out of a total \n     arsenal of some 250. The Russian atomic energy commission \n     denied the report--and even the existence of such weapons--\n     and Lebed later seemed to back away from his own assertions. \n     However, other Russian experts have confirmed the reality of \n     such bombs. For instance, the Los Angeles Times recently \n     quoted Russian START II negotiator Nikolai Sokov as saying \n     the suitcase bombs existed but speculating that they have \n     been dismantled. Russian scientist Alexei Yablokov, a former \n     member of the Russian National Security Council, told \n     Congress that the suitcase nukes were actually controlled by \n     the KGB, the former Soviet intelligence service, and were \n     thus outside the inventory-accounting system of the Russian \n     military.\n       Yossef Bodansky, the director of the U.S. Congressional \n     Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, \n     heightened concerns over the Russian suitcase bombs. Citing \n     unnamed intelligence sources in his 2000 book, Bin Laden: The \n     Man Who Declared War on America, Bodansky claimed: ``Although \n     there is debate over the precise quantities of weapons \n     purchased, there is no longer much doubt that bin Laden has \n     finally succeeded in his quest for nuclear suitcase bombs. \n     Bin Laden's emissaries paid the Chechens $30 million in cash, \n     and gave them two tons of Afghan heroin worth about $70 \n     million'' for the bombs. Bodansky's book seemed to lend \n     credence to bin Laden's assertion in a recent interview that \n     Al Qaeda possessed nuclear weapons as a ``deterrent.''\n       Nuclear experts at Sandia and Los Alamos confirm that both \n     the Soviet Union and the United States developed portable \n     nuclear weapons. The U.S. weapon is the MK-54 Small Atomic \n     Demolition Munition. Given the stringent security systems \n     that nuclear states create to guard such weapons, however, \n     the scientists consider the threat of loose mini-nukes as the \n     least likely of all nuclear terror threats.\n       ``Every state that has ever created a nuclear arsenal has \n     come to a sobering realization of what it possesses, and has \n     established extraordinary levels of security to protect those \n     weapons,'' said Hagengruber of Sandia. ``So while we can \n     never dismiss the possibility of a stolen Russian nuclear \n     weapon, that would be extremely difficult to accomplish, and \n     the Russian president would almost certainly know about such \n     a theft immediately.''\n       Immele of Los Alamos concurs. ``There is no question that \n     both the United States and the Russians developed suitcase-\n     sized atomic demolition munitions,'' he said. ``We studied \n     Lebed's comments very closely and compared them to our \n     extensive knowledge about what the Russian military has done \n     to account for its nuclear weapons, however, and we have no \n     intelligence leading us to believe that those weapons have \n     escaped Russian control. What you find is that even a country \n     with 25,000 nuclear weapons and a less-than-state-of-the-art \n     accounting system will keep a very close accounting and \n     jealously guard control of its actual nuclear weapons.'' \n     However, he cautioned, ``nuclear materials and expertise are \n     much harder to account for and keep track of, which is why so \n     much of our concerns about Russia are focused on its nuclear \n     fissile material and scientists.''\n\n\n                          DOOMSDAY INGREDIENTS\n\n       Most analysts cite as a success story the joint U.S.-\n     Russian programs designed to rid the former Soviet states of \n     their nuclear\n\n[[Page S13282]]\n\n     weapons, and to help Russia secure and dismantle its own \n     weapons. The United States has spent roughly $4 billion on \n     the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program (named \n     for legislative co-sponsors former Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and \n     Richard Lugar, R-Ind.). To date, the Nunn-Lugar program has \n     deactivated 5,700 nuclear warheads, destroyed 434 ICBMs and \n     483 air-to-surface missiles, and eliminated hundreds of \n     Russian bombers, submarines, and missile launchers.\n       However, attempts to consolidate and safeguard the much \n     larger Russian stockpile of nuclear fissile material--the \n     essential ingredient of these doomsday weapons--have had a \n     more checkered record. Indeed, the first indication that \n     Russia might be leaking lethal nuclear material from its \n     increasingly decrepit inventory came as early as 1992, when a \n     Russian was caught attempting to steal 1.5 kilograms of \n     highly enriched uranium from a facility in Podolsk. Other \n     incidents soon followed. In March 1993, authorities in St. \n     Petersburg seized 6.6 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from \n     smugglers. In August 1994, police in Munich, Germany, seized \n     360 grams of plutonium and 5 pounds of uranium, part of a \n     shipment apparently stolen from a nuclear research center in \n     Obninsk, Russia. In one of the most worrisome incidents, an \n     anonymous tip enabled the Czech police to seize 2.7 kilograms \n     of highly enriched uranium in December 1994.\n       Because nuclear experts consider the difficulty of \n     acquiring weapons-grade fissile material as the single \n     greatest impediment to a group or nation that wants to build \n     nuclear weapons, these seizures sounded a loud wake-up call. \n     The theft of significant amounts of uranium is particularly \n     frightening because uranium can be used as the key ingredient \n     in relatively rudimentary nuclear devices that experts \n     consider most within the technological grasp of fledgling \n     nuclear states or terrorist groups.\n       The Energy Department's efforts, under its ``Lab-to-Lab'' \n     initiative, to protect Russia's stockpile of fissile material \n     have encountered severe obstacles. One is the continuing \n     Russian reluctance to open its secret nuclear cities and \n     research facilities to prying Western eyes. The second has \n     been the unwillingness of both Russian and American \n     authorities to acknowledge the vast scope of the problem of \n     securing the enormous Russian stockpile of fissile material.\n       ``I think it's fair to say that the Russians themselves \n     didn't have a complete handle on the quantities and scattered \n     locations that made up their fissile-material stockpile,'' \n     said Kent Biringer, who works on cooperative international \n     programs at Sandia. ``As we started out on these programs, we \n     didn't have a solid baseline from which to work that told us \n     what we were trying to get our arms around.''\n       When the true size of the Russian stockpile eventually came \n     into clearer focus, U.S. officials realized they had greatly \n     underestimated the challenge. Richard Wallace, the program \n     manager for material protection, control, and accounting in \n     the Russian Nonproliferation Program at Los Alamos, said: \n     ``What we found was that Russia had produced roughly 10 times \n     more nuclear fissile material during the Cold War than the \n     United States, and they had it scattered at many more sites. \n     They also had 10 secret nuclear cities,'' Wallace said, ``and \n     each one dwarfed one of our comparable nuclear weapons \n     laboratories. The Russians also had to go through a major \n     cultural change in how they thought about security at their \n     stockpile sites.''\n       Eventually, U.S. experts were able to estimate that Russia \n     had a total of 850 metric tons of weapons-usable missile \n     material--enough for more than 70,000 nuclear weapons--\n     stored at 95 separate sites. Because it takes only about \n     17.5 pounds of plutonium or 55 pounds of enriched uranium \n     to make a nuclear bomb, securing that vast trove of \n     fissile material became one of the United States' top \n     nonproliferation priorities of the 1990s.\n       The lax security systems at some of those Russian sites \n     have become legendary within the weapons-lab community. \n     Security experts talk about perimeter fences with gaping \n     holes; fissile material stored in unguarded boxes in hallways \n     of poorly guarded facilities; and facilities without air \n     conditioning, where windows without bars were routinely kept \n     open to ease the summer heat. According to experts at Los \n     Alamos, managers of Russian nuclear reactors also routinely \n     set aside extra stashes of plutonium and uranium ``off the \n     books'' to make up for potential shortfalls in their \n     production quotas at the end of each accounting period.\n       U.S. experts thus focused in the early years of the Lab-to-\n     Lab program on rudimentary fixes such as consolidating \n     fissile material at fewer sites, and protecting it with \n     radiation detectors, closed-circuit television camera \n     systems, electronic sensors on perimeter fences, and \n     computerized accounting systems. Even some of these \n     relatively simple fixes went awry. U.S. experts discovered, \n     for instance, that the batteries in some of their security \n     systems failed in the harsh Siberian winters. Levels of \n     radiation dust and radiation contamination on workers that \n     were considered routine at some Russian facilities often set \n     off U.S. radiation detectors.\n       Today, U.S. experts at Los Alamos estimate that roughly 570 \n     tons of Russia's total 850 tons of weapons-usable material \n     are more secure as a result of the security upgrades. They \n     concede, however, that more than 200 tons of fissile material \n     remain largely unsecured. A May 2000 report by the General \n     Accounting Office, Congress's investigative arm, found that \n     U.S. officials have yet to gain access to 104 of 252 nuclear \n     sites ``requiring improved security systems.''\n       ``There is still a lot of room for improvement in securing \n     Russia's fissile materials,'' according to Larry Walker, the \n     manager of Cooperative International Programs at Sandia. \n     ``What you find is, the closer you get to Russia's actual \n     nuclear weapons, the more secretive and less willing to give \n     access the Russians become. Access remains an issue, because \n     it's difficult to improve security unless you can actually \n     see a storage site and witness how things are stored and \n     handled.''\n\n\n                            stalled progress\n\n       After making significant headway in the early years, the \n     U.S.-Russian cooperative programs to secure Moscow's fissile-\n     material stockpile got stock in 1998 and have not yet \n     recovered. The reasons for the lagging progress are varied, \n     experts say. As the materials protection program grew in cost \n     from a few million dollars to more than $100 million \n     annually, Congress and Administration officials began \n     demanding a higher level of access to Russian nuclear \n     facilities, and the Russians balked. A bureaucracy that had \n     been thrown into disarray by the dissolution of the Soviet \n     Union in the early 1990s also began to reassert itself, \n     throwing up red-tape barriers to greater Western access. And \n     the Russians angered the United States by insisting on \n     exporting a civilian nuclear reactor to Iran. The State \n     Department lists Iran as the most active state sponsor of \n     terrorist groups in the world.\n       Political tensions over the bombing of Serbia, NATO \n     expansion, and a U.S. national missile defense system also \n     soured relations between senior American and Russian \n     officials in the late 1990s. Finally, because of a financial \n     collapse in 1998, many Russian nuclear scientists and \n     technicians were not paid for months at a time, raising fears \n     that they would peddle their expertise on the world market. \n     The Japanese doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo, for instance, was \n     known to have actively recruited Russian nuclear design \n     specialists, and even student physicists from Moscow State \n     University, in an attempt to acquire nuclear weapons.\n       ``After making enormous progress in the first three to four \n     years, our cooperative programs with the Russians basically \n     ground to a halt, and I don't think many officials in the \n     Bush Administration still understand just how broken this \n     process now is,'' said Hecker, the former director of Los \n     Alamos. ``Partly because the U.S. government lost its way and \n     switched from an approach of cooperation to one that dictated \n     an unnecessarily intrusive level of access into sensitive \n     Russian facilities, we've lost the spirit of partnership \n     necessary to make these programs work. Couple that with the \n     fact that the Clinton Administration never really had a \n     strategic vision or overarching strategy for dealing with the \n     Russian nuclear complex and setting priorities among all \n     these various programs, and you have a process that has \n     essentially ground to a standstill in many respects. And \n     until we can restore a common sense of purpose between us and \n     the Russians, no amount of money will fix the Russian nuclear \n     security problems.''\n       Meanwhile, indications of serious Russian security lapses \n     continue. Russian officials in 1998 broke up a conspiracy by \n     employees of a major nuclear facility in the Chelyabinsk \n     region of the Ural Mountains to steal 18.5 kilograms of \n     weapons-usable material. The Center for Nonproliferation \n     Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies \n     has documented 11 cases involving diversion and recovery of \n     Russian weapons-grade material between 1992 and 1997. The \n     International Atomic Energy Agency further documents six \n     seizures of weapons-grade material linked to states of the \n     former Soviet Union between 1999 and 2001. Four Russian \n     sailors were arrested at a base on the Kamchatka Peninsula in \n     January 2000, with radioactive materials that they were \n     suspected of stealing from a Russian nuclear submarine. \n     According to a New York Times report, Turkey recently \n     revealed that its undercover police had broken up a smuggling \n     ring holding 2.2 pounds of what appeared to be enriched \n     uranium, brought from a Russian of Azeri origin. The head of \n     the Russian agency responsible for nuclear security recently \n     told reporters that, on two occasions last year, terrorists \n     had staked out Russian nuclear facilities. Earlier this \n     month, on December 6, Russian police arrested members of a \n     criminal gang who were trying to sell uranium for $30,000.\n       Reports coming in a steady drumbeat from U.S. commissions \n     and blue-ribbon panels have warned that the inadequate \n     security of the fissile-material stockpile of the former \n     Soviet union remains a glaring weakness in the global system \n     designed to prevent a nuclear catastrophe. A 1997 Defense \n     Science Board Study noted: ``Defense planners are \n     increasingly concerned about possible state and non-state use \n     of radiological dispersal devices [dirty bombs] against U.S. \n     forces and population centers abroad and at home, as \n     technological barriers have fallen and radiological materials \n     have become more plentiful.'' A 1999 congressional commission \n     chaired by former CIA Director John Deutch and Sen. Arlen \n     Specter, R-Pa., warned that power outages, inadequate \n     inventory control, and unpaid Russian guards and technicians \n     had all increased the threat of an ``insider'' diversion of \n     Russian nuclear fissile material.\n\n[[Page S13283]]\n\n       Perhaps the starkest warning was issued earlier this year \n     by an Energy Department advisory group headed by former Sen. \n     Howard Baker, R-Tenn., and former White House counsel Lloyd \n     Cutler. ``The most urgent unmet national security threat to \n     the United States today is the danger that weapons of mass \n     destruction or weapons-usable material in Russia could be \n     stolen or sold to terrorists or hostile nation-states,'' the \n     Baker-Cutler study concluded. The group recommended that the \n     United States spend $30 billion over the next eight to 10 \n     years on a crash program to finally secure Russia's weapons \n     of mass destruction and its stockpile of fissile material.\n       Ominously, the steady stream of warnings in recent years \n     resembles similar unheeded alarms raised before September 11 \n     about the possibility of a catastrophic terrorist attack. \n     Nonproliferation advocates were thus dismayed that the Bush \n     Administration's fiscal 2002 budget proposed cutting the \n     Pentagon's Nunn-Lugar programs by 9 percent (from $443.4 \n     million in fiscal 2001 to $403 million), and the Energy \n     Department's nonproliferation programs by 11.5 percent (from \n     $872.4 million in fiscal 2001 to about $773.7 million). \n     Congress has since moved to restore some of the proposed \n     funding cuts, however. And in a December 11 speech at the \n     Citadel, Bush promised expanded efforts and increased funding \n     for securing Russian fissile material and for finding \n     peaceful employment for Russian nuclear scientists.\n       In an attempt to jump-start the stalled threat-reduction \n     programs, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Joseph r. Biden \n     Jr., D-Del., and Lugar recently introduced the Debt Reduction \n     for Non-Proliferation Act, which would forgive Russia's debt \n     of $3.7 billion to the United States in exchange for its \n     cooperation with U.S. efforts to secure and monitor Russian \n     weapons of mass destruction and fissile material.\n       ``Time after time, the United States has put together \n     groups of objective, bipartisan policy experts to study this \n     problem, and each time, they have concluded that this is an \n     urgent national security issue--and every time, their reports \n     are ignored,'' said Joseph Cirincione, the director of the \n     Non-Proliferation Project at the Carnegie Endowment for \n     International Peace in Washington. Part of the problem, he \n     says, is that such programs have no natural domestic \n     constituency in Russia, and in the United States they smack \n     of unpopular foreign aid. And because cooperative threat-\n     reduction programs do not command the same priority within \n     the Administration as missile defense, they can easily get \n     shoved off the summit-level agenda.\n       ``Another problem is, this seems like a distant threat \n     because nothing terrible has happened yet,'' Cirincione said. \n     ``The general feeling among experts, however, is that we've \n     been lucky so far. There is absolutely no doubt that there \n     are bad people out there trying very hard to get their hands \n     on Russian weapons of mass destruction and nuclear materials, \n     and if we don't secure the source, sooner or later they will \n     succeed. After September 11, the once-inconceivable is now \n     all too easily imagined.''\n\n\n                             An Unseen Hand\n\n       A decade's worth of seizures and the breakup of numerous \n     smuggling rings in Russia and Europe clearly point to a \n     lucrative black market in nuclear fissile materials. No one \n     knows with any certainty whether terrorists have successfully \n     smuggled any of that material through the porous southern \n     Russian border into Central Asia or nearby Afghanistan. Few \n     intelligence experts doubt, however, that one of the unseen \n     hands creating the demand for fissile material was that of \n     Osama bin Laden.\n       The most unambiguous testimony to date on Al Qaeda's \n     methodical, well-financed campaign to acquire nuclear bomb-\n     making material came from Ahmed Al-Fadl, an Al Qaeda \n     operative who turned state's witness in the trial earlier \n     this year of men accused of bombing two U.S. embassies in \n     East Africa in 1998. Al-Fadl claimed he was the middleman in \n     a mid-1990s deal between Al Qaeda and Sudanese officials for \n     the purchase of $1.5 million worth of highly enriched \n     uranium, apparently diverted from South Africa's former \n     nuclear program. Though Al-Fadl was not present for the final \n     exchange, his testimony convinced U.S. prosecutors that ``at \n     least since 1993, bid Laden and others made efforts to obtain \n     components of nuclear weapons.''\n       Recent years have yielded a steady stream of news reports \n     and intelligence leaks about Al Qaeda's attempts to acquire \n     fissile material. In 1998, for instance, bid Laden aide \n     Mamdouh Mahmud Salim was arrested in Munich and charged with \n     acting on behalf of Al Qaeda to acquire nuclear materials. As \n     The Christian Science Monitor recently reported, a Bulgarian \n     businessman claimed to have met bin Laden himself last year \n     to talk over a complex deal to transship nuclear materials \n     across Bulgaria to Afghanistan.\n       Pakistan, meanwhile, continues to detain Sultan Bashiruddin \n     Mahmood and a second nuclear scientist considered key to \n     Pakistan's nuclear program. Mahmood has reportedly \n     acknowledged meeting bin Laden and Taliban leader Mohammed \n     Omar during at least three visits to Afghanistan last year, \n     and he is said to have talked at length about developing \n     nuclear and biological weapons. According to the New York \n     Times, CIA Director George J. Tenet, during his recent trip \n     to Pakistan, raised U.S. concerns about additional contacts \n     between Pakistani nuclear weapons experts and Al Qaeda.\n       If the Al Qaeda network has successfully acquired enough \n     weapons-grade uranium, U.S. experts say the group's last \n     major challenge in eventually constructing a workable nuclear \n     bomb would be to entice a trained nuclear scientist to \n     spearhead the project. ``The history of nuclear programs \n     suggest that they depend on only a few key, knowledgeable \n     scientists, with sufficient time and bankrolling, to bring a \n     program to fruition,'' said Biringer of Sandia. ``That's why \n     we have focused a lot of effort on trying to retrain Russian \n     scientists in other disciplines so they will not attempt to \n     sell their services on the open market.''\n       U.S. experts say that Russian nuclear scientists are \n     generally much better off today than in 1998, when they went \n     unpaid for up to eight months because of a financial crisis \n     and the collapse of the ruble. Nevertheless, they worry that \n     Energy's ``Nuclear Cities Initiative,'' designed to retrain \n     Russian scientists and shrink the Russian nuclear complex, \n     has suffered from erratic funding and tepid congressional \n     support.\n       ``Virtually all Russian scientists we have dealt with are \n     enormously loyal and patriotic, and most of them would like \n     to stay where they are and continue to conduct meaningful \n     work and research,'' Hagengruber said. ``So we are not \n     worried about Russian hemorrhaging nuclear scientists. These \n     scientists remain one of our major concerns, however--because \n     unfortunately, all it takes is enough fissile material and \n     one or two good scientists to create a real problem. Even a \n     99 percent solution is not really good enough.''\n       Experts at Los Alamos and Sandia doubt that Al Qaeda has \n     had the requisite time, weapons-grade fissile material, and \n     nuclear expertise to actually construct a crude nuclear \n     weapon, though they would not rule the possibility out. One \n     expert who concurs in those doubts is Iraqi defector Khidhir \n     Hamza who headed Saddam Hussein's secret nuclear bomb program \n     through the mid-1990s and co-authored the book, Saddam's \n     Bombmaker. Despite obvious weaknesses in global nuclear \n     nonproliferation defenses, Hamza insists that the \n     difficulties inherent in constructing a nuclear weapon remain \n     daunting.\n       ``We in Iraq were in the market for nuclear materials, and \n     not a week passed without us getting an offer from somebody \n     to sell us such materials,'' he told CNBC's Geraldo Rivera on \n     October 26. ``People came to Baghdad with bags of samples, \n     and left with bags of money, and we never got any serious \n     nuclear materials. Despite what people say, the [protections \n     of such materials] are not that loose, and this radioactive \n     material is very difficult to transport.'' As for actually \n     constructing a nuclear bomb, ``that's not that easy either,'' \n     Hamza said. ``Iraq is a country with thousands of nuclear \n     workers, and we still couldn't get a bomb ready in time for \n     the Gulf War''\n       U.S. experts are much less skeptical that Al Qaeda or \n     another terrorist organization could build a dirty bomb by \n     packing a conventional explosive with fissile material that \n     would kill and injure, mainly through radioactive dispersal \n     and contamination. On the spectrum of nuclear threats, \n     experts consider this a ``high-likelihood, low-lethality'' \n     scenario.\n       Bruce Blair, an arms control expert and former nuclear \n     missileer who is now the president of the Center for Defense \n     Information in Washington, said: ``There's almost no credible \n     evidence that Al Qaeda acquired a portable nuclear device \n     that could actually split the atom, but I think it's very \n     plausible that bin Laden acquired fissile material that could \n     be wrapped around dynamite and exploded in an urban center \n     like Lower Manhattan to cause panic and terror, and require \n     the evacuation of large portions of the city for a \n     considerable period of time.''\n       According to Blair, the Defense Department ran an analysis \n     of just such a worst-case scenario involving a dirty bomb \n     made with 50 kilograms of nuclear power plant spent fuel \n     packed around 100 pounds of conventional explosives. ``The \n     calculation was that lethal doses of radiation would be \n     dispersed over roughly a half-mile area, leading to hundreds, \n     if not thousands, of casualties,'' Blair said. ``There is \n     also considerable data on what would be involved in cleaning \n     up after such a terrorist attack, and that dates back to \n     1966, when an Air Force plane carrying nuclear weapons \n     crashed in Spain.''\n       Indeed, a display at Sandia's National Atomic Museum \n     depicts the collision of a B-52 and a KC-135 tanker during \n     midair refueling over Palomares, Spain, on January 17, 1966. \n     Photos document how three thermonuclear weapons that burst \n     open in the crash contaminated a 285-acre area with highly \n     enriched plutonium, which has a half-life of 24,000 years. \n     More than 4,000 Air Force personnel were drafted into the \n     cleanup effort, which required plowing hundreds of acres and \n     removing 4,810 barrels of plutonium-contaminated earth to a \n     storage site in South Carolina. In 2001 dollars, the cleanup \n     operation cost $230 million.\n       In a post-September 11 world, a Palomares-type incident \n     occupies the ``high-likelihood, low-lethality'' end of the \n     spectrum of threats to U.S. national security. Such a \n     classification is a testament to the almost unthinkable \n     menace posed by nuclear-armed terrorists.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I wish to quote liberally from what I think are remarkable \nsummaries of some very tough decisions that we will need to make. The \nauthor begins:\n\n\n[[Page S13284]]\n\n\n       The recent disclosure that documents about nuclear bombs \n     and radiological ``dirty bombs'' had been found at captured \n     Al Qaeda terrorist network facilities in Kabul, Afghanistan, \n     immediately triggered alarms among the nuclear scientists who \n     work atop the high desert mesas in this remote region of New \n     Mexico. For more than 50 years, nuclear experts at Los Alamos \n     and at nearby Sandia National Laboratories have studied \n     terrorist and criminal groups for any signs that they were on \n     the verge of cracking the nuclear code first broken here. \n     Everything they knew about Al Qaeda told them that these \n     terrorists might be drawing too close to a terrible \n     discovery.\n       Indeed, ever since members of the Manhattan Project tested \n     the first atomic bomb in New Mexico in 1945, scientists at \n     Los Alamos have been the pre-eminent keepers of the nuclear \n     flame. When the former Soviet Union created the secret \n     nuclear city ``Arzamas-16'' as the birthplace of its own \n     atomic bomb, it hewed closely to the Los Alamos blueprint. So \n     much so, in fact, that Russian residents later jokingly \n     referred to their town as ``Los Arzamas.''\n       Almost from the inception of the nuclear age, no one \n     understood better the apocalyptic threat of these weapons \n     than the nuclear scientists who made them.\n       J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan \n     Project and the father of the atomic bomb, eventually fell \n     out of favor with the U.S. military at least partly over his \n     strident support for arms control and his opposition to \n     development of the much more powerful hydrogen bomb. The \n     scientists at Los Alamos developed and help train and man the \n     Energy Department's secretive Nuclear Emergency Search Teams \n     that for 30 years have stood poised to respond to the threat \n     of nuclear terror or the smuggling of a nuclear weapon onto \n     U.S. soil.\n       Most important, the scientists at the Los Alamos, Sandia, \n     and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories helped devise a \n     U.S. nuclear doctrine designed to strictly limit the spread \n     of nuclear weapons and technology, and to render their use \n     unthinkable through the dynamic tension of ``mutually assured \n     destruction.'' And for the past decade, they watched with \n     growing concern as unpredictable world events have repeatedly \n     tested the tolerances of that careful calculation and \n     narrowed its margins for error.\n       The breakup of the former Soviet Union, followed by the \n     fundamental restructuring of a Russian society that accounted \n     for the world's largest stockpile of both nuclear weapons and \n     the fissile material necessary to make them, created a gaping \n     hole of vulnerability in terms of nuclear proliferation. U.S. \n     experts concede that that hole remains open to this day.\n       ``We've been worried about Russia for 10 years, because \n     initially the Russians insisted they didn't need any help \n     securing their weapons and nuclear material, which was a \n     ludicrous assertion,'' said Siegfried Hecker, a senior fellow \n     and former longtime director of Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory. . . .\n\n  Mr. Hecker continues:\n\n       ``The Russians simply failed to take into account how \n     dramatically their country had changed with the breakup of \n     the Soviet Union. With the evolution toward an open society, \n     the old Soviet security system based on guns, guards, and \n     gulags was simply not good enough anymore. So we've spent a \n     lot of time educating the Russians about the gaps in their \n     own security system, and I still don't think the Russian \n     leadership fully appreciates just how real the continued \n     vulnerabilities are in the Russian nuclear complex.''\n       On top of this Russian instability has come the rise now of \n     Islamic fundamentalism, particularly the Taliban regime in \n     Afghanistan, which has--or had, until recent weeks--strong \n     links with the government of Pakistan, an emerging nuclear \n     power. Pakistan's detention of two of its nuclear scientists \n     for suspected connections to Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda \n     network, and most recent news reports suggesting previously \n     undisclosed contacts between other Pakistani nuclear weapons \n     experts and Al Qaeda, underscore the difficulty such \n     societies have in safeguarding their nuclear secrets in time \n     of extreme turmoil.\n       John Immele, a deputy director of Los Alamos, said: ``The \n     biggest security threat in terms of nuclear weapons or \n     expertise falling into the wrong hands has always been the \n     `inside job,' because it short-circuits so many of the \n     traditional barriers to nuclear proliferation. From that \n     standpoint, the threat to the Pakistani government from \n     Islamic fundamentalists, and the close ties between \n     fundamentalists inside the government and Pakistan's nuclear \n     program, are obviously causes for concern. If a terrorist \n     group were to get its hands on nuclear fissile material,'' he \n     said, ``the main impediment to making a bomb would be to \n     find an expert to assemble it. As cases concerning \n     Pakistani and some Russian nuclear scientists in the past \n     have shown, there are an increasing number of nuclear \n     experts out there, and some find themselves in desperate \n     circumstances. . . .\n       Perhaps the greatest disruption to the equilibrium of the \n     nuclear ``balance of terror'' is the emergence of criminal \n     and terrorist organizations with a level of power and \n     technological sophistication once associated only with \n     nation-states.\n\n  Quoting again from James Kitfield:\n\n       Should Al Qaeda or another one of these terrorist groups \n     with global reach succeed in acquiring nuclear weapons, \n     experts say, it would turn on its head a nuclear doctrine \n     that is based on the deterrent value of mutually assured \n     destruction. Doomsday cults or religion zealots bent on \n     martyrdom may not care much for traditional theories of \n     deterrence.\n\n  Mr. President, in a piece in the Washington Post published from my \nwritings last week, I tried to say the bottom line I thought in this \nwar was the search for al-Qaida and then nuclear cells wherever they \nmay be in many countries where such have been identified. That is \ncritical and that continues even as we speak with important American \nforces and a broad coalition.\n  The second path is equally, if not more, crucially important, and \nthat is as weapons of mass destruction or materials that might produce \nweapons of mass destruction are identified in various countries, U.S. \npolicy, and hopefully the alliance policy, must be, first, to gain \naccountability and transparency as to what there is, and, secondly, to \nwork with each of those countries to make sure that material is secure, \nnot an invasion of a sovereignty, and I mentioned Pakistan and India in \nmy article in particular because these are very vital cases in the area \nwe are now talking about, Afghanistan.\n  We offer, I hope, some assistance to make certain, first of all, \nthose Governments know what they have; that it is secure; that if they \ndo not have the money, the United States and others may work with them, \nand likewise with the security apparatus, which has become a part of \nour experience and, to a great extent, the Russian experience.\n  And finally, we encourage, whenever possible, and maybe even help \nfinance, the destruction of this material or those weapons.\n  The opening up of those societies may not be easy. So as people talk \nabout the next step, the next step is essentially attempting to define \nwho will cooperate. I have no way of knowing whether our new friendship \nwith India and Pakistan will lead us to believe they might be more \ncooperative than they would have been prior to September 11, but that \nis possible.\n  The stories about Pakistan's own striving to bring about security, \nits placement, as press reports give it, in six different locations, \neven a very far stretch of the imagination that the Chinese might be \nentrusted as trustees for it to get it out of harm's way in the event \nPakistan was in harm's way, indicates how serious this is.\n  The question comes: What about situations in which there may be less \ncooperation? We do not know for certain what Libya has or if the \nSyrians are involved. We have strong beliefs that Iran and Iraq have \nbeen very active. And what if there is not cooperation with the \ninternational community, either the United Nations inspections teams or \nanybody else's inspections teams?\n  This is why the war against terrorism is likely to have some life to \nit beyond Afghanistan because there clearly is, in my judgment, a need \nto make certain this intersection does not occur. It is easy enough to \nread the paragraph I have just read, but clearly I think it has come \ninto the purview of our policymakers that mutually assured destruction \nmay or may not have been the guiding post between the United States and \nRussia. It apparently is not going to be the way we will proceed in the \nfuture, and the President and others have said we are on a different \ncourse of cooperation. But it did serve as a deterrent for a long time \nas thousands of nuclear warheads were aimed at us, and we had thousands \naimed at the Russians.\n  Now the problem is, as we take a look at the aircraft going into the \nWorld Trade Center and into the Pentagon, mutually assured destruction \ndoes not seem to pertain to that kind of arrangement. Suicidal missions \ndo not take into consideration mutually assured destruction, in part \nbecause those who committed suicide destroyed themselves.\n\n  There are no assets back in a home country of governmental buildings, \nheadquarters, utilities. What is there to destroy? What is the \ndownside? This, of course, is the problem, that those with the suicidal \ntendency who have their hands on the materials, the weapons, for \nwhatever reasons--religiously based, zealotry--decide to create havoc \nin the world and could do so in a monstrous way.\n\n[[Page S13285]]\n\n  I continue with a bit more of Mr. Kitfield's analysis. It appears to \nme when he says the consequences of being wrong or not paying attention \nto these matters is catastrophic--we have been down the trail in \nvarious ways. Take a look at suitcase bombs. General Lebed of Russia \ncame over and suggested that it may or may not confirm his point of \nview. But never the less, the Los Alamos people are taking a look at \nLebed's contentions and those of others who have said ``nuclear \nmaterials and expertise are much harder to account for'' than bombs, \neven suitcases, anything encased. That is why ``concerns about Russia \nare focused on fissile material and its scientists.''\n  The problem is now it appears Russia produced a great deal more \nfissile material than we anticipated. So much more that the destruction \nof it or even the securing of it has gone well beyond all of our best \nattempts. Mr. Kitfield's article mentions the 5,700 nuclear warheads, \n434 ICBMs, 484 air-to-surface missiles, bombers, submarines, and what \nhave you, destroyed. However, he goes on to say, ``attempts to \nconsolidate and safeguard the much larger Russian stockpile of fissile \nmaterial--the essential ingredient of these doomsday weapons--have had \na more checkered record. Indeed, the first indication that Russia might \nbe leaking lethal nuclear material from the decreasingly decrepit \ninventory is as early as 1992.'' He goes through each of the well-known \ndocumented cases and attempts to pilfer kilograms here, pounds there, \nof weapons-grade uranium.\n  The Russians still contend that all of these situations have been \nstopped, that the perpetrators were caught, whether in Prague or St. \nPetersburg or elsewhere.\n  ``Today, U.S. experts at Los Alamos estimate that roughly 570 tons of \nRussia's total 850 tons of weapons-usable material are more secure,'' \nbut this leaves 280 tons that are not. They believe at Los Alamos that \nclearly more than 200 tons of fissile material remaining largely \nunsecured are in 104 of the 252 nuclear sites in which U.S. officials \nhave yet to gain access.\n  From my own personal experience, it is not easy to gain access to \nareas in which the officials of the country do not wish you to gain \naccess. It is a bargaining process, trip by trip, site by site--whether \nnuclear or biological or chemical. It is the first comprehensive figure \nI have ever seen, however, that details there are 252 known sites where \nthere is fissile material--not warheads or ICBMs--and we have yet to \ngain access to 104 of these, almost 40 percent.\n  To make my point again, while I counsel we approach Pakistan and \nIndia with the thoughts of accessibility, accountability, and security, \nwe have a great deal of work still to do with friends in Russia with \nwhom we have been working for 10 years. The 10th anniversary of the \nNunn-Lugar Act occurred 2 days ago, and in this body. It was late in \nthat session in 1991 when the legislation was passed. For 10 years, we \nhave been at work, these two countries, Russia and the United States. \nYet even at this point, extraordinary amounts of material remain \nperhaps less secure than they ought to be, and unavailable, at least \nfor our inspection even in this cooperative program.\n\n  Finally, the problems with the scientists are always speculative. \nFrom the beginning, the thought has been, in addition to the material, \nas Mr. Kitfield points out, there has to be one individual who has the \nexpertise with the program to bring it together if a weapon actually is \nto be usable. The hope has been, through the International Science and \nTechnology Committee--and this body has appropriated funds, again, from \nthe State Department appropriation process--of a generous contribution \nto that effort. In the past, there have been contributions by Japan, by \nEuropean countries, by Saudi Arabia and others.\n  In my own business, at their headquarters, I found our contribution \nnow unfortunately has risen to 60 percent. I say unfortunately because \nit means others may have dropped off of the program. But with good \ndiplomacy, others may drop back in.\n  Under this program, over 20,000 Russian scientists have been paid \nstipends to furnish them money to do other work--work in commercially \nviable propositions in Russia that do not involve weapons of mass \ndestruction. I cannot overstate how vital this has been in sustaining \nthe interests of those scientists in continuing to live in Russia as \nthey wanted to do, provided there was any work--at a time that the \nRussian military establishment was winding down. Obviously, programs \nproducing fissile material have been virtually stopped.\n  I have no idea how many scientists there are in Russia who at any one \ntime were involved as experts in weapons of mass destruction. We have \nno way of knowing whether 20,000 represents most of them or a majority. \nWe have, according to Mr. Kitfield and the experts at Los Alamos and \nSandia, luck that the coincidence of scientists, material, cell groups \nhave not quite come together yet.\n  The point of this statement at this late hour today is to say that we \ncannot count on that. America has been staggered and shocked and \ngrieved by September 11. Horrible circumstances.\n  Testimony before a committee I chaired involving those deeply \ninvolved in this subject and who knew a great deal about it, brought a \nwitness who had the proverbial thin suitcase. He laid it down on the \nwitness table. At the appropriate time, he opened it and there was a \nmachined piece of metal, something like a pineapple in both its shape \nand size. He assured us this was not highly enriched uranium. \nNevertheless, there were materials in this particular piece that a \ncounter would register.\n  At this point, many in the audience backed away from the table. This \nhearing was turning into somewhat more of an interesting situation than \nsome asked for. He made the point this was probably equivalent in size \nto 16 pounds of highly enriched uranium.\n  The article states some scientists say you need 55 pounds of highly \nenriched uranium in order to have a nuclear weapon. Some would say it \nis more like 100 pounds. So 16 pounds would not get the job done, nor \ndid he purport that it would. He suggested, however, enlarging this \npineapple with a few more layers would get you to that point.\n\n  This came just after the tragedy at Oklahoma City and the bombing of \nthe courthouse by McVeigh and whoever was involved with him. That would \nnow be classified, in many circles, as sort of the forerunner of the \ndirty bomb situation. That is, you have some materials, at least, that \nhave properties that are nuclear but they are not at the highly \nenriched level. But you use common or garden variety explosives and you \ncreate a mess. McVeigh, as far as we know, was not attempting to \ncombine the explosives with nuclear material at any level.\n  So I cite this example as only illustrative, in two ways. One was \nthat half of that Federal courthouse was destroyed, along with a number \nof Americans, innocents, who were in that courthouse at the time.\n  The witness made the point, however, that if you had the proper \nexpertise and you had the suitcase and the 55 or 100-pound weapon in \nthis same pineapple shape, this would have had the effect of taking out \n4 square miles of Oklahoma City, not just half of the Federal building.\n  Others have made the point that even without highly enriched uranium, \nthe so-called dirty bomb, which does include some nuclear material but \nsimply with an explosive device, could render the same territory in New \nYork City uninhabitable for a fairly sizable period of time after the \ndestruction of many lives in the process of the fallout of this \nmaterial, much like the effects down range from the Chernobyl explosion \nin Ukraine where hundreds of thousands of acres will not be farmed for \nour lifetime and many after that, or, if they are farmed, may have \ndevastating health consequences, given the spoiling of the soil, the \ntrees, the animals--everything that was involved. In short, this is the \ndanger.\n  I think our officials understand this. But I am hopeful that as we \nproceed in subsequent years with our military appropriations, and our \nDepartment of Energy appropriations, and our State Department \nappropriations--because all of these efforts are divided in several \nways, each one of them vital to the overall objective--that we have an \nunderstanding of how large a proposition this is.\n  This does not for a moment negate the need for the very best trained \nand\n\n[[Page S13286]]\n\npaid American troops we have, and support of them, and all of the \ninstruments of conventional warfare that are now being produced. But I \nam saying that once again the bottom line of the war, as I perceive it, \nis that even as we are very successful with these so-called \nconventional means, and with remarkable, talented American service \npersonnel, on the homefront, here in the home defense situation, we \nneed to understand the vulnerability we have in the same way that we \nexplained it to those in Moscow and London and Rome and other beautiful \ncapital cities of our world that are at risk if in fact this \nintersection between cells of terrorism and materials and weapons of \nmass destruction should develop.\n  There are people who say this is so pervasive and so comprehensive \nthat school is out, it is beyond remedy. The numbers of terrorists, the \nnumbers of countries, numbers of programs, regimes all believing they \nmust have weapons of mass destruction or at least the threat of these \nto stave off whoever --and I understand that, as the Presiding Officer \ndoes. But our objective, at least, as policy leaders in this country, \nhas to be a ``go to it'' spirit.\n  If at this point we simply accept it is there, we have to accept that \nat some point a very large part of one of our cities or our basic \ninstitutions could be under attack and this time could disappear, with \nabsolutely devastating results for our country or any other country \nthat was victimized in this way.\n  If we ask the basic questions we would have asked before September \n11--Who could possibly do this? And for what reason?--we are staggered \nas we watch the tape of Osama bin Laden or listen to interviews with \npeople who seem to be committed to a very different course of action \nthat most of us find even remotely conceivable, morally or as human \nbeings.\n  Unless we are prepared simply to forget September 11, roll the clock \nback into a simpler time, then we will have to deal with more complex \ntimes.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me to proceed in morning business with \na message that I believe is important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13286-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PROGRESS ON THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor for a couple of \nminutes prior to the time we finish our Senate business for the week \nto, first, compliment the Presiding Officer who has been our floor \nmanager on the farm bill now for 1 entire week.\n  This afternoon marks 1 complete week of deliberation on the farm \nbill. I know this has not been easy on many, nor easy on the ranking \nmember, as they have attempted to deal with the bill itself.\n  I compliment the Chair for his outstanding leadership and patience \nand the extraordinary effort he has made to manage this bill in a way \nthat accommodated virtually every Senator.\n  I am disappointed that we weren't able to achieve cloture on the \nbill. I have indicated that we are going to keep trying to reach that \npoint where we can bring debate to a close. I know there are a number \nof other amendments. We accommodated those on the other side of the \naisle who wish to bring up an alternative to the committee-passed bill, \nthe so-called Roberts-Cochran bill.\n  I believe we have had a good debate. I hope we can complete our work \nthis coming week. I would not want to have to come back after that, but \nwe will entertain the possibility of coming back additional days after \nChristmas, if need be, to get this job done. There is nothing that says \nwe can't keep coming back until the 23rd of January, if necessary. We \nwill look at all the options. But we need to bring this bill to a \nclose. As I have said on other occasions, we need to do it for a number \nof reasons. Some of us have outlined those reasons throughout the week.\n  I think as we close out the week and mark the fact that we have now \nspent a week on the bill, we remind all colleagues that we have a \nbudget window that may close. If that budget window closes and we are \nprecluded even by a few billion dollars from dealing with all the needs \nin this bill, what a mistake that would be. What a moment of admission \nof failure that would be. I hope we can avoid doing that and avoid that \nscenario.\n\n  Secondly, I know, based on many conversations the managers and I have \nhad and others have had with regard to the continuity, of the need to \nhave a clear roadmap on how we transition from Freedom to Farm to \nwhatever it is that Congress ultimately passes, something that every \nfarmer and rancher would like to know.\n  I think that is the reason I got calls again this morning from \nfarmers and ranchers in South Dakota who said: Please pass this \nlegislation as quickly as you can because we need to know. We need to \nplan.\n  There is so much uncertainty in farm legislation as it is. There is \nso much uncertainty with agriculture as it is. To exacerbate that \nuncertainty by refusing to act, or not acting as quickly as we should, \nis compounding the problem unnecessarily.\n  We have seen a 75-percent reduction in farm prices since 1996. That \nis a remarkable demonstration of the need to do something now.\n  I hasten once again to note the importance of completing our work. I \nalso say that as complicated as farm administration is, it is important \nthat the Department of Agriculture be given as much lead time to make \nthe transition as smoothly as they can.\n  There is no question, from a farm income point of view, from a farm \ncertainty point of view, from the smoothness in transition point of \nview, and from the budget point of view, one could add more and more \nreasons that it is important for us to finish our work. No one has said \nit more eloquently or passionately than the chairman of the committee, \nmy friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  I simply come to the floor to again reiterate that we are determined \nto finish this bill. We are determined to do all we can to finish it \nnot only on the floor but in conference. We will do whatever it takes \nto stay, to work, to cooperate, and to find ways to compromise. But it \nhas to be a two-way street.\n  We have to continue to keep the pressure on. That is certainly my \nintention. I know it is the intention of the distinguished chair of \ncommittee. It has been 1 week. If necessary, it will be 2 weeks. And, \nif necessary, it will be 3 weeks, or more. But we are going to get this \nbill done.\n  I am just reminded that while we have been on the bill for a week, we \nactually made the motion to proceed 2 weeks ago.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about our fight against \nterrorism and a report in the New York Times last Thursday about the \nJustice Department's denial of requests from the FBI to review \nbackground check records for gun purchases as part of its antiterrorist \ninvestigation.\n  When I met with Justice Department officials on November 1, I was \ninformed that in the immediate aftermath of the\n\n[[Page S13287]]\n\nSeptember 11 attacks, the Department of Justice compared the audit log \nof approved gun sales under Brady law's National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System to the Federal Government's terrorist \nwatchlists.\n  The New York Times reported that on September 16, 5 days after the \nterrorist attacks, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms \nrequested the FBI center that operates the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System to check a list of 186 names against the NICS \naudit log. The names were identified as aliens whose identities had \nbeen developed during the ongoing terrorist investigation. The FBI got \ntwo hits, meaning that two of the persons on the watchlist had been \napproved to buy guns.\n  The ATF's request and the resulting hits underscore the point that \nthe NICS audit log has a clear investigative value for law enforcement \nand our counterterrorist efforts.\n  Yet the day after the FBI made its initial check, the Attorney \nGeneral's lawyers prohibited further reviews of the audit log by the \nFBI for the purposes of the terrorist investigation.\n  The Congress passed and the President signed the Patriot Act earlier \nthis year to give the Attorney General expanded powers to fight \nterrorism. The Attorney General has used these powers and others \ncreated by the administration, without congressional input, to permit, \nfor example, eavesdropping on detainees' conversations with their \nattorneys, to implement new wiretapping authority, and to look into the \nbackgrounds of truck drivers and crop duster pilots, and immigrants.\n\n  When President Bush addressed Congress on September 20, he said:\n\n       We will direct every resource at our command--every means \n     of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of \n     law enforcement, every financial influence, and every \n     necessary weapon of war--to the disruption and to the defeat \n     of the global terror network.\n\n  Now we find the Attorney General is bending over backwards to protect \nthe special interests of the gun lobby at the expense of the safety of \nthe American people and the investigation into terrorism. Rather than \nseeking every opportunity to give law enforcement all the information \nat hand, the Attorney General has chosen, erroneously in my view, to \ninterpret the Brady law and related Justice Department regulations as \nprohibiting the use of the audit log for investigative purposes beyond \nthe performance of the system.\n  Even if the Attorney General believed he did not have the authority \nto review the audit log for investigative purposes, why then did he not \nask Congress for that authority back in September when he was putting \ntogether his proposals for the Patriot Act? Why wouldn't he want \nFederal law enforcement officers to know if a suspect or potential \ninformant had recently purchased a firearm when they go to question or \ndetain that person? Finally, why would he continue to seek to reduce \nthe retention time for the audit log from 90 days to 1 business day, \nforcing ATF to ask more than 70,000 federally licensed gun dealers to \nreview their sales records every time law enforcement authorities \nconduct a review for names associated with gun crimes but particularly \nassociated with terrorist activities?\n  We can only conclude that politics and the powerful influence of the \ngun lobby have trumped gun policy once again. I hope the Attorney \nGeneral will reconsider his position. None of us really knows what the \nnext terrorist attack will look like. We cannot assume that because the \nattacks on September 11 did not involve firearms, the next one will not \nalso involve firearms. We should give law enforcement every tool at our \ndisposal to prevent terrorists from gaining access to firearms, and to \nknow about it when they do.\n\n  If the Attorney General insists upon the narrowest interpretation of \nallowable uses of the NICS audit log, we need legislation to make it \nabsolutely clear that law enforcement authorities can review these \nrecords if they have reason to believe that a person under \ninvestigation, particularly under investigation for terrorist activity, \nmay have purchased a firearm.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Schumer as a cosponsor of S. 1788, to \nclarify that NICS audit log records may be accessed by the Federal \nauthorities for the purposes of responding to an inquiry from any \nfederal, state or local law enforcement agency, and also to ensure that \nthese records be maintained for at least 90 days to ensure a reliable \nauditing system is in place.\n  I also look forward to consideration at the earliest possible time \nnext year of my legislation to close the gun show loophole, so that we \ncan prevent convicted felons, fugitives from justice, and, yes, even \nterrorists, from buying guns from private dealers at gun shows without \na background check.\n  There has been a lot of misinformation about the technical \nrequirements of conducting Brady Law background checks at guns shows. \nIt has been suggested that gun shows in rural areas are not equipped \nwith the technology to make background checks feasible. The only \ntechnology needed to run a Brady background check is a telephone. At \nmost gun shows, federally licensed firearms dealers use cell phones to \nconduct background checks. At others, telephone ``land lines'' are made \navailable. Under my bill, these federally licensed dealers would run \nchecks on behalf of unlicensed sellers at the gun show, ensuring that a \nbackground check is run every time a gun is sold at more than 4,000 gun \nshows held each year in America.\n  I should also add that 95 percent of these checks are completed \nwithin two hours, and no new technology would be required beyond access \nto a telephone, a device that has been with us for a long time. My \nconstituents in Rhode Island and all Americans pay a universal service \nfee as part of their monthly phone bills to ensure that telephone \nservice is available to every part of this country, no matter how rural \nor how remote.\n  Let's close the gun show loophole so that convicted felons, domestic \nabusers, terrorists, and other prohibited persons do not use gun shows \nto purchase firearms without a Brady background check.\n  When we confront terrorists, and when we hear the President say every \ntool available to law enforcement will be used, let us ensure every \ntool is used. Let us ensure there is no area that is off limits because \nof the powerful influence of the gun lobby. Let us give our law \nenforcement officials every opportunity to protect America from \nterrorist attacks.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13287-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13287-S13290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF EUGENE SCALIA\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I rise to join many of our colleagues to express my \nfrustration with the leadership for failing to permit a floor vote on \nthe nomination of Eugene Scalia to be the Solicitor General of the \nLabor Department. I was mystified as to what reasons there could \npossibly be to hold up the President's choice, his pick, for this vital \nposition at a time when it is of national urgency for the Labor \nDepartment to have its team in place.\n  I have heard it said in the press it is because Scalia is the son of \nJustice Antonin Scalia and that this is some sort of payback for the \nBush v. Gore decision. I personally find that hard to believe. Such a \nmotive would be far below the dignity of the Senate. The notion that \nthis Chamber would in effect punish a Supreme Court Justice or his \nfamily for a decision, any decision, would be abhorrent to anyone who \nloves this institution or the Constitution.\n  I also find it hard to believe because the Senate confirmed Ted \nOlsen, who litigated the Bush v. Gore case, although some did try to \nstop his confirmation despite his unquestionable qualifications. We \nalso confirmed Janet Rehnquist, the daughter of the Chief Justice, to \nbe inspector general of the Department of Human Services. But that is \nwhat is being said to the public. We wonder why the public is so \ncynical about the Congress.\n  I, personally, do not believe that is the reason Mr. Scalia is being \nheld up. But I have also heard, and this reason is very troubling to \nme, that it is because Eugene Scalia is a devout, pro-life Catholic. He \nis being targeted by radical fringe elements because his name has \nsymbolic value. I only hope this is not true. If that is true, this is \nalso troubling because it shows that an appearance has been created \nthat there is an ulterior partisan motive.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an op-ed by \nMarianne Means, who wrote, ``Two\n\n[[Page S13288]]\n\nScalias In Our Government Are Too Many.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Two Scalias in Our Government Are Two Too Many\n\n                (By Marianne Means, Hearst News Service)\n\n       Washington.--When President Bush nominated the son of \n     conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia to the \n     third-highest post in the Labor Department, the terrorist \n     attacks had not occurred and Bush was not yet in a political \n     unity mode.\n       This week, however, Eugene Scalia's nomination to be the \n     department's solicitor--its top lawyer--was before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee threatening to blow up the fragile aura \n     of bipartisanship the president is currently trying to \n     foster. During his hearing, Scalia was sternly grilled by \n     Democratic members and lavishly praised by the Republicans.\n       Giving Scalia power to interpret the administration's \n     policies toward organized labor, which worked hard to defeat \n     Bush in the 2000 election, was a deliberately vengeful move. \n     Looming over the selection is the dark shadow of his cranky \n     father, the architect of the court's rightward drift on civil \n     rights and the mastermind of the court's convoluted ruling \n     that handed the presidency to Bush. Eugene Scalia's \n     nomination inescapably looks like a gigantic political \n     payback, meant to reaffirm Bush's authority by slapping the \n     Democrats in the face.\n       In April when he picked Scalia, Bush had embarked on a \n     crusade to drive the country to the right, rolling over the \n     Democratic congressional minority and his own party's \n     moderates. In those days, he had no interest in \n     bipartisanship.\n       His first choice as Labor Secretary, the conservative anti-\n     labor commentator Linda Chavez, proved to be too \n     controversial and was forced to withdraw her name. She was \n     replaced by Elaine Chao, whose attitude is less ideological \n     than Chavez's and is therefore less objectionable to the \n     major unions. Scalia, 37, seems to have been selected to give \n     Chao the backbone to be tough on the labor movement whenever \n     possible.\n       During his career as a labor lawyer, Scalia campaigned \n     vigorously to repeal Clinton-era federal ergonomics rules \n     designed to reduce repetitive-motion injuries and lower back \n     problems. He said he doubted the ``very existence'' of the \n     problem, which union officials take very seriously, and \n     mocked ergonomics as ``junk science.'' The Clinton rule was \n     killed by the Republican-controlled Congress earlier this \n     year, and Chao is currently reviewing proposals for revised \n     ergonomics rules.\n       Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \n     Chairman Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., is unequivocal in his \n     opposition to Scalia. The senator says his writings and his \n     record ``clearly suggest that his views are outside the \n     mainstream on many issues of vital importance to the nation's \n     workers and their families.''\n       The committee is divided along party lines, with all 10 \n     Democrats opposed to Scalia and all 10 Republicans supporting \n     him. When the committee votes next week, the tie will be \n     broken by former Republican-turned-independent James Jeffords \n     of Vermont. Recently Jeffords said awkwardly, ``I think I'll \n     probably support him . . . reluctantly.''\n       That means the nomination will go to the Senate floor, \n     where Kennedy vowed ``there will be a battle.'' Business \n     groups have lined up behind Scalia, and the AFL-CIO is \n     campaigning against him, making the outcome uncertain.\n       The floor vote is likely to break down along party lines, \n     marking the first serious tear in the bipartisan fabric Bush \n     is trying to weave.\n       He visited the Labor Department Thursday and warned, ``This \n     is not a time to worry about partisan politics.''\n       He should have thought of that before he picked such a \n     partisan nominee. Scalia, a choice left over from the pre-\n     unity era, is a flagrant example of the partisan excesses of \n     that period before the terrorist attacks. It is impossible \n     for the Democrats to embrace Scalia, and Bush knew it when he \n     chose him. It would be disingenuous of the president to claim \n     now to be shocked that the nomination has provoked a partisan \n     confrontation.\n       If Bush is really serious about working in a bipartisan \n     fashion, he should withdraw the nomination. There are other \n     qualified Republican labor lawyers who would not raise so \n     many hackles and cost the president so much in good will.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Members can see why I am concerned. I have always tried to \njudge nominations without bias or self-interest. I am concerned, \nhowever, that the Senate is not demonstrating similar fairness to the \nPresident and this nominee. But these partisan remarks, extraneous to \nMr. Scalia's qualifications, are bound to arise when the Democratic \nleadership refuses to allow Mr. Scalia and his qualifications to be \nopenly debated in the light of day.\n  If you do not like Mr. Scalia for any reason at all, including the \nfact that he is a pro-life Catholic, or the fact that he is Justice \nScalia's son, then vote against him and show your bigotry that way.\n  But the fact is, he ought to have a vote. The President ought to have \na vote. Even if Members do not like Mr. Scalia, he is the President's \nchoice. He ought to have a vote.\n  I have to say the allegation by some that it is because he is a pro-\nlife Catholic bothers me. As a practicing member of the Church of Jesus \nChrist of Latter Day Saints, I have known much bigotry due to my faith, \nand especially because I am a pro-life member of my faith. As we all \nknow, mine is the only denomination that had mobs go against it, with a \npogrom ordered against it within the United States of America. I find \nbias against a person because of his or her religious beliefs \nparticularly repugnant. I worry about that type of thing.\n  I know people in the Congress who will not vote for anybody who is \npro-life. I believe there are some people who will not vote for anybody \nbecause they are pro-choice. I think that is abysmal. I think the \nPresident, whomever he or she may be, should be given tremendous \nsupport with regard to the nominees they send up here--unless there is \nsome legitimate reason for rejecting the nominee. That is another \nmatter.\n  I have also heard it is because Mr. Scalia may have a differing \nopinion on ergonomics. My gosh, ergonomics could not get through the \nCongress because a majority happened to be against the ergonomics \nproposal. It seems very bad to hold it against Mr. Scalia because he \nmay differ with a minority in the Congress.\n  There is no apparent reason for some of these things, and in my years \non the Judiciary Committee I have learned a thing or two about judging \nthe qualifications of lawyers who serve in our Government. It is clear \nthat Eugene Scalia is highly qualified to hold the position for which \nthe President has nominated him. Mr. Scalia has a distinguished career \nin private practice and has been an influential writer and laborer in \nemployment law.\n  He has been strongly supported by lawyers to whose views my \nDemocratic colleagues and I normally give great weight--William \nColeman, former Secretary of Transportation and a great civil rights \nleader, a dear friend to most all in this body; Professor Cass \nSunstein, one of the two or three leading advisers to my Democratic \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee, not known for conservative \npolitics, but liberal politics, a very good guy; and Professor William \nRobinson, the chair of the College of Labor and Employment Lawyers who \ndescribes how Mr. Scalia taught on a volunteer basis at the UDC law \nschool when that predominantly minority institution had financial \ndifficulties and could not afford to pay a full faculty.\n  This person gives his time voluntarily in a primarily minority \ninstitution, a law school, and does not ask for a cent and does it out \nof the goodness of his heart. That ought to be given some consideration \naround here.\n  This is hard to believe, but Mr. Scalia was nominated more than 7 \nmonths ago. Seven months ago! He was reported favorably out of \ncommittee and has been waiting for a floor vote for 6 weeks.\n  Still a vote has not been scheduled. Why not? Well, it saddens me, \nbut it is becoming ever more believable that Mr. Scalia is being \ntreated this way for reasons beyond his qualifications, whatever they \nmay be, and I hope they are not the two I have mentioned. Whether \nbecause of the Bush v. Gore Supreme Court decision or otherwise, they \nwant to punish Eugene Scalia for his association with his father's \nopinions, and I surely hope it is not because he is pro-life and a \ndevoted member of the Catholic faith.\n  The President of the United States is working hard for the American \npeople. The least we can do in the Senate is to confirm his qualified \nnominees to serve in his administration unless there is something \ngravely wrong with their records. We owe this to the President. We owe \nit to the American people. We need to let President Bush staff up his \nadministration so he has the people he needs to get the job done.\n  Every time we play partisan games with a Presidential nomination, we \nmake the President's job that much harder and we fail to discharge our \nconstitutional duty. We prevent the President and his top people at the \nWhite House from focusing on the war\n\n[[Page S13289]]\n\neffort, getting the economy moving, and a host of other things the \nAmerican people care about.\n  The Labor Department has front line responsibilities for worker \nsafety and economic security. It has been working hard to help \nemployers deal with the anthrax threat, and it has been helping \nemployees laid off by the economic downturn. We are not helping the \nLabor Department, we are hurting it, and we are hurting American \nworkers if we do not allow a vote so the Department can have its top \nlawyer in place.\n  Some have said the reason he is not getting a vote in the Senate is \nthat the unions do not want him. I have to say there are times when \npeople on our side have not wanted what the unions want, and there are \npeople on the other side who have not wanted what the unions want. The \nergonomics rule was the perfect illustration. The resolution of that \nissue should not be held against anybody. People ought to have a right \nwithin the framework and the mainstream of the law to think what they \nwant.\n  I have to admit, I am sure the AFL-CIO, as much as I respect it, as \nmuch as I respect its leadership--having been one of the few Senators \nwho have actually held a union card--I went through an informal \napprenticeship, became a journeyman in the AFL-CIO, I understand there \nare irritations with some of President Bush's nominations, but no less \nthan there were with President Clinton's nominations. They were put \nthrough, or at least they were allowed a vote.\n  Mr. Scalia is one of the finest people I know yet he is not even \ngiven the consideration of a vote. Back in July, five former Solicitors \nof Labor urged us to move quickly on this nomination. Both of President \nClinton's Labor Solicitors joined that letter. We not only have the \nones I have mentioned, who are strong Democrats, but the two Clinton \nSolicitors of Labor who said Mr. Scalia deserves a vote and should be \nsupported. The five Solicitors said it was harming the Department of \nLabor and the workers whom the Department serves the longer we delay \nthis decision. So I say let us have a vote on this highly qualified \nnominee before we adjourn.\n  Last but not least, and changing the subject, I praise the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, for the movement we have \nhad in the last month on Federal district court judges. Admittedly, \nthey are people who have Democrat support, or have both Democrat and \nRepublican support. They are people who are slam dunks, unanimous \nconsent type of people, but I think virtually everyone President Bush \nhas nominated to the judiciary is a slam dunk, unanimous consent \nsupported individual.\n\n  What is bothering me is we have an inordinate number of circuit court \nof appeals judge nominations that are not being brought up. At our last \nconfirmation hearing for district court nominees, a point was made that \nthose nominees had been pending for less than 60 days since receipt of \ntheir American Bar Association ratings. If this is the standard, then \nthe committee is falling woefully behind, especially on circuit court \nof appeals nominations. There are 8 circuit court nominees who have \nbeen languishing for 157 days or more since receiving their ABA \nratings. In fact, some of them have been pending for more than 180 days \nsince being rated by the ABA and nearly 220 days since their \nnomination.\n  I agree with the suggestion that 2 months should be the standard \nlimit to review nominees. We should apply this standard or better to \nthe circuit court nominees President Bush sent to the Senate nearly 220 \ndays ago. These are not just nominees, these are some of the finest \nlawyers ever nominated to the circuit courts of appeals, and I will \nmention two of them.\n  John Roberts, who was left hanging at the end of the first Bush \nadministration, who is considered one of the two best appellate lawyers \nin the country, and who is not known as a partisan Republican, he was \nleft hanging then, and now he has been left hanging for almost 220 \ndays.\n  I have heard so many complaints during other Republican \nadministrations of not enough women and minorities being nominated, but \nnow we have one of the leading minority lawyers in the country, Miguel \nEstrada, and he cannot even get a hearing. He has argued 14 cases \nbefore the Supreme Court; Roberts, many more. Most lawyers never argue \na case before the Supreme Court. Estrada is respected by the courts of \nthis country. He is one of the brightest lawyers in this country today.\n  What really moves me, even more than that, is this is a young man who \ncame from a country of abject poverty, graduated with honors from \nColumbia University, then was at the top of his class at Harvard Law \nSchool, became a law clerk and, of course, has had a distinguished \nlegal career. There is not one thing any reasonable person would find \nagainst him. And he is Hispanic. We are trying to do what is right.\n  I do not understand it. If we do not get these judges on the Circuit \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia and in other circuits as \nwell, we are going to be very directly harmed in this country. The \npeople will suffer. We have to quit playing games with this.\n  I have to admit there were times when during the Clinton \nadministration I wished that I, as chairman of the committee, could \nhave done better. There were some people on our side who I think acted \nirresponsibly, as there are people on the other side today acting \nirresponsibly. People of good will, those of us who really believe a \nPresident's nominees ought to be given their votes, these people ought \nto prevail in this body, and we ought to start establishing a system \nthat works with regard to judicial nominations.\n  Lest anybody think President Clinton was mistreated, the all-time \nconfirmation champion was Ronald Reagan with 382 Federal court judges \nwho were confirmed. By the way, President Reagan had 6 years of his own \nparty in control of the Senate. President Clinton had 5 fewer than \nReagan, 377, and would have had 3 more than Reagan had it not been for \nDemocrat holds on the other side. Frankly, even President Clinton told \nme he thought we did a good job.\n  Were there some exceptions? Sure. There always are. There have been \nfor my whole 25 years in the Senate. Somebody has a hold or somebody \ndoes not like somebody for some stupid reason or another. But the fact \nof the matter is that President Clinton was well treated. When we \nfinished, there were 67 vacancies. President Clinton once said that 63 \nvacancies, when Senator Biden was the chairman on the Democrat side, \nwas a full judiciary.\n  Today we have almost 100 vacancies, and we have to do something about \nit, but we are not doing it with regard to these circuit court of \nappeals judges and I sure want to get that going.\n  I hope our distinguished chairman and others on the committee will \nhelp this President get done the nominations he has so carefully, I \nthink, selected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am constrained, after listening to my good friend from \nUtah talk about nominating judges and vacancies--I cannot let the \nmoment pass without pointing out that on the Eighth Circuit Court of \nAppeals there is a vacancy today. That vacancy is there because my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle would not let us vote last year \non the former attorney general of Iowa, Bonnie Campbell, to take that \nposition as circuit court judge on the Eighth Circuit Court.\n  She had a hearing, she came out of committee, but they would not let \nus bring her name up on the floor for a vote. She was perfectly \nqualified to be on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. As I said, we \nhad all the hearings. She was supported by everyone. Yet they would not \npermit her name to come up for a vote before we left last year.\n  Bonnie Campbell is not on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals today \nbecause of pure politics. Because the Republicans, those on that side, \nlast year--I guess correctly--thought they were going to win the \nnational election and therefore they didn't have to put through any \njudges on the circuit courts.\n  So Bonnie Campbell--there is a vacancy there today because of \npolitics. Not that she wasn't qualified. I always said bring her up for \na vote; if people want to vote against her, vote against her--just the \nsame argument the Senator from Utah made right now. I made the same \nargument last year. Bonnie Campbell is qualified. No one says she is \nnot. Let's bring her up for a vote. Yet the leadership on that side \nprevented us from ever having a vote on\n\n[[Page S13290]]\n\nBonnie Campbell's nomination to be Eighth Circuit Court judge.\n  I hope my friend from Utah doesn't want to preach too much to me, to \nthis Senator, about politics being involved in circuit court judges. I \nknow full well what happened last year. It is on the record. This \nSenator stood at the desk right back there, day after day, asking that \nBonnie Campbell's name come up for debate and vote. Every time it was \nobjected to by the other side.

Mr. President, I am pleased that Senators Dodd, \nMcConnell, Schumer, Bond, and Torricelli were able to reach agreement \non a strong, bipartisan election reform bill.\n  Studies of the 2000 elections have made it clear that outdated and \nunreliable technology, confusing ballots, language barriers, lack of \nvoter education, lack of poll-worker training, and inaccurate voting \nlists all added up to the disenfranchisement of six million voters.\n  These problems are unacceptable, and, as a Nation, we can't afford to \nrepeat them. Our Federal system leaves it to individual States to \nconduct their own elections; but Congress has an obligation to see to \nit that election mechanisms and procedures in every county in every \nState guarantee every eligible citizen a voice in the democratic \nprocess\n  Under this agreement, States will be required to meet minimum \nstandards, and a bipartisan committee will be created to set those \nstandards.\n  This bill requires that election officials notify voters of overvotes \nand give them the opportunity to correct a flawed ballot before it is \ncast. It will establish statewide computerized voter registration \nlists.\n  This bill further guarantees that voting machines be made accessible \nto people with limited English proficiency and people with \ndisabilities, and that provisional ballots be made available to people \nwhose names do not appear on voting lists. Those ballots would be set \naside until it can be determined whether the individual's name was \nmistakenly left off the registration list. If it was, the vote is then \ncounted.\n  Finally, this bill provides the real resources these real reforms \ndemand.\n  As we protect our democracy from its external enemies, we must also \nfix its internal flaws. That is what this compromise bill will do, and \nI look forward to working to get it passed early in the next session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13290-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARIE MOORE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to one of my departing \nstaff who has been working in my personal office for almost 4 years. \nMarie Moore has served as my Deputy Press Secretary since May 1998, and \nhas distinguished herself in many ways. She has handled her duties with \ngrace and professionalism, and quite frankly has set the standard for \nthose who will follow her in this very demanding position.\n  Marie has served with me during some of our Nation's most historic \nand sometimes very difficult and dramatic events. On occasion these \nevents have demanded very much of her, as they did all Senate staff \nmembers but particularly those who are required to deal one on one with \na sometimes skeptical or hostile media. She certainly leaves Washington \nwith some memories and experiences which will benefit her professional \ncareer and her personal life for many years to come.\n  Marie's tenacious work ethic and organizational skills have benefited \nour office's operation greatly. Both are exemplary. Maybe she learned \nthese attributes at Ole Miss, where she graduated with a journalism \ndegree just before coming to Washington. However, I suspect the best of \nMarie Moore is a product of her wonderful family and upbringing back in \nHolly Springs, MS. Only a few short days after joining my staff, Marie \nbegan reorganizing the press shop, adding new filing cabinets, \nrearranging furniture, finding more space for this or that, all for the \nbetter. She has demonstrated a tremendous capacity for leadership. She \nknows how to take charge and really get things done with presented with \nvirtually any challenge. For instance, in addition to working on my \nstaff, Marie has been an active member of the Mississippi Society of \nWashington, helping to organize events and recruit new members. She has \nalso selflessly assisted me and my staff in a number of other duties, \nnot necessarily in her job description, but tasks which must be done \nand require an exceptional degree of patience, understanding, and \nskill.\n  She is excellent with my constituents who come to Washington. Marie \nhas always provided a friendly face and warm welcome for the many \nvisitors I receive each day, and she is always quick to entertain them \nwith refreshments or conversation if the have to wait. Additionally, \nshe has done a wonderful job in handling the many photographs which are \nrequired of a U.S. Senator. Marie always makes sure those seeking a \nphoto with me have that opportunity, and that these many photos get \nback to those with whom I have met.\n  Marie has proven to be press savvy, something we all value here in \nWashington. She has a keen mind for what may or may not be a news item, \nand in their regard shows experience well beyond her years. Marie knows \nhow to meet deadlines, how to prioritize and most importantly how to \nget information to the public in an effective, comprehensive and timely \nmanner.\n  We all know people who are somehow just prone to being successful in \nanything they undertake. Marie is one of those people. I have no doubt, \nthat whatever career path is are in Marie Moore's future, she will \nsucceed.\n  May I add, for those Americans who sometimes make negative \ngeneralization about America's younger people, Marie Moore is just the \nopposite in every way. She is an example of the best in America's \nfuture. She is an asset to our country and to this institution. I will \nmiss her very much, and so will many other people in the U.S. Senate \nwho work with Marie on a daily basis. Marie made it a point to know \nnames, remember faces throughout the Capitol and Senate Office \nBuildings, just as she did with our visitors. I know the folks down in \nthe Senate recording studio, the photo studio, the service department \nand a host of other Senate offices share my sentiments about Marie, and \nour loss. But, we wish Marie the very best in her new endeavor, and I \ncertainly hope she will stop by and visit when back in Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13290-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13290-S13291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SECRET HOLDS ON THE 21ST CENTURY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE APPROPRIATIONS \n                           AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that one or more \nRepublican Senators are holding up final passage of the 21st Century \nDepartment of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, H.R. 2215.\n  This bipartisan bill is supported by the Bush Administration and \ncosponsored by Senator Hatch, the ranking Republican Member of the \nJudiciary Committee. It was unanimously approved by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee back on October 30.\n  This bill, with a bipartisan amendment authored by Senator Hatch and \nmyself, has cleared the Democratic cloakroom for final passage but \nsomeone on the other side of the aisle has placed a secret hold on it. \nI would urge my Republican friends to permit the Senate to take up and \npass this critical legislation.\n  The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization \nAct, provides permanent enabling authorities which will allow the \nDepartment of Justice to efficiently carry out its mission.\n  At a time when the Department of Justice is conducting the most \nsweeping investigation into terrorist conspiracies in our Nation's \nhistory, the Senate should pass this legislation.\n  Indeed, Title II our bipartisan bill provides the Department of \nJustice with additional law enforcement tools in the war against \nterrorism. Section 201 permits the FBI to enter into cooperative \nprojects with foreign countries to improve law enforcement or \nintelligence operations, and Section 210 provides special ``danger \npay'' allowances for FBI agents in hazardous duty locations outside the \nUnited States.\n  In addition, the bill as passed by the Committee, contains language \noffered by Senator Feinstein to authorize a number of new judgeships.\n\n[[Page S13291]]\n\n  Title III of this bipartisan legislation authorizes eight new \npermanent judgeships as follows: five judgeships in the Southern \nDistrict of California; two judgeships in the Western District of \nTexas; and one judgeship in the Western District of North Carolina. \nSection 312 would also convert two temporary judgeships in Illinois \ninto permanent judgeships, create one new temporary judgeship in the \nWestern District of North Carolina, and extend the temporary judgeship \nin the Northern District of Ohio for five years.\n  I strongly support Senator Feinstein's amendment, as do many of my \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan basis, including \nSenator DeWine, Senator Durbin, Senator Edwards, and others. I believe \nthat the need for these new judgeships is acute.\n  Finally, the bill creates a separate Violence Against Women Office to \ncombat domestic violence. This section of the bill was crafted by \nSenator Biden and Senator Specter--another bipartisan partnership in \nthis legislation. There is strong bipartisan support in the House and \nSenate to create a separate Violence Against Women Office within the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Senator Hatch and I have also worked together to craft a bipartisan \nfloor amendment which compiles a comprehensive authorization of expired \nand new Department of Justice grants programs and improvements to \ncriminal law and procedures.\n  For example, our bipartisan floor amendment authorizes Department of \nJustice grants to establish 4,000 Boys and Girls Clubs across the \ncountry before January 1, 2007. This bipartisan amendment authorizes \nDepartment of Justice grants for each of the next 5 years to establish \n1,200 additional Boys and Girls Clubs across the Nation. In fact, this \nwill bring the number of Boys and Girls Clubs to 4,000. That means they \nwill serve approximately 6 million young people by January 1, 2007.\n  In 1997, I was very proud to join with Senator Hatch and others to \npass bipartisan legislation to authorize grants by the Department of \nJustice to fund 2,500 Boys and Girls Clubs across the Nation. We \nincreased the Department of Justice grant funding for the Boys and \nGirls Clubs from $20 million in 1998 to $60 million in 2001. That is \none reason why we have now 2,591 Boys and Girls Clubs in all 50 States \nand 3.3 million children are being served. It is quite a success story.\n  But the authorization for these Department of Justice grants to Boys \nand Girls Clubs across the country has expired. This bipartisan \nlegislation will renew and expand these grants.\n  Parents, educators, law enforcement officers, and others know we need \nsafe havens where young people can learn and grow up free from the \ninfluence of the drugs and gangs and crime. That is why the Boys and \nGirls Clubs are so important to our Nation's children.\n  Our bipartisan amendment also includes the Drug Abuse Education, \nPrevention, and Treatment Act of 2001. I am pleased that we have \nincluded in this package the version of S. 304 that the Judiciary \nCommittee passed unanimously on November 29. This legislation ushers in \na new, bipartisan approach to our efforts to reduce drug abuse in the \nUnited States. It was introduced by Senator Hatch and I in February. \nSenator Hatch held an excellent hearing on the bill in March, the \nJudiciary Committee has approved it, and the full Senate should follow \nthe committee's lead. This is a bill that is embraced by Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, as well as law enforcement officers and drug \ntreatment providers.\n  This legislation provides a comprehensive approach to reducing drug \nabuse in America. I hope that the innovative programs established by \nthis legislation will assist all of our States in their efforts to \naddress the drug problems that most affect our communities.\n  Our bipartisan amendment also includes provisions to protect \nwitnesses who provide information on criminal activity to law \nenforcement officials by increasing maximum sentences and other \nimprovements to the criminal code.\n  And our bipartisan legislation contains amendments, authored by \nSenator Sessions, that modify the Paul Coverdell National Forensic \nScience Improvement Act of 2000 to enhance participation by local crime \nlabs and to allow for DNA backlog elimination. I was proud to cosponsor \nthe Coverdell grants bill last year and support it to help bring the \nnecessary forensic technology to all states to improve their criminal \njustice systems.\n  The 21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization \nAct should result in more effective, as well as efficient, Department \nof Justice for the American people. But it must pass the Senate soon \nand be reconciled with the House-passed bill in a conference.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to lift the \nsecret hold on this bipartisan legislation to support the Department of \nJustice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13291-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred January 14, \n1993 in Macon, GA. Elizabeth Davidson, a 25-year-old lesbian, was \nfatally shot in a bar. The attacker, Deion N. Felton was charged with \nmurder in connection with the crime. An accomplice, Shawn Hightower, \n16, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit aggravated assault. Felton \nand Hightower allegedly were engaged in a plan to rob homosexuals at \nthe time of the killing.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13291-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GUNS AND TERRORISTS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am concerned about the Attorney General's \ndecision to deny law enforcement access to the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System database. According to a December 6 \nstory in The New York Times, following the events of September 11, FBI \nofficials checked the NICS database for the names of 186 suspects being \ndetained in connection with the terrorist attacks. The search turned up \ntwo matches of detained individuals approved to buy guns.\n  According to the Attorney General, existing law does not give him the \nauthority to approve law enforcement's review of these records. But \ndespite knowledge of this gap, the Attorney General did not request \nthis authority in the comprehensive USA PATRIOT Act signed into law by \nthe President on October 26. Since September 11, over 500 individuals \nhave been detained, but law enforcement has not been able to audit the \nNICS database for gun purchases by detained individuals. I believe the \nAttorney General's actions are at odds with his own priorities. That is \nwhy I was pleased to cosponsor the Use NICS in Terrorist Investigations \nAct introduced by Senators Kennedy and Schumer. This bill would \nestablish a 90-day period for law enforcement to retain NICS data. It \nwould also give the FBI the authority they need to review the NICS \ndatabase. I urge the Attorney General to endorse this legislation and \ngive law enforcement the comprehensive tools they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13291-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13291-S13292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         VETERANS EDUCATION AND BENEFITS EXPANSION ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise to comment on important legislation \npassed by the Senate last evening, H.R. 1291, the Veterans Education \nand Benefits Expansion Act of 2001. This compromise agreement is the \nproduct of negotiations between the House and the Senate to craft an \nagreement between the Senate- and House-passed bills aimed at improving \na wide array of benefits affecting veterans and their families. \nIncluded in this legislation is funding for improving educational \nbenefits under the Montgomery GI Bill, enhancing veterans' \ncompensation, and increasing home loan guarantees. This legislation \nalso makes important investments in vocational training, education, and \noutreach programs to improve economic and educational opportunities for \nveterans who served our\n\n[[Page S13292]]\n\ncountry. And, this legislation expands the definition of service-\nconnected disability to include symptoms associated with ``Gulf War \nsyndrome'' thereby enabling those veterans suffering from Gulf War-\nrelated symptoms to receive the compensation and care they deserve. Our \nnation's veterans have served our country with distinction and have \nsacrificed in the defense of our country. These veterans deserve \nbenefits commensurate to their service to our country. In many ways, \nthis legislation recognizes the sacrifices and commitment of our \nnation's veterans, and rightfully rewards their service and valor.\n  I wanted to take some time to talk about a very important aspect of \nthis legislation--Section 502--which is a provision pertaining to \nproviding VA grave markers for deceased veterans. On December 7, 2001, \nthe Senate unanimously passed S. 1088, the Veterans' Benefits \nImprovement Act of 2001. This legislation included a provision which is \nbased on legislation that I introduced this year and in the 106th \nCongress. It has the support of every major veterans group and a wide \narray of organizations including the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the \nAmerican Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, the Air Force Sergeants Association, and the National Funeral \nDirectors Association. It also has strong bipartisan support and enjoys \nthe support of 21 of my Senate colleagues who cosponsored this \nlegislation. The cosponsors include Senators Bingaman, Byrd, Conrad, \nCraig, DeWine, Dorgan, Feingold, Johnson, Kennedy, Kerry, Kohl, Leahy, \nLevin, Lieberman, Lincoln, Miller, Santorum, Sessions, Stabenow, \nStevens, and Voinovich.\n  Section 402 of S. 1088 would authorize the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to furnish a grave marker for the grave of a deceased veteran, \nirrespective of whether the grave has already been marked privately by \nthe family. Current law--which dates back to the Civil War--does not \nallow the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide such a marker to \nalready-marked graves. This arcane provision of federal law effectively \nprecludes an estimated 25,000 families each year from appropriately \ncommemorating their loved one's service to our country. Sadly, this \nnumber will only increase as our nation's veteran population ages. \nIndeed, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, some 1,500 \nAmerican World War II veterans will pass away each day. With our aging \npopulation of veterans and with our nation's armed forces currently in \nharm's way in the war against terrorism, it is critically important to \nact promptly to secure this final tribute to suitably recognize the \nservice of past and future veterans.\n\n  This archaic law was originally intended to ensure that our fallen \nsoldiers were not buried in unmarked graves. Of course, in today's age \nrarely, if ever, does a grave go unmarked. Prior to 1990, the surviving \nfamily of a deceased veteran could receive from the VA, after burial or \ncremation, partial reimbursement for a private headstone, a VA \nheadstone, or a VA grave marker. The choice was solely up to the \ndeceased veteran's family. However, budgetary tightening measures \nenacted in 1990 eliminated the reimbursement component and prevented \nthe VA from providing an official headstone or grave marker when the \nfamily had already done so privately. This change in law precludes \nveterans' families from receiving an official VA grave marker if the \nfamily has already made private funeral arrangements.\n  Suffice it to say, this provision of law is a major source of \nfrustration for veterans families as they seek to honor their deceased \nloved one's service to our nation. At the time of a veteran's death, \ngrief stricken family members invariably concern themselves with making \nnecessary funeral arrangements and providing comfort and support to \nloved ones, not investigating the complexities of VA regulations. \nNonetheless, for veterans' families that make private funeral \narrangements prior to contacting the VA--such as purchasing a private \nheadstone or marker--these families unwittingly forfeit their right to \nreceive an official marker to honor their loved one's military service. \nThis inequity in current law is unfair to those veterans who have \nserved our country. Indeed, the denial of this benefit to veterans' \nfamilies is one of the major sources, if not the major source, of \ncomplaints lodged with the VA.\n  One of the countless families negatively effected by this provision \nof federal law is the Guzzo family of West Hartford, Connecticut. Back \nin the summer of 1998, I was approached by a young man named Tom Guzzo \nwhose father Agostino Guzzo had recently passed away. While Agostino's \nservice in the Army in the Philippines during World War II entitled him \nto full military honors from the VA, he was not eligible for an \nofficial VA marker because the family had already purchased a private \nmarker.\n  I became involved in this matter to correct what I believed to be a \nbureaucratic error, and I wrote to the then-Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to resolve this matter. However, when the Secretary informed me \nthat he was unable to furnish a VA grave marker to the Guzzos because \nof federal law, I introduced legislation to correct this inequity. Last \nyear, the VA headstone and grave markers legislation that I authored \nunanimously passed the Senate as an amendment to the FY 2001 Department \nof Defense Authorization bill. However, the House-passed version of the \nDepartment of Defense Authorization bill did not include a comparable \nVA grave marker provision, and regrettably this measure was stripped in \nconference committee. Last week, once again, the Senate passed a \nprovision based on legislation that I introduced in the Senate that \nwould authorize the Secretary of the VA to furnish grave markers to \ndeceased veterans, regardless of whether the grave is privately marked. \nAnd, once again, the House failed to adopt this reasonable provision, \nand this important measure was the subject of negotiations between the \nHouse and Senate to resolve this matter.\n  The legislation before us today allows grave markers for veterans who \npass away after the date of enactment. This is good news for veterans \ntoday. However, I continue to be concerned about the more than 5 \nmillion veterans who passed away over the past decade and whose \nfamilies have tried in vain to obtain an official commemoration from \nthe VA. My legislation was retroactive and would have assisted all \naffected veterans families back to 1990--when the aforementioned change \nin federal law occurred. As part of the compromise agreement between \nthe Senate, House, and the Administration, this legislation would allow \nfor the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to ``implement this provision in \na flexible manner in light of requests for grave markers pre-dating \nthis provision.'' While I am pleased that this compromise will allow \nfor the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to help the Guzzo family and may \nhelp other families who have struggled to receive official recognition \nfor their deceased loved one's service through administrative means, \nthis problem should have been addressed by a change in law--not through \nan ad-hoc, case-by-case, administrative procedure. Nonetheless, while \nthis is not by any means a perfect agreement, it will allow deceased \nveterans' families to obtain this official grave marker in the future.\n  I would like to take a moment to thank and recognize the tremendous \nleadership of Chairman Rockefeller with regard to this issue and to \nveterans issues in general. Chairman Rockefeller and his talented \nstaff, in particular, were extremely helpful in working with me to \nensure that the service of our Nation's veterans are suitably \nrecognized. I would also like to commend Congresswoman Nancy Johnson \nand her efforts to reach a workable compromise with respect to this \nissue. Finally, I would like to commend and recognize the hard work and \nvigilance of the Guzzo family, particularly Tom Guzzo, in ensuring that \nAgostino Guzzo's service to our Nation--and the military service of \ncountless other veterans--can from now on be recognized by the U.S. \nGovernment with this final, modest gesture from a grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13292-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13292-S13294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ABM TREATY WITHDRAWAL\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to take just a few moments today to \nplace President Bush's announcement that he is withdrawing the United \nStates from the 1972 ABM Treaty into a broader context, to try and \nredefine a debate\n\n[[Page S13293]]\n\nabout our security which too often has been argued at the margins.\n  The undergirding objective behind any American foreign policy should \nbe to make Americans safer, to make our position in the world more \nsecure, not less. That is the only objective measurement of foreign \npolicy, and it is by that measurement that I want to offer any \nconstruction concerns about today's announcement.\n  First, let me be clear: I support the development of an effective \ndefense against ballistic missiles that it deployed with maximum \ntransparency and consultation with U.S. allies and with other major \npowers, including Russia and China. I've voted as has the Senate, to \nsupport an approach which delivers that kind of security measure. In \nthe end, it boils down to common sense: If there is a real potential of \na rogue nation firing a few missiles at any city in the U.S., \nresponsible leadership requires that we make our best, most thoughtful \nefforts to defend against that threat. The same is true of accidental \nlaunch. If it ever happened, no leader could ever explain not having \nchosen to defend against the disaster when doing so made sense.\n  The broader question we must ask today is what constitutes not just \neffective defense against the ballistic missile threat, but whether in \nits entirety we are pursuing a national security strategy which makes \nus as safe as we can be against the whole range of threats we face as a \nnation, and what should have been clear before September 11 and what is \nevident with frightening clarity today is that there are urgent and \nimmediate vulnerabilities to our security which can and must be \naddressed, practically, pragmatically, today.\n  The President's announcement today reflects, I fear, misplaced \npriorities--an unyielding obsession almost with a threat which most \nmeasurements would suggest is of lesser likelihood, and an almost \ncavalier willingness to nickel and dime security priorities of the \nfirst order. I remain disappointed that the Bush Administration \ncontinues to focus so much on its attention on the issue of missile \ndefense and a missile defense plan which will be enormously expensive \nwhile at the same time they cite expense as a reason why they will not \ntoday make the investment towards meeting our tremendous homeland \nsecurity challenges.\n  Missile defense is important, but it is a response of last resort, \nwhen diplomacy and deterrence have failed. No missile defense system \ncan be 100 percent effective, and so we would be remiss to discard \nentirely the logic of deterrence that has kept us safe for 40 years. \nEven in periods of intense animosity and tension, under the most \nunpredictable and isolated of regimes, political and military \ndeterrence have a powerful, determining effect on a nation's decision \nto use force. We saw it at work in the Gulf War, when Saddam Hussein \nwas deterred from using his weapons of mass destruction by the sure \npromise of a devastating response from the United States. For 30 years, \nthe ABM Treaty has helped to anchor nuclear deterrence, and I believe \nthat people of the world have been safer for it. Yes, I would have \npreferred that the Bush administration continue to work with Russia to \nfind a way to amend, rather than end, the ABM Treaty. It appears that \nRussia was willing to allow the Bush administration great leeway in \npursing its robust testing plan for missile defense, but the President \nwas unwilling to accept any restrictions on his plans. Given their past \nstatements, it comes as no surprise that the Administration does not \nseem to have offered much to Russia by way of a compromise or an \nattempt to amend and preserve the Treaty. What the Administration has \ndone, and it is their prerogative to do so, is gamble successfully on \nthe fact that the Russian leadership would wisely determine not to \nallow this issue to derail the improvements we have seen in the last 3 \nmonths in the U.S.-Russian relationship. President Putin has called \nthis decision on the ABM Treaty a mistake and expressed his regret that \nPresident Bush intends to go forward with this, but Putin and others in \nhis administration have pledged that they will continue to work with us \non reducing strategic nuclear arsenals and building a new Russian \nrelationship with NATO. The response from Russia could have been much \ndifferent, much more dangerous and destabilizing, and I believe it \nwould have been, before the events of September 11 changed Russia's \nperception of the threats it faces and the importance of cooperating \nwith the United States. But I am gratified that the Russians remain \npartners in a global effort to increase security.\n\n  The situation with China is more murky. While the administration has \nbriefed the Chinese leadership on its missile defense plans, I don't \nbelieve enough time or diplomatic effort has been invested in \nconvincing Beijing that this system is not directed at eroding China's \nsmall nuclear deterrent. The Administration must do more to reach a \ncommon understanding with China that there is a real threat from \nisolated regimes bent on terrorism and accidental or unauthorized \nlaunches. If we fail to take this task seriously, we will jeopardize \nstability in the Pacific.\n  But, in my judgment, what is more striking about the President's \nannouncement today is the homeland security measures left unaddressed, \nand unfunded, in the Administration's security wish list.\n  In his statements about missile defense over the last several months, \nPresident Bush has said over and over that this is only one part of a \ncomprehensive national security strategy. I could not agree more, but I \nam deeply concerned that the President's words are not matched by the \ndeeds of his administration. Especially in the world after September \n11, a comprehensive national security strategy must emphasize the \nthings we need to do to keep the American people safe from terrorism. \nBut just last week, the President defeated attempts by Democrats in the \nSenate to provide additional funding for homeland security as part of \nthe Defense Department appropriations bills.\n  I am deeply concerned that, at a time when the Administration tells \nus that financial resources for defense are highly limited, we must be \nmore prudent about our spending priorities, we need a debate about \nchoices for our national security agenda.\n  Let's be clear about what every national security expert told us \nbefore September 11 and has amplified since. We need to fund our \nefforts to deliver airline and rail security, border security, the \nability of our fire fighters, police and emergency workers to respond \nto terrorist attacks, and the ability of our health care system to \nrespond to the threat we face from bio-terrorism. And we are at war. We \nneed to ensure that our fighting men and women have the tools and \nsupport they need to prosecute this war on terrorism successfully. \nFinding an effective defense against missile attacks is important, but \nthese challenges are immediate, critical, and regrettably they are \nbeing left unmet today.\n\n  Pushing forth first and foremost with national missile defense does \nnothing to address what the Pentagon, even before September 11, \nconsidered a much more likely and immediate threat to the American \nhomeland from terrorists and non-state actors, who might attack us with \nweapons of mass destruction. As we are learning more about Osama bin \nLadin's attempts to possibly acquire nuclear weapons and develop \nchemical or biological weapons, it is crucial that we stay focused on \nmeeting the WMD threat.\n  Our first defense against that threat is a robust international \neffort on non-proliferation. but the President's FY 2002 budget \nactually cut U.S. funding for counter-proliferation programs to deal \nwith the huge weapons stockpiles of the former Soviet Union. Our former \ncolleague, Senator Howard Baker, was part of a study of these counter-\nproliferation programs released earlier this year. That study concluded \nthat the threat of proliferation from the weapons stockpiles of the \nformer Soviet Union is very grave, and efforts to secure and destroy \nthose weapons demand our immediate, robust support. The study \nrecommended an increase of $30 million in funding for these programs, \nbut supporters of these programs on both sides of the aisle have \nstruggled mightily just to keep the funding from being slashed.\n  Consider also the homeland security needs so clearly being given \nshort shrift in an agenda dominated by national missile defense. Our \nsecurity needs are enormous, for certainly the\n\n[[Page S13294]]\n\nlast months have at least demonstrated where some of the \nvulnerabilities lie.\n  We must shore up not just the safety of our nuclear plants around the \ncountry, but plants and nuclear weapons facilities around the globe. \nFrom making nuclear facilities less vulnerable from the air, to \ninvesting in the trained personnel to ensure that cargo ships in \nAmerican ports are not carrying dangerous or stolen nuclear materials \nmeaningful steps can be taken to protect Americans against a threat \nwhich was real before September 11 and looms larger today.\n  The Administration can't speak about preparing to deal with \nbioterrorism, and in the next breath ignore that medicine must be \nstockpiled, that nurses and medical professionals must be trained, and \nthat massive investments in vaccines for diseases long believed to have \nbeen eradicated must be made at a rapid pace.\n  We can't honor firefighters, police and rescue workers who died in \nthe World Trade Center if we aren't willing to invest in the technology \nand innovation that make these jobs safer. There is little solace for \npostal workers killed by Anthrax if the government is not committed to \nputting in place innovative ways to detect and combat future biological \nand chemical threats.\n  Making our Nation's rail system safe will come with a high price tag, \nbut it's trivial compared to the devastation that could be wrought by a \nsingle terrorist attack on passenger rail. More than 300,000 people \npass through the century-old rail tunnels under New York City each day, \ntunnels lacking both ventilation and sufficient emergency exits. It is \ntime to shore up the security of our transportation infrastructure \nbefore they become targets, not when it is too late.\n  These are security needs of a nation at war and a nation bent on \nreturning to normalcy in the months and years ahead, and they must be \naddressed. I would say to you today, it's time we break out of a debate \nover whether we're going to have a missile defense system or rely \nentirely on deterrence, a fruitless debate, ideological shadow-boxing \nand end the days of arguing at the margins. We need a serious, \nthoughtful debate on the comprehensive steps required, in every issue \nof national security, to make our Nation as safe as it can be, and \nuntil we do that we are not offering the kind of leadership our \ncitizens and our country demands of us. And that is a debate of the \nfirst order of urgency, a debate too important to delay.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that the \nPresident has announced that the United States is withdrawing from the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The President is adamantly pursuing a \nunilateral approach at a time when we so clearly need international \ncooperation in the war against terrorism. We now know beyond dispute \nthat we cannot simply withdraw within our border, with a magical shield \nto protect us. All our gold-plated weapons systems could not prevent \nthe terrorist attack, and they can't hunt down every terrorist. Our \nnational security depends on international intelligence, international \nlaw enforcement, international financial transactions, international \naid, in short on our relations with other nations.\n  Yet for the first time since World War II we are walking away from a \nmajor treaty, dismaying our friends and inciting those who could become \nour enemies. While Russian President Putin has given a measured \nresponse, I fear our intransigence could endanger cooperation not only \non terrorism in Asia but also on further reductions in nuclear arms. \nAnd China, whose much smaller missile arsenal is most directly \nthreatened by our missile defense plans, will almost certainly build \nmore missiles, making the world less safe.\n  For our close allies, abandoning what we used to call the \n``cornerstone'' of arms control is just the latest in a series of \nprovocations. Last week we torpedoed negotiations on the Biological \nWeapons Convention, having earlier axed a verification protocol, at a \ntime when we face a biological weapon attack. Wouldn't a little \nverification of foreign labs that use anthrax be useful right now? We \nabandoned negotiations on the Kyoto global warming accord, gutted the \nsmall arms treaty, and walked away from the United Nations Conference \non Racism. We rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and dismissed \nthe convention on land mines. How can we expect full cooperation from \nother nations on terrorism, when we dismiss their concerns, refusing \neven to negotiate, on critical issues including biological weapons, \nnuclear arms control, and global warming?\n  Make no mistake, we have no technical need to withdraw from the ABM \ntreaty at this time. Most experts agree that research and testing could \ncontinue for years without violating the present treaty. And the \nRussians have offered to amend the treaty if needed. Unfortunately, \nthis administration refused to take yes for an answer. If we are to \nmaintain international cooperation in defeating the terrorists, and \nalso in protecting the global environment, ending child labor abuses \nand promoting human rights, and improving the global economy, we must \nourselves show some regard for international norms and concerns. \nFriendship is not a one-way street. I hope we wake up to that fact \nbefore it is too late.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13294-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13294-S13295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RESERVISTS PAY SECURITY ACT OF 2001\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I take great pride in supporting Senator \nDurbin in introducing the Reservists Pay Security Act of 2001. This \nlegislation will ensure that the Federal employees who are in the \nmilitary reserves and are called up for active duty in service to their \ncountry will get the same pay as they do in their civilian jobs.\n  According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, the federal \ngovernment is by far the largest employer of our nation's military \nreservists. These reservists stand ready to serve our country with \nhonor, during times of peace as well as war. They are the finest \nexamples of dedication and service our nation has to offer.\n  When federal employees who also serve as reservists are called to \nduty, they respond with pride, often facing significant pay cuts as \nthey lose their normal civilian salaries. But the federal government \ndoes not supplement the lost pay of our reservists. This is a travesty.\n  Our Nation has always placed a high value on the spirit of public \nservice. That's why so many private employers, both large and small, \nare making significant changes to provide more generous military leave \npolicies, even in the midst of a recession. If Safeway, IBM, Intel and \nVerizon can provide for their employees during times like these, then \nour federal government must care for its own as well.\n  Family members of federally-employed reservists are already starting \nto feel the pinch of service. Amy Bennett, of Centreville, MD, can't \nafford the payments that she and her husband, a lieutenant in the Army \nReserve, must pay for their home. Their family income will drop by \n$50,000 per year. To respond to this, she was at first going to sell \nher car. Now, with an 8-month-old son to care for, she must move in \nwith her parents until her husband returns. She'll keep the car, but \neven worse, she may be forced to sell their home.\n  Janice Riley, of St. Mary's County, will work two jobs now that her \nhusband, Sgt. Rob Riley, has been sent to Texas for training. Until he \nreturns, he is forced to ask his mother to help Janice out with the \nbills. Lynn Brinker, of Columbia, MD, expects her family to lose about \n$30,000 this year because her husband, Mark, was sent to Texas to join \nthe rest of his 443rd Military Police Battalion. As a result, her \nneighbors are buying her meals, her babysitter and hairdresser are \nworking for free, and she has taken a line of credit against her house \nbecause no one can take over the home improvement business Mark began \n10 years ago.\n  Fifty-five thousand of our Nation's reservists have been activated \nsince the attacks of September 11th. This includes about 3,000 Maryland \narea reservists, most of them federal employees. Their families sit and \nwait at home, with no guarantee when their loved ones will return, and \nlittle means to pay for their college funds, mortgages, car loans, and \nholiday gifts.\n  This is simply wrong. I fail to see why these dedicated Americans \nshould be forced to leave their families financially vulnerable at a \ntime when they have so many other things to worry about.\n\n[[Page S13295]]\n\n  This legislation is the same as the measure my colleague, Robert \nWexler of Florida, introduced in the House of Representatives this \nspring. But this is not the first time I've fought for the rights of \nour nation's reservists, or our nation's federal employees. In 1991, \nwhen so many of our brave reservists answered the call to fight for our \ncountry in the Persian Gulf, I sponsored similar legislation. During \nthe Gulf War, Senator Durbin, the other sponsor of this bill, who was \nthen serving in House, introduced the exact same legislation.\n  Before and since then, I have been a part of many other efforts to \nmake sure that those who work on behalf our country, both here and \nabroad, are not penalized simply for their service to our country. This \nlegislation will help relieve the financial hardship being felt by so \nmany of our dedicated citizens. It will allow those who stand ready to \nserve our country not to have to worry about how the bills at home will \nbe paid while they fight to protect the way of life so many Americans \nenjoy.\n  We all hope that federally-employed military reservists achieve \nsuccess in their military duty, and return safely to comfort at home. \nBut our efforts abroad should not compromise the living standards of \nthem or their families, and our efforts to relieve their plight cannot \nwait.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for our \nactive duty citizens, the federal employees who serve our nation in \npeace and, as reservists, in war, by supporting this very important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13295-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HOLD TO S. 1805\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to inform my colleagues \nthat I have lodged an objection to the Senate proceeding to S. 1805 or \nto any other legislation or amendment that converts temporary \njudgeships to permanent judgeships.\n  When there is a temporary judgeship on a court, when the temporary \njudgeship expires, the next permanent vacancy that occurs will not be \nfilled and will be deemed not to be a vacancy, so that the total number \nof permanent judgeships allowed by law stays the same. On the other \nhand, the net effect of converting a temporary judgeship into a \npermanent judgeship is the creation of a new permanent judgeship for \nthat court. The creation of new judgeships should not be taken lightly.\n  As you know, I firmly believe that the Federal judiciary should not \nbe expanded prior to comprehensive congressional oversight. Congress \nhas not held a single hearing in this Congress on whether additional \njudges are necessary for the Federal courts, and specifically has not \nevaluated whether there is a need to convert the temporary judgeships \ncontained in S. 1805 into permanent judgeships. Arguments that the \nJudicial Conference has recommended these changes should be scrutinized \nwith care, the formula that the Judicial Conference utilizes to create \njudgeships is flawed and can be substantially manipulated. There needs \nto be serious congressional oversight of the numbers, which is our \nresponsibility. We need to ensure that the courts are employing all \nappropriate methods to take care of their caseloads and to make sure \nthat they are utilizing all efficiencies and techniques. Moreover, we \nshould be looking at filling appropriate existing judicial vacancies \nbefore we create new judgeships.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13295-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13295-S13296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VA COMMENDED FOR PATIENT SAFETY INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am proud to highlight the \nrecognition given to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the high \nlevel of attention they have paid to patient safety in recent years.\n  The Institute for Government Innovation at Harvard University has \nannounced that VA's National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) will be \none of five winners of the annual Innovations in American Government \nawards. An article in yesterday's Washington Post brings this \nachievement to national attention and details why VA's Center was the \nonly federal recipient of the award.\n  It's apparent that the NCPS has cultivated a culture within VA that \npromotes communication and therefore enables health care staff to feel \nmore comfortable about reporting medical errors or even concerns that \nthey have about patient safety. VA launched this initiative in 1998, \nbut it received a major push in 1999 when the Institute of Medicine \nreleased a report estimating that 44,000 to 98,000 Americans die each \nyear due to medical mistakes.\n  This award demonstrates how VA has pioneered the establishment of the \ntype of culture which must exist. According to the article, many health \ncare providers in the private sector have started to model their \npatient safety models around that of the NCPS. This was a driving force \nbehind the Institute for Government Innovation's decision to recognize \nVA's efforts by giving them this honor.\n  For a long time now, I have pushed VA to pay closer attention to \npatient safety, as it has been an issue of concern in the past. This is \nwhy I am glad to finally see VA on the cutting edge of patient safety, \nand being acknowledged for it. Our veterans deserve nothing less than \nhighest standards of health care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from The Washington Post, \ndetailing VA's patient safety program and the award, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Dec. 13, 2001]\n\n           VA Medical System To Get Harvard Innovation Award\n\n\n         Reporting, Handling of Health Care Errors To Be Cited\n\n                             (By Ben White)\n\n       The Department of Veterans Affairs health care system, long \n     derided as a bloated bureaucratic mess, will be singled out \n     for praise today for its efforts to improve the way medical \n     errors and close calls are reported by health care workers \n     and handled by hospital administrators.\n       VA's National Center for Patient Safety (NCPS) will be the \n     only federal program among five winners of the annual \n     Innovations in American Government awards from the Institute \n     for Government Innovation at Harvard University. The awards \n     are to be announced today.\n       Gail Christopher, executive director of the institute, said \n     the NCPS is helping foster a ``healthier culture of \n     communication'' in which health care workers at VA's 173 \n     medical centers are far more likely to report mistakes or \n     close calls than in years past.\n       ``It's sort of a breath of fresh air for workers who are \n     used to being in an adversarial or litigious climate,'' \n     Christopher said. ``It meets a basic set of human needs, to \n     strive for excellence while at the same time acknowledging \n     the potential for human error. Its genius is really its \n     simplicity.''\n       VA officials say the program, begun in 1998, produced a 30-\n     fold increase in the number of accident reports in just 16 \n     months and a 900-fold increase in the number of reported \n     close calls over the same period. These numbers reflect not \n     an increase in mistakes, they say, but rather a big jump in \n     the willingness of doctors, nurses and other workers to \n     report problems.\n       The agency began to focus on the issue after a 1999 report \n     by the Institute of Medicine estimated that 44,000 to 98,000 \n     Americans die each year as a result of medical errors.\n       VA Secretary Anthony J. Principi said NCPS has created a \n     centralized mistake-reporting system that helps staff analyze \n     and address repeat problems while also establishing a new \n     culture in which the emphasis is on addressing the root \n     causes of errors rather than punishing those who make them.\n       ``We look at entire systems now, not just, say, a nurse who \n     [makes a mistake] because she is pressed for time,'' Principi \n     said in an interview yesterday. He noted, however, that VA \n     will still punish anyone who ``intentionally and criminally \n     hurts a patient.''\n       In addition to the improved, confidential mistake-reporting \n     system, NCPS has set up a voluntary external system, modeled \n     after a NASA program, that allows any individual to report \n     medical mistakes or close calls anonymously.\n       NCPS Director James P. Bagian said the anonymous system \n     serves as a safety valve to make sure serious problems that \n     VA health workers might feel uncomfortable reporting, even \n     confidentially, do not slip unnoticed.\n       Bagian cited a flawed pacemaker and a potentially deadly \n     ventilator as examples of problems the NCPS regime has helped \n     identify and correct. But he said the biggest success has \n     been the change in culture. VA health care workers now know \n     they will be identified publicly and punished only if they \n     deliberately cause harm to a patient, according to Bagian. If \n     a worker simply makes a mistake, he can report it \n     confidentially and a team will assess the case, addressing \n     the cause of the error rather than the individual \n     responsible.\n       ``We no longer focus on whose fault it is,'' Bagian said, \n     noting that the handbook explaining the new approach is \n     written in plain\n\n[[Page S13296]]\n\n     English, rather than in the legalese of the past. ``Instead \n     we ask: What happened? How did it happen? And what can we do \n     to prevent it in the future?''\n       The award carries a $100,000 grant to help VA further the \n     program and let others know about it. Harvard's Christopher \n     said VA earned the award in part because so many private \n     health care and hospital companies are already seeking to \n     emulate NCPS.\n       ``Clearly, the problem this program addresses is of \n     monumental significance,'' she said. ``and word has spread \n     rapidly within the health care community.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13296-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to highlight two provisions \nin the Defense appropriations bill we passed last Friday night that are \nof great importance to Iowans. I have spoken here before of the \ncontinued health and environmental legacy of the nuclear weapons work \nat the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, of conventional munitions work at \nthe same plant, and of the secrecy issues that make it difficult to \nhelp the workers there. In the last couple years the Department of \nEnergy has made real, if slow, progress toward addressing these issues. \nTwo provisions in this year's Defense appropriations bill promise \nsimilar progress in addressing concerns of workers on the Army side of \nthe plant.\n  Last year an amendment I offered to the Defense authorization bill \nrequired the Pentagon to review its secrecy policies to ensure that \nthey do not harm workers at defense nuclear facilities, to notify \nworkers who may have been harmed by radioactive or toxic exposures at \nthese plants of these exposures and of how they can discuss them with \nhealth care providers and other officials, and to report back to \nCongress. But six months after the bill passed the Secretary had not \neven designated an official to carry out the provision. There still has \nbeen no notification and no report to Congress.\n  My amendment to the Defense appropriations bill this year clarifies \nthat provision by explicitly including employees of contractors and \nsubcontractors of the Defense Department, a colloquy last year between \nSenators Levin and Warner and myself had clarified this intent, and by \nlimiting its scope to facilities that manufacture, assemble, and \ndisassemble nuclear weapons. The amendment also applies similar \nprovisions to the Army side of the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant. It \nrequires the Department to determine the nature and extent of exposures \nof current and former workers there to radioactive and other hazardous \nsubstances. It requires the Department to notify the workers of such \nexposures and of how they can discuss them with health providers, \ncleanup officials, and others. These actions are to be taken, and the \nSecretary is to report back to Congress, within 90 days of passage of \nthe Act. I am pleased that the Defense Department has supported this \namendment, and I hope that this time the workers in Iowa will quickly \nreceive the support they need.\n  Another provision in the bill provides $1 million for a health study \nfor workers on the Army side of the plant. The University of Iowa is in \nthe second year of a study funded by the Department of Energy of the \nhealth effects of exposures on workers at the nuclear weapons facility. \nThe new funds will begin a similar look at the health of workers on the \nArmy side of the plant, who were exposed to many of the same \nradioactive and toxic substances. The work is to be done in conjunction \nwith the Department of Energy study. I believe that these two \nprovisions will help the workers on the Army side of the plant to \naddress the same questions that workers at the nuclear facility in Iowa \nand around the country have faced: what dangers have they encountered \nwhile serving our country, have they been harmed, and how can they get \nhelp?\n  I would like to thank the managers of the bill for their assistance \nin including these provisions, in passing another amendment I offered \non the Iowa National Guard's CIVIC project, and in addressing other \nconcerns of the people of Iowa in this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13296-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13296-S13297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FORMER VICE PRESIDENT WALTER F. MONDALE'S REMARKS AT WESTMINSTER \n                          PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, one of \nMinnesota's greatest Senators and statesmen, recently spoke in \nMinneapolis at Westminster Presbyterian Church, of which I am a member. \nI found his insights into our country's present situation and our \ncurrent deliberations to be most valuable. I ask unanimous consent to \nprint the former Vice President's speech in the Record for the benefit \nof all my colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Westminster Presbyterian Church Forum Speech by Walter Mondale\n\n       Thanks, Pastor Hart-Anderson for that kind introduction and \n     thanks for your gifted leadership of this wonderful \n     congregation. Joan and I are glad to be members of \n     Westminster.\n       I love this magnificent and historic sanctuary where we \n     meet today. It was 1897--104 years ago--when Westminster \n     congregants first gathered here.\n       Some of the men who came to worship here in those first \n     days may well have been veterans of the Civil War; some may \n     have fought at Gettysburg. Seventeen years after that first \n     service, the first boat passed through the new Panama Canal \n     and World War I broke out in Europe. And can you imagine how \n     parishioners must have felt as they worshipped here that grim \n     Sunday morning of December 7th, 1941?\n       Westminster has also lived through profound changes in our \n     Minneapolis community. From its beginning at the center of \n     the Presbyterian community living nearby, the church has \n     lived through the hollowing-out of Minneapolis's central \n     city, then, thankfully, its revitalization into a bustling \n     and diverse downtown neighborhood.\n       Today, Westminster is on its feet, growing, adapting, \n     serving its faith in a community that the congregation's \n     first members could not have imagined. For more than a \n     century, we have seen it all.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       A foreign correspondent recently wrote that what struck him \n     the most about America was that we all seemed to have a sense \n     of ownership in our country. He's right--we do own our \n     country.\n       That's why we all came together, in an instant, on \n     September 11.\n       That unity is no coincidence * * * it flows from our \n     American ideals of justice, openness and freedom. That unity \n     is by choice, not by chance. Almost every American \n     generation, when pressed by crisis, has had to renew that \n     choice and defend our ideals--not only abroad, but here at \n     home.\n       Abolitionists argued that slavery was immoral, and soldiers \n     fought a war to end it . . . the suffragists struggled for \n     women's right to vote . . . the civil rights movements \n     persuaded us that all Americans must be free from \n     discrimination . . . the women's movement profoundly enhanced \n     opportunities for American women . . . and, at our best, we \n     have reached out to make American life more open and \n     accepting to everyone.\n       Roosevelt once said that America's great goal has been ``to \n     include the excluded.'' I believe that's what we have done.\n       I was a part of the civil rights struggle and served in the \n     Senate when many of the key civil rights law were passed. I \n     worked under a president who was the first southerner elected \n     to the office in 120 years . . . elected, in part, because a \n     southerner could finally champion civil rights and bring our \n     Nation closer together.\n       It all came together for more at the 1984 Los Angeles \n     Olympics. Civil rights laws had knocked down the barriers to \n     black and Hispanic participation in sports. And we had \n     recently passed title nine, over huge objections, which \n     required schools receiving public money to provide equal \n     athletic opportunities for young women.\n       When I watched American athletes of all colors, men and \n     women, winning one gold medal after another and astounding \n     the world, I saw our Nation's long march toward openness and \n     justice being justified right before our eyes. America was \n     the best because we had tapped all of our talent.\n       The wonderful American historian, Stephen Ambrose, spoke in \n     Minneapolis the other day about the long-term prospects for \n     America versus Bin Laden and his fellow extremists.\n       America has a great advantage, Ambrose said. In today's \n     world the trained mind is the most valuable of all assets. In \n     America, we tap all of our talent, while the Taliban and \n     other medievalists shut it off--by closing the door to women, \n     by requiring you men to spend all of their time repeating \n     extremists doctrines by rote, and by suppressing science and \n     debate.\n       By wasting their good minds, they will fail, Ambrose said.\n       Just as we saw America prevail at the '84 Olympics by \n     tapping all our talent, we will see our openness and freedom \n     give us the edge in this newer, grimmer challenge.\n       And we have another advantage.\n       Roger Cohen, a senior New York times European \n     correspondent, recently wrote that ``Hitler promised the \n     1,000 year Reich; Communism promised equality; Milosovich \n     promised glory. All the West Offers is the rule of law, but \n     that's enough.\n       Under our constitution, the rule of law has meant that our \n     public officers must be accountable to the law: this idea \n     runs throughout our system.\n\n[[Page S13297]]\n\n       The House and the Senate account to each other; the \n     Congress to the President, the President to the Congress, \n     both to the courts, and to the American people; a prosecutor \n     to the judge (appointed for life) and jury and all of it \n     subject to appeal. It is one of the great paradoxes of that \n     document: on the one hand, the constitution reveals our \n     founders' abiding faith in democracy--in the people, while on \n     the other hand, the framers were very suspicious of human \n     nature when clothed with unaccountable power. This principle \n     is not a detail; it is crucial to America's phenomenal \n     success.\n       Our founders made this very clear in the remarkable \n     federalist papers. In them, Madison, and Hamilton famously \n     observed: ``What is government itself, but the greatest of \n     all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no \n     government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, \n     neither external nor internal controls on government would be \n     necessary, but in framing a government which is to be \n     administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in \n     this: you must first enable the government to control the \n     governed; and in the next lace oblige it to control itself . \n     . . . . a dependence on the people, is no doubt, the primary \n     control on government; but experience has taught mankind the \n     necessity of auxiliary precautions.''\n       Maintaining the rule of law takes a lot of nerve. And over \n     our history we have occasionally lost it during moments of \n     great threat.\n       In 1798, Congress passed the notorious alien and sedition \n     acts. David McCullough in his marvelous new history of John \n     Adams, wrote that President Adams' signatures on the those \n     bills were ``the most reprehensive acts of his presidency.'' \n     During the Civil War, President Lincoln abolished the writ of \n     habeas corpus. In World War I, Minnesota established the \n     shameful public safety commission, which held public hearings \n     all over the state to test the loyalty of German-American \n     Minnesotans and remove the doubtful from office. At the \n     beginning of World War II, Federal officials arrested \n     thousands of Japanese-Americans and herded them into \n     ``relocation'' camps without any credible evidence of \n     disloyalty. during the worst of the Cold War, Joe McCarthy \n     panicked our Nation and during the turbulent days of the \n     civil rights struggle, F.B.I. Directors, Hoover, decided that \n     Martin Luther King was a dangerous man who needed to be \n     hounded daily and destroyed as a public leader--even though \n     King's message of nonviolence may have saved our Nation.\n       In all of these cases, after we had regained our \n     confidence, we could see that we had allowed our fear to get \n     the better of us, and that we had hurt innocent people, \n     compromised our ideals and shamed ourselves.\n       Today we again have much to fear.\n       These are tough times and they require decisive action. We \n     must find and punish our attackers, and make clear that \n     aggression against our country will not be tolerated. We must \n     also try to prevent future terrorism, by learning much more \n     about the threats around and among us. We must give our \n     intelligence and law enforcement agencies the resources and \n     authority they need to do these difficult jobs.\n       But we can be vigilant and deceive without giving in to \n     fear. We can do everything we need to do to protect ourselves \n     within our constitution, and we will be stronger if we do so. \n     For history has taught us over and over again that the rule \n     of law, openness and tolerance will prevail over injustice, \n     oppression and hate.\n       It is our great advantage.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13297-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13297-S13299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       HONORING ROBERT STILLER AND GREEN MOUNTAIN COFFEE ROASTERS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Robert \nStiller, Founder and Chief of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, who has \nbeen awarded the ``Entrepreneur of the Year Award'' by Forbes Magazine.\n  Before establishing success on the national level, Bob owned several \nretail coffee stores in Vermont and Maine. Unable to afford \nadvertising, he gave away free samples at wine and food festivals and \nto organizations like the Cub Scouts and Ronald McDonald House. Always \nin search of new customers, Bob began selling his coffee to high-end \nrestaurants and to gas stations with a goal of serving the same high-\nquality of coffee at both. That strategy and innovation contributed to \nhis company's growing success.\n  Stiller's success stems from his willingness to take risks within the \nbusiness world and his knowledge of modern technological advantages. By \ninvesting in innovative packaging tools that extended the shelf-life of \ntheir coffee, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters has made significant \nbreakthroughs in modern brewing. They pioneered efforts to do what few \ncoffee vendors have been able to master: keeping convenience store \ncoffee fresh.\n  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters ranks 16th on the ``Forbes 200 Best \nSmall Companies'' list, and sales have continued to grow an average of \n24 percent over the last five years. New roasters they recently \npurchased will allow them to package and sell over 40 million pounds of \ncoffee a year, available at convenience stores, gas stations, \nsupermarkets, offices, and restaurants nationwide. And their stock has \nmore than doubled in the past 12 months, outperforming competitors like \nStarbucks, and Peet's Coffee & Tea.\n  Again, I congratulate Bob Stiller and all his employees at Green \nMountain Coffee Roasters for receipt of the Forbes award. I ask that \nthe Forbes Magazine article, ``Entrepreneur Of The Year: Java Man,'' \nand a Rutland Daily Herald article, ``Coffee Company, Founder Grab The \nSpotlight,'' be made a part of the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                 [From Forbes Magazine, Oct. 29, 2001]\n\n                   Entrepreneur of the Year: Java Man\n\n                            (By Luisa Kroll)\n\n       Bob Stiller's long-shot bets have turned Green Mountain \n     Coffee Roasters into one of the smartest small companies in \n     America.\n       Don't let his look of blissful relaxation fool you. Robert \n     Stiller's head is constantly boiling with new ideas, many of \n     them at odds with those of almost everyone around him. Some \n     of the ideas lose money. Every now and then one makes a \n     bundle.\n       Stiller's first big hit was selling rolling paper on the \n     drug-sodden campus of Columbia University in the early 1970s. \n     His brand, E-Z Wider (a little jab at the cult film), had \n     double the width of competing brands. The paper wouldn't feed \n     into the machine properly, causing tearing. It was \n     scientifically processed; Stiller discovered that storing a \n     bobbin of paper for three weeks in a humidified room \n     prevented the raw material from ripping. ``People expected to \n     see potheads, but we were more efficient at paper conversion \n     than any manufacturer at the time,'' he recalls. E-Z stoked \n     its sales to $11 million before Stiller and a partner sold \n     out in 1980, each pocketing $3.1 million.\n       Twenty years later he still has a knack for \n     experimentation--in the humble business of selling coffee \n     beans. Founder and chief executive of Green Mountain Coffee \n     Roasters (nasdaq: GMCR--news--people), 58-year-old Stiller is \n     constantly trying out new technologies, backing other \n     entrepreneurs with untested ideas and taking risks with \n     suppliers that, on the face of it, appear slightly crazy. \n     ``Bob has that sense of not what is, but what could be,'' \n     says Nick G. Lazaris, chief executive of Keurig, which makes \n     coffee-brewing machines and is a partner of Green Mountain.\n       The road less traveled is strewn with riches. Green \n     Mountain ranks 16th on the Forbes 200 Best Small Companies \n     ranking, its second year on the list. Sales have grown an \n     average 24% over the last five years to $84 million for the \n     year ended Sept. 30, 2000; earnings per share have been \n     growing at 43%. In the quarter ended July 7, net income rose \n     67%. Its stock has more than doubled in the past 12 months, \n     outperforming those of both Starbucks and a closer rival, \n     Peet's Coffee & Tea. Stiller's 48.5% stake is worth $89 \n     million.\n       Green Mountain has put down deep roots near its \n     headquarters in bucolic Waterbury, Vt. Three of every 10 \n     pounds of roasted beans are sold in Maine, New Hampshire and \n     Vermont. But this is a national company, deriving 95% of its \n     revenue from 6,700 wholesale customers that include \n     convenience stores, gas stations, supermarkets, offices and \n     restaurants.\n       Lesson: Don't forsake marketing. if you cant afford it, try \n     giving away your product.\n       A born tinkerer, Stiller spent weekends and holidays during \n     his youth toiling at Stillman Manufacturing, his dad's Bronx, \n     N.Y. company that made one of the first tubular heating coils \n     for electric stoves. While still in high school, Stiller \n     designed one machine that handled milling, cleaning and \n     threading of a heating element. College was a chore; he \n     couldn't maintain a C average--or what the college called a \n     proper attitude--to remain at Syracuse University and ended \n     up with a degree in business from Parsons College in \n     Fairfield, Iowa in 1967. He landed at Columbia as a data-\n     processing manager.\n       After cashing out of the rolling paper business, Stiller \n     found himself at his ski condo in Sugarbush, Vt. wondering \n     what to do next. One night, as he enjoyed a rare cup of \n     coffee at a restaurant, he woke up and smelled the \n     opportunity. A couple of days later he visited the small \n     roaster in Waitsfield, Vt., where the restaurant bought its \n     beans. For the next few months he roasted his own beans, \n     using a hot-air popcorn popper at one point, a cookie sheet \n     at another, brewing batches of coffee for friends. Stiller \n     ended up buying the Waitsfield store with a partner and \n     giving the store owner an equal one-third stake in Green \n     Mountain. Within two years he became the sole proprietor, \n     buying out both partners for $100,000.\n       The business seemed doomed from the start. Holed up in an \n     office over a movie theater, Stiller lent the company $1 \n     million, but still had to pay salaries with credit cards. His \n     $30,000 line of credit was snatched from him after he went to \n     the main branch of the bank in search of more money. What \n     loan officer dared believe in this venture? This was\n\n[[Page S13298]]\n\n     a decade before Starbucks reached the East Coast, and a \n     cup of joe was just something to wash down the morning \n     eggs and toast. Stiller added retail stores in Vermont and \n     Maine, and insisted on roasting only arabica beans, grown \n     at higher altitudes and pricier than the robusta variety. \n     Unable to afford advertising, he gave away samples at wine \n     and food festivals and to organizations like the Cub \n     Scouts and Ronald McDonald House. The red ink flowed, $1.4 \n     million cumulatively from 1981 to 1985.\n       Always on the prowl for new customers, Stiller began \n     selling to high-end restaurants and specialty stores. He \n     bought a personal computer and hired a programmer to write \n     software that traced customers' orders, deliveries and \n     payments. Ever since, he has invested heavily in technology, \n     becoming one of the first customers of Praxis, which \n     developed a program to monitor and adjust heat levels in the \n     roasters appropriate to each bag of beans. ``Some say there \n     is an art to great coffee,'' says Stiller. ``I don't care how \n     artistic you are, there are too many factors in play. You \n     need the technology.''\n       Which is why the fellow with the tube-bending machine and \n     the rolling-paper process has installed $2.5 million worth of \n     software from PeopleSoft to track distribution, \n     manufacturing, sales and personnel. At the time this software \n     project got under way Green Mountain had only $33 million in \n     sales and was PeopleSoft's smallest customer for the product. \n     ``Green Mountain,'' says Michael Frandsen, PeopleSoft's \n     general manager of supply chain management, ``is one of the \n     most aggressive small companies I've come across.''\n       As when Stiller ignored the grumbling of some board members \n     over selling his premium coffee to grungy gas stations. He \n     thought it was a good way to spread the brand; the trick was \n     to make sure the coffee at ExxonMobil was brewed as carefully \n     as it was at New York's Harvard Club. So along with its \n     beans, Green Mountain bundled services and tools, including \n     coffee machines, cups, banners and training. Stiller created \n     one- and two-day courses for customers with instruction about \n     coffee farming, grinding and filtering. Now ExxonMobil is its \n     biggest customer, representing 17% of sales last year. Last \n     November Green Mountain signed a five-year agreement, beating \n     out 11 rivals, to supply all 1,100 ExxonMobil company-owned \n     stores and 500 franchise locations.\n       Another long-shot bet: backing three unknown entrepreneurs \n     peddling a single-serve coffee system. At the time, they held \n     the patent on filter-wrapped individual portions of ground \n     coffee, but had no product ready for market. Stiller invested \n     $150,000 for a 1% stake in Keurig. Green Mountain patiently \n     worked with them on product quality and flavor. Finally, in \n     1998, the Keurig machine rolled into offices like \n     PricewaterhouseCoopers. Green Mountain, which produces K-Cup \n     individual packages of coffee at its factory, pays Keurig an \n     undisclosed royalty based on the number of packages it sells. \n     Last year K-Cups contributed 15.7% of Green Mountain's \n     revenues.\n\n\n                              DAILY GRIND\n\n       A grower of fancy coffee gets maybe a dollar a pound.

Source: Forbes estimates, using Green \n     Mountain's FY 2000 financials.\n       Leaning forward so often, Stiller has occasionally fallen \n     off his perch. Anxious to expand, he took the company public \n     in 1993, but couldn't meet Nasdaq listing guidelines and \n     traded for four years on Nasdaq's minor league system (called \n     the Nasdaq SmallCap Market). With the $11.5 million raised, \n     he invested in mail-order catalogs, opened five retail stores \n     and hired a bunch of seasoned outsiders. He also spent \n     $500,000 on packaging equipment that flushes out the oxygen \n     with puffs of nitrogen to improve shelf life.\n       Stiller wanted to invest now in anticipation of future \n     growth. Such improvements had a cost. The company lost a \n     combined $4.7 million in fiscal 1993 and 1994. For ten months \n     Stiller stopped matching contributions to the 401(k) program, \n     and imposed a hiring freeze. The bigger growth lay with the \n     wholesale business. Green Mountain shuttered its 12 stores in \n     1998, at a cost of $1.3 million.\n       Lesson: Don't be afraid to increase capacity for a level of \n     business that doesn't yet exist.\n       Vermont being Vermont, it goes without saying that Green \n     Mountain strives for a do-gooder image, giving away 5% of \n     pretax profits to ``socially responsible'' causes. ``I'm not \n     doing it because I want to give money away to charities,'' he \n     confesses. ``What we're doing makes the most business \n     sense.''\n       Example: providing startup funding for 100 small-scale \n     farmers who formed a cooperative in Sumatra, Indonesia. Since \n     then, production has increased almost sixfold--18% of its \n     arabica going to Green Mountain. Stiller was one of the early \n     backers of ``fair trade'' coffee, which pays farmers what \n     they need to break even and clear a small profit. All this \n     draws customers like Columbia University and natural food \n     stores.\n       Stiller has gradually backed away from the day-to-day \n     business, acting more as teacher than taskmaster. He \n     meditates 45 minutes every day and, despite enduring the \n     occasional pair of rolling eyes, nudges his staff to study \n     ``appreciative inquiry,'' a management technique developed at \n     Case Western Reserve University that encourages people to \n     learn from their successes--what produced a great batch of \n     roasted beans, for instance, or the last deal that closed--\n     instead of their mistakes.\n       Is this still a growth company? Probably not the one it \n     used to be. The Delta Shuttle will be buying less, and \n     Starbucks, with help from Kraft, is muscling into the \n     grocery-store channel. Stiller predicts sales growth will be \n     15% to 20% next year, below its five-year average. But he's \n     still a risk-taker. He is spending $2 million for a couple of \n     roasters, which will boost capacity from 15 million pounds to \n     40 million pounds a year. It will be a long time before \n     demand catches up. But Stiller is sure that day will come.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Rutland Herald, Nov. 5, 2001]\n\n               Coffee Company, Founder Grab the Spotlight\n\n                           [By Bruce Edwards]\n\n       An interview with Robert Stiller, the founder and president \n     of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters in Waterbury. Stiller was \n     recently named Forbes' magazine first ``Entrepreneur of the \n     Year.'' The magazine also ranked the company as one of the \n     ``200 Best Small Companies in America.''\n       Question: When you started Green Mountain Coffee Roasters \n     in 1981, did you have a vision for the company. And are you \n     surprised at the success you've achieved?\n       Robert Stiller: I didn't envision the success the way it \n     has come about. I felt we may have been further along in \n     getting the coffee out there because I always felt there \n     isn't great coffee out there. When people get used to \n     drinking great coffee, they just don't go back to the \n     commercial grades. So, I knew that was going to work. I \n     really didn't envision the awards. I really didn't feel we \n     would be as strong as we were with the social type of issues \n     like the organic and the fair trade coffees.\n       Q: When you think of Vermont you think of maple syrup. \n     Coffee, on the other hand, is hardly indigenous to the state. \n     Where did you come up with the idea for a coffee company?\n       Stiller: Actually, a friend had started a small shop at the \n     end of 1979 with a couple that had come up from Connecticut. \n     Their brother had been in the coffee business and they opened \n     a small shop here in Vermont. I got to know them and I wanted \n     to expand that concept. I really wasn't much of a coffee \n     drinker at the time. When I had great coffee, it was like \n     this is terrific and we wanted to carry that concept further.\n       Q: What kind of competition do you face? There are \n     obviously a lot of coffees out there and your coffee is a \n     premium brand.\n       Stiller: We provide a better product that people are \n     willing to pay more for. Sometimes they'll use less of our \n     coffee than the commercial coffees and get a more satisfying \n     cup of coffee. There are ways to get around the economics of \n     it. People will also find it a little bit finer than some of \n     the commercial grades and get better extraction in the \n     brewing process. We compete by offering better solutions to \n     customers, like a supermarket, to sell the product. We \n     merchandise the coffee better. We work with the staff to \n     educate them and support the product. A lot of the commercial \n     companies don't want to get into (that). They just want to \n     put it on the shelf and have it sell. We differentiate \n     ourselves by offering the higher levels of service that in \n     turn provide a value to the consumer.\n       Q: Where do you buy most of your coffee beans?\n       Stiller: Central and South America. Also Mexico. We have \n     other coffees that come from Africa and Indonesia.\n       Q: What makes the quality of your coffee beans different?\n       Stiller: It would be the taste profile of that particular \n     coffee being representative of the area that it comes from. \n     You want the taste to sort of epitomize where that coffee \n     comes from. And we are very selective in getting the taste of \n     that coffee as good as it can be. You also look at the \n     highest-grade coffees. Each of the countries has a grading \n     system. And we would also select the highest grades \n     available. A lot of companies are just interested in the cost \n     aspect and don't look for the taste profile.\n       Q: How much coffee do you import each year and is it all \n     processed in Waterbury?\n       Stiller: We're about 12 to 13 million pounds of green \n     coffee a year. We roast all the coffee here and package it \n     and ship from here.\n       Q: What's the size of the Vermont operation?\n       Stiller: In the Waterbury area, we employ about 300 people. \n     There's a little over 500 in the organization. We have a \n     90,000-square-foot production, roasting, warehousing \n     facility. We just purchased a couple of roasters that will \n     substantially increase our roasting capacity. With the new \n     roasters we'll be able to roast over 40 million pounds a \n     year.\n       Q: Much of your business is wholesale as opposed to retail?\n       Stiller: We don't have any retail shops. The supermarkets \n     in some industries define that as retail. The bulk of our \n     coffee is sold 25 percent through the supermarkets, about 25 \n     percent through the office distributors and then another 25 \n     percent through convenience stores.\n\n[[Page S13299]]\n\n       Q: How were you able to land these large contracts like the \n     Exxon Mobil convenience stores, Amtrak and Delta airlines?\n       Stiller: Mobil came to us over 10 years ago and we got one \n     convenience store that was right across from a Dunkin' \n     Donuts. The owner said if you can do anything with this \n     location I'll talk to you about the rest of the stores. And \n     we increased the coffee sales of the store about five times. \n     So we got the rest of that chain, which led to recognition in \n     the area and we just kept getting more convenience stores. \n     They tested us against all the other coffee companies and \n     found that our products did indeed sell better. We offered \n     better support. And then we signed a contract with Mobil for \n     five years.\n       Q: Your company has also come up with some technological \n     innovations.\n       Stiller: I think the whole convenience store area was \n     initiated with our use of air pots or the vacuum pump, \n     thermal server. Because historically the coffee wasn't able \n     to be kept fresh at the convenience store level. And with \n     those servers we were able to offer a variety of coffees with \n     a much longer shelf life than coffee sitting on a burner.\n       We were one of the first to recognize the sustainable issue \n     with coffee. We tried to work with the farms to improve the \n     farms, the product and the workers. It makes sense from a \n     business point of view that if the people are taken care of \n     you're going to have a better product. Nobody that is treated \n     poorly is going to put their heart and soul into developing a \n     good coffee.\n       Q: It appears you followed Ben & Jerry's philosophy of \n     social responsibility.\n       Stiller: It's been very important to us. I think it's been \n     very motivational to people in the company knowing that they \n     are achieving a greater good in the world through what we do. \n     We've had sustainable coffees for quite a while. And that led \n     the industry in organic and fair trade (coffees). We've also \n     encouraged our customers like Exxon Mobil. It was the first \n     convenience store on a national level to have an organic \n     coffee as their coffee of the month. This year they've done a \n     fair trade coffee.\n       Q: What do you mean by a fair trade coffee?\n       Stiller: A fair trade coffee is certified that the farm \n     that it comes from is a co-op. It's owned by the farmers. \n     They get a minimum wage. So that they can live off of that. \n     It's a major factor right now in that coffee is the second \n     largest commodity behind oil. But unlike oil, coffee is a \n     product of the people. There are 25 million farmers involved \n     in farming and developing coffee. And about 75 percent of \n     them are small farms. So if a farmer can't earn a living and \n     support a family with coffee, what do they do? They turn to \n     the government for support or they can turn to other illegal \n     crops. We're talking about a life and death situation for \n     these people. The break-even point for coffee is about 85 or \n     90 cents (a pound). It doesn't pay for them to produce good \n     coffee. Coffee prices are below 50 cents right now. So a lot \n     of the work that goes into good coffee is not happening. \n     Sometimes they will pick coffee four or five times during the \n     harvest season. Now, they're picking it once because they \n     can't afford the pickers. This whole fair trade initiative \n     was really developed to guarantee economic stability for the \n     farmers and with that almost guarantees more of a democracy \n     in a lot of these Third World countries because it provides \n     that economic stability.\n       Q: Has NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, had \n     any effect on your business?\n       Stiller: It doesn't really come into play. I think it's \n     more for manufactured goods as opposed to agriculture.\n       Q: You have a director of social responsibility to oversee \n     that area of the company?\n       Stiller: I think consumers are looking for more of that \n     from companies. A lot of the people here are really motivated \n     to make a difference in the world. They feel it's the right \n     thing to do.\n       Q: The economy is either in a recession or close to a \n     recession. Have you seen any indication of that in your \n     business? Or is coffee one of those products that consumers \n     regard as a necessity?\n       Stiller: It is a necessity. People enjoy it. It's part of \n     their life. It's an energizing experience. It's reflective in \n     a sense. You sort of take a break for coffee. And lots of \n     times ideas come to you with that reflection. In troubled \n     times, people might drink more coffee. In the overall scheme \n     of things, there might be a little bit of a downturn but it \n     wouldn't be very significant.\n       Q: You've been doing business in Vermont since 1981. Has \n     the state been a difficult place for your company to do \n     business?\n       Stiller: I think it's been a great experience. The Vermont \n     name has added a lot (of value). I think the people we have \n     hired are wonderful. There is a real sense of integrity and a \n     hard work ethic. We haven't had too many problems with the \n     permitting process. We've always felt supported by state \n     government and other agencies within the government. The only \n     issue has been in the banking area where we have had trouble \n     getting the credit lines from local banks. We went down to \n     Boston years ago and have been banking out of the \n     state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13299-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PAYING TRIBUTE TO RON CASS\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ron \nCass, a man who embraces the idea that one person can truly make a \ndifference. Ron is retiring after 28 years with KXLF-TV as General \nManager in Butte, MT. While his job required a keen sense of community, \nit was his dedication to his family and the city of Butte that I want \nto recall today.\n  Ron joined KXLF in 1974 and worked his way up the corporate ladder. \nHe was named President of KXLF Communications, Inc. in 1986 and later \nadded the management of KBZK in Bozeman, MT. Born in Harlowton, Ron \nstarted out as a disc jockey but soon chose television as his medium of \nchoice. I believe he chose wisely.\n  During the past several years, Ron has been instrumental in helping \nme understand a variety of telecommunication issues. He has given me \nhis ideas freely and helped me to understand not only the growing \ncomplexity of the industry but also the need to remember what is \nimportant for Montana TV viewers who rely on the medium for their \ninformation.\n  Meanwhile, Ron found himself complaining about the current state of \naffairs in his hometown of Butte. He realized rather quickly that \ntalking about problems didn't produce results--actions certainly speak \nlouder than words. Ron went into action. He now has a long list of \naccomplishments and I believe that Butte is a better place today \nbecause of his efforts.\n  Whether as President of the Butte Chamber of Commerce, a member of \nthe United Way Board of Directors, part of the Butte-Silver Bow Law \nEnforcement Commission, or even a member of the county's Study \nCommission, Ron rolled up his sleeves and Butte reaped the benefits. He \nalso made a commitment to the local Exchange Club and the Pachyderms. \nHe even battled Butte's frigid temperatures to help the Salvation Army \nduring their annual bell ringing fundraiser at Christmas time.\n  Those who know Ron Cass know that his personal participation is not \nfor personal glory or a Butte parade on St. Patrick's Day. Ron's \ninvolvement comes from his desire to give back; give back to the very \nfolks who helped him succeed in Montana when he first arrived and \ndecided to raise a family in Butte.\n  Today, Ron cherishes his family and many friends as he begins his \nretirement. His children, Barbara, Lura, and Dan--and his \ngrandchildren, Timothy, Sean, Alex, Andrew, and Jake--and of course, \nhis fiance, Nancy all agree that ``Poppa'' is a true role model.\n  About the same time he decided to contribute his talent, energy, and \nstrength to Butte, his grandson, Alex, was born with Down Syndrome. \nFrom that day on, Ron made it his mission to support and encourage Alex \nin all that he would choose to do. That has included his grandson's \nefforts in Special Olympics and the joys of mainstreamed education.\n  Ron Cass's unselfish actions throughout his CBS Television Network \ncareer transcend the airwaves. His actions are shown today in the \nquality of his family's lives and the many friends who will gather and \nhonor him before or after his last ``working'' day.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank Ron for all \nhe has done to benefit the City of Butte, and the State of Montana. I \nwant to wish him well in his retirement. While I am certain he will be \nspending plenty of time within the community he holds so close to his \nheart, I'm also certain that he'll be enjoying the Treasure State on \nthe back of his motorcycle with the wind in his hair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13299-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEASURE REFERRED\n\n  The following bill, previously received from the House of \nRepresentatives for concurrence, was read the first and second times by \nunanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 3282.

A bill to provide for transitional employment eligibility \nfor qualified lawful permanent resident alien airport security \nscreeners until their naturalization process is completed, and to \nexpedite that process; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Airport \nSecurity Personnel Protection Act. This legislation would expedite the \nnaturalization process and authorize transitional employment for the \nmany deserving airport security screeners who are in danger of losing \ntheir jobs as a result of a provision in the recently enacted Aviation \nTransaction Security Act.\n  In providing this assistance to these worthy individuals, the bill \nalso will provide relief for the airports in which they work and the \nmany customers whom they serve.\n  On November 19, 2001, President Bush signed the Aviation \nTransportation Security Act, P.L. 107-71, into law. The measure was \npassed with overwhelming support in both chambers. Among its many \nessential provisions was one, found in section 111(a) of the bill, that \nrequires all airport security screeners to be United States citizens.\n  Some expressed disagreement with the citizenship requirement while \nthe bill was pending but voted for the bill, nonetheless, because of \nthe many positive and essential provisions that the bill contained. \nOthers supported the citizenship requirement as a necessary step to \nensure the safety of our aviation system.\n  Regardless of how Senators and House Members feel about the merits of \nthe provision, we cannot help but be touched by one of its unfortunate \nconsequences. Because of the contentious manner in which differing \nprovisions in the House and Senate bills were resolved, we were unable \nto provide adequate transition provisions for the many well-qualified, \nhard-working, loyal, and deserving lawful permanent residents who are \non the verge of attaining U.S. citizenship but who will not be able to \ncomplete that process before they lose their jobs.\n  My legislation would resolve their situation in two ways: First, it \nwould require the Attorney General to expedite the naturalization \nprocess for those applicants who were employed as airport security \nscreeners at the time of enactment of the Aviation Transportation \nSecurity Act.\n  Second, it would carve out a transition period during which qualified \nlawful permanent residents could continue their employment as security \nscreeners while their naturalization applications are being \nadjudicated.\n  The ``Airport Security Personnel Protection Act'' would provide for a \nsmoother transition for qualified lawful permanent resident airport \nsecurity screeners who are on the verge of completing the \nnaturalization process. In so doing, it also would preserve both the \nintegrity of the naturalization process and the strong requirements for \nsecurity screeners that are contained in the Aviation Transportation \nSecurity Act.\n  Section 4(c) of the legislation specifically precludes the weakening \nof standards for naturalization for these screeners. It makes it clear \nthat the legislation merely requires the Attorney General to expedite \nthe processing of the naturalization applications of qualified airport \nsecurity screeners.\n  Under current law, these standards include such requirements as five \nyears of lawful permanent residence for most of those naturalizing, a \ndemonstration of good moral character, an understanding of the English \nlanguage, and an understanding of the history, principles, and form of \ngovernment of the United States.\n\n  The legislation also makes it clear that the Standards for continuing \nin employment during this transition period are to be the same, strong \nstandards that are included in the recently enacted Aviation \nTransportation Security Act.\n  Under this bill, in order to continue in employment during the \ntransition\n\n[[Page S13302]]\n\nperiod, an affected security screener would have to: be a lawful \npermanent resident alien; have been employed as a security screener on \nthe date of enactment of the Act; meet the employment eligibility \nrequirements under the Airport Security Screeners Act; have undergone \nand successfully completed an employment investigation (including a \ncriminal history record check); have had a naturalization application \npending on the date of enactment of the Act or, in the alternative, \nhave to be within one year of being eligible to file an application for \nnaturalization; and be approved by the U.S. Department of \nTransportation for hiring or continued employment.\n  Just as importantly, in order to remain employed during this \ntransition period, an alien would have to meet the new, enhanced \nrequirements of security screeners that were enacted as part of the \nAviation Transportation Security Act. These new, enhanced requirements \nprovide that the alien would have to: have a satisfactory or better \nscore on a Federal security screening personnel selection examination; \ndemonstrate daily a fitness for duty without any impairment due to \nillegal drugs, sleep deprivation, medication, or alcohol; undergo an \nemployment investigation, including a criminal history record check; \nnot present a threat to national security; possess a high school \ndiploma, a general equivalency diploma, or experience that the Under \nSecretary has determined to be sufficient for the individual to perform \nthe duties of the position; possess the ability to efficiently and \nthoroughly manipulate and handle such baggage, containers, and other \nobjects subject to security processing; be able to read, speak, and \nwrite English well enough to carry out written and oral instructions \nregarding the proper performance of screening duties; be able to read \nEnglish language identification media, credentials, airline tickets, \nand labels on items normally encountered in the screening process; \nprovide direction to and understand and answer questions from English-\nspeaking individuals undergoing screening; and write incident reports \nand statements and log entries into security records in the English \nlanguage; have satisfactorily completed all initial, recurrent, and \nappropriate specialized training required by the security program; \namong other requirements.\n  This simple but important bill would help the many deserving lawful \npermanent residents who are well qualified, have been performing their \njobs admirably, and whose lives are in danger of being disrupted. But \nit also would help the traveling public.\n  It is estimated that at least 25 percent of the current 28,000 \nairport security screeners in the Nation's 419 commercial airports are \nnoncitizens. I have heard from the mayor and airport director of the \nSan Francisco International Airport. They came to me out of concern \nthat, as a result of the new citizenship requirements under the \nAviation and Transportation Security Act, the airport stands to lose 70 \nto 80 percent of its screening personnel. In Los Angeles, about 40 \npercent of the baggage screeners are noncitizens.\n  Certainly, not all of these noncitizens will be able to meet the \nstringent requirements of this legislation. But to the extent that \nthose who are well-qualified are permitted to continue their employment \nwhile their naturalization applications are being adjudicated, it will \nbe a great help to the many airports in which they are employed.\n  I urge my colleagues to move expeditiously to enact this bill into \nlaw. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1829\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide alternative minimum tax relief with \nrespect to incentive stock options exercised during 2000; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today Senator Kerry and I introduced \nbipartisan legislation that will provide some relief to those workers \nwho are facing a massive tax bill on the phantom income they have from \nincentive stock options.\n  Because it is important that my colleagues understand the unfairness \nof this matter, let me provide a very brief background.\n  Incentive stock options ISO, are an option given by an employer to an \nemployee to purchase stock at a certain price. An individual does not \nrecognize any income on the grant of the option or exercise thereof if \nthe individual holds the shares for more than 2 years after grant and 1 \nyear after exercise. If the holding period requirements are satisfied, \nthe employee is taxed on the excess of the sale price over the exercise \nprice on his disposition of the shares.\n  The reason these employees have such a significant tax bill is due to \nthe workings of the Tax Code's answer to Rube Goldberg, the Alternative \nMinimum Tax, AMT. The employee's nonrecognition of income discussed \nabove does not apply for AMT purposes. For AMT purposes, the code \nrequires the recognition of the excess for the stock's fair market \nvalue on the date of exercise over the option price when the stock is \nsubstantially vested. Thus, while an employee does not have a tax \nliability of ordinary income for exercising his ISO the employee may be \nsubject to AMT when he exercises his ISO.\n  While in years past, this may not have been too great a problem in a \ntime when share prices are increasing and individuals have the money to \npay the AMT. It is a very different story when shares are declining. \nThe individual is then facing the AMT charges based on the exercise \nvalue but often has no funds to pay the AMT since the stock that was \nthe source of the AMT has declined in value since it was exercised.\n  It is true that if the individual had sold the stock in the same year \nhe exercised his ISO he would have potentially reduced his AMT \nliability significantly. However, the code sends a mixed signal to the \nindividual telling him that he must hold the stock for one year after \nexercise if he wants to avoid taxation at ordinary income on the value \nat the point of exercise.\n  The above are the facts of the tax code, but they do not reflect the \nvery real disaster this has done to many people across the country. The \nstory of one company in Cedar Rapids, IA, McLeod USA, puts a real face \non how this tax has destroyed families. I have received letters from \ndozens of honest hard-working people of this company telling me how \nthey are making a good salary in Iowa, say $50,000 or $70,000, and were \nalso given these ISOs as an additional incentive to work for McLeod. \nNow, because of the AMT rules and the declining market, these families \nare facing tax bills of tens of thousands, if not over a hundred \nthousand dollars. It is wiping out a lifetime of savings and hardwork, \nall to pay a tax bill on phantom income, income they never received, \nnever enjoyed and never had. It is outrageous and it is just plain \nwrong.\n\n[[Page S13305]]\n\n  The bill that Senator Kerry and I have introduced will provide \nsignificant relief from the AMT tax bill for workers. It allows \nemployees to determine the value of their stock options on April 15, \n2001, (as opposed to the exercise date), which will reflect the \ndownturn of the market. This will go far in minimizing the AMT hit that \nemployees face. In addition, the relief is targeted to assist low-\nincome and middle-income families.\n  I hope my colleagues will join myself and Senator Kerry to put an end \nto this tax disaster.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1831\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX RELIEF WITH RESPECT TO \n                   INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2000.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the case of an incentive stock option \n     (as defined in section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986) exercised during calendar year 2000, the amount taken \n     into account under section 56(b)(3) of such Code by reason of \n     such exercise shall not exceed the amount that would have \n     been taken into account if, on the date of such exercise, the \n     fair market value of the stock acquired pursuant to such \n     option had been its fair market value as of April 15, 2001 \n     (or, if such stock is sold or exchanged on or before such \n     date, the amount realized on such sale or exchange).\n       (b) Limitation.--\n       (1) In general.--If the adjusted gross income of a taxpayer \n     for the taxable year in which an exercise described in \n     paragraph (1) occurs exceeds the threshold amount, the amount \n     otherwise not taken into account under paragraph (1) shall be \n     reduced by the amount which bears the same ratio to such \n     amount as the taxpayer's adjusted gross income in excess of \n     the threshold amount bears to the phaseout amount.\n       (2) Threshold amount.--For purposes of this subsection, the \n     threshold amount is equal to--\n       (A) $106,000 in the case of a taxpayer described in section \n     1(a) of such Code,\n       (B) $84,270 in the case of a taxpayer described in section \n     1(b) of such Code, and\n       (C) $53,000 in the case of a taxpayer described in section \n     1(c) or 1(d) of such Code.\n       (3) Phaseout amount.--For purposes of this subsection, the \n     phaseout amount is equal to--\n       (A) $230,000 in the case of a taxpayer described in section \n     1(a) of such Code,\n       (B) $172,500 in the case of a taxpayer described in section \n     1(b) of such Code, and\n       (C) $115,000 in the case of a taxpayer described in section \n     1(c) or 1(d) of such Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN:\n  S. 1834. A bill for the relief of retired Sergeant First Class James \nD. Benoit and Wan Sook Benoit; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that I \nhope will assist a family in my home State of Michigan who suffered the \ndeath of their child while living on a U.S. Army base in the Republic \nof Korea. Nearly 18 years ago, Mr. James Benoit and his wife Mrs. Wan \nSook Benoit lost their three year old son, David Benoit, in a tragic \nmishap.\n  Some years ago, Mr. and Mrs. Benoit approached my office with a \nrequest for assistance. The Benoit family felt that they did not \nreceive the relief that they were entitled to receive. To assist the \nfamily, I introduced two private relief bills that sought to give the \nBenoit family a hearing before the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.\n  This case was referred to U.S. Court of Federal Claims as the result \nof private relief legislation I introduced. The legislation, S. 1168, \ngave the Court of Federal Claims ``jurisdiction to hear, determine and \nrender judgement on a claim by Retired Sergeant First Class James D. \nBenoit, Wan Sook Benoit, or the estate of David Benoit concerning the \ndeath of David Benoit on June 28th 1983. On March 14, 2000, oral \narguments were heard by the hearing officer assigned to the case and \nthe hearing officer recommended to the Court of Federal Claims on July \n28, 2000, ``that Sergeant and Mrs.. Benoit be awarded $415,000 for the \nwrongful death of David Benoit.'' Subsequently on May 23, 2001, the \nCourt of Federal Claims Review Panel upheld the conclusion of the \nhearing officer, and found that the plaintiffs ``have a valid and \nequitable claim against the United States.'' It went on to state that \n``the Review Panel recommends that plaintiffs be awarded $415,000.''\n  As a result of these findings, I am introducing special legislation \nto provide relief consistent with the court's recommendation. This \nlegislation can in no way compensate the Benoit's for the horrible loss \nthat they have suffered. No amount of money can do that. However, as \nthe court has stated, the Benoit family does indeed ``have a valid and \nequitable claim.'' It is my hope that Congress will act expeditiously \nto resolve this claim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13305-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   STATMENTS OF SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 192--TO AUTHORIZE REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGAL \n              COUNSEL IN JUDITH LEWIS V.

Mr. President, today the Senate passed S. 1762, a bill I \nintroduced to improve the formula for student loan interest rates and \nto ensure the long-term viability of the student loan program. I am \npleased the Senate unanimously agreed to this important legislation and \nI am proud to have worked with both students and lenders and my \ncolleagues on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nespecially Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Gregg, as well as \nMajority Leader Daschle, in passing this monumental legislation.\n  All across America, millions of young people are preparing to apply \nto college. These teenagers are dreaming not only of the college \nexperience they are about to embark upon, but also of graduating to \nbecome teachers, doctors, engineers, and even public servants. Thanks \nto the national education loan program, the educational and career \naspirations of students and their families can become reality.\n  We know that the future of our Nation lies in educating the next \ngeneration of young people so that each of them can realize the promise \nof America. For 35 years, we have invested in our future by opening the \ndoors of colleges and universities to the broadest cross-section of our \ncitizens at the lowest possible cost. That is why passing this \nlegislation was crucial to ensure that education loans are available to \nhelp future generations of students, workers, and their families climb \nthe ladder of economic opportunity.\n  Since 1965, a partnership of students, workers, their families, \neducational institutions, lenders, and the Federal Government has \nopened the doors of educational opportunity for more than 50 million \nAmericans. By any measure, the education loan program is a winning \ninvestment for our Nation.\n  Education loans are good investments in our economy and in our \ncitizens. As I travel across South Dakota, educators, employers, and \nstudents tell me how valuable a college degree is in today's economy. \nIndeed, we know that graduates with college degrees earn an average of \n80 percent more than individuals with only a high school diploma. Over \na lifetime, the earnings difference between individuals with high \nschool and college degrees can be more than $1 million. At a time when \nmany workers are losing their jobs through no fault of their own, \neducation loans are critical tools that can empower these workers to \nupgrade their skills. As we search for ways to expand our economic \nprosperity, we must preserve this important investment in the future of \nour Nation.\n  Congress has now taken the initiative to ensure that future \ngenerations have access to the college or university of their choice by \nenacting a permanent solution to the interest rate issue. Again, I \nthank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support in \npassing this critically important legislation of which we can all be \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13311-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13311-S13312]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HIGHER EDUCATION RELIEF OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2610) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted and Proposed.'')\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 2657), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \nsupporting and passing the ``District of Columbia Family Court Act of \n2001,'' which my friend and colleague, Senator Landrieu, and I \nintroduced earlier this summer. Our bill is aimed at guiding the \nDistrict, as the Superior Court strives to reform its role in the child \nwelfare system through its creation of a Family Court. This is a good \nbill, an important bill. It will have a significant impact on children \nand families throughout the District of Columbia.\n  Just last week, by passing the fiscal year 2002 District of Columbia \nAppropriations bill, the Senate took a major step toward fundamentally \nchanging the direction of what we are doing in the District regarding \nits child welfare system. Passage of that bill, while significant, was \njust the beginning of our work, not the end. As Chair and Ranking \nMember of the District of Columbia Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator \nLandrieu and I made sure that the appropriations bill made a sizeable \nand sound investment in the District's court system. However, the bill \nwe are passing today, through the creation of a new family court \nstructure, actually outlines the essential, institutional changes \nnecessary to achieve long-term reform and improvement in the District's \nability to protect its children.\n  We need fundamental reforms, because, quite frankly, the District's \nchild welfare system is a mess. This is nothing new. We have seen \narticles repeatedly in the Washington Post, that paint a very \ndisturbing picture of the kinds of atrocities that children in the \nDistrict of Columbia court system have faced. For example, a recent \nPost series outlined multiple mistakes made by the District of Columbia \nGovernment by placing children in unsafe homes or institutions. \nUnfortunately, these same mistakes occur in the child welfare system \nthroughout our country. Here in Washington, though, these\n\n[[Page S13317]]\n\nmistakes resulted in over 180 deaths of children in foster care since \n1993, 40 of whom died as a direct result of government workers' failure \nto take key preventative actions or because they placed children in \nunsafe homes or institutions.\n  Again just last week, the Post ran a story about deficiencies in \nDistrict's child services. According to this story, ``nearly 80 percent \nof the District's child abuse complaints were not investigated within \n30 days and close to two-thirds of foster homes housing city children \nwere unlicensed this year,'' a study reported. The article continues: \n``Among the reports' findings, 30 percent of the children under \nDistrict care were not visited by social workers during their first 8 \nweeks in foster care. Thirty-seven percent of child neglect complaints \nwere not investigated within 30 days after they came into the city's \nhotline. Abuse and neglect cases are required to be investigated within \na 30-day period.''\n  Stories like this, have been running for years in the District of \nColumbia. What is happening here in America's capital, is a national \ntragedy. I realize that no child welfare system is perfect. Each one of \nus representing our respective States has seen problems in our home \nStates, but what we see in the District of Columbia is an absolute \noutright scandal.\n  Since being appointed to the District of Columbia Appropriations \nCommittee, I have made it my personal mission to find financial \nsolutions for the problems facing District of Columbia's foster \nchildren. In March, we laid the groundwork for a District of Columbia \nFamily Court Bill that would be bipartisan and effective. In drafting \nthis bill, we have held numerous hearings, met with child welfare \nadvocates from across the District, and had countless meetings with the \nDistrict of Columbia Superior Court Judges.\n  The bill we are now passing today includes a number of important \nreforms that would ensure that the judicial system protects the \nchildren of the District. First, it increases the length of judicial \nterms for judges from 1 year for judges already presiding over the \nSuperior Court to 3 years. New judges appointed to the Superior Court \nand then assigned to the Family Court will have 5-year terms. This \nchange enables judges to develop an expertise in Family Law.\n  Second, our bill creates magistrates so that the current backlog of \n4,500 permanency cases can be properly and adequately addressed. These \nmagistrates will be distributed among the judges according to a \ntransition plan, which must be submitted to Congress within 90 days of \npassage of this bill. We want to make sure the court has the \nflexibility to deal with these important child welfare issues.\n  Third, the bill provides the resources for an Integrated Judicial \nInformation System, IJIS. This will enable the court to track and \nproperly monitor family cases and will allow all judges and magistrates \nto have access to the information necessary to make the best decisions \nabout placement and child safety.\n  Fourth, a reform in the bill that I find extremely important is the \nOne-Judge/One Family provision. This policy will ensure that the same \njudge, a judge who knows the history of a family and the child, will be \nmaking the important permanency decisions. This provision is essential \nfor those hard cases involving abuse and neglect. It ensures \nconsistency. It ensures safety. And, it just makes sense.\n  Ultimately, our bill will help provide consistency through the One-\nJudge/One-Family provision. It will help increase safety and security, \nand it will help instill stability for the children of the District. We \nneed to give the children in the District's welfare system all of these \nthings. It is the right thing to do.\n  We must never, ever lose sight of our responsibility to the children \ninvolved. Their needs and their best interests must always come first. \nAnd today, I believe we are putting children first and taking a huge \nstep forward on their behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13317-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AUTHORIZING REPRESENTATION BY SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, one thing we need to do a better job of \nin this Congress--and we do have oversight and appropriations authority \nfor all moneys that are expended--is to make sure that those moneys \nhave been spent wisely, efficiently, and that the taxpayers' interests \nare protected with the same degree of fidelity that homeowners and \nfamilies protect theirs, as small business people protect theirs. We \ndon't always do that. We spend such big sums of money that sometimes we \nthink small matters are not that significant.\n  I had the responsibility a few years ago as Attorney General of \nAlabama to take over an office that was financially out of control. We \nhad a huge debt facing the office the year I took office. We had to \nreduce personnel, substantially cut back on all kinds of things, and to \nreorganize the office. When it was over, even though we had lost some \ngood people--no career people, thank goodness, but almost a third of \nthe office, those who were political appointees; that office has never \ngotten close to the same number of people that it had--what we found \nwas that working together we actually improved productivity. We did a \ngreat job. The people worked hard. They reorganized. They had a new \nvision.\n  We have a false impression that money is the only thing that answers \na problem around here. Always the answer is, just give it more money. \nAnd we in Congress say: We did what we could; that is somebody else's \nproblem.\n  I have initiated a program I call ``Integrity Watch.'' It is a \nprogram in which I take time periodically to analyze bad fiscal \nmanagement expenditure practices in our Government and to highlight \nthose. The one today I take no real pleasure in. It was a sad, \nconfusing story, but it is appropriate for the taxpayers to know the \nfinal outcome, to see what has happened, to be aware of how much it has \ncost us in expenditures.\n  Many people remember the decision by General Shinseki, Chief of Staff \nof the Army, to change the berets to give everybody a black beret. He \nset a deadline of this year, only a few months away from that date, and \nhe had to find a whole lot of berets in a hurry. Under the Berry \namendment, the Federal law requires that all clothing items be \nmanufactured within the United States except in times of armed \nconflict.\n  What happened with the deadline that was given was, the Defense \nLogistics Agency, that had been delegated the authority way down the \nline to grant waivers of the Berry amendment, found itself in a \nposition where they did not have sufficient American manufacturers to \nmeet that deadline. And so based on this artificial goal by the Chief \nof Staff of the Army, General Shinseki, they set about to get the \nberets wherever they could. They issued waivers and started getting \nberets from all over.\n  They got 925,000 of them made from China, by the Communist \ngovernment. Other countries were called on and agreed to manufacture in \nthis rushed process. When that all became public and there were \ncomplaints about the beret decision to begin with and all these factors \ncame up, there was quite an uproar. The result was that the military \nadmitted that they had not complied at least with the spirit of the \nBerry amendment, that they should not utilize the Chinese-made black \nberets, worth $6.5 million, and so they stored them. They paid for \nthem. They stored them. So we now have 925,000 black berets valued at \n$6.5 million not being utilized. Hopefully, some other army in the \nworld might buy them from us, but we are certainly going to take a big \nhit on that.\n  Another thing that we learned: Some of this information came about as \na result of my request to the General Accounting Office that does \naudits for the Congress and other agencies to determine how moneys are \nbeing spent. We just got this audit back earlier this week. The General \nAccounting Office report indicates a number of other things that \nhappened.\n\n  GAO declared that the military, in order to meet its deadline, chose \nto shortcut normal contracting procedures. They found, for example, \nthat the defense logistics agency awarded the first set of contracts \nwithout competition.\n  According to the contract documents, all the contract actions were \nnot completed because of ``an unusual and compelling urgency.'' The \nreal urgency was the self-imposed deadline they set.\n  It also goes on to point out that these rushed up contracts hadn't \nworked very well. Not only were they being done substantially outside \nthe United States by foreign suppliers in violation of congressional \nacts, but they weren't being performed well and had to be canceled.\n  The Denmark military equipment supplier which manufactured black \nberets in Romania agreed to supply 480,000 berets. Only 90,000 have \nbeen supplied, and the military canceled the order for 350,000.\n  Another one was a Bernard Cap Company, which is manufacturing the \nberets in South Africa but with Chinese content. They contracted to \nsupply 750,000 berets. The cancellation has now taken place, and \n442,000 were canceled.\n  A third contract was with Northwest Woolen Mills to have the berets \nmanufactured in India. The number purchased was 342,000; the number \ndelivered was 56,000; the quantity canceled was 235,000.\n  Every time the military has to go through a cancellation of a \ncontract, it costs us money. We all know that. That was bad management. \nA lot of things happened that I think were not good. I am, however, \nquick to say that the Assistant Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul \nWolfowitz, early on had a study and review done of the compliance with \nthe Berry amendment. And what they concluded was that he would direct \nan order, throughout the Defense Department, requiring compliance with \nthe Berry amendment, directing that any waiver authority could not be \ndelegated below the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition. That is \nwhat the problem was in this case.\n  It required that no waivers be granted without a full analysis of the \nalternative because it is easy to say there is no supplier in the \nUnited States. But had the Defense Department really searched it out to \nmake sure that is true? Had they considered other possibilities? He \ndirected that it be done. He achieved revisions throughout the \nacquisition regulations which govern our military forces as they make \nacquisitions. There are complex regulations and he revised them to make \nsure there would be no further violations of the Berry amendment. In \nthe course of all this, he uncovered at least three cases in which the \nBerry amendment had apparently been violated. No one had even raised \nit, and no analysis or waiver had been done. They just went on and \npurchased military apparel outside the U.S. without any kind of waiver \nauthority.\n  Now, the Chief of Staff of the Army came under a lot of criticism, \nand I think he told the truth. He was frank when he discussed why he \ndid what he did and why he believed it was important. I think he made a \nmistake. He did not argue with people about it. He explained why he did \nwhat he did, and he believe he was justified. So I hope that is a \nlearning experience there.\n\n[[Page S13319]]\n\n  It is not enough that we just complain about waste, fraud, and abuse. \nMy little program, called Integrity Watch, is designed to ask in some \ndetail how can we make it better. Do we need legislation to be passed? \nDo we need regulations to be changed? Do we need to cut off funding? \nWhat do we need to do to improve a situation? In this case, I would say \nthe Berry amendment is adequate. It does the task. What the problem was \na cavalier attitude about how it should be administered. I also think \nthere was an unnecessary rush to produce the berets, and it cost us a \nconsiderable amount of money, a $26 million total contract price. So I \nbelieve the actions of the Defense Department in reinvigorating and \nhighlighting the need to enforce the Berry amendment, to raise up the \nlevel of the personnel of the Defense Logistics Agency before anybody \ncan grant a waiver, will probably solve that.\n  So I don't think legislation is needed. I am certainly not of the \nview that we need to pass legislation to direct how the Chief of Staff \nof the Army decides emergency matters. I hope through this experience, \nhowever, that he will have learned a lesson, and those who work with \nhim will have learned a lesson, that sometimes it is better to go slow, \nnot to set deadlines and goals that are too fast because the costs can \nbe paid by the taxpayer and you can end up with problems such as we had \nin this case. You can end up with a situation where a nation is \nsupplying berets that we don't intend to use. You can end up with a \nsituation where contracts, because they were rushed, got canceled and \nwhere it cost more money and ended up delaying distribution of the \nberets.\n  I think this is worth highlighting. I appreciate the GAO for doing an \nobjective and fair analysis of the situation. It was not a bright day \nfor the Department of Defense. In fact, it was a clear error--a kind of \nproblem that should not have occurred. But it did occur. I believe we \nhave all learned from it and, hopefully, in the future, this will be \navoided as we go forward with the additional procurement we will be \nfacing to make sure the men and women in uniform have the equipment, \nclothing, and resources they need to do the important jobs with which \nthey are challenged.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/14/senate-section/article/S13319-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 12:30 P.M., MONDAY, DECEMBER 17, 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
