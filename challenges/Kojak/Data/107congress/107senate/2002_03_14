Madam President, I ask that Senator Crapo and Senator \nGordon Smith be added as sponsors, please.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, we of course are into our energy bill. \nOne of the important components of an energy bill is the electricity \nsection. There are a number of things we have done. Yesterday we did \nsome things on PUHCA and PURPA--had those eliminated. We have done some \nother things to make it work. The committee chairman and others were \ngracious enough to accept those.\n  Today we have some other issues we want to talk about, that are very \nimportant. This amendment deals with one of those. It is called \nreliability.\n  Of course, there is nothing more important than ensuring our electric \ntransmission grid will continue to be safe and continue to be reliable; \nthat consumers will be able to get the power they need where they need \nit and when they need it, the lights will go on and stay on. In fact, \nprobably no aspect of our energy program touches more people than does \nelectricity.\n  The amendment we are offering today does those things. It makes \nelectricity available and puts some reliability into it by establishing \na nationwide organization which has the authority to establish and \nenforce reliability standards.\n  We have had our reliability standards, we have worked with them, \nthere are organizations, but we have not really been able to cause \nthose things to happen. This amendment takes into account--and this is \nvery important--the regional differences that occur between the West \nand the East. You can imagine, simply by geography, how different they \nare.\n  Under this amendment, the new reliability organization will be run by \nmarket participants and will be overseen by FERC. Basically what we are \nsaying is that the States and local people and various interested \nparties can participate in setting this up and will participate in it, \noverseen by FERC to make sure it works. The reliability organization \nwill be made up of representatives from everyone who is affected--\nresidential, commercial, industrial consumers, State public utility \ncommissioners, independent power producers, electric utilities, and \nothers.\n  There is no question we need a new system to safeguard the integrity \nof our power grid. Both the amendment and the Daschle bill create \nmandatory and enforceable reliability rules, and they do so in \ndifferent ways, and that is what we are talking about--the difference. \nThe Daschle bill gives all the authority and responsibility to FERC. \nFERC is to set the standards, FERC is to enforce the standards. The \nfact is, FERC is not prepared to do this job, nor do they have the \nexpertise to do it.\n  The amendment, instead, establishes a participant-run, FERC-overseen \nelectric reliability organization. This is key to this whole amendment \nand this whole direction. It is a blend of Federal oversight along with \nindustry expertise. It is similar to the bill the Senate passed \nunanimously in this Congress last year.\n  Over the years, the grid has been well protected through the \nvoluntary standards established by the North American Electric \nReliability Council. NERC's voluntary reliability standards, which are \nnot enforceable currently, have generally been complied with by the \nelectric power industry. But with the opening of wholesale power market \nto competition, our transmission grid is being used in ways in which it \nhas not been used before and, frankly, was not designed to be used.\n\n  This is one of the big changes that has happened. It used to be that \na utility that did the distribution in the area produced the power for \nthat area. Now, of course, we have merchant generators. And more and \nmore of that will go, where they sell it outside of their distribution \narea or, indeed, have no distribution area at all.\n  New system strains are also being created by the disillusion of \nvertically integrated utilities and by the emergence of new market \nstructures and participants. Cooperation is being replaced with \ncompetition.\n  The result of these changes has been an increase in the number and \nseverity of violations of NERC's voluntary reliability rules.\n  On occasion, we have even seen utilities take power from the grid in \ndirect violation of NERC's rules, and they suffer no penalty.\n  We all agree we need to protect reliability. The question is not \nwhether we protect it. The question is, How do we protect it? That is, \nof course, what this issue is all about.\n  Unfortunately, the reliability provisions in the Daschle bill take \nthe wrong approach. The Daschle bill gives FERC the exclusive \nresponsibility for establishing and enforcing reliability standards. \nThis is very technical work that will require a very large commitment \nof resources.\n  Unfortunately, FERC does not have either the technical capability or \nthe manpower to take on such a significant new responsibility. FERC's \nexpertise is ratemaking, not in technical standard setting.\n  Another key problem with the Daschle bill is that it does not \nrecognize regional differences in electrical systems due to the \ngeography, the market design, the economics, and the operational \nfactors. Many fear that FERC does not have the sensitivity to the \nregional differences that are so critically important, and I suppose \nyou could say particularly in the West, in that the West has moved a \nlittle more quickly to this, but the rest of the country will be moving \nnecessarily soon.\n  Regional differences are best taken into account by those who are \nclosest to the problem and those who understand what needs to be done, \nand that, unfortunately, is not FERC.\n  In addition, the Daschle bill simply does not address adequately the \nneeds of the States for a meaningful role in the process of setting and \nenforcing reliability standards. This is, of course, an issue in lots \nof things, but it has always been an issue in this electric \nreregulation business; that is, that the States outside of a State \nought to have a great deal of involvement. And particularly when we end \nup, as inevitably we will, with RTOs and different kinds of \ndistribution systems coming off a main national distribution \ntransmission channel, then the States and the regions need to have that \nability to have input.\n  Under the Daschle bill, the States, as any other interested or \naffected party, can make their views known to FERC as part of any \nformal rulemaking, but\n\n[[Page S1874]]\n\nFERC can disregard those State views, substituting FERC's judgment for \nthat of the States.\n  So I ask, who is more interested in ensuring reliability than those \nwho would be directly affected? Why would anyone believe that FERC \nknows better what to do than those who are directly affected? I feel \nvery strongly about that, as I think most of us do.\n  Far too often we have seen that FERC is more interested in abstract \nnotions of competition instead of concrete issues of price and supply, \nwhich is what is really important in this reliability aspect to \nconsumers.\n  The Daschle bill also fails to account for the international nature \nof our transmission grid. Canada is already part of a seamless North \nAmerican grid, and Mexico is also an interconnect.\n  If reliability is given to FERC, as in the Daschle bill, FERC will be \ntrying to set standards applicable to and affecting transmission in \nCanada and Mexico, over which FERC has no authority. I fear Canada and \nMexico simply will not allow their systems to be regulated directly or \nindirectly by FERC. After all, of course, they are sovereign nations.\n  If these two nations withdraw from collaborative efforts, not only \nwill it jeopardize the reliability of the entire North American grid, \nit will certainly also seriously impair cross-border trade in \nelectricity.\n  Continued international trade is critical to our supply of power. As \nwe have seen in California, even a minor shortfall of electricity can \ncreate significant problems in terms of price spikes and blackouts. In \nshort, we need to have that Canadian component. And they are a \nvoluntary part of this system.\n  This amendment addresses all of those concerns. In a nutshell, the \namendment converts the existing NERC voluntary reliability system into \na mandatory reliability system.\n  The new reliability organization will have enforcement powers, with \nreal teeth to ensure reliability. The amendment provides that mandatory \nreliability rules will apply to all users of the transmission grid. \nThere are no loopholes. No one will be exempt.\n  It will be participant run but subject to oversight by FERC in the \nUnited States and with the appropriate regulatory authorities in Canada \nand Mexico.\n  It will utilize industry's technical expertise to create reliability \nrules, and everyone will be able to participate. It assures a \nmeaningful role for the States and regional organizations in the \ndevelopment and enforcement of the reliability standards.\n  There can be appropriate regional variations that recognize that the \nEast is different from the West. It will allow the participation of \nCanada and Mexico without violating national sovereignty.\n  The amendment has the backing of the North American Electric \nReliability Council; the National Association of Regulatory Utility \nCommissioners, which represent State public utility commissions, the \nWestern Governors' Association, and the administration.\n  The need for such a reliability system has been cited in the \nPresident's national energy policy. It is one thing that Congress \nreally should do as part of any energy bill. We have the opportunity \nnow to do that.\n  Both the Daschle bill and the amendment speak to reliability of the \ntransmission system. If you want more Federal command and control by \nthe FERC, and if you do not mind jeopardizing cross-border electric \ntrade with Canada and Mexico, then vote against this amendment. But if \nyou want a realistic and effective reliability program that protects \nconsumers, does not disrupt international trade, and allows for \nregional differences to be taken into account, then we need to vote for \nthis amendment.\n  There are a couple letters I would like to read from that we have \nreceived. This one is from the North American Electric Reliability \nCouncil. It says:\n\n       For more than 30 years, NERC has sought to assure the \n     reliability of the North American bulk transmission system, \n     working with all segments of the industry, consumers and \n     federal and state regulators. Your amendment would put in \n     place a reliability management system that builds upon this \n     proven reliability mechanism, but upgrades it to provide for \n     mandatory and enforceable reliability standards. The Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, will provide oversight \n     and coordination in the United States, but unlike the \n     existing language in S. 517, your amendment would not have \n     FERC directly promulgating and enforcing reliability rules.\n\n  That is from this national group that, by the way, is located in New \nJersey.\n  This one is from APPA's over 2,000 State and locally owned not-for-\nprofit electric utilities:\n\n       [This] amendment would ensure that a broad-based industry \n     self-regulating reliability organization would be vested with \n     the authority to set and enforce reliability standards. This \n     type of organization--the North American Electric Reliability \n     Council--already exists, but legislation is required to give \n     NERC the ability to enforce the standards that industry \n     agrees should be promulgated. . . .\n       In contrast, [the Daschle bill] would allow the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission to confer enforcement authority \n     to a wide range of organizations--with potential for varied \n     and conflicting enforcement.\n\n  We also have a letter from the Canadian Embassy and from the Western \nGovernors' Association.\n  I think there is a real opportunity, obviously, to deal with \nreliability. Our choices are whether we want to use what is in place \nthat has been proven or whether we want to shift it to another agency \nof the Federal Government to make all the decisions at the top level \nrather than including everyone in it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise to discuss the issue before the \nSenate and explain my perspective on it and hope that Senators can give \ntheir attention, those in their offices, and their staffs. This is a \ncomplex issue we are debating, the issue of reliability and how we deal \nwith it.\n  The underlying energy bill contains provisions that are intended to \ncreate a system to ensure that the grid for delivery of electricity is \nreliable. This is an issue on which, as the Senator from Wyoming \nindicated, we all agree. Something needs to change in Federal law to \nensure that the grid is reliable.\n  The most recent wake-up call was what happened in California when the \nlights went out. All of a sudden, everybody starts looking around. Who \ndo we hold accountable? Whose job was it to keep the lights on?\n  We have an interstate transmission system in this country. It is one \nwhich most would acknowledge is not adequate for future demands. For \nthat reason, we are trying to ensure that the proper safeguards and \nmechanisms are in place to keep this system reliable.\n  Up until now, the reliability of the transmission system has been up \nto a private organization. There is no Federal responsibility for it. \nYou could call the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nover and have a hearing in front of the Energy Committee. He could say: \nYou haven't given us that job. You, the Congress, have not given us, \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the job of keeping this \nsystem reliable. That belongs to NERC, which is the North American \nElectric Reliability Council. They are the ones responsible.\n  Everybody, the industry included, realizes that is not adequate for \ntoday's demands. We need to have some governmental accountability in \naddition to the expertise that NERC and other organizations can bring \nto the system.\n\n  The reliability system needs to apply to all users. The rules need to \nbe enforceable. There need to be penalties if you do not comply with \nthe rules. Someone has to be able to slap your wrist and say: Get in \nline and do what everyone has agreed to do.\n  Nobody disagrees with the conclusion that FERC should have oversight \nof the system that contains these requirements. There are differences, \nhowever, about how these principles should be implemented.\n  I believe the provisions in the bill before us, S. 517, take the \nsimplest approach possible. That is what we have tried to do. We give \nFERC the responsibility. We provide tremendous flexibility for FERC to \ndefer to experts, to\n\n[[Page S1875]]\n\ndefer to regional entities, to defer to private groups to implement the \nobligation. But when push comes to shove, FERC has the responsibility \nto be sure this system is reliable so when the lights go out, we have \nsomeone to hold accountable.\n  The Western Governors' Association has proposed an amendment--the \nSenator from Wyoming has now offered that amendment--that would take a \nfar more cumbersome and complicated approach to accomplishing these \ngoals. The proposal would create a tangle of procedural red tape that \ncould tie up attempts to make certain the grid is reliable. For that \nreason, I have to oppose the amendment.\n  The Thomas amendment would require FERC to create a reliability \nstructure that first creates a national electric reliability \norganization to be approved by FERC. Clearly, there are such \norganizations. We have NERC, which I referred to a few minutes ago, \nthat exists. That should continue. But to put this requirement in law \ntakes away flexibility.\n  The amendment allows creation of regional reliability entities. It \ncreates a rebuttable presumption that the standard set by any such \nregional entity, on an interconnection-wide basis, should be accepted \nby FERC. That is a concern I will get into in more detail.\n  The amendment creates a rebuttable presumption that standards offered \nby an interconnection-wide entity are just and reasonable and not \nunduly discriminatory. It writes that into the law. It allows FERC only \nto remand to an electricity reliability organization or to regional \nentity rules that it determines are not just and reasonable. It creates \na complaint process that is very cumbersome and would take months, if \nnot years, to finally result in a compliance award.\n  The structure is complex. It is largely unworkable as proposed. If \nsomeone is acting in a way that the national reliability experts think \nendangers the stability of the delivery system, those experts should \nnot have to go through a cumbersome process in order to remedy the \nproblem.\n  These problems in the reliability of the system are extremely time \nsensitive. And you can't set up a maze of procedural requirements that \nhave to be maneuvered before a remedy can be found. Only in one part of \nthe country is there any likelihood that an interconnection-wide entity \ncan be created, and that is the West, beyond the Rocky Mountains.\n\n  Let me put up a map of the country. As I indicated, the amendment the \nSenator is proposing is being offered by Governors from the western \npart of the country--his Governor, my Governor from New Mexico, who--I \ndon't know the extent to which he is focused on what he is proposing \nhere. The only interconnection-wide entity that is likely to exist and \nmeet these requirements--or get the provisions under here is in the \nWest, this large pink area here.\n  The reliability structure, in my view, needs to be simple and \ndependable. We should require that FERC implement a system, give them \nguidelines and flexibility to confer with experts, flexibility to defer \nto regional bodies. That is what we do in the underlying bill. We \nshould not create a system that is too complicated and causes the \nreliability of our electric system to remain in question.\n  Let me take this down and just go through more of a detailed \nexplanation of what I understand this proposal to be. This amendment \nthat the Senator from Wyoming is offering would add a new section, No. \n215, to the Federal Power Act.\n  Just a second here. Let me jump ahead. The provision the Senator from \nWyoming is proposing contains a provision that is as a result of an \nattempt by NERC to reach a consensus among industry participants about \nwhat needs to be done about reliability. This process has been going on \nmany years now.\n  About 4 years ago, they came up with a 30-page document purporting to \nrepresent the agreement of a broad range of industry participants. The \nproposal was renegotiated several times over the course of the years, \noften with key constituencies dropping out of that consensus as they \nwent forward. The most recent iteration--the one we are considering \nhere--was a result of discussions last fall. At the conclusion of those \ndiscussions, very few of the original consentees--if that is a good \nword--remained on board. The Electric Power Supply Association and the \nAssociation of Marketers and Independent Power Producers oppose this \nnew version--the version now being offered as an amendment. The \nElectric Institute--which is, of course, central in issues related to \nelectricity--was unable to endorse the proposal because they had \nopposition from several of their members.\n  The Western Governors' Association has proposed language and that is \nwhat we have before us.\n  Let me try to summarize their proposal. Their proposal gives the \nCommission jurisdiction within the U.S. over an electric reliability \norganization and any regional entities and all users, owners, and \noperators for the bulk power system for the purpose of improving \nreliability and enforcing reliability standards. The FERC must issue a \nrule within 180 days of enactment of this law, if it is enacted. FERC \nmust certify an applicant, if it determines it has the ability to \ndevelop and enforce reliability standards, and that the applicant has \nrules that assure its independence of users, owners, and operators \nwhile assuring fair stakeholder representation of directors in balanced \ndecisionmaking in any committee.\n  Compliance with standards is mandatory. So the electric reliability \norganization must file proposed standards or modifications with FERC. \nThis is under the amendment of the Senator from Wyoming. Instead of \nFERC issuing them, the electric reliability organization would file the \nproposed standards of modification with FERC. FERC may approve them if \nit determines that the standards are just, reasonable, and not unduly \ndiscriminatory or preferential and in the public interest. FERC must \ngive due weight to the technical expertise of the electric reliability \norganization but shall not defer with respect to a standard's effect on \ncompetition.\n\n  The electric reliability organization and FERC must rebuttably \npresume--and that is in the statute. I know our Presiding Officer is \nvery familiar with presumptions in the law and rebuttal presumptions in \nthe law, and here there is a rebuttable presumption that a proposal for \na standard or a modification that comes from a regional entity that is \norganized on an interconnection-wide basis is just and reasonable and \nnot unduly discriminatory.\n  Let me go to the map again. As to that provision that says there is a \nrebuttable presumption, a rebuttable presumption that any proposal for \na standard or modification that comes from a regional entity organized \non an interconnection-wide basis is just and reasonable, where do we \nhave a regional entity organized on an interconnection-wide basis? One \nplace: California, in the West. The rest of the country doesn't benefit \nfrom that so-called rebuttable presumption.\n  If FERC cannot approve a standard, it must remand the standard to the \nelectric reliability organization. FERC may order the electric \nreliability organization to propose a different standard or a \nmodification. The electric reliability organization may impose a \npenalty on a user of the system that violates a standard. After notice \nand the opportunity for hearing, filing with the Commission, the FERC \nmay order compliance or a penalty. The Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission must establish rules authorizing the electric reliability \norganization to delegates its authority to a regional entity.\n  All of this is in the amendment the Senator from Wyoming is \nproposing. This goes on and on. Let me try to summarize this by putting \nup a chart or two and try to explain to the Senate how this would work, \nas I understand it. Let me start with ``Standard Proposal.'' It really \nshould have been entitled, ``How Do You Propose a Reliability \nStandard?'' What is the process for proposing a reliability standard? \nFERC has a responsibility and jurisdiction to establish an electric \nreliability organization. That is what they do here. So the ERO, \nelectric reliability organization, under the Senator's amendment, would \nbe established.\n  Now, the ERO can delegate its authority to a regional entity for \nstandard proposals and enforcement. That is this box over here, which \nsays ``delegated regional entity.'' Remember that the regional entity \nis organized on an interconnection-wide basis. Then that is when the \nrebuttable presumption\n\n[[Page S1876]]\n\ncomes in. So if you are in the western part of the country, then there \nis the rebuttable presumption that comes in that the regional entity \nshould be approved. There is only one region in the country where this \ninterconnection-wide deference is applicable, and that is the West. The \nrest of the country doesn't benefit.\n  There are three interconnections: The 14 Western States that are in \nthe Western Electric Coordinating Council; ERCOT, Electric Reliability \nCouncil of Texas; and then there is the rest of the country. Currently, \nthere are eight regional reliability councils besides these two--the \none in the West and the one in Texas. They are all in the eastern \ninterconnection. It is a near certainty that these eight entities will \nnot be able to organize into an interconnection-wide regional body so \nthat the rest of the country does not receive, under this amendment, \nthe same deference as the West would receive.\n  As a consequence, there will be different structures for reliability \ncompliance and enforcement in different parts of the country.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing detail of the proposal is that any entity \nthat is organized on an interconnection-wide basis must be assumed to \nbe functional just because it is organized on an interconnection-wide \nbasis. We are saying if you are organized on an interconnection-wide \nbasis, shown in pink on this map of the country, then you have the \npresumption that you are a functional organization. In the rest of the \ncountry, a regional entity must prove it is up to the task before there \ncan be any delegation of authority to it. In the West, and perhaps in \nTexas, it would work the other way around.\n\n  The Commission and the national reliability organization on which we \nwill be depending to keep the lights on, to keep the electricity \noperating, must prove that any regional entity is not adequate, instead \nof requiring the entity to prove it is adequate. Reliability, in my \nview, is more important than that, and we need to require that all \nparts of the structure in all parts of the country demonstrate \ncompetence to shoulder this heavy responsibility.\n  There is no reason we should write into law presumptions that any \nparticular organization, which we do not yet even have established in \nsome cases, knows what they are doing.\n  How are standards proposed? Let me go through this chart as best I \ncan. If the electric reliability organization, the ERO, that has been \nset up by FERC, wants to propose a standard, it needs to file that with \nFERC.\n  The Commission has the choice: It can approve the standard or, if it \ndoes not find it is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory \nor preferential, it can remand the proposal back to the electric \nreliability organization. It has two options: It can approve it or \nremand it.\n  If the electric reliability organization has delegated its authority \nto a regional entity, the proposal will then be remanded to the \nregional entity instead of FERC. If the regional entity does not accept \nthe proposal, it may resubmit it to the electric reliability \norganization, and the electric reliability organization then resubmits \nit to FERC. It would go up to a delegated regional entity, over to the \nelectric reliability organization, and then to FERC.\n  Remember, there is a rebuttable presumption for both the electric \nreliability organization and for FERC that any proposal from a regional \nentity that is organized on an interconnection-wide basis is just and \nreasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. We have these \nrebuttable presumptions to which everyone is obligated to defer.\n  The consequence of this rebuttable presumption/remand circle is that \na regional entity that wanted to prevent a change in a standard could \ntie up the decision for virtually forever. The important rule that \ngoverns reliability of the transmission system could circle through \nthis system pretty much indefinitely, with nobody ever able to come to \na final decision.\n  These are time-sensitive decisions. We are trying to keep the lights \non. These are not the kinds of decisions that should be allowed to bog \ndown in this maze.\n  Let me change charts and put up a different chart. This is one that \nis called FERC Proposed Modification. Again, I am trying to describe \nthe amendment as I understand it, and if I am wrong about how this \namendment works, then I invite my colleagues who are proposing the \namendment to explain why I am wrong.\n  This is called FERC Proposed Modification. If FERC believes it needs \nto propose a change, it can order the electric reliability organization \nto submit the modification. We have an order going from FERC to the \nelectric reliability organization. Then the electric reliability \norganization submits the modification to FERC and the circle starts \nagain. There are rebuttal presumptions in here. There are remands going \naround in this chart as well. Neither the electric reliability \norganization nor FERC is empowered under this amendment, as I read it, \nto bring this to a conclusion.\n\n  Let me go to one other chart. This is a chart on how complaints are \nto be handled under the system that is being proposed in this \namendment.\n  If the electric reliability organization receives a complaint that \nsomeone has failed to comply with a rule--and that is obviously what \nthis whole system is intended to deal with--it may, after notice of \nhearing--that is shown on the chart as: Does the electric reliability \norganization want to act? The complaint is filed. If they want to act, \nthey have to give notice, have a hearing, and propose a penalty.\n  They do not have authority under this amendment--and I underline \nthis--they do not have authority to issue a compliance order. They \ncannot say: Do this. All they can do is penalize for failing to comply, \nand they can impose a penalty. The penalty is then submitted to FERC, \nwhich reviews it and may modify, affirm, or set aside the electric \nreliability organization's action.\n  That is, they have that authority unless the electric reliability \norganization has already delegated its authority to a regional entity. \nIf there is a regional entity with a delegated enforcement authority, \nthen they have first dibs at dealing with this issue.\n  If the regional entity disagrees with the electric reliability \norganization, it may not have the authority to file an enforcement \naction with FERC. But that action needs to be filed by the regional \nentity, so that the electric reliability organization is essentially \ndisplaced from its authority and the authority then has to be exercised \nby the regional entity at that point. Whether the electric reliability \norganization then files with FERC--exactly what happens in that \ncircumstance is not very clear.\n  This may seem confusing. To me it is confusing. I have heard other \nbills over the course of the time in the Senate referred to as the \nlawyer's full employment act of 19 whatever. This is the Lawyer's Full \nEmployment Act of 2002, particularly the Utility Lawyer's Full \nEmployment Act of 2002.\n  I hope that if a participant in a market is acting in some manner \nthat is not in compliance with reliability rules, some action can be \ntaken to change that behavior quickly. That is in everyone's interest. \nThat is what we were trying to do when we proposed language to \nessentially say, OK, FERC, you are responsible for being sure the \nreliability is guaranteed in the system.\n  With this structure that is proposed in this amendment, the complaint \nhas come to the ERO, to this electric reliability organization. They \nhave to have time for notice. They have to have a hearing. They, then, \ncan impose a penalty. They cannot issue a compliance order. Then their \nproposal needs to be filed with FERC for further review and further \naction.\n  So the real question is, Will the lights still be on? Will the \nelectricity still be flowing? How long does this take before a \ncompliance order can be issued to stop the action that is threatening \nthe reliability of the system? Is it going to take weeks? Is it going \nto take months? Is it going to take years?\n  This amendment requires FERC to establish regional advisory councils \non the petition of at least two-thirds of the States in the region. \nThis is a good idea. This is a part of the amendment I think is a good \nidea. I am not sure as much process needs to be specified as the \namendment does, but the general idea is one that I certainly support. \nIf this were the amendment being offered, we would gladly accept that \namendment.\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\n  I think, though, the amendment that is offered and the way it is \nworded gives most States less deference than the language in our bill \ndoes. Our bill would allow FERC to defer to NERC, to defer to a \nregional council, to a similar organization, or to a State regulatory \nauthority. In other words, if States create a regional advisory \ncouncil, FERC clearly can defer to that under the legislation that we \nproposed.\n  The language we have before us in this amendment would allow FERC to \ndefer only to a regional advisory body if it is organized on an \ninterconnection-wide basis.\n  So, again, we have this map. I will put the map up again to reiterate \nthe point.\n  This amendment was put together by the Western Governors' \nAssociation. I understand that. That is the part of the country in \nwhich I live. I know that is the part of the country in which my \ncolleagues who are proposing the amendment live. But in each case, the \npreference under the amendment goes to this part of the country. The \ndeference goes to another part of the country.\n  I do not really think that is the right way to make national policy. \nI think we ought to have a uniform national policy. The whole idea is \nto set up a system that will work everywhere.\n  I will summarize my objections. I know my colleague from Oregon is \nanxious to speak in favor of the amendment. I will summarize some of my \nother views, and then I will defer to him.\n  In general, the proposal of the Western Governors' Association \nspecifies matters that I believe are better left to experts to sort \nout. The proposal we have in the bill would allow FERC to approve a \nreliability organization that fits this description to defer to \nregional entities or to the electric reliability organization, but it \ndoes not require it. Our language does not contain all of these \nrebuttable presumptions.\n  When I first read through this, I thought to myself: Why in the world \nare we putting in all these rebuttable presumptions? A rebuttable \npresumption is essentially a burden of proof, a standard of proof, that \nis put in in order to be in a position that later on someone can review \nthat, when it is appealed, to see whether the standard was met, whether \nor not the burden of proof was met.\n  I shudder to think of the number of appeals that will be taken from \ndecisions by one or another of these entities on the basis that the \npresumption, which we are being asked to write into law, was not \nadequately rebutted. I do not really know why we see it in our \ninterest, why it would be in the national interest, for us to write \ninto law all sorts of rebuttable presumptions which then complicate the \nsituation and invite appeal from whatever decision is made. We have \nsome real interest in seeing some finality brought to these decisions \nif we are going to have a reliable system.\n\n  I think the requirement that FERC only be able to remand standards \nthat it finds not to be just and reasonable eliminates flexibility that \nFERC may well need to have. This interconnection-wide presumption \nessentially says, if one happens to be in this pink area of the \ncountry, they are in this interconnection-wide area, and therefore all \nthese rebuttable presumptions apply. And what they say gets particular \ndeference.\n  I do not, quite frankly, understand, and we are still trying to \neducate people on this amendment, but I cannot understand why Governors \nof these other States--there are a lot of States that are not in this \npink area. I do not know why Governors in these other States and \ncommissioners in these other States would support this proposal. It \ngives them far fewer rights than the Governors and the commissioners in \nthe West have. So I have some concerns about it.\n  I will mention one other concern, and then I will defer to my \ncolleague, who is anxious to speak. As chairman of the Energy \nCommittee, we have had several hearings so far this last year where we \nbring in the FERC Commissioners and we basically try to cross-examine \nthem and ask them why they have not done this and why they have not \ndone that and why they are not living up to their responsibilities in \nthis regard. We had a bunch of those hearings when the lights were \ngoing out in California.\n  If we pass this amendment, my firm belief is next time the lights go \nout somewhere, and we bring those Commissioners before the committee \nand say, now, why were you not carrying out your responsibility, they \nhave a ready answer. Their answer will be: We were carrying out our \nresponsibility. You told us our responsibility was to presume these \nfolks knew what they were doing, and we have been presuming it, and now \nit turns out they did not know what they were doing. So do not \ncriticize us. You are putting the responsibility somewhere else. You \ntold us there is a rebuttable presumption that they know exactly what \nthey are doing and they can handle all of this.\n  So we were trying to get out of that. We were trying to say: Look, \nlet us fix responsibility in the hands of a group that the President \nappoints and that we confirm and then encourage them to delegate that \nas they say fit, but not give them the out of saying they are not \nresponsible; that it was someone else's job and it was not theirs.\n  I very much fear this amendment, if adopted, will give them a very \nconvenient out. We will then be having long, complicated hearings going \nthrough charts about whose rebuttable presumption was met and whose \nrebuttable presumption was rebutted, and that is not going to be good \nfor the country. It is not going to keep the electricity going. It is \nnot going to keep the lights on.\n  For those reasons, I urge that my colleagues oppose the amendment and \nkeep the bill as it is, which is much simpler, which is much more \nstraightforward and which does not get into all kinds of complexities \nwhich will be contrary to our national interest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank our chairman for his \nstatement. I rise, though, in opposition to his view, and I support the \nview of the Senator of Wyoming and his amendment. I happen to be a \ncosponsor of it.\n  I think for people looking in, the C-SPAN junkies like ourselves, may \nwonder what all the charts and all the maps and all the rhetoric might \nboil down to. In my view, it really boils down to this: Should all \npower over power be vested within the beltway or should we trust \nregional organizations that know their areas, that know their systems, \nto manage these systems? That, in my view, is what this debate is all \nabout.\n  It is very important. There are great implications for how we \nreliably transmit energy and keep the lights on in the regions of this \ncountry.\n  This amendment would ensure that a self-regulating organization would \nbe given the authority to establish and enforce reliability \nstandards. This amendment is supported by the Western Governors' \nAssociation, the American Public Power Association, and most of the \ntransmitting utilities of the West.\n\n  For those in the West who lived through the blackout of August 10, \n1996, the need for an enforcement mechanism for transmission \nreliability standards is clear. That blackout, which literally \nstretched from Texas to Portland to Los Angeles, was the result of a \nseries of seemingly independent events that sent the western \ntransmission system cascading into a blackout. The ensuing blackout \ncovered parts of seven Western States and caused severe economic \ndisruption on the west coast. The event caused the Western Systems \nCoordinating Council to reevaluate its notification procedures. Such an \nevent has not been repeated since.\n  The only thing that regional transmission reliability organizations \nlack is an enforcement mechanism. That is what we provide in this \namendment.\n  To date, we have relied upon voluntary compliance by transmitting \nutilities to keep the lights on. While such voluntary compliance has \nbeen largely successful, there are growing concerns that such voluntary \nmeans may not work in a deregulated wholesale electricity market. \nFrankly, if we are going to move away from a voluntary system, I would \nmuch rather give the enforcement authority envisioned under this bill \nto established regional organizations that are well respected and know \nthe intricacies of the systems which they regulate.\n\n[[Page S1878]]\n\n  This approach is embodied in the amendment before the Senate today. I \nthank Senator Thomas for offering this commonsense solution to \ntransmission reliability. Our chairman's approach, again, moves all \nenforcement authority to Washington, DC, under FERC's jurisdiction. We \ndo not need to vest this authority with FERC, which has no history on \nthis issue and, in my view, no technical expertise on standards for \ntransmission systems.\n  The amendment before the Senate mirrors in spirit, if not in detail, \nthe reliability legislation which was reported out of the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee in the 106th Congress and was passed by \nthe full Senate. I introduced this legislation at the beginning of this \nCongress, and I urge my colleagues to follow the action of this body in \nthe last Congress. We do not need to change that. What was offered \nthen, what is offered today, is the right fix for transmission \nreliability.\n  In conclusion, I reference a letter by the Canadian Ambassador to \nSenator Daschle dated March 13, 2002. I ask unanimous consent the \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             Canadian Embassy,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2002.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I wrote to you on November 2, 2001, \n     to express concern that certain legislative proposals \n     regarding electricity reliability could have a negative \n     impact on Canada-U.S. electricity trade. I also met with \n     Senator Bingaman to discuss this issue in early January 2002.\n       These problematic proposals have now found their way into \n     the new Energy Policy Act of 2002 (S. 517). The electricity \n     reliability section would vest the U.S. Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC) with the authority to establish \n     and enforce mandatory reliability standards for the \n     electricity grid.\n       The approach taken in S. 517 could impede our strong cross-\n     border electricity trade. While this bill suggests some \n     cooperation with Canadian utilities, it does not provide for \n     meaningful coordination between regulators in the United \n     States and Canada. As I explained in my earlier letter, \n     different jurisdictions could develop and enforce different \n     standards in the absence of such meaningful coordination: \n     this could lead to variations in reliability standards which \n     could impede trade. Consistent standards are required for the \n     interconnected North American grid.\n       An essential tool for managing the reliability of the \n     interconnected grid is the remand function, which is key for \n     ensuring consistent standards and respect for the \n     jurisdiction of sovereign regulatory bodies. This function \n     would allow regulatory bodies to return any standards that \n     are not approved to the reliability organization for \n     reconsideration. In this manner, the reliability organization \n     can work with all relevant regulatory bodies to avoid \n     inconsistent standards. A remand function therefore provides \n     meaningful recognition that U.S. and Canadian regulators \n     share an important role in establishing and enforcing \n     standards in the interconnected grid.\n       Canada's position is that a self-regulating reliability \n     organization, with members representing both countries, would \n     be best placed to develop, implement and enforce consistent \n     reliability standards for the interconnected North American \n     electricity grid, while respecting the jurisdiction of \n     sovereign regulatory bodies. I understand that a similar \n     position is supported by the Western Governors Association \n     and by major electricity associations.\n       The approach in S. 517 will not provide for the effective \n     management of reliability standards for the interconnected \n     North American electricity grid. I urge you to give strong \n     consideration to our shared interest in an increasingly \n     integrated North American market and to our mutually \n     beneficial electricity trade.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                   Michael Kergin,\n                                                       Ambassador.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I note a few of the words in particular. He \nexpressed to Senator Daschle a concern that this legislation would \n``have a negative impact on Canadian-U.S. electricity trade.''\n  I can say in the California debacle last year, but for Canadian \npower, it would have been far worse than it ended up being. Anything we \nare doing that could disrupt the trade we have with Canada on energy \nwould be a step back, not a step forward. That is why the Canadian \nGovernment has notified the Senate leadership that the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Wyoming is the right thing to do. The \nunderlying proposal is the wrong thing to do in terms of our \nrelationship with Canada.\n  I urge support for the Thomas amendment. It is the amendment we \npassed in the Senate in the 106th Congress. We ought to pass it again \nin the 107th Congress as part of this important energy regulation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator from Oregon for his insight. I cannot \nthink, frankly, of anyone in the whole country who has had more \nexperience in this than the people on the west coast connected to the \nCalifornia project. I appreciate very much the Senator's thoughts.\n  This bill has come to the Senate without the committee being \ninvolved. This very bill was passed by the committee last year with no \nobjection from the Senator from New Mexico. This went through the \ncommittee, although what is before the Senate now was never talked \nabout in the committee. That is a procedural question we have discussed \nquite a bit.\n  Now I will discuss some of the objections. There are two points of \nview, very clearly. The Senator from Oregon said it very well: To whom \nare you going to look?\n  I have been involved in this business in the past. The people in the \nbusiness, the people who are responsible in your State, the people who \nhave joined together in a region, have a much better view than bringing \nit back to the beltway for these decisions. That is the bottom line.\n  It is a complicated business. However, in the current underlying \nbill, practically anyone can go to FERC. It is not uncomplicated there. \nThe bill we are discussing gives FERC responsibility to defer to other \norganizations. FERC need not defer to anyone on anything if they choose \nnot to. It is given sweeping new authority to preempt the judgments of \nexisting State and national organizations with respect to the \navailability for transmission systems to supply the demand. That is \nwhere we are with the amendment.\n  The amendment builds on an existing system. If you go to FERC, there \nis nothing to build on. Here, there is. Go to FERC: There are no people \nwho have the expertise to do these things. In the existing system, \nthere are.\n  It does not require a new bureaucracy which would come about under \nthe existing bill. Bulk power system reliability will continue to be \nmanaged outside of FERC's hearing rooms unless a problem arises. Then, \nof course, we can invoke FERC's intervention. That is the way it is \ndesigned to be, to start at the grassroots, do the decisionmaking \nthere, and still have the opportunity to go to FERC through the \nnetwork. That is not strange and unusual. That is why we have States. \nThat is why we have local government.\n  The amendment in the existing bill, under the Daschle bill, requires \nFERC to create a reliability structure. Ours does not. FERC need only \napprove reliability organizations that meet the requirements specified. \nS. 517 requires FERC to create a new reliability bureaucracy to take \nover the function that FERC now does not have the expertise to \nperform--where, indeed, we have expertise now.\n  Cumbersome? We talked about it being cumbersome. Nothing in the \namendment makes it cumbersome. FERC can entertain a complaint at any \ntime, move as quickly as it deems warranted. I do not think you can ask \nfor much more than that.\n  We talked about only one part of this country when this was created. \nThe interconnect-wide entity exists in Texas. Whether an eastern-wide \nentity is created is up to the East. It has been done in the West \nbecause there are unique problems there. These problems can be solved \nbetter by an interconnect and will be done throughout the rest of the \ncountry as well. This is what we are seeking to do.\n  The complaint here is the structure is so complicated as to render it \nunworkable. Actually, the structure reflects the way the reliability \nhas been managed by the North American bulk power system--rather \nsuccessfully, as a matter of fact--and the legislation is needed to \nensure that reliability experts who are not at FERC can take the \nactions necessary to protect the grid. That is what it is all about. We \nhave people, and it has been successful. Certainly we need to build on \nthat. It becomes more important as we go.\n\n[[Page S1879]]\n\n  It would be ironic for the industry to come to consensus on how to \ndeal with these issues. There is no industry consensus on how to \nstructure the relationship. That is why the arrangement is there. The \nbulk of the industry agrees they should continue with separate \norganizations that focus solely on reliability. That organization \nshould coordinate closely with whatever organization devises the \nbusiness practices. Because FERC has the ultimate oversight for \nreliability and whatever business standard is ultimately approved, FERC \ncan assure the necessary coordination exists.\n  That is really what it is all about. Out there, there are people who \nhave done this. We know how to do it. We have evidence of that. But \nwhat we have not had is the opportunity for someone to really have the \nauthority to do that. So this is what this does, giving that to FERC.\n  You can argue if you want to, and I understand that and I hope \nMembers understand, if you like having the Federal Government do it \nfrom here, that is what you ought to do. If you like working with your \nown public service commission--and by the way, the national public \nservice commissions have supported this amendment. Talk about being \njust a regional thing, the national public service commissions support \nthis amendment.\n  I think we will have some more Senators over here to speak shortly. I \nthink we ought to continue to delve into how we can best serve the \nAmerican people with electric reliability, whether we transfer that to \nan agency that does not have the expertise or whether we try to use \nwhat is in place to make it more efficient.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Campbell of Colorado as a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, at this point I want to refer to and \nthen have printed in the Record a few letters that support the \nunderlying provision that we have in the bill on reliability and oppose \nthe Thomas amendment. I have five. Let me go through each of them and \nindicate what they are and what they say.\n  This first one is a letter from the Mid-Atlantic Area Council, the \nregional reliability council for this area of the country. It is \nlocated in Norristown, PA. It is directed to me. It is dated March 13. \nIt says:\n\n       The Mid-Atlantic Area Council--\n\n  MAAC is the acronym. We always like acronyms here in Washington--\n\n     would like to express its support for the reliability \n     provisions in section 207 of your amendment in the nature of \n     a substitute to S. 517.\n\n  They are supporting the underlying bill, not the amendment by the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n\n       MAAC appreciates your continued efforts to promote \n     legislation that increases our energy supply and advances the \n     effort to establish wholesale electricity markets in the \n     United States.\n       It is our understanding that the North American Electric \n     Reliability Council (NERC) and the Western Governors' \n     Association are seeking to strike your language in order to \n     substitute an amendment they drafted. This amendment is based \n     upon the now very stale NERC reliability proposal developed \n     over three years ago. The subsequent convergence of \n     reliability and market issues has rendered this language \n     obsolete, and we urge you to oppose the amendment.\n       MAAC recognizes the need for mandatory reliability \n     standards that are broadly applicable to the wholesale power \n     industry. However, the language in the amendment will limit \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's--FERC--and the \n     industry's ability to properly restructure the wholesale \n     transmission system which is essential for reliable, \n     efficient and well-functioning markets. As currently drafted, \n     the amendment removes most aspects of standards development \n     and enforcement from FERC and grants sweeping powers to a new \n     electric reliability organization, likely to be NERC.\n       The amendment largely ignores the important role that \n     regional transmission organizations--RTOs--will play in \n     reliability and market management and appears to assume that \n     assuring real-time reliability is purely an engineering \n     function with no significant economic content or effect on \n     markets, while your language would permit FERC to recognize \n     the interplay between reliability and markets and allow RTO-\n     administered market mechanisms to preserve and foster \n     reliability.\n       Furthermore, a December, 2001 FERC Order commenced a broad \n     industry collaborative effort to arrive at a consensus on how \n     to best merge NERC's activities into the standard setting \n     process of the new North American Energy Standards Board--\n     NAESB, formerly Gas Industry Standards Board. The industry \n     will make a filing to FERC by March 15. This amendment could \n     derail the efforts supported by a large number to \n     stakeholders to establish NAESB as the standards developer \n     best able to accommodate NERC and commercial concerns.\n       Your reliability language is compatible with recent efforts \n     by the industry to develop a new and innovative approach to \n     standards setting. The amendment would stifle industry \n     efforts to forge a standards setting process that is in the \n     best interest of America. Unlike the amendment [the Thomas \n     amendment], your language does not set into law a complex and \n     burdensome set of rules and processes which would institute a \n     command and control system of enforcement ignoring was that \n     market forces could enhance reliability. The language of the \n     amendment, if substituted for your language, would result in \n     a major setback of the efforts to reduce power costs through \n     innovation and market forces.\n       MAAC urges that you strenuously oppose the changes to your \n     reliability provision, and offers our assistance to you as \n     the Senate considers this important legislation.\n\n  The States that are covered by MAAC are Pennsylvania, New Jersey, \nDelaware, Maryland, and Virginia. That is an indication at least that \nsome States are not totally enthusiastic about this amendment Senator \nThomas is proposing.\n  Next, I refer to a letter we have received, also directed to me, \ndated March 13, from the Electric Consumers Resource Council--ELCON. \nThis is the national association representing large industrial users of \nelectricity. They indicate in their letter they were established in \n1976, their member companies have long supported policies furthering \ncompetition in wholesale and retail electric markets, and their members \noperate in every State in the Union.\n  I will quote a couple of sentences out of their letter:\n\n       We are obviously following the Senate debate on S. 517 very \n     closely. One provision that might be overlooked is the issue \n     labeled ``reliability.'' By way of background, ELCON was part \n     of the original group working on this issue with the North \n     American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) to develop then-\n     consensus language roughly four years ago. We have continued \n     to work with NERC and with the Gas Industry Standards Board \n     (GISB), now the North American Energy Standards Board \n     (NAESB), to develop a structure for an organization to \n     develop reliability standards for our interstate electricity \n     grid and the impact of those standards on commercial \n     activity.\n       Since our members operate throughout the Nation, we \n     strongly believe that rules should be as consistent as \n     possible in every area. To do otherwise would balkanize the \n     grid and hinder competition. For that reason we find the \n     proposal now being promoted by NERC (and supported by several \n     groups including the Western Governors Association) to be \n     counterproductive. Granting deference to any region, even if \n     that region constitutes an entire interconnection, invites \n     conflict with other regions. By diminishing the authority of \n     the national standard-setting organization, we are less \n     likely, not more likely, to have an effective and fully \n     functioning wholesale market.\n       We hope that these views are helpful to you in your \n     deliberations.\n\n  I will go next to the PJM Interconnection. It is the Pennsylvania-New \nJersey-Maryland interconnection. This, again, is a letter dated the \nsame date, March 13, to me, by Phillip Harris. He is the president and \nCEO of PJM. He says:\n\n       I am writing to express our support for electricity title, \n     Title II, of Senator Bingaman's energy legislation, S. 517. \n     We believe Title II will serve to fundamentally improve \n     electricity markets in North America and urge your support of \n     it.\n\n  Then, going down the letter, it says:\n\n       In the PJM region, we have been able to work successfully \n     with States and local governments to ensure that electricity \n     markets and the grid work in a way that meets the needs of \n     wholesale and retail electric customers, while improving \n     regional reliability. We are pleased that section 207 of \n     Title II contains simplified reliability legislation that \n     places reliability authority directly with the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission and enables it to objectively defer to \n     regional solutions without preference. We urge you to reject \n     any attempts by Senators from other regions to impose \n     alternative legislation that would significantly blur or \n     weaken the government accountability over reliability found \n     in Section 207 or impose improper restrictions on FERC's \n     authority over Regional Transmission Organizations. The \n     substance of the reliability amendment runs counter to an \n     ongoing industry effort to reconcile business and reliability \n     concerns.\n\n  As I said, that was signed by Phillip Harris, the president and chief \nexecutive officer for PJM.\n  Next, I will refer to a letter dated March 14, 2002, from Elizabeth \nMoler,\n\n[[Page S1880]]\n\nwho is representing Exelon, Commonwealth Edison of Chicago, and PECO \nEnergy in Pennsylvania.\n  She says:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to share Exelon \n     Corporation's views on the Sen. Thomas' proposed reliability \n     amendment to S. 517, the pending energy bill.\n       Exelon Corporation is one of the nation's largest electric \n     utilities. Our major subsidiaries are Commonwealth Edison, \n     the public utility that serves Chicago; PECO Energy, the \n     public utility that serves the Philadelphia area, and Exelon \n     Generation. We have roughly five million retail customers \n     in Illinois and Pennsylvania, which have both restructured \n     their electricity markets. Exelon owns 22.5 gigawatts of \n     generation (including nuclear, coal-fired, gas-fired, gas-\n     oil fired, pumped storage and run-of-river hydro units) \n     and controls an additional 15 gigawatts of capacity. We \n     have additional capacity under development.\n\n  Then the letter goes on and says:\n\n       Exelon opposes the Thomas amendment, principally because we \n     believe it would interfere with the development of \n     competitive wholesale markets. As the United States Supreme \n     Court recognized just last week in reviewing FERC Order No. \n     888, electricity markets are fundamentally interstate in \n     nature. The Thomas amendment seeks to deny this fact, by \n     encouraging individual states or regions to development \n     unique reliability standards. We believe that the Nation \n     needs uniform, national reliability standards. The rules \n     should not vary from region to region. National reliability \n     guidelines and standards will facilitate the development of \n     more seamless electricity markets and encourage much-needed \n     investment in both generation and transmission. We believe \n     that the Thomas amendment would further balkanize electricity \n     markets, rather than facilitating development of a national \n     electricity marketplace.\n\n  That is a quotation out of that letter from Exelon.\n  The final letter I wish to refer to is the one from the Electric \nPower Supply Association. Quoting their letter:\n\n       The Electric Power Supply Association would like to affirm \n     our support for the reliability provision in Section 207 of \n     your amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 517. We \n     appreciate your continued efforts to promote legislation that \n     increases our energy supply and advances the effort to \n     establish wholesale electricity markets in the United States.\n       It has come to our attention that efforts are being made to \n     strike your language in order to substitute an amendment \n     supported by the North American Electric Reliability Council \n     and the Western Governors' Association. This amendment is \n     based upon the NERC reliability proposal development over \n     three years ago. However, the subsequent convergence of \n     reliability and market issues has rendered this language \n     obsolete, and we urge you to oppose the amendment.\n       The Electric Power Supply Association endorses the need for \n     mandatory reliability standards that are broadly applicable \n     to the wholesale power industry. However, the language in the \n     amendment could limit the industry's ability to address the \n     challenges presented by the ongoing development and \n     restructuring of the wholesale transmission system which is \n     essential for reliable, efficient and well-functioning \n     markets. As currently drafted, the amendment shifts \n     significant aspects of standards development and enforcement \n     away from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to a new \n     electric reliability organization. The text also does little \n     to reflect the role that will need to be played by regional \n     transmission organizations in future market management.\n       This amendment would prevent FERC from carrying out its \n     responsibility to ensure the reliable and efficient operation \n     of the transmission grid and would hinder the development of \n     effective RTOs. Energy standards have an inevitable impact on \n     bulk power transmission systems and market operation \n     essential for reliability. Accordingly, the standard setting \n     process outlined in the amendment raises serious concerns \n     that failing to centralize this activity with FERC could lead \n     to confusion and conflicts among multiple entities.\n       Further, the amendment fails to account for recent industry \n     efforts to rethink the nature, scope and organizational \n     structure for a new standard setting process that recognizes \n     the need to integrate reliability and market practices. The \n     industry, spurred by a December, 2001 FERC Order and \n     encouraged by the U.S. Department of Energy, is currently \n     engaged in a broad collaborative effort to consider how to \n     combine NERC's activities with standard setting that will be \n     done by the new North American Energy Standards Board, that \n     the Gas Industry Standards Board approved in December of \n     2001. The industry will make a filing to FERC by March 15. \n     This amendment [the Thomas amendment] could preempt the more \n     extensive consolidation of NERC into NEASB that is supported \n     by many industry stakeholders.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters in their \nentirety be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Mid-Atlantic Area Council,\n\n                                   Norristown, PA, March 13, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman: The Mid-Atlantic Area Council \n     (``MAAC,'' a NERC regional reliability council covering all \n     or part of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, \n     Virginia, and the District of Columbia) would like to express \n     its support for the reliability provision in Section 207 of \n     your amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 517. MAAC \n     appreciates your continued efforts to promote legislation \n     that increases our energy supply and advances the effort to \n     establish wholesale electricity markets in the United States.\n       It is our understanding that the North American Electric \n     Reliability Council (NERC) and the Western Governors' \n     Association are seeking to strike your language in order to \n     substitute an amendment they drafted.

The industry \n     will make a filing to FERC by March 15. This amendment could \n     derail the efforts supported by a large number to \n     stakeholders to establish NAESB as the standards developer \n     best able accommodate NERC and commercial concerns.\n       Your reliability language is compatible with recent efforts \n     by the industry to develop a new and innovative approach to \n     standards setting. The amendment would stifle industry \n     efforts to forge a standards setting process that is in the \n     best interest of America. Unlike the amendment, your language \n     does not set into law a complex and burdensome set of rules \n     and processes which would institute a command and control \n     system of enforcement ignoring ways that market forces could \n     enhance reliability. The language of the amendment, if \n     substituted for your language, would result in a major \n     setback of the efforts to reduce power costs through \n     innovation and market forces.\n       MAAC urges that you strenuously oppose the changes to your \n     reliability provision, and offers our assistance to you as \n     the Senate considers this important legislation. Please \n     contact us with any questions or requests for additional \n     information.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  P.R.H. Landrieu,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                        ELCON,\n\n                                                   March 13, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Electricity Consumers Resource \n     Council (ELCON) is the national association representing \n     large industrial users of electricity. We were established in \n     1976 and our member companies have long supported policies \n     furthering competition in wholesale and retail electricity \n     markets. Our members operate in every State.\n       We are obviously following the Senate debate on S. 517 very \n     closely. One provision that might be overlooked is the issued \n     labeled ``reliability.'' By way of background, ELCON was part \n     of the original group working on this issue with the North \n     American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) to develop then-\n     consensus language roughly four years ago. We have continued \n     to work with NERC and with the Gas Industry Standards Board \n     (GISB), now the North American Energy Standards Board \n     (NAESB), to develop a structure for an organization to \n     develop reliability standards for our interstate electricity \n     grid and the impact of those standards on commercial \n     activity.\n       Since our members operate throughout the Nation, we \n     strongly believe that rules should be as consistent as \n     possible in every area. To do otherwise would balkanize the \n     grid and hinder competition. For that reason we find the \n     proposal now being promoted by NERC (and supported by several \n     groups including\n\n[[Page S1881]]\n\n     the Western Governors Association) to be counterproductive. \n     Granting deference to any region, even if that region \n     constitutes an entire interconnection, invites conflict with \n     other regions. By diminishing the authority of the national \n     standard-setting organization, we are less likely, not more \n     likely, to have an effective and fully functioning wholesale \n     market.\n       We hope that these views are helpful to you in your \n     deliberations. Please feel free to call on us for additional \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n     John A. Anderson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          PJM Interconnection,\n\n                                                   March 13, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I am writing to express our support \n     for electricity title (Title II) of Senator Bingaman's energy \n     legislation (S. 517). We believe Title II will serve to \n     fundamentally improve electricity markets in North America \n     and urge your support of it. We also urge you to resist any \n     amendments that would weaken important provisions associated \n     with reliability of the electric grid or the authority of the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to oversee the \n     operation of electricity markets.\n       PJM operates the largest competitive wholesale electricity \n     market in the world. We maintain reliability of the electric \n     transmission grid and also operate a successful spot market \n     for electricity in a five state region, which includes all or \n     a portion of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, \n     Virginia, and the District of Columbia. We are awaiting final \n     FERC approval of PJM West which will expand the market to \n     include significant parts of Ohio and West Virginia. PJM has \n     been recognized as a deregulation success story.\n       In the PJM region, we have been able to work successfully \n     with States and local governments to ensure that electricity \n     markets and the grid work in a way that meets the needs of \n     wholesale and retail electric customers, while improving \n     regional reliability. We are pleased that Section 207 of \n     Title II contains simplified reliability legislation that \n     places reliability authority directly with the FERC and \n     enables it to objectively defer to regional solutions without \n     preference. We urge you to reject any attempts by Senators \n     from other regions to impose alternative legislation that \n     would significantly blur or weaken the government \n     accountability over reliability found in Section 207 or \n     impose improper restrictions on FERC's authority over \n     Regional Transmission Organizations. The substance of the \n     reliability amendment runs counter to an ongoing industry \n     effort to reconcile business and reliability concerns. I have \n     attached talking points and a comparison chart in furtherance \n     of our position.\n       As this debate unfolds, many important issues will arise. I \n     have instructed my Washington staff to be available to meet \n     your needs and respond promptly to question about the effect \n     of various electricity issue legislative provisions on your \n     State. If we learn of any harmful electricity amendments, we \n     will alert your office as soon as possible. Please feel free \n     to call Craig Glazer, PJM's Manager of Regulatory Affairs in \n     Washington at 202-393-7756 or Robert Lamb of Wright & \n     Talisman at 202-393-1200.\n       We look forward to working with you and meeting the needs \n     of the millions of citizens you so ably represent in the \n     United States Senate.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Phillip G. Harris,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to share Exelon \n     Corporation's views on the Sen. Thomas' proposed reliability \n     amendment to S. 517, the pending energy bill.\n       Exelon Corporation is one of the nation's largest electric \n     utilities. Our major subsidiaries are Commonwealth Edison, \n     the public utility that serves Chicago; PECO Energy, the \n     public utility that serves the Philadelphia area, and Exelon \n     Generation. We have roughly five million retail customers in \n     Illinois and Pennsylvania, which have both restructured their \n     electricity markets. Exelon owns 22.5 gigawatts of generation \n     (including nuclear, coal-fired, gas-fired gas-oil fired, \n     pumped storage and run-of-river hydro units) and controls an \n     additional 15 gigawatts of capacity. We have additional \n     capacity under development. Exelon's PowerTeam is one of the \n     largest power marketers in North America; we market power \n     nationally 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n       Exelon opposes the Thomas amendment, principally because we \n     believe it would interfere with the development of \n     competitive wholesale markets. As the United States Supreme \n     Court recognized just last week in reviewing FERC Order No. \n     888, electricity markets are fundamentally interstate in \n     nature. The Thomas amendment seeks to deny this fact, by \n     encouraging individual states or regions to develop unique \n     reliability standards. We believe that the Nation needs \n     uniform, national reliability standards. The rules should not \n     vary from region to region. National reliability guidelines \n     and standards will facilitate the development of more \n     seamless electricity markets and encourage much-needed \n     investment in both generation and transmission. We believe \n     that the Thomas amendment would further balkanize electricity \n     markets, rather than facilitating development of a national \n     electricity marketplace.\n       We appreciate the leadership that you and Sen. Murkowski \n     have shown on electricity issues. The bipartisan electricity \n     amendment adopted unanimously yesterday by the United States \n     Senate is a giant step toward enactment of much-needed \n     legislation to reform the laws that govern our industry. We \n     look foward to continuing to work with you in the days and \n     weeks ahead in support of enacting a comprehensive national \n     energy policy that will enable us to continue to provide our \n     customers reliable service at reasonable prices.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n       With best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n     Elizabeth A. Moler.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         EPSA,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman: The Electric Power Supply \n     Association (EPSA) would like to affirm our support for the \n     reliability provision in Section 207 of your amendment in the \n     nature of a substitute to S. 517. We appreciate your \n     continued efforts to promote legislation that increases our \n     energy supply and advances the effort to establish wholesale \n     electricity markets in the United States.\n       It has come to our attention that efforts are being made to \n     strike your language in order to substitute an amendment \n     supported by the North American Electric Reliability Council \n     (NERC) and the Western Governors' Association. This amendment \n     is based upon the NERC reliability proposal developed over \n     three years ago. However, the subsequent convergence of \n     reliability and market issues has rendered this language \n     obsolete, and we urge you to oppose the amendment.\n       EPSA endorses the need for mandatory reliability standards \n     that are broadly applicable to the wholesale power industry. \n     However, the language in the amendment could limit the \n     industry's ability to address the challenges presented by the \n     ongoing development and restructuring of the wholesale \n     transmission system which is essential for reliable, \n     efficient and well-functioning markets. As currently drafted, \n     the amendment shifts significant aspects of standards \n     development and enforcement away from the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission (FERC) to a new electric reliability \n     organization. The text also does little to reflect the role \n     that will need to be played by regional transmission \n     organizations (RTOs) in future market management.\n       This amendment would prevent FERC from carrying out its \n     responsibility to ensure the reliable and efficient operation \n     of the transmission grid and would hinder the development of \n     effective RTOs. Energy standards have an inevitable impact on \n     bulk power transmission systems and market operation \n     essential for reliability. Accordingly, the standard setting \n     process outlined in the amendment raises serious concerns \n     that failing to centralize this activity with FERC could lead \n     to confusion and conflicts among multiple entities.\n       Further, the amendment fails to account for recent industry \n     efforts to rethink the nature, scope and organizational \n     structure for a new standard setting process that recognizes \n     the need to integrate reliability and market practices. The \n     industry, spurred by a December, 2001 FERC Order and \n     encouraged by the U.S. Department of Energy, is currently \n     engaged in a broad collaborative effort to consider how to \n     combine NERC's activities with standard setting that will be \n     done by the new North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) \n     that the Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB) approved in \n     December of 2001. The industry will make a filing to FERC by \n     March 15. This amendment could preempt the more extensive \n     consolidation of NERC into NAESB that is supported by many \n     industry stakeholders.\n       The implications of these developments are clear: \n     legislation should not deny FERC or industry stakeholders the \n     opportunity to develop new approaches to energy standards \n     development. Your reliability language is compatible with \n     recent efforts by the industry to develop a new and \n     innovative approach to standards setting. Furthermore, your \n     language does not set into law a complex and burdensome set \n     of rules and processes which would hamper the development and \n     enforcement of standards. Replacing your language with the \n     amendment can only serve to delay the evolution of the energy \n     markets and threaten the reliable operation of the \n     transmission grid.\n       We urge you to fight efforts to make such changes to your \n     reliability provision, and we look forward to working with \n     you as the Senate considers this important legislation. \n     Please don't hesitate to contact us with further questions or \n     to request additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lynne H. Church,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will yield the floor. I see my \ncolleague from Massachusetts is prepared to speak. I will defer to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S1882]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak for 10 minutes as in morning business and that my remarks be \nprinted at the appropriate place in the Record and not interfere with \nthe debate on the energy bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kennedy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to address the pending amendment. \nThe Senator from New Mexico cited a number of the people supporting his \npart of the bill, several of whom were companies, of course. Maybe the \nfact that the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners \nsupports the amendment would be an interesting change. In terms of \nlooking out for the public's interest, I would guess that is more \nlikely to be the case--certainly the North American Electric \nReliability Council. Again, there are letters on each one's desk that \nthe administration supports this proposal. We are looking toward \ngetting together a balanced program.\n  A number of things have been mentioned that need to be talked about a \nlittle bit. The FERC industry standards board was mentioned as being an \nalternative. The fact is that is only a concept. Years of work will be \nneeded to make it happen. There is no consensus among industry \nstakeholders. More has developed in the West, and that is why this has \nsort of started there because these people were forced to come together \nand others will be as well.\n  I don't think it is time to jettison 30 years of experience in doing \nthis thing so that you can hand it over to a new bureaucracy that has \nneither the expertise nor, indeed, the background to take care of this \ntask.\n  It has been mentioned, but it is very true that we need to have an \nopportunity for whatever we put into place to deal also with uniformity \nin reliability with the United States, Mexico, and western Canada. That \nis very important, particularly to the Northwest, of course, as \nmentioned by the Senator from Oregon.\n  There is a need to move fairly quickly. I don't think there is much \ndoubt that the NERC process would be able to act much more quickly in \nconsensus building than FERC. The thing that it seems we always try to \npush aside is that FERC still has the final responsibility. That is \nprobably the way it ought to be.\n  The standard setting, we talked a little about that. I don't think \nthat system has to recognize the realities of the differences that do \nexist. The enforcement of standards is well defined and responsive to \ndifferences in interactions, and it has to be that way. There is no \ndefinition process that is going to emerge from the industry. Often \nthere are things going on here that just aren't actually the case on \nthe ground.\n  There was some suggestion that NERC's proposal was organized 3 years \nago and is now obsolete. There is nothing obsolete about the NERC \nproposal.\n  In fact, during this Western crisis of the last couple years, \nreliability standards was one of the few elements that worked well. So \nI think the evidence is that we have on the ground a group that is \ndeeply involved and has shown expertise, representing different parts \nof the country, the needs of different parts of the country--certainly \nwith the oversight that exists.\n  So the Bingaman approach--the Daschle bill--does not provide a role \nfor the States. There is no assurance of independence or any standard \nsetting. Therefore, we need to look at the concept of how we are doing \nthis. We are expecting a couple more Senators to come and speak \nmomentarily. In the meantime, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are in the process of preparing to \npropound a unanimous consent request. That should be done within the \nnext few minutes. We hope we can set up a vote at 2 o'clock this \nafternoon. Prior to that time, Senator Bingaman is planning to start \ndebate on renewable portfolio. Senator Jeffords is standing by to come \nat the appropriate time. It is my understanding that Senator Kyl will \nfollow with his amendment. We should be able to do that in the next few \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Thomas \namendment No. 3012 be set aside to recur at 2 p.m. today; that at 2 \np.m., the Senate vote in relation to the amendment, with no second-\ndegree amendments in order prior to the vote in relation to the Thomas \namendment; that Senators may speak until 2 p.m. today on the Thomas \namendment, notwithstanding its pendency; that Senator Dayton be \nrecognized to offer an amendment relating to gasohol; that after a \nperiod of debate, the amendment be set aside for consideration later \ntoday; that following that period of debate, Senator Bingaman be \nrecognized to offer an amendment relating to renewable portfolio \nstandards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will have a vote at 2 o'clock. Senator \nDayton is going to offer an amendment on his behalf and that of Senator \nGrassley. That debate will take just a few minutes. There are others \nwho want to speak on the amendment of Senator Thomas. They can do that \nuntil 2 o'clock.\n  In the meantime, Senator Bingaman is going to start the debate today \ndealing with renewable portfolio standards. A very important part of \nthe bill deals with renewables. He will offer his amendment and Senator \nJeffords will offer a second-degree amendment, I am told. I spoke with \nhis chief of staff. Following that, Senator Kyl will offer another \namendment dealing with renewables. This should take care of renewables \nonce and for all on this bill.\n  Once we get that done, there are some other amendments, but the big \none still left is that dealing with ANWR. We are eliminating a lot of \ncontentious matters on this bill.\n  Senators can be expected to come to the Chamber a number of times \nthis afternoon and evening regarding votes on renewable portfolio \nstandards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3008 to Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Thomas for his \nacquiescence.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senator \nGrassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton], for himself and \n     Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 3008 to \n     amendment No. 2917.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require that Federal agencies use ethanol-blended gasoline \n  and biodiesel-blended diesel fuel in areas in which ethanol-blended \n       gasoline and biodiesel-blended diesel fuel are available)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title VIII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 8____. FEDERAL AGENCY ETHANOL-BLENDED GASOLINE AND \n                   BIODIESEL PURCHASING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Title III of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 is amended by \n     striking section 306 (42 U.S.C. 13215) and inserting the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 306. FEDERAL AGENCY ETHANOL-BLENDED GASOLINE AND \n                   BIODIESEL PURCHASING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       ``(a) Ethanol-Blended Gasoline.--The head of each Federal \n     agency shall ensure that, in areas in which ethanol-blended \n     gasoline is available, the Federal agency purchases ethanol-\n     blended gasoline containing at least 10 percent ethanol (or \n     the highest available percentage of ethanol), rather than \n     nonethanol-blended gasoline, for use in vehicles used by the \n     agency.\n       ``(b) Biodiesel.--\n       ``(1) Definition of biodiesel.--In this subsection, the \n     term `biodiesel' has the meaning given the term in section \n     312(f).\n       ``(2) Requirement.--The head of each Federal agency shall \n     ensure that the Federal agency purchases, for use in fueling \n     fleet vehicles used by the Federal agency at the location at \n     which fleet vehicles of the Federal agency are centrally \n     fueled--\n       ``(A) as of the date that is 5 years after the date of \n     enactment of this paragraph, biodiesel-blended diesel fuel \n     that contains at least 2 percent biodiesel, rather than \n     nonbiodiesel-blended diesel fuel; and\n\n[[Page S1883]]\n\n       ``(B) as of the date that is 10 years after the date of \n     enactment of this paragraph, biodiesel-blended diesel fuel \n     that contains at least 20 percent biodiesel, rather than \n     nonbiodiesel-blended diesel fuel.''.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Nevada and New \nMexico for making the time available.\n  I am pleased to offer today, along with my very distinguished \ncolleague from our neighboring State of Iowa, Senator Grassley, an \namendment that will significantly increase the use of ethanol and soy \ndiesel fuels across our country.\n  Our amendment requires all Federal Government vehicles to use 10-\npercent ethanol-blended gasoline where it is available or whatever \nlesser percent of ethanol blend is available in that particular locale.\n  Our amendment also requires Federal vehicles which run on diesel fuel \nto use at least a 2-percent biodiesel blend or higher by the year 2007, \nand a 20-percent biodiesel blend by the year 2012.\n  If we want to improve our Nation's energy security, provide cleaner \nair, boost farm income, and strengthen many rural communities across \nthis country, increasing the use of ethanol and soy diesel is a golden \nopportunity. Both of these fuels have come into their own as better \nalternatives to blend with regular gasoline and diesel fuel than the \noil-based additives which currently predominate across the country.\n  Regular car and truck engines can use up to 10-percent ethanol with \nno modifications required, and centrally fueled trucks and other \nvehicles can similarly use up to 20-percent biodiesel blend even more \nefficiently and effectively than other diesel blends today. In fact, my \nMinnesota office leases a regular Chrysler minivan that travels all \nacross Minnesota burning fuel which is 85-percent ethanol. That van has \nhad no problems whatsoever in its performance and, fortunately, we have \nhad no problem finding this 85-percent ethanol throughout my State.\n  One of the reasons ethanol is so readily available in Minnesota is \nthat our State legislature had the foresight 7 years ago to pass a law \nrequiring that a 10-percent ethanol blend be available to all gas \nstations across the State. Just 3 days ago, the Minnesota Legislature \npassed a similar mandate which, if signed by the Governor, will require \nstations to provide a 2-percent blend of biodiesel fuel.\n  When people have positive experiences using these blends and then \nbecome confident they can obtain them wherever they travel, the usage \nof these alternative fuels sores.\n  By the end of this year, it is estimated that our country's ethanol \nproduction capacity will reach 2.7 billion gallons. If this amount of \nethanol were used in cars and trucks across our country, it would \ndisplace approximately 9 percent of all the foreign oil imported into \nour Nation this year.\n  Of all the measures being considered in this legislation and of all \nthe measures that are being discussed or implemented in America today, \nnothing can reduce our dependency on foreign oil or increase our \ndomestic energy production but ethanol and biodiesel fuels.\n  Increasing the use of these fuels is what I call the grand slam: No. \n1, it boosts the prices of corn and soybeans and other suitable crops \nin the marketplace and, thus, both raises farmers' incomes and reduces \ntaxpayers' subsidies; No. 2, it improves the local economies and \ncommunities throughout agricultural America; No. 3, it reduces U.S. \ndependence on foreign oil; and No. 4, it provides cleaner air.\n  The Federal Government ought to be leading the way in expanding these \nmarkets for these renewable fuels, but, unfortunately, the Federal \nfleet consumption of these fuels is currently only 2 percent, despite \nseveral Executive orders signed by President Clinton during his two \nterms. Thus, our amendment is essential to requiring that the 600,000 \nvehicles in the Federal fleet do their part in expanding the \nutilization of ethanol and soy diesel.\n\n  When I was commissioner of energy and economic development for the \nState of Minnesota back in the 1980s, ethanol was being produced and \ntouted as just this kind of alternative fuel blend for this Nation. \nUnfortunately, like so many other forms of alternative energy which \nhave been around for years or even decades, it has been sadly \nunderutilized.\n  I believe as a nation we are utilizing less than 5 percent of our \npotential for alternative sources of energy, energy conservation, and \nother economically and ecologically sound measures to improve our \nenergy security. We have been taking these small baby steps when we \ncould have and should have been progressing by leaps and bounds.\n  This energy bill is an opportunity we cannot afford to miss. Senator \nDaschle and Senator Bingaman have performed a great service to all of \nus and to our entire country by bringing before us this bill which \nmakes so many important contributions to a balanced national energy \npolicy.\n  Senator Grassley and I believe our amendment is another important \ncontribution, and I respectfully urge our colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as all of my colleagues know, I strongly \nsupport the production of renewable domestic fuels, particularly \nethanol and biodiesel. As domestic, renewable sources of energy, \nethanol and biodiesel can increase fuel supplies, reduce our dependence \non foreign oil, and increase our national and economic security.\n  Historically, Congress and the administration have asked the Federal \nGovernment to lead by example when moving this country to new \nstandards. Since we are talking about the future of energy in this \ncountry, we as a Federal Government must lead by example. The Dayton-\nGrassley amendment is largely symbolic and it will codify what many \nadministrations have already directed the Federal Government to do: to \nuse renewable fuels where practicable.\n  For instance, the last administration issued an Executive order \ndirecting the Federal Government to exercise leadership in the use of \nalternative fuel vehicles, to develop and implement aggressive plans to \nfulfill the alternative fueled vehicle acquisition requirements of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 1992, which required 25 percent in 1996, 33 \npercent in 1997, 50 percent in 1998, and 75 percent in 1999 and \nthereafter.\n  The Executive order was never adhered to because it was not generally \npracticable, but the Dayton-Grassley amendment is much easier to \nimplement, because we are talking about setting a standard using \nnormally blended renewable fuels.\n  The Federal Government should be using as much renewable fuels as is \npracticably available.\n  This amendment would require just that--where available, Federal \nfleet vehicles should be using ethanol and biodiesel, the two most \npracticably available renewable fuels.\n  I support this amendment, because it makes good sense for the Federal \nfleet to use as much ethanol and biodiesel as it possibly can.\n  The requirements for ethanol and biodiesel usage under this amendment \nare easily attainable and does not require the Federal fleet to comply \nif the blended fuel is not readily available.\n  I am pleased to offer this amendment with Senator Dayton.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota. His amendment is the kind of \ncreativity and inventiveness and American can-do ingenuity we have to \nhave as we approach this energy crisis, energy shortage.\n  Clearly, the production of ethanol and its substitution for otherwise \nfossil fuels is of benefit to Minnesota. There is not particularly any \nbenefit to my State, so I wish to rise as a nonconflicted party to \nendorse the Chair's amendment to say, as we approach the crisis of how \nwe are going to continue to have the energy resources we need for a \nnation that consumes a lot of energy, we have to be inventive and \ncreative.\n  I think the Senator from Minnesota has proposed one alternative. I \nthink we will see other alternatives produced in an amendment by the \nSenator from New Mexico on renewables, wind, the\n\n[[Page S1884]]\n\nuse of waste to produce energy which we do in Florida in 13 different \nlocations. I have been assured by the Senator from New Mexico that we \nwill be able to continue, as part of the credit, with those existing \nfacilities which are turning waste into energy.\n  Years ago, when I was in the Florida Legislature, we established the \nFlorida Solar Energy Center, which is in the shadow of Cape Canaveral \nright outside the gates of our space center. It, today, is a thriving \ncenter of research and development in using the God-given rays and heat \nof the Sun and converting that into energy.\n  Clearly, we have seen that, for example, so successfully employed in \nour space program, of taking the solar arrays, very high-tech kinds of \nmechanisms, folded out in huge arrays in the zero gravity and vacuum of \nspace and having that sunlight come down and penetrate those arrays and \nthat being converted into electricity for the spacecraft.\n  Another thing used on the spacecraft called the space shuttle is a \ndevice that takes oxygen and hydrogen and suddenly makes electricity \nand has water as a byproduct. That is why our astronaut crews on the \nspace shuttle have to perform, at the end of each flight day, water \ndumps where water, which is the byproduct of making this electricity by \nthe combining of hydrogen and oxygen, is dumped overboard in space. As \none sees it come out the nozzle and it starts to freeze in that very \ncold atmosphere of space, it is a beautiful sight, particularly when \nthe rays of the Sun happen to hit those water crystals. It is another \nexample.\n  Ultimately, we will be able to use hydrogen in automobiles. Think \nwhat that will save us in the way of fossil fuels.\n  Why do we need to find alternatives to fossil fuels? Because of the \nobvious: They are limited. The amounts of oil for energy purposes are \ngoing to be used up over the course of the next 50 years. So we have to \nbe planning for that.\n  There is another reason right now that is so important, and that is \nthe United States is dependent on foreign-imported oil, and that \ndependence causes us to be in the unenviable position that we have to \nassure the flow of that oil out of the Persian Gulf region. As we are \nengaged in this war against terrorism, where is a lot of that activity? \nIt is over in the Middle East. It is over in central Asia.\n\n  I will never forget. I clearly learned what a military chokepoint was \nwhen I looked out the window of our spacecraft as we were coming across \nthe Persian Gulf and from that altitude of space saw the 19-mile-wide \nStrait of Hormuz. That is a military chokepoint, and we have understood \nthat and that is why we have so much military over in that part of the \nworld to assure that oil in the supertankers of the world flows out of \nthat oil-rich region of the gulf, and those supertankers flow to the \nindustrialized world.\n  So somewhere there is a terrorist who is planning to try to sink one \nof those supertankers in the Strait of Hormuz, and if that were to \noccur, what huge economic dislocations and economic disruptions would \noccur throughout the globe. And it is because we are dependent on that \noil.\n  We ought to be reducing our dependence, and I think the amendment of \nthe Senator from Minnesota is one good illustration of how we lessen \nour dependence on that foreign oil.\n  Another good illustration is--and unfortunately, we were not \nsuccessful yesterday--increasing the miles per gallon, otherwise known \nas the CAFE standards. That does not mean anything to most Americans, \nbut when we start talking about do Americans want to get more miles per \ngallon in their automobile, the answer is a resounding ``yes.'' Yet \nyesterday we were not able to increase the miles per gallon in our \nfleet of automobiles.\n  That is a political travesty. It will have profound economic \nconsequences. Sooner or later, when we have another crisis, that oil is \nnot going to be able to be as accessible from foreign shores; then we \nwill have to get serious again about the greatest consumption of energy \nin America, which is in the transportation sector, about increasing \nmiles per gallon.\n  That is a decision the Senate rendered yesterday. I think it is \nunfortunate. However, the fact is there are creative and genius \nSenators, such as the Senator from Minnesota, who is offering his \namendment. I add my voice of support to his amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3012\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Craig Thomas. I will discuss the \namendment. It is an amendment that deserves understanding. I compliment \nthe Senator from Wyoming for the manner in which he has focused on this \namendment from the standpoint of keeping responsibility for the most \npart at the level where it belongs, which is at the State level.\n  The amendment replaces the Federal command and control in the Daschle \nsubstitute. That amendment has FERC setting and enforcing reliability \nstandards. There are some things wrong with that, and I will go through \nthat in detail. This is a provision similar to legislation the Senate \nunanimously passed last Congress which has the North American Electric \nReliability Council continuing to set standards but not with the \nability to enforce them. This is a group that knows what they are \ntalking about when it comes to reliability.\n  Under this amendment, there is an enforcement mechanism. It is \nimportant to note that the amendment is broadly supported by Governors \nand State public utility commissions. Since Ben Franklin went kite \nflying, we have known of electricity's unique attributes. Customers \ncount on the fact that when they turn the light on, it goes on; the \nelectricity will be there. It is probably one of the largest industries \nin our country that is so taken for granted. It works. Anytime Congress \ncomes in and proposes to fix it when it is still working, there are \nthose who become concerned. I am one.\n  More than reading lights and television are at stake. Reliable, \naffordable electricity moves the economy forward. It makes possible \ncomputers that research solutions to our most pressing problems and the \ninstruments that save lives.\n  This amendment ensures our electric transmission grid will continue \nto be safe and reliable. We know that grid, in some areas particularly, \nis overtaxed, with inadequate transmission lines. Yet it works. So the \ntendency is, do not disturb it. We have to recognize there are more and \nmore demands for greater electric energy as a consequence of computers \nand various other appliances we take for granted in our homes.\n  This amendment ensures that our electric transmission grid will \ncontinue to be safe and reliable. Consumers will be able to get the \npower they need when they need it--the lights will go on, and they will \nstay on.\n  The amendment establishes a nationwide reliability organization which \nhas the authority to establish and enforce reliability standards. I \nemphasize two words: Establish and enforce. This is a nationwide \nreliability organization that has proven itself. The new reliability \norganization will be run by market participants and will be overseen by \nthe FERC.\n  To give an example: When the Enron company collapsed, the system \nworked. There was not a price increase. There was not a shortage of \nelectricity. The free market system worked. I have often said, if those \ncompanies, on the demise of Enron, had to go to FERC to get authority \nto take over the slack, one wonders how long it would take. The public \nwould probably be inconvenienced. The price would probably be adjusted \nbecause of a crisis.\n  My point is, the free market system can work. That is why it is so \nimportant we address reliability. This amendment does it.\n  Our existing voluntary reliability system has been with us for some \ntime. Under current law, reliability standards are set by the North \nAmerican Electric Reliability Council and its 10 regional councils. \nThese standards are entirely voluntary. There is no penalty\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\nmechanism for violation. The pending amendment gives an enforcement \nmechanism that is good. In a nutshell, the pending amendment takes the \nexisting voluntary program and gives it some enforcement powers. The \nnew reliability organization sets the standard with FERC, and FERC \nbecomes the backstop, not the individual who necessarily carries the \nball upfront. The reliability organization will be made up of \nrepresentatives of those who are affected: Residents, commercial and \nindustrial customers, independent power producers, electric utilities, \nand others.\n\n  There is no question we need a system to safeguard the integrity of \nour electric grid. Both the amendment and the Daschle bill create \nmandatory and enforceable reliability rules. But they do so in very \ndifferent ways. This is where Members are going to have to look at this \namendment and recognize its contribution vis-a-vis what is in the \nDaschle bill.\n  The Daschle bill gives all authority and responsibility to FERC. This \nis a States rights issue. Clearly, when it comes to interstate \ntransmission of power, FERC has, and should have, a role. We believe \nthe Daschle bill, in giving all the authority and responsibility to \nFERC, takes away from the States their right to address intrastate \npower matters that can best be addressed by the States. In the Daschle \nbill, in giving all the authority and responsibility to FERC, FERC sets \nthe standards and FERC enforces the standards. It is that simple.\n  Unfortunately, in our opinion, FERC does not have all the expertise \nin the world to set highly technical and complex reliability standards \nthat can only be done by industry experts. Where do the industry \nexperts reside? They reside within the States.\n  The amendment instead establishes a participant-run, FERC-overseeing, \nelectric reliability organization. It is a blend of Federal oversight \nalong with industry expertise. It is similar to the bill that passed \nunanimously last Congress.\n  Over the years, the grid has been well protected through voluntary \nstandards established by the North American Electric Reliability \nCouncil. FERC's voluntary reliability standards, which are not \nnecessarily enforceable, have subsequently been complied with by the \nelectric power industry; in other words, a kind of self-policing \nmechanism.\n  But with the changing nature of the electric power market, it is time \nto change that to create a new organization with enforcement powers. \nThat is what we have done. The answer to every problem is not \nnecessarily another layer of Federal command and control or, in this \ncase, more FERC. This is the central failure, in our opinion, of the \nDaschle bill. Federal standards and Federal enforcement are simply not \nnecessary across the board.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Wyoming adopts the language \ndeveloped by the North American Reliability Council. It recognizes and \naddresses the regional differences. It is supported by State Governors, \nincluding western Governors, and State public utility commission. As we \ndid last year, the Senate should unanimously support the language and \nreject the Federal preemption and command and control that is in the \nDaschle legislation.\n  I support the amendment and encourage its adoption.\n  I would like to point out that this is a pretty complex piece of \nlegislation contained in this amendment. I encourage Members to talk to \nmembers of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee because we have \nhad previously--not this time--hearings on this matter.\n  I previously discussed my displeasure with the process that brought \nthe bill to the Senate floor. However, unlike most of this bill, the \nreliability language does have some committee history. During the last \nCongress, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources specifically \nconsidered the issue of whether we should have more Federal controls or \nwhether we should, instead, provide enforcement authority to the \ncurrent voluntary standards and those would be administered by NERC.\n  On June 21, 2000, the committee reported legislation that took the \napproach contained in the amendment offered by Senator Thomas and the \nSenate passed that approach. That approach recommended by the Energy \nCommittee and passed by the Senate has been abandoned in this \nlegislation. I think that is regrettable.\n  The reliability language in the current legislation was circulated by \nthe chairman of the committee as part of the chairman's mark on \nelectricity. They ignored our committee position and the action taken \nby the Senate at that time. We had a markup scheduled to consider \nelectricity. This is when the majority leader basically shut down the \ncommittee process and, in my opinion, obstructed the advancement of \nthis energy legislation.\n  We have never had the opportunity to vote on this provision. I can \ntell you what that vote would have been, however. I have said the \nmajority leader shut down the Energy Committee because he feared our \nvote over ANWR. Everyone knows a majority of the committee and a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate support responsible development of a \nresource that could replace some 30 years of imports from Iraq. \nHowever, in all honesty, ANWR was not the pending subject when the \nchairman and majority leader started counting votes--electricity was \nthe subject.\n  Reliability, Federal mandates, Federal command and control--these \nwere the issues. I went through this in great detail in the last \nCongress. We had 2 days of markup going through these issues. When we \nwere done, the committee voted and, as I said, the Senate decided to do \nreliability in a manner substantially similar to that being proposed by \nSenator Thomas.\n  I agree with many of my colleagues that we should have done this in \ncommittee and not be conducting these business meetings, necessarily, \nor educational processes, in the Chamber. That is not our option, \nhowever. Given the circumstances, the Senate should follow the \nrecommendations of the Energy Committee on this matter and its own \nunanimous action in the last Congress and support the Thomas amendment.\n  I see the Senator from Louisiana seeking recognition, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thought I would come to the floor and \nspeak for just a moment about an amendment that I propose to lay down \nsometime either today or tomorrow, for, hopefully, a good debate next \nweek.\n  This amendment is rather simple. I am sure it is going to cause a lot \nof interest and debate. I am going to explain it in a moment, but it \nwill be proposed because of what I have come to believe after studying \nnow for several years the current situation with our energy policy. \nSenator Bingaman and Senator Murkowski have worked so hard on the bill \nbefore us, and I have supported many of their efforts. I have nothing \nbut the most wonderful things to say about the two of them and the \npatience they displayed trying to bring the bill together into one that \ncan unite this body and one that can really help move this country \nforward.\n  I am going to vote for the bill, whether ANWR is in it or not. I am \nsupporting Senator Murkowski's effort to open up more domestic drilling \nin this Nation because I think he was absolutely correct. But I want to \nsay I think it is going to take a more fundamental shift in attitude \nand policy. Although the bill gives us great hope in tax credits for \nmore production, great hope in tax credits for more alternatives, we \nare still, if you will, arguing about the margins and missing the big \npicture.\n  The big picture is really this: I think the solution is for this \ncountry to get serious about becoming energy independent. I think the \nPresident is absolutely right when he talks about a freedom car or a \nfreedom truck or a freedom system. This is about freedom. This is about \nbeing able to be a leader in the world based on what our real values \nare, and not being held hostage because we need something that someone \nelse has and because we will not produce it, even though we have it. \nOur foreign policy is compromised and the lives of our men and women \nare put in danger.\n  It is not right. It is not smart. It is dangerous. If we did a better \njob of communicating to the American people this reality, I think they \nwould rise and demand a fundamental change.\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\n  So the amendment I am going to lay down is a simple one. It says \nthis: All States are to submit a plan to the Secretary of Energy within \n1 year to show how they can become basically energy self-sufficient.\n  Whatever they are consuming, they must come up with a plan of \nproducing--not 100 percent, because I think that would be very \ndifficult for some States, recognizing that some States are small. So \nmy amendment is going to say that whatever you consume, you must try to \nproduce 85 percent of what you consume. The money in this budget, the \nmoney that the Federal Government--taxpayers--provide, is contingent \nupon the State submitting such a plan.\n  If you do not submit a plan, you are not permitted to receive any \nmoney. I will tell you why. On the floor I said one of the founding \nprinciples of this Nation was: He who doesn't work doesn't eat. It is \nwhy the Plymouth Colony survived. It is why this Nation not only is \nsurviving but thriving; it is because it is an American principle that \nwe live by every day--not perfectly, but it is an undergirding \nprinciple of this Nation.\n  It is not the communistic principle, not other principles. The \nprinciple in America is you live by the fruit of your labor. You work \nand use the talents that God has given you. When you produce, you can \nlive and consume. But if you don't work, if you don't produce, you \nshould not pick up the paycheck. We have done it in welfare reform. We \ndo it everywhere. But we do not do it in energy.\n  I will show you why we do not do it. This is a chart of the States \nthat produce power. The purple States shown here produce enough power \nfor themselves, and are net exporters of power. They produce it in all \ndifferent ways. Some produce it by coal, some produce it by oil and \ngas, some produce it by using their great water resources with which \ntheir regions are blessed. These States have figured out what resources \nthey have.\n  They are trying--I admit with a lot of mistakes in the past. When we \ndidn't have the great science and technology of today--using basically \njust carriages and horseback--we were just trying to make it work and \nbuild this country. So they found all these resources and started \nputting them together, to give power to a nation that is truly the \nlight of the world.\n  Now notice the red States here. They are consuming much more--in some \ncases dramatically more--than they are producing. That is the problem. \nI will submit for the Record the numbers that are quite dramatic for \nthese consuming States which indicate their unwillingness and their \nreluctance to produce the energy they need to sustain their economy and \ntheir dependence on others to produce.\n  If that were as far as we have gone, maybe we could even live with \nthat. Not only are these States not willing to produce, but they are \ntelling other States they can't produce--not only not in my backyard, \nbut not in your backyard. I think that kind of attitude is driven by \npopulations that might not quite realize what is at stake. It is, I \nthink, jeopardizing our Nation and causing us to work around the \nmargins and not really work on the core points.\n  We cannot conserve our way out of where we are. We have to produce \nmore domestically.\n  Let me give you another reason why I am very passionate about this.\n  Every time we drive domestic production off our shores, it goes \nsomewhere else. It doesn't go away. It just goes somewhere else. When \nit goes to Canada, it is not bad because Canada is a stable country \nwith good laws and good environmental rules and regulations. We in some \nways benefit when it goes to Canada--not only as a nation but as a \nworld--because Canada is a developed, progressive, and friendly \ncountry. But that is about it.\n  It might go to Mexico and to South and Central America. Mexico is a \nfriend. Our relations are warming. They are an ally, but I would not \nsay that Mexico or Central America or Latin America have the strongest \nenvironmental policies. I think they have fairly transparent business \noperations. I am not so sure they have the highest level of ethics in \nterms of their business, at least compared to the United States.\n  When we drive production off the shores of the greatest country in \nthe world, which has the best regulations, the best laws, the most \ntransparent system, and an assurance that drilling is done in the right \nway, we drive it to places in the world where environmental destruction \nis inevitable because they do not have the technology. They do not have \nthe laws. They do not have the organized environmental groups.\n  In our great righteousness of trying to clean up the United States of \nAmerica, we are messing up the rest of the world. It doesn't make sense \nfrom an environmental perspective. It doesn't make sense from a \nsecurity perspective. Children, young people, spouses, and parents are \ndying today over this issue.\n  Why can't we help Israel anymore? Because we are so dependent on Arab \ncountries to supply us with oil, and so we don't have to drill anywhere \nin the United States for oil. We see in the paper every day that \nanother 60 people have died in Israel, and we say we are sorry.\n  This Senator is going to do everything in her power to help change \nthis view in the United States.\n  When a person runs for President in this country, they have to go to \nCalifornia to get a lot of votes. They have to go to Florida to get a \nlot of votes. They have to go to other big States to get a lot of \nvotes. There are some interest groups there that I think have captured \nand held hostage some of the general public in those States and \nconvinced them that they can just continue to consume. They don't have \nto produce anything. They do not have to produce it by coal. They don't \nhave to produce it by nuclear. They don't have to produce it by \nhydro. They don't have to produce it by gas. They don't have to produce \nit. They can just consume.\n\n  Again, the States in red on this chart are importers of electricity. \nThey consume sometimes 3, 5, 10, and 15 percent more than they produce. \nThe States in purple produce more than they consume. They are net \nexporters.\n  The amendment that I am going to lay down later today is a message \namendment. I think this message is compelling. I think this is a \nmessage worth giving. I hope somebody will listen to it. States are to \nsubmit a plan to the Secretary of Energy within 1 year. In that plan, \nevery State has to show how they are going to become energy independent \nwithin 10 years. If they do not submit a plan, they are not allowed to \nget one penny from this energy bill for any projects because then they \ngo on their own.\n  The country was founded on the principle of those who work eat, and \nthose who do not work don't eat.\n  Let me say something about by State. This isn't just about Louisiana. \nI am proud of what my State does. We are trying to do a better job of \nprotecting our environment. We are making a lot of strides. Our \nuniversities are doing great, and our businesses are trying. We \nacknowledge that we have made some mistakes. I am very proud of my \nState. We produce a lot, and we consume a great amount.\n  I will show you on this chart, but you can understand that our \nconsumption is not just for ourselves. We have a lot of industry that \nmakes a lot of products that go everywhere in the country and in the \nworld. Not only do we produce everything that the 4.5 million of us \nneed every day for our lives, but we also produce enough to run this \ngreat industrial complex. Even then, we send another half of what we \nproduce out to everybody else. We do it because we are very blessed to \nhave oil and gas. We thank God for it. We didn't make it. It was there \nwhere our State was founded. But we are wise enough to try to recover \nit and use it for the great growth of the Nation.\n  In addition, we sit on the greatest river system that drains the \nentire Nation, that produces fish, and we have levy systems, at some \nsacrifice to our environment. Who in America would say we don't need \nthe Mississippi River? I don't know what we would do without it. I do \nnot know what our farmers in the Midwest would do without the mighty \nMississippi and its tributaries.\n  The people in Louisiana have done more than their fair share. It is \nnot just about Louisiana. It is about the principles that we need to \nget straight.\n  This chart is an illustration of how much natural gas comes from \noffshore.\n\n[[Page S1887]]\n\nThis is the big trunk--Louisiana and Mississippi. This represents where \nour gas comes from that is firing our economy and meeting new \nenvironmental clean air standards. Why? Because natural gas is a clean \nway to produce energy. It helps keep our air clean. That is the benefit \nwhen you have a pro-production attitude.\n  Just imagine if we had a pro-production attitude in other places in \nthis Nation. Instead of one tree trunk, we could have 10 tree trunks. \nSo in the event that some terrorists tried to shut down one of these \ntree trunks, we might have several others. Or in the event of some \nnatural catastrophe, such as a major hurricane, or some other event \nthat might shut down some of the infrastructure here, we could be self-\nreliant. But we are not self-reliant because we have one big trunk, and \nit comes right off the Mississippi and Louisiana coast. Nowhere else.\n  It cannot come off anywhere here as shown on this portion of the \nchart because we have blocked everything else. We are just like sitting \nducks. We have one tree trunk. If that tree trunk gets cut down, we are \nout of business.\n  Let me show you another chart. This shows you the other fallacy.\n  I am so tired of hearing people say: Senator, even if we opened up \ndrilling everywhere, we could only get enough gas to last us for a year \nor 2 years or 3 years.\n  Let me just say something: Hogwash. Hogwash. It is not true. I say to \nanybody who says it, please come to this Chamber and let's debate the \nnumbers because I am going to show you what I just learned this week, \nafter being here several years. I was looking at these charts, and then \nsomething very significant dawned on me.\n  As seen on this chart of the United States, for those areas shown in \nthe gold-orange color, we have said, either through law or through \nregulation, you cannot drill here. It was not always this way; we did \nnot start the country this way--but in the last several years, a small \ngroup of people who think you can consume and not produce have \nconvinced enough people of that mistruth, and successfully blocked \nproduction in these areas.\n  Here are the areas shown on the chart. You cannot drill anywhere up \nthe east coast and the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. You cannot \ndrill in California or any place such as Washington or Oregon.\n  But what these charts are not accurate about is this: Minerals \nManagement Service, for instance, offers these estimates. MMS does a \nbeautiful job. It isn't that they are trying to mislead, but I just \nlearned how they calculate these numbers and they are not really \naccurate or show the right picture. They are calculating, if we open \nthis area, we could maybe get 2.5 trillion cubic feet of gas. The \nUnited States needs 22 trillion cubic feet of gas a year.\n  So that would only be such a small percentage, you could ask \nyourself: Is it worth it? I would ask myself that. Is it worth it to \nopen it up if you could only get a few months' worth of gas? Maybe that \nanswer would be wrong. I will show you the reason these charts are very \nmisleading.\n  On this chart, look at the Gulf of Mexico, where we have been \ndrilling since about 1950. It is a very developed field. We know what \nis there because we have taken a lot out. Our industry is very \nknowledgeable about this area.\n  Look what this chart says: Gas, 105.52, which means this is 105 \ntrillion cubic feet of gas in just one part of the gulf. But right over \nthis line, between Alabama and Florida, the estimate drops to 12.31 \ntrillion cubic feet of gas.\n  So I tell you again, that could not possibly be true because any \ngeologist--and I am not a geologist--but any geologist can tell you \nthat the formations do not stop at State boundaries. They do not stop \nat political boundaries. If these formations are true for the western \npart of the gulf, it has to be true for the eastern part.\n  So when we say no drilling anywhere in the eastern part of the gulf \nbecause there might be only a little bit of gas--so why go there? It is \nnot just a little bit of gas. It is the difference between imports and \nfreedom. It is the difference between being hostage to enemy countries \nand freedom. It is a big difference. And it is a big decision. And we \nmislead our people when we say: Why drill? There is just not a lot of \ngas there.\n  There is a lot of gas in the gulf. There is enough gas, just in my \nlittle place to keep the country going for 5 years--just in one part. \nFive years--just in my part. And we are willing to do it. But why \nshould we try to keep it going for the next 20 years? Can't someone \nelse contribute? For 5 years we could keep it going. And that is on one \nlittle part. And we have already taken half of our gas out.\n  So I am just going to make a rough estimate that if Florida would \nopen up--not close to the shore because I do not want to put oil rigs \noff the coast of Florida. I have spent my life growing up off the \nFlorida coast. I am used to seeing oil rigs. I understand people do not \nlike them. I think they are pretty nice. I have been on them. But I \nunderstand that.\n  I am not talking about right off the coast. I am talking about 25 \nmiles out. You cannot even see them. And with the directional drilling \nnow, you could drill with a minimal footprint and provide this Nation \nwith 10 years of freedom. You could tell Saudi Arabia, no. You could \nsay: No, we are not sending our soldiers. But, no, we have people who \nthink: Fine. Send the soldiers.\n  I don't want to send my son. He is only 9. I hope I can keep him \nhome. That is what this debate is about. I do not want him to go when \nhe is 18. If I have to come to this Chamber every day until he is 18 to \nfight on this point, it is worth it--for him, for my family, for \neverybody's family.\n  But I am not going to listen to ``because MMS says.'' I asked MMS \nthis morning. I asked: How do you all come up with these numbers?\n  They said: Senator, since we have done no exploration there, we \nreally don't know. We just low-ball it. These are just bare minimum \nnumbers.\n  But I can use my brain and figure out what the truth is. Today I \nfigured it out. There is a lot of gas. There is a lot of oil. There is \nenough in that little part in Alaska where Senator Murkowski and \nSenator Stevens want to drill. And it is not the last great place on \nEarth, which is something else I want to talk about. With all due \nrespect to the environmental leaders who have done a good job in our \ncountry helping us to find a balance, we have, in this case, gone too \nfar, in my opinion. It is not the last great place on Earth.\n  This Earth has a lot of great places left. There are a lot of \nwonderful oceans and rivers and streams and things that are getting \ncleaner and brighter every day. It is not the last great place. But \nthey would drive drilling off the most sophisticated Nation on Earth \ninto places that are worth preserving in this world. But they are not \ngoing to exist anymore because the environmental movement itself is \ngoing to destroy them. Because there are no regulations in other \ncountries--not up to our standards--there is no oversight, there are no \ndemocracies, there is no free press to tell you when you have gone too \nfar.\n  We have a free press in this country. And, believe me, that is a \ngreat thing because if the industry goes too far, the press will be \nright there, writing: You didn't abide by your permit. You went too \nfar. You have polluted this stream, and you should not do it. Then we \nrespond to it and we shut them down. That does not exist in places like \nBrazil or Honduras, and other places, to that great of an extent.\n  So I challenge the environmental community: Could you think about \nsomebody else besides us for a change? Could we think about the world? \nWe are not thinking about the world. We are leading the country in the \nwrong direction.\n  I challenge the leadership to tell the people the truth. Just tell \nthem the truth. We are not telling them the truth. And, as a result, \nwhen they do not have the truth, they cannot then respond in a way that \nis right.\n  It is our job to say the truth, and I am going to say it every day in \nhopes that we will get energy independent in this Nation. We can do it. \nAnd we can do it by producing more in the right ways, and by--as \nSenator Bingaman has been so good at--focusing on new freedom \ntechnologies, such as fuel cells and hydrogen and new reactors that \nSenator Domenici has been leading us on for the nuclear industry. And \nsoon it will be wonderful to live in a country where we are energy \nindependent. Then we can set our goals and our principles\n\n[[Page S1888]]\n\naccording to our values and according to the reason we fought and died \nin every war: The values for which this country stands.\n  I hope I see that day. I am young enough that hopefully I will see \nit. I have a lot of years left to fight.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthese numbers that show which States produce and which States do \nnothing but basically consume.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                                             STATE ENERGY PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                         1999 Production Quadrillion Btus (Quads)                                     1999 Consumption\n                                                               ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             State                                 Total       Primary                                                         MMBtu per                 MMBtu per       1999\n                                                                electricity  electricity      Oil           NG          Coal     Total quads     capita    Quads total     capita     Population\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama.......................................................        0.413        0.148        0.065        0.608        0.414        1.234        282.4        2.005        458.8    4,369,862\nAlaska........................................................        0.020        0.003        2.223        0.514        0.033        2.773       4476.1        0.695       1121.4      619,500\nArizona.......................................................        0.286        0.138        0.000        0.001        0.250        0.389         81.5        1.220        255.3    4,778,332\nArkansas......................................................        0.162        0.061        0.041        0.000        0.000        0.103         40.4        1.204        471.8    2,551,373\nCalifornia....................................................        0.630        0.328        1.584        0.425        0.000        2.336         70.5        8.375        252.7   33,145,121\nColorado......................................................        0.135        0.005        0.107        0.821        0.636        1.570        387.1        1.156        284.9    4,056,133\nConnecticut...................................................        0.095        0.052        0.000        0.000        0.000        0.052         15.8        0.839        255.7    3,282,031\nDelaware......................................................        0.023        0.000        0.000        0.000        0.000        0.000          0.0        0.279        370.0      753,538\nDist.

 Ms. LANDRIEU. Then I am going to submit other things for the Record \nand lay down the amendment when the Senator from Alaska suggests we lay \nit down.\n  I yield whatever time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BAYH). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have listened to the Senator from \nLouisiana. I look forward to being a cosponsor of her amendment.\n  For far too long, we have not identified the issue of equity which \nthe Senator from Louisiana has certainly shown with her chart. I have a \nslightly bigger chart which basically shows the same thing.\n  I will take a few moments, if I may. I ask the Senator from Louisiana \nto look at this chart. As she displayed on her own chart, the areas \nthat are off limits for oil and gas exploration are clearly the entire \neast coast of the United States, from Maine to Florida. This is the \nentire area in gray. Then we have the area of lease sale 181 that was \naddressed by the Senators from the States of jurisdiction. I respect \nthe attitude prevailing within those States relative to what happens \noff their shores.\n  The entire west coast of the United States is off limits, from \nWashington to California. The Senator from Louisiana did not show what \nhappened in the overthrust belt, where we have the producing States of \nColorado, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, northern parts of New Mexico; they \nhave been taken basically off limits by the roadless policy, as has a \nlot of public land.\n  As we begin to look at this country, we recognize who produces the \nenergy: Texas; Louisiana; Mississippi; Alabama, to a degree; California \nis still a major producer; Montana; my State of Alaska. But the \ninconsistency, as the Senator from Louisiana pointed out, is that we \nhave an inequity. And it is ironic that Senators who do not want energy \nproduction from Federal lands of their States are very much opposed to \nsupporting the States that want to have the development. Whether we \ntalk about CAFE or some reasonable form of revenue back to the States \nthat bear the impact associated with offshore activity, such as \nLouisiana or others, we get into a fight over equity there. Clearly, \nLouisiana has to provide the infrastructure to support an offshore \nactivity, but they don't receive necessarily any Federal consideration \non revenue sharing that is any more significant than another State that \ndoesn't have that impact.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator is aware that there is a great injustice on \nwhich I hope we can make some headway before this bill leaves the \nSenate. The injustice is that Federal law allows interior States--and I \nthink rightfully so, and I most certainly support it and would even \nargue it should be increased--but in the interior States,\n\n[[Page S1889]]\n\nwhen they do any kind of mining or resource recovery on Federal land, \nthe State that hosts that Federal land and the surrounding communities \nshare 50 percent to compensate for impacts because there are roads that \nhave to be built.\n  There are other impacts where if the Federal Government is going to \nbenefit from drilling within your State, even on State land, we think \nthe State should share the benefit.\n  But the tragedy is that for coastal States, such as Louisiana, Texas, \nMississippi, Alabama, and, to some degree, Alaska, you must drill \nwithin 3 miles of your coast to get any compensation. So we are sending \n$4 and $5 billion in royalties and revenues to the Federal Treasury. In \naddition to sending the oil, in addition to sending the gas, we are \nalso sending huge amounts of money to the Federal Treasury, and our \nStates get nothing, nothing in direct aid.\n  My next amendment is going to be about changing that. I have an \namendment that is going to ask for a portion. I hope everyone will \nsupport that. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't, considering what I \nhave just shown. I thank the Senator for raising this issue.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I will comment on \na couple of other points she made. One is that States such as Louisiana \nand other energy-producing States contribute extraordinarily to the \nstandard of living we all enjoy. We enjoy it without having the impact \nof resource development in some States.\n  I would appreciate it if they would leave that one chart up that \nshowed the electricity because that in itself--even though I am not \nover there, I hope the camera can pick it up--does represent a \nsignificant reality that the purple States are contributing for the \nproduction of electric energy so that the other States can share a \nstandard of living that is equal to the States that are generating the \nelectric production. That means somebody is burning coal in a purple \nState, and a red State enjoys theoretically the potential of not the \nimpact of air emissions but the generation of prosperity through \ninexpensive electricity because of various efficiencies we have in the \nsystem.\n  For a producing State not to get any other consideration seems kind \nof inequitable when we look at technology and issues of where are we \ngoing to generate the power we consume.\n  That chart specifically is limited to electricity, but it is a very \ninteresting one because it shows a harsh reality. I encourage my \ncolleagues to feel a little guilty if they are a red State. If they are \na red State, they are depending on a purple State to support the \nquality and standard of living they enjoy.\n  I appreciated the Senator's comment relative to her young son and the \nreality that we have fought a war over energy oil specifically--before. \nThe paper this morning showed a very dismal picture relative to what is \nhappening in the Mideast, the threat from Iraq. I am always reminded of \nSenator Mark Hatfield, who was a respected Member of this body from the \nState of Oregon, who said time and time again: I would rather vote for \nopening up ANWR than send another American man or woman to fight a war \non foreign soil over oil. That is what the Senator is talking about \nwith regard to her own son.\n  As we look at our vote yesterday, really that vote was over safety. \nIt was families; it was children. We sacrificed to some extent a CAFE \nfor that assurance and that reality. I think we have to look similarly \nto the merits of our dependence on greater sources of imported oil from \noverseas and the price we are going to have to pay for it, not just in \ndollars but American lives. There is a parallel.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield for one moment? I would ask him \nif he could imagine if we put some kind of chart up like this where \nthere were some States that said: We want to produce food. And then \nother States said: No, we are not going to produce any food. We want \nyou to produce the food, and we don't want to produce the food. Not \nonly do we not want to produce the food, but we want to have a \nmoratorium on food production. Not only are we going to have a \nmoratorium on food production in our State, we are going to tell you, \nthe purple States, what kind of food you can grow and how you can grow \nit, and that is just the way it is going to be.\n  I realize this might be stretching this analogy, but we have to break \nthrough to the American people in some way and explain that there are \ncertain things we all need. We all have to be able to produce them. \nFood is one. Energy is one.\n  Then some people will come down here and argue: Senator, this is not \nright, because some States produce food, some States produce energy, \nsome States produce this, some States produce that, and that is what a \nunion is all about. I have thought about that. But there will not be a \nmoratorium on food. Nobody is saying don't grow food in my State. But, \nabout energy, they are saying we don't want to produce energy in our \nState. We don't want the gas plants, don't want the oil; we don't want \nto produce it through nuclear or through coal. Some States are even \ngoing so far as to say: We don't want the electricity lines. They are \nnot nice to look at. We don't want merchant powerplants.\n\n  How in the heck do they think, when you walk into a building, these \nlights go on? There is some electricity line, or a powerplant, or there \nis some man or woman in a coalfield working for power production. We \nhave done a great disservice to our country by not making this \nconnection. It is very dangerous. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. I look forward to \nseeing her amendment, which I intend to cosponsor and support.\n  As we reflect on this debate, make no mistake about it, yesterday's \nvote was a vote where we were willing to give up CAFE for the safety of \nour children. I think that is pretty basic. We are going to have the \nsame opportunity to address the parallel when we get to the issue \nspecifically of trying to reduce our dependence on imported oil--\nwhether we want to trade off domestic production here at home, the \nopening of ANWR, or, indeed, recognize the threat we have to young men \nand women fighting a war overseas on foreign soil over oil.\n  I will take a few moments to remind our colleagues that our President \nhad some very strong words today for Saddam Hussein. Yesterday, during \nhis press conference, he shared them with many of our colleagues. I \nwant to quote from that press conference. I ask that Members who \nhaven't looked at the front page of the Washington Post to recognize \nthe potential threat we have with regard to our relationship with Iraq. \nYesterday he said:\n\n       I am deeply concerned about Iraq. . . . This is a nation \n     run by a man who is willing to kill his own people by using \n     chemical weapons, a man who won't let the inspectors into the \n     country, a man who's obviously got something to hide.\n\n  Further, the President states:\n\n       And he is a problem, and we're going to deal with him . . . \n     we've got all options on the table. . . . One thing I will \n     not allow is a nation such as Iraq to threaten our very \n     future by developing weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  We know that Saddam Hussein has been up to no good. We have not had \ninspectors there for over 2\\1/2\\ years, and we have reason to believe \nhe has a missile development capability. He has already shown it in the \nPersian Gulf war and with the missiles that were fired at Israel. We \nhave every reason to believe he has a biological, and perhaps a \nnuclear, capability. We know he has been developing weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Now, the President said:\n\n       We've got all the options on the table.\n\n  I don't need to remind my colleagues what Saddam Hussein means to the \nworld in which we live. He is much more than just one of the world's \ngreatest threats to peace and stability. He is more than just an enemy \nwith whom we went to war. Unfortunately, he is a partner at the same \ntime. He is a partner we rely on to power our economy. What is going to \nhappen to the roughly million barrels a day we import each day when and \nif President Bush's words turn into deeds? Are we still going to be \nable to count on Saddam Hussein for a million barrels a day? How are we \ngoing to replace that oil?\n  I want colleagues to understand an important reality of one of our \nefforts on the energy bill. By an overwhelming\n\n[[Page S1890]]\n\nmajority, 62 to 38, yesterday's vote on CAFE was a victory for common \nsense, for the American family, and the American worker. As I indicated \nearlier, it was a very basic vote where we gave up CAFE for the safety \nof our citizens and our children. By insisting that sound science \ndecides where we should set our fuel standards, we protected America's \nability to choose the automobiles that meet their needs and the \nAmerican workers who build them.\n\n  But in so doing, those who objected to this more reasonable approach \nto CAFE standards for reducing our dependence on foreign oil--that was \nbasically rejected as an alternative. Keep in mind that one of the \ntreaties of that particular concept was that we don't need to develop \nmore oil here at home. We don't need to develop ANWR. We can do it \nthrough CAFE savings.\n  Well, perhaps that might have been possible, but that was simply \naddressed in real terms by a rejection of that thought. So that \nalternative of CAFE savings--picking up what we would otherwise have to \nperhaps depend on in ANWR, opening up domestic oil and gas reserves--\nwas rejected.\n  Between the CAFE victory and the President's words on Iraq, I think \nit is clear we have to act to fill the energy voids. If we are not \ngoing to do it through CAFE, how are we going to do it? If we are going \nto terminate our relationship with Iraq under some set of \ncircumstances, that is certainly going to affect our ability to import \noil. Where will we get the difference?\n  The Senator from Louisiana said it right. Charity begins at home. We \nhave to develop those areas where we have possible oil and gas \npotential to lessen our dependence on foreign oil.\n  I think her theory of holding each State accountable is a good one. \nWe have technology and ingenuity within our States. Some States may be \nable to generate energy from solar, or wind, or nuclear. Let's get on \nwith it here at home.\n  We have a lot of coal in this country, and we have gas offshore, and \nwe have oil potential in certain areas. Let's commit ourselves to \nbecoming more energy independent. We can do that if we concentrate on \nit.\n  Isn't that a good thing for the American economy? If we made this \nkind of a commitment, you would see the OPEC cartel come to an \nemergency meeting where they would say, just a minute, maybe we should \nlower the price of oil, maybe we should make a little more available--\ninstead of what they are doing now.\n  So I think the Senator from Louisiana brought up some interesting \nideas, and we should concentrate a little bit more on getting our act \ntogether. You have heard it time and again, but one of the major \nsources is the promise of ANWR. ANWR has more oil in it than Texas \ncurrently shows in reserves. It offers us an opportunity to potentially \neliminate Iraqi dependence for more than a century or 30 years from \nSaudi Arabia. With American technology, we can reach oil safely and we \ncan create thousands of jobs.\n  It is interesting to note that today we are going to have James \nHoffa, the Teamster president, for a press conference and one of the \nthings we will be discussing is how to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil. One of the items is opening ANWR. That debate lies ahead of us. \nKeep in mind the realities of the choices we make when we choose from \nwhere our oil comes.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. The Presiding Officer and I, before we were hired on as \nSenators, used to earn our keep by serving as Governors of Indiana and \nDelaware. As Governors, we were mindful of the prerogatives of the \nStates and our roles and responsibilities as chief executives of our \nStates. We worked through our national and regional organizations to \nmake sure the concerns of our region and the Governors and the States \nin general were respected.\n  Whenever a group of Governors today raises a concern about an issue \nthat is before the Congress, I listen. In this case, we have heard from \na number of Governors from the western part of the United States \nraising concerns with respect to the electric reliability provisions \nthat are in the underlying bill before us.\n  We have had a chance to try to better understand what the concerns of \nthe Governors are, and we have had an opportunity to try to understand \nhow their concerns, if adopted as proposed, would affect the rest of us \nwho do not happen to be from those 14 or so Western States that have \nbanded together to present their message to us.\n  That having been said, I nonetheless must feel compelled to rise in \nsupport of the electric reliability provisions that are in the \nunderlying amendment. Senator Bingaman has sent out a Dear Colleague \nletter to all of us dated yesterday, March 13, on this issue. I urge \nour colleagues to take a few minutes to read it as we approach the vote \nat 2 p.m.\n  The underlying language that is in the bill Chairman Bingaman has \ndeveloped represents what I believe is a simplified approach that \nplaces appropriate authority for liability within the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, which we call FERC. FERC is the proper body to \naddress electric reliability issues. FERC has the expertise to \nharmonize reliability and to commercialize issues that States and \nutilities face.\n  Under Senator Bingaman's proposal, FERC can objectively defer to \nregional and State solutions if FERC does not think they have the \nexpertise and that the expertise lies elsewhere. They have the \nflexibility to look elsewhere for those solutions.\n  I believe what Senator Bingaman has provided for us is a thoughtful \ncompromise. It is based on the premise that a reliability structure \nshould be both simple and dependable. The language in the underlying \nbill requires FERC to implement a system that applies to all regions in \nwhat I believe is a fair manner. It also includes a flexibility to \ndefer, as I said earlier, where appropriate, to regional entities and \nto States. I believe this is a good solution to the important issue of \nensuring the reliability of our electric grid. The electric grid is a \nnational infrastructure, and the oversight of its reliability should be \nnational in scope as well.\n  This morning Senator Bingaman introduced into the Record a letter \nfrom PJM. PJM is the entity which coordinates the electric grid in \nDelaware and in five other States in the mid-Atlantic region. PJM is \nrecognized, we believe, as the best in the country in ensuring the \nreliability of our grid. They said they support Senator Bingaman's \nefforts as well. So do I.\n  I would be surprised if our colleagues, especially those from the \nmid-Atlantic or from the Northeast, voted for the amendment that is \nbeing offered by the Senator from Wyoming later today, particularly if \nthey will take the time to listen to the input, as I have, from their \nPJM in their part of the country, and especially if they will take the \ntime to read this letter. It is a Dear Colleague letter from Senator \nBingaman.\n\n  As Governors, we always tried to find solutions that were simple and \ndependable: The old ``kiss'' principle, keep it simple stupid. I often \nfind that would underlie what we attempted to do. We would often seek, \nas Governors, to make sure what we tried to do for one region of the \ncountry did not somehow inconvenience or undermine the interests of \nanother part of the country.\n  My concern about what our friends from the West have proposed is it \nis not simple and it would undermine and put the rest of us at a \ndisadvantage.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Senator Bingaman's position in the \nunderlying bill and oppose the amendment of Senator Thomas.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Oregon, when the \ntime arrives that he has his amendment in hand, I will be happy to \nyield the floor to him.\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\n  In the meantime, I note that after the 2 o'clock vote Senator \nBingaman will lay down an amendment. The purpose of the amendment, as I \nunderstand it, is to change the renewable portfolio in the underlying \nbill. The underlying bill says in effect that 10 percent of the \nelectricity in this country must be renewables by a certain time. \nSenator Bingaman's amendment changes that to 8\\1/2\\ percent, lowering \nit. Senator Jeffords will offer an amendment to raise that amount to 20 \npercent--double the amount in the underlying bill. Following that, \nSenator Kyl of Arizona will offer an amendment to delete all renewables \nfrom the bill.\n  Senators will have an opportunity to vote for a lowering of the \namount from 10 to 8\\1/2\\ percent, sponsored by Senator Bingaman and \nothers; they will have an opportunity to vote for raising that standard \nto 20 percent; or eliminating them altogether. We will complete those \nvotes this afternoon sometime.\n  Although the amendment has not been laid down, I will speak in \nsupport of the Jeffords amendment. Why would I do that? The State of \nNevada would benefit significantly from renewable energy because the \nNevada Test Site--where we for 50 years have set off nuclear weapons \nand are still performing testing--could produce enough electricity for \nthe whole United States, every need in the United States for \nelectricity, by putting solar panels that cover the Nevada Test Site. \nThere is that much sun. We are not going to do that, but we could.\n  Also, the State of Nevada is the most mountainous State in the Union. \nWe have more mountains than any State in the Union, except Alaska. We \nhave 340 separate mountain ranges. We have 32 mountains over 11,000 \nfeet high. As a result of that, we have wind all over the State of \nNevada. Nevada, other than Alaska, is the most dangerous State in which \nto fly. Why? Because of the mountains. We have weather changing very \nquickly because of the mountains. People do not realize Nevada is the \nmost mountainous State except for Alaska.\n  People think of Nevada as being desert, like Las Vegas. That is not \nthe case. We have, in addition, the ability to produce large amounts of \nenergy with sun. We have the ability to produce large amounts of energy \nwith wind. However, it does not stop there. Nature gave Nevada also the \ngreatest geothermal resource in the United States.\n  I remember when I first went to Reno. I traveled from Reno to Carson \nCity, about 25 miles. Driving along that road on the side is steam \ncoming from the ground. I had never seen anything like that before. The \nsteam is from the heat of the Earth. What we have been able to do is \ntap that heat. Now we are producing electricity in Nevada, the \ngeothermal energy. That is why I am so in favor of the Jeffords \nproposal.\n  Senator Murkowski, my friend from Alaska, wants to produce more \nenergy as a result of this bill. He wants to produce energy in the ANWR \nwilderness. That is not going to happen.\n  On the other side, people want to cut down the consumption of fuel. \nThat was debated all day yesterday with CAFE standards. That is not \ngoing to happen.\n  On one side, we have Members who want more production out of Alaska \nand are not going to get it; and those who want to cut down the \nconsumption of fuel on automobiles will not get it.\n\n  Where does that leave us? It leaves us with the opportunity to demand \nthat we do more with renewables. We can do that. There is no question \nwe can do that. We are not as well advanced in technology as we should \nbe, but we could be. The link between environment and energy must be \nforged and tempered in this century. I know everyone understands the \nimportance of developing renewable energy resources in homes and \nbusinesses without compromising our air or water quality. Senator \nJeffords, in his position as chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, is in a very good position to proceed on this. That is \nwhat he is going to do. He will offer a second-degree amendment to \nincrease the supply of renewables. He will offer that at a later time.\n  Congress needs to step up to the plate and diversify this Nation's \nenergy supply by stimulating the growth of renewable energy, America's \nabundant and untapped renewable energy, and fuel our journey to a more \nprosperous tomorrow. We should harness the brilliance of the Sun, the \nstrength of the wind, and the heat of the Earth to provide clean, \nrenewable energy for our Nation.\n  Other nations are developing renewable energy sources at a faster \nrate than we are in the United States. Ten years ago, America produced \n90 percent of the world's wind power; today, 25 percent of the world's \nwind power. Germany has the lead in wind energy, and Japan in solar \nenergy. They are using technology that we developed, but we are not \nmoving forward on it. They have surpassed us because their governments \nhave provided support for renewable energy production and use.\n  In the United States today, we get less than 3 percent of our \nelectricity from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and \ngeothermal. But the potential from a State such as Nevada is \nunbelievably large. To meet the goals for 2013, for example, Nevada \nhas, through their State legislature, indicated they must produce more \nelectricity. I am proud of the State of Nevada for doing that. They \nhave set goals. If they set goals, there is no reason we as a Federal \nGovernment cannot set goals.\n  In Saudi Arabia--we refer to them as the energy source of the world--\nthey literally can punch a hole on top of the ground and oil comes out. \nWe do not do that in the United States; it is hard to get our oil. \nHowever, Nevada is referred to as a Saudi Arabia of geothermal. My \nState can use geothermal to meet a third of its electricity needs. \nToday, this source of energy produces only a little over 2 percent of \nour electricity needs. We must reestablish America's leadership in \nrenewable energy.\n  How can Congress help? Clearly, the two most important legislative \nmeans are a renewable portfolio standard and a production tax credit. \nThe renewable portfolio standard provides a strategic framework for \nrenewable energy development while the production tax credit acts as a \nmarket force. They are both essential. We need a permanent production \ntax credit to encourage businesses to invest in wind farms, geothermal \nplants, and solar arrays.\n\n  Within the stimulus bill we passed, and the President signed last \nweek, there is a tax credit for wind. We had that before. It is so \nimportant. All over America we have companies wanting to go forward \nwith wind farms. They could not do it because they did not have the tax \ncredit. Now, within a short period of time, they are off and running \nagain.\n  When the wind energy tax credit first came into being, it took a \nlittle over 22 cents to produce a kilowatt of electricity by wind. At \nthe same time, coal and natural gas was 2 cents to 3 cents. Wind was \nway behind these other two sources. But today, because of the tax \ncredit, wind is the same price as coal and natural gas. That is why we \nneed to make sure we have a production tax credit. It would cause \npeople to invest in wind farms. We also need it, though, Mr. \nPresident--we do not have the same tax credit for Sun, solar. We do not \nhave it for geothermal. We do not have it for biomass--and we need to \nget that. That is why I am looking forward with great interest to the \nFinance Committee Chairman's work, Senator Baucus, to offer something \non this bill to allow us to do that.\n  A permanent tax credit would provide business certainty and ensure \nthe growth of renewable energy development. It would signal America's \nlong-term commitment to renewable energy. As I have already said, I \nlook forward to Senator Baucus's bill.\n  I hope to have more to say about the production tax credit when we \nbegin debate on the tax provisions of the energy bill. For the time \nbeing, let me focus my remarks on the need for a national renewable \nportfolio standard.\n  I see the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee is \nin the Chamber. I say to my friend, I have been indicating you are \ngoing to offer a second-degree amendment at a subsequent time to the \nBingaman amendment, which has not yet been laid down.\n  I have been laying on the Senate all the reasons you are so visionary \nin offering this amendment.\n  We have to do this. I said earlier to those here in the Chamber that \nthis energy bill has turned into an interesting\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\nbill. On the one hand, people want to produce more by drilling in ANWR. \nThat is not going to happen. We also wanted to increase the fuel \nefficiency of cars. That is not going to happen. I think all we have \nleft to point to for progress with energy policy in this country is \nyour amendment.\n  I really do believe we need to do more with wind, Sun, geothermal, \nand biomass. So I commend and certainly applaud my friend from Vermont \nfor his work in this area.\n  As I indicated, there is no question that the amendment of Senator \nJeffords, which I understand will call, in 2020, for a 20-percent \nrenewable portfolio standard--starting at 5 percent in 2005. A 20-\npercent goal is achievable.\n  I am proud that Nevada has adopted the most aggressive renewable \nportfolio standard in the Nation, requiring that 5 percent of the \nState's electricity needs be met by renewable energy resources in \n2003--that is next year--and then climbing to 15 percent by the year \n2013.\n  If Nevada can meet its renewable energy goal of 15 percent by 2013, \nthen the Nation certainly should be able to meet its goal, 20 percent, \nin the Jeffords amendment.\n  To meet the goals of 2013, Nevada will develop 400 megawatts of wind, \n400 megawatts of geothermal, and will do other things such as solar and \nbiomass facilities. But it can be done. If it can be done in Nevada, it \ncertainly can be done in the rest of our Nation. Fourteen States have \nalready adopted a renewable portfolio standard. Why? Because they \nbelieve it works. We need a renewable portfolio standard, national \nstandard, to ensure the energy security of this Nation and diversify \nour energy supply; to reduce the price volatility in energy markets; to \nset clear, reachable goals for the growth of renewable energy \nresources; to establish a system of tradable credits that allow a \nutility flexibility to meet these goals and reduce the cost of \nrenewable energy technologies to create a national market.\n\n  I was listening to public radio one morning last week. I was stunned \nto hear a report of an article in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation that linked, clearly, lung cancer to soot particles from \npowerplants and motor vehicles. This study was exhaustive--500,000 \npeople in 16 American cities whose lives and health have been tracked \nsince 1982, for 20 years. Experts gave the study high marks.\n  The conclusions are obvious. We need to improve the quality of our \nair for the health and well-being of the American people.\n  These adverse health effects cost us billions in medical care, and \ntheir cost in human suffering cannot be measured.\n  My good friend, Senator Jeffords, knows better than anyone that \nAmerica needs to build its energy future on an environmental foundation \nthat doesn't compromise air and water quality.\n  If we begin to factor in environment and health effects, the real \ncost of energy becomes more apparent. At the Nevada Test Site, I have \nindicated to the Senate what could happen there with solar power \nproduction. But a new wind farm there--it has already received \npermission from the DOE to be built--will provide 260 megawatts to meet \nthe needs of 260,000 Nevadans. The energy cost for this wind farm will \nbe 3 cents to 4.5 cents per kilowatt hour with the benefit of \nproduction tax credits. There are concerns about migratory birds, but \nbasically that is the only environmental impact--some birds may hit the \nwindmills. We will work on that, but that is the only environmental \nimpact. There are no adverse health impacts to humans.\n  Taking health and environmental effects into account, wind still \ncosts, as I have indicated, about 3 cents per kilowatt hour. Compare \nthat to coal.\n  About half the electricity in the United States is generated by coal. \nIt is going to be that way for a while. But in Nevada, it is an even \nhigher percentage. That is why development of clean coal technology is \nvital. I supported Senator Byrd in all his efforts for clean coal \ntechnology. We have a northern Nevada clean coal plant. Energy costs \nfor new coal plants are about the same as wind. But coal mine dust \nkilled 2,000 U.S. miners a year. Since 1973, the Federal black lung \ndisease benefits program has cost $35 billion. Coal emissions cause \npollution and adverse health effects. Taking health and environmental \neffects into account, using coal actually costs us, some say, up to 8.3 \ncents per kilowatt hour.\n  So a national renewable energy portfolio standard by 2020 will not \nonly protect the environment and the health of our citizens, it would \ncreate nearly $80 billion in new capital investments, and $5 billion a \nyear in property tax revenues to communities.\n  Renewable technologies are highly capital intensive. As a result, we \ntypically pay much more in income taxes per megawatt produced than \nconventional fossil fuel plants. A recent analysis by the National \nRenewable Energy Laboratory points out that Federal royalties and \nincome taxes generated by geothermal plants are 3 to 4 times that of \nelectricity produced from new natural gas combined-cycle powerplants.\n\n  So replacing conventional powerplants with renewable powerplants mean \nmore tax revenue to the Treasury, even with the production tax credit \nin place.\n  In places such as Nevada, expanding renewable energy production will \nprovide jobs in rural areas, areas that have been largely left out of \nAmerica's recent economic growth.\n  I say to my friend from Vermont, I appreciate the information in your \nlegislation that says rural electrics will not be bound by this. So \npeople do not have to worry about these local areas having to meet this \n20-percent margin. Renewable energy, as an alternative to traditional \nenergy sources, is a commonsense way to make sure American people have \na reliable source of power at an affordable price.\n  The World Energy Council estimates that global investment in \nrenewable technologies over the next 10 years will total up to $400 \nbillion. With a renewable portfolio standard in place, American \ncompanies will be ready to lead the way in the 21st century by tapping \nthe Nation's vast potential of clean renewable energy. Congress should \npass energy legislation with a vision that looks to the future and \nassures the Nation of continued prosperity and a cleaner environment.\n  This Congress, this Senate, must commit ourselves to renewable energy \nfor the security of the United States, for the protection of our \nenvironment, and for the health and welfare of our people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3014 to Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Nevada for the \nexcellent statement on the importance of renewable energy. He and \nSenator Jeffords have really made the case.\n  I want it understood that I very much share Senator Reid's views with \nrespect to renewable energy. He and Senator Jeffords have really been \nour leaders.\n  This amendment has been cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  As I begin my remarks, I would especially like to express my \nappreciation to Senators Bingaman, Murkowski, Leahy, and Hatch. All of \nthem have been very gracious in terms of working with me on this issue.\n  This amendment would establish within the Department of Justice the \nOffice of Consumer Advocacy. This is especially important right now \nbecause our Nation's electric power system is undergoing dramatic \nchanges. New sources of power are produced by State-regulated utility \ncompanies. Unregulated power marketers are providing an increasing \nshare of new power generation in this country.\n  At the State level, many States--in fact, the majority of the \nStates--have put in place consumer advocates whose job it is to stand \nup for the energy ratepayer. The fact is that across this country, in \nthe last year, America's energy consumers--particularly senior citizens \nand small businesses--have many millions of dollars taken from their \npockets. The fact is that the Federal Government really is not in a \nposition to deal with many of the rate hikes, nor are the State \ngovernments, because much of this activity relates to energy trading \nand energy activity that is interstate in nature.\n  We have the States across the country trying to stand up for the \nratepayer. Many of the legislatures have created these consumer \nadvocates that monitor energy prices to make sure the State-regulated \nutilities are charging fair rates. But when power is being traded like \npork bellies and so much of the energy business has moved interstate, \nthe State advocates have no way to investigate or address the wholesale \npower prices that eventually raise retail consumer rates and that are \nspawned by interstate activity.\n\n  What I am proposing in this legislation--which is a part of what my \ncolleagues, Senators Bingaman, Murkowski, Hatch, and Leahy, have \nalready made clear--is that we will continue to refine this bill as we \ngo through the legislative process, and we will create a Federal \nadvocate for the energy consumer. That advocate at the Department of \nJustice will have the authority to address the interstate trading of \nwholesale power and to spotlight unfair wholesale price hikes before \nthey get to the State-regulated utilities and their retail ratepayers.\n  My view is that consumer advocates provide an independent watchdog \nover a variety of important issues that come before the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission and a number of agencies that affect energy \npolicy and the American consumer.\n  Power, of course, used to be produced and sold by State-regulated \nutilities. Those advocates were able to watchdog the entire process. \nBut today, with State advocates being forced to rubberstamp a lot of \nthese electric rate increases caused by spikes in interstate wholesale \nprices, consumers are more vulnerable than ever before. The purpose of \nthis amendment is to close the gap which is leaving consumers \nunprotected from wholesale wheeling and dealing.\n  When prices spike in the wholesale energy market, the fact is that \nour States and public utility commissions really do not have the \nauthority to challenge these rate increases due to increased wholesale \nprices. But the Federal consumer advocate could ask for protection of \nconsumer interests. If the increases weren't just and reasonable, the \nadvocates could represent the consumer in a complaint before the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, challenging those prices.\n  Some may say as they consider this issue that there really isn't a \nneed for a Federal advocate, that utilities and other buyers of energy \ncan bring cases on their own at the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission if someone is manipulating the market. But that approach \nwon't work when the buyer of energy is the utility owned by an energy \nmarketer. The utility isn't going to bring a case at the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission against its parent company.\n  In cases where a utility engages in transactions with the parent \ncompany, the consumer advocate can independently investigate to make \nsure the utility ratepayers are not harmed by deals which enrich the \nparent company at the expense of the utility and its ratepayers.\n  A number of organizations support this legislation. I want to take a \nminute to particularly commend the American Association of Retired \nPersons. I have worked with them on these issues, going back to my days \nwhen I was codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers and ran a voluntary \nlegal aid program for the elderly. They have pulled together a \ngrassroots juggernaut on behalf of this effort involving the public \ninterest--research organizations, State associations of advocates for \nratepayers, and the ones that I think do a very good job given the \nlimited tools they have today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a set of letters endorsing this \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                Washington DC,\n\n                                                February 28, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate begins consideration of S. 517, \n     the comprehensive energy bill, we urge you to support several \n     amendments that would protect consumers, especially as \n     electricity markets continue to be deregulated.\n       First, Senator Wyden will likely be introducing an \n     amendment to create an Office of Consumer Advocacy to handle \n     energy issues within the Department of Justice (DOJ). This \n     new office will represent the interests of consumers within \n     the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), before the \n     courts and in front of Congress. Having an independent energy \n     ombudsman within DOJ will provide important protections for \n     consumers as FERC continues to deregulate the electricity \n     market. Nothing demonstrates the need for this office more \n     than the price spikes and blackouts in the western \n     electricity market in 2000-2001. Moreover, the office will \n     serve to protect consumers as FERC performs its general day-\n     to-day energy sector oversight functions, which will become \n     ever more crucial as the growing Enron scandal unfolds and \n     efforts are made to provide greater oversight of energy \n     trading markets.\n       With regard to the energy trading markets, Senator \n     Feinstein is planning to address regulatory shortcomings made \n     evident by Enron's collapse through an amendment that would \n     provide for regulatory oversight by the Commodity Futures \n     Trading Commission (CFTC) of derivative transactions on \n     energy commodities. This would ensure that energy traders \n     cannot operate without appropriate federal oversight that \n     makes market transactions transparent. Given that it was the \n     CFTC that initially allowed these types of transactions to \n     escape scrutiny, it is important that Congress be explicitly \n     clear in this legislation regarding what it expects of the \n     CFTC in closing this loophole. In addition, we believe that \n     it would be appropriate for FERC to have a greater role in \n     this area as its primary concern should be the stability of \n     the nation's energy markets, while the CFTC is set up to \n     protect investors.\n       To further address the market problems that have become \n     clear in the wake of the western electricity crisis, Senator \n     Cantwell is planing to offer an amendment that would direct \n     FERC to define precisely what a competitive market is and \n     establish rules for when market-based rates will be \n     permitted. In addition, the amendment would put in place \n     market monitoring procedures so that FERC can better detect \n     problems, before they lead to a complete breakdown in the \n     market, and give FERC more authority to take action to \n     protect consumers when the market is failing. This change is \n     necessary to ensure that electricity suppliers do not \n     continue to manipulate the market to the detriment of \n     consumers, as was seen in the western market in 2000-2001.\n       S. 517 would simply repeal the Public Utility Holding \n     Company Act (PUHCA) in its entirety, including consumer \n     protections that have been in place for decades. Now, more \n     than ever, it is clear that these protections are absolutely \n     necessary. We believe that regulators could have used their \n     authority under PUHCA to prevent some of the abuses that have \n     come to light in the Enron debacle. If there are going to be \n     amendments to PUHCA to make it more relevant to today's \n     situation, then Congress must take affirmative steps to \n     ensure that PUHCA's consumer\n\n[[Page S1894]]\n\n     protection provisions remain in force, and where necessary \n     are strengthened. For example, Senator Wyden will likely \n     offer an amendment, which we support, to require that \n     transactions between utilities and their affiliates be \n     transparent, and to shield consumers from the costs and \n     risks of interaffiliate transactions. The amendment would \n     provide for: Streamlined FERC review of utility \n     diversification efforts to ensure that there is \n     appropriate regulatory oversight so that consumers are not \n     the victims of abusive affiliate transactions; and \n     structural limits on affiliate transactions to protect not \n     only consumers, but unaffiliated competitors as well.\n       Finally, Senators Dayton and Conrad are planning to offer \n     an amendment that would ensure that mergers in the energy \n     sector ``promote the public interest,'' based on objective \n     criteria that would be evaluated by FERC. Under current law, \n     all that is necessary for merger approval is a determination \n     that the merger is ``consistent with the public interest.'' \n     Given the wave of mergers sweeping through the electric \n     industry, and the collapse of meaningful competition in \n     California and other states, we believe that a more \n     protective standard than the current one is necessary to \n     adequately protect consumers from abuse. FERC must hold the \n     public interest paramount in evaluating any potential energy \n     company mergers. The Dayton/Conrad amendment would: Establish \n     criteria for FERC to consider in order to determine that a \n     merger would ``promote the public interest,'' including \n     efficiency gains, impact on competition, and its ability to \n     effectively regulate the industry; clarify that these \n     provisions would apply to all potential financial \n     arrangements (not just stock acquisitions) which could lead \n     to exertion of control over the entity, including \n     partnerships; and clarify that FERC review applies to all \n     electric and gas combinations.\n       We would also like to reiterate our organizations' support \n     for Senator Jeffords' efforts to include a national renewable \n     portfolio standard in the legislation, which would help \n     diversify our energy mix and avoid future energy shortages \n     and price spikes. We also support the Kerry/Hollings \n     provision in the legislation to raise the national corporate \n     average fuel economy (CAFE) standards, which will likewise \n     help to provide energy security and protect the environment. \n     In addition, we urge you to oppose efforts that will damage a \n     pristine Alaskan ecosystem, supposedly in the name of energy \n     security--the supply is too limited, the environment too \n     fragile, and the costs too high.\n       Thank you for considering the needs and concerns of \n     consumers while moving forward with this legislation. Please \n     do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or \n     need any information regarding how this comprehensive energy \n     package will affect consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n     Adam J. Goldberg,\n       Policy Analyst, Consumers Union.\n     Mark N. Cooper,\n       Director of Research, Consumer Federation of America.\n     Anna Aurelio,\n       Legislative Director, U.S. PIRG.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                             State Utility Consumer Advocates,\n\n                                 Silver Spring, MD, March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman: I am writing to express the \n     National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates \n     strong support for an amendment we expect to be offered by \n     Senator Wyden establishing an Office of Consumer Advocacy in \n     the Department of Justice.\n       Restructuring experiences in the states have consistently \n     shown that the road to competition is a rocky one. In many \n     instances, consumers have faced higher prices and limited, if \n     any, choices. State consumer advocate offices have worked \n     diligently to protect consumers during this difficult \n     transition.\n       However, they have found their limited resources (half of \n     our members' budgets are $1 million or less with less than 10 \n     employees) stretched to the limit, particularly as wholesale \n     prices set by FERC in Washington increasingly determine what \n     consumers ultimately pay back home. Most consumer advocate \n     offices simply do not have the resources to fight in both \n     venues.\n       An Office of Consumer Advocacy would give residential \n     consumers much needed representation in Washington and a \n     fighting chance to benefit from legislation passed by \n     Congress. We urge you to support this critical amendment.\n       Thank you for your leadership to enact comprehensive energy \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Charles A. Acquard,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as I indicated earlier, my colleagues--\nparticularly Senators Bingaman, Murkowski, Leahy, and Hatch--have been \nvery gracious in working with me on this position. We are going to \ncontinue to work with them as this legislation is considered in the \nSenate and when this bill gets to conference.\n  As we go forward with this today, I hope we will ensure that there is \na strong Federal presence to advocate for the consumer. I think these \nadvocates at the State level do a good job given their limited \nresources.\n  Given the fact that so much of the energy business has moved \ninterstate, and those interstate transactions can result in higher \nbills to small businesses in Georgia, Oregon, and across this country \nfor senior citizens and others of modest means, I think we need to now \nhave a Federal advocate.\n  I am pleased we have been able to assemble a bipartisan group that is \ngoing to help pass this today and continue to work to refine it as it \nis considered through the evolution of this legislation in the Senate \nand in conference.\n  I ask the Senate to approve the amendment at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is a good amendment. I congratulate \nthe Senator from Oregon for his leadership in bringing this amendment \nto the Senate and for us to consider it as part of this bill. It has \nbeen cleared on both sides. I am authorized by the Republican manager \nas well to indicate that.\n  There is a lot already in the bill that protects consumers. \nObviously, a main theme of this bill is to empower and protect \nconsumers. This will add to that and further strengthen the bill.\n  We very much appreciate the cooperation of the other side in having \nthis amendment added.\n  I urge all colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3014) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to address, in a few moments, \nthe pending issue involving the energy bill, particularly when it comes \nto the renewable portfolio standard for energy. Before I do that, \nthough, I ask the indulgence of the Senate for a few moments to address \nan unrelated issue which I think is of critical importance to our \nNation.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the pending matter \nbeing debated concerning the renewable portfolio standard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, if I may propound a unanimous consent \nrequest before my colleague from Illinois continues with his comments, \nI ask unanimous consent, since we have a vote at 2 o'clock on the \nThomas amendment, that at 1:50 we reserve 10 minutes equally divided \nbetween Senator Thomas and myself where he can explain his amendment, \nand I can explain the arguments against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will try to make my presentation briefer \nso they have more time if needed. I thank the Senator from New Mexico \nfor his leadership on this issue.\n  This is supposed to be an energy bill which is going to give America \nmore energy security, make us more independent of foreign oil sources, \nclean up our environment, and provide for the energy needs of the \ngrowing American economy in the 21st century. That is a tall order for \nany single piece of legislation.\n  What happened on the floor of the Senate yesterday calls into \nquestion whether or not we are facing this challenge responsibly. If we \ncannot pass a fuel economy standard, a fuel efficiency standard for \ncars and trucks in America, then we have given a great victory not only \nto the special interests who are fighting it but a great victory to \nOPEC. Yesterday was a wonderful day of victory for OPEC and all of\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\nthe foreign oil producers who have America hooked on foreign sources of \noil.\n  We came to the Senate floor and, by a vote of 67 to 32, better than a \n2-to-1 margin, we rejected the notion that we would establish new fuel \nefficiency standards for cars and trucks in America. We haven't had \nsuch a standard since 1985. So for 17 years, no progress has been made. \nAnd by its decision, 67 to 32 yesterday, this Senate said: And we are \nnot interested in changing it in the future.\n  The Senate gave authority to NHTSA, the National Highway \nTransportation Safety Administration, to take a look at it, consider \nit, view it, wrestle with it, to get back to us when they want to. That \nis totally unacceptable. It is an abdication of our responsibility to \nfuture generations. It is a decision which will come back to haunt us \nas we continue to be dependent on foreign energy sources.\n  This is going to drag us into political tight fixes and situations \naround the world where American lives will be at stake because the \nSenate does not have the courage to stand up and say to the American \npeople: we need to give real leadership; to say to the Big Three in \nDetroit: you can do a better job, you can make better cars and trucks, \nand we challenge you to do it over a period of time; and to say to the \nAmerican people: yes, you may not be able to buy the fattest, biggest \nSUV that can come out of your dream sequence, but we believe you can \nhave a vehicle that is safe and fuel efficient for you and your family \nand your business.\n  We were unwilling to do that yesterday--too much to ask of the \nAmerican people to consider that possibility. I looked at some of the \ncomments that were written and said on the floor yesterday suggesting \nthat the American people are just too self-centered to be prepared to \nmake any sacrifices for the good of this country. How could anybody \nstart with that premise after what we have seen since September 11?\n\n  This country is prepared to roll up its sleeves and fight the war on \nterrorism. This country is prepared to sacrifice if necessary to make \nus more secure. The families and businesses across this country are \nwaiting for leadership from this Congress to make this a better, safer, \nand stronger Nation.\n  Yesterday, colleagues in opposition to fuel efficiency said: We \nwouldn't dare ask Americans to consider making that kind of sacrifice.\n  I am sorry. We missed a golden opportunity. I am afraid today we are \nabout to do the same thing. It is bad enough that we can't have fuel \nefficiency standards. Now we are talking about what is known as a \nrenewable portfolio which means looking at alternative forms of energy \nthat do not threaten the environment and give us energy independence.\n  I applaud Senator Jeffords of Vermont. I was happy to cosponsor his \namendment. He says America should move to the point where in the year \n2020, about 18 years from now, 20 percent of our electricity is \ngenerated from renewable sources. Today it is about 4 percent. The \nunderlying bill sets a goal of about 10 percent.\n  Why is this important? Because as we find other sources for \nelectricity, we lessen our dependence on foreign sources, and we also \nhave a cleaner environment. We create a new industry to promote and \nproduce this technology which is going to make us less and less \ndependent on our current sources for the generation of electricity. \nThose sources would obviously be, in most instances, coal; in some \ninstances it would be gas, natural gas; oil; or it could be nuclear.\n  I come from a State that produces coal. I would like to see us return \nto the day when coal becomes an environmentally responsible alternative \nto other sources of energy. I have voted, for 20 years, and I will \ncontinue to do so, for research to find ways to use that coal in an \nenvironmentally sensible way so that we can promote energy sources in \nthe United States not at the expense of America's public health. We \nneed to do that.\n  At the same time, we need to look to other sources that are benign, \nsources that can produce electricity without damaging the environment \nin any way. One of those that is clearly obvious is wind power. This is \na new concept for a lot of people. They have not seen the wind \ngenerating stations across the United States, but they are popping up \nall over the place. Senator Grassley from Iowa is in the Chamber. The \nState of Iowa is seeing more and more of the wind-generated turbines \nthat are, frankly, generating electricity for small and large uses. \nThat makes a lot of sense, and it is part of the renewable portfolio.\n  It is important for us to keep an eye on these elements that can give \nus energy independence and a cleaner environment.\n  Wind power is used for electricity. It lights our homes, our office \nbuildings, and powers our industries. It is very misleading for people \nto say we don't need to worry about wind power; we are going to go and \ndrill for oil and gas in the Arctic; we are going to go to the ANWR \narea, the National Wildlife Refuge. That seems to be the only answer \nfrom the other side of the aisle when you talk about America's future \nenergy needs. I think that is a false choice and a bad choice. There \nare many other concepts of conservation and fuel efficiency and making \ncertain that we have alternative fuels that are going to be encouraged.\n  Can this be done? Can we really move to a 20-percent standard by the \nyear 2020? We would have to work hard at it. We would have to have \nleadership in Washington. Take a look at some of the other countries \naround the world that have said they are going to do the same thing. \nDenmark, Spain, and Germany are already near 20 percent in their \nelectricity production just from wind turbines alone. The European \nUnion has a goal of reaching 22-percent renewable energy in electricity \nby the year 2010. The State of Nevada has a 15-percent RPS by 2013. \nConnecticut and Massachusetts are looking for similar goals. The State \nof California is currently at 12 or 13 percent in their renewable \nportfolio. The city of Chicago, under the leadership of Mayor Daley, \nhas said they will move toward more wind power as a source of \nelectricity.\n  In individual settings around the country and around the world, \nleaders are stepping up and saying: We accept the challenge. We believe \nwe can do this. Whether we are going to use wind power, solar energy, \ngeothermal or biomass, there are ways to do it that can be attained and \nattained successfully.\n  There will be critics who will come to the floor and say this is an \nidea that is also flawed, much like fuel efficiency in vehicles. They \nwill toss out this opportunity for us to look ahead with vision and \ndetermination to become a nation that is more energy secure, more \nenergy independent, and using sources of energy that are more \nenvironmentally acceptable.\n  I say to my colleagues: I hope we don't gut this provision when it \ncomes to the renewable portfolio. Senator Jeffords has a valuable \nsuggestion. I hope it is offered and that it passes. Please, let's not \ngo any further down the chain lower than the 10 percent that is being \ncalled for by the underlying bill. If this is truly going to be an \nenergy bill to meet our Nation's energy needs, we have to address the \nreal issues of fuel efficiency, of conserving energy in this country, \nand of finding alternative sources that are environmentally acceptable.\n  At this point, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement \nentered into, we reserved 10 minutes--5 for myself, 5 for Senator \nThomas--and I think the protocol is that since Senator Thomas has the \namendment, he would want his 5 minutes last. I will go ahead with my \nstatement at this point and urge people not to support the Thomas \namendment.\n  Let me, once again, make the large points that need to be made. I \nwill put up the map of the country again. These are the electricity \nregions that are all over the country. This largest one, by far, of \ncourse, is in the western part of the country and contains 14 States. \nThe amendment before us, which Senator Thomas offered, is an amendment\n\n[[Page S1896]]\n\nthat the Western Governors' Association has put together, which, as I \nsee it, does several things.\n  First, it dramatically complicates the process by which we try to \nensure that the system for transmitting power around this country is \nreliable. Let me put up another chart that tries to make that point. I \nwill not go through every detail of it. I will try to make the point \nthat if a complaint is filed and it is indicated that some utility is \nnot abiding by the standards that need to be abided by in order to \nensure the reliability of the system, and it is not doing what is \nrequired, then under Senator Thomas's amendment you have a very complex \nprocedure that could, in fact, take place, where the electric \nreliability organization that is called for in his amendment decides it \nwants to take action, and before it can, it is required to give notice, \nhave a hearing. If it decides to take action, all it is permitted to do \nis impose a penalty. It cannot compel compliance or issue an order \ncompelling compliance, as FERC can.\n  This electric reliability organization is also required to approve \nregional entities and delegate enforcement authority to them; and there \nare presumptions written into this that say, just in the western part \nof the country, just in this area here in the pink, there are \nrebuttable presumptions that anything they do is right--that FERC has \none set of standards that apply to the rest of the country, but in this \narea there are rebuttable presumptions that what is done is accurate.\n  In my view, this complicates matters. It is an inconsistent set of \nrules. It is not an appropriate set of national rules. It is not fair, \nquite frankly, to the rest of the country. I come from a State that is \nin this area, so perhaps I should be on the other side of this issue. \nBut this is not good national policy. In my view, it is not fair to a \nlot of the other States. We have letters I have put into the Record \nalready to indicate that various of the regional transmission \norganizations are upset about this inconsistent treatment.\n  Quite frankly, the complexity of this amendment undercuts any \nmeaningful accountability in the system. We have been trying to ensure \nthat someone can be held accountable when the lights go out, when the \nelectricity quits flowing. You have to know whom to call to say they \nhave fallen down on the job: it was your responsibility to do this, and \nyou have fallen down on the job.\n  Under this amendment, it is going to be really tough to tell whom you \nought to call because the electric reliability organization might be \nthe right one, or the regional entity might be, or FERC might have some \nauthority. Quite frankly, we can see the time down the road when we can \nwind up with a hearing in the Energy Committee, the lights will have \ngone out somewhere in the country, power will have failed, and we will \ncall in the FERC Commissioners and say: What is the problem? Why were \nyou not doing your job? They will say: We were doing our job. Under the \nstatute you passed, you told us to presume these people knew what they \nwere doing. It was a rebuttable presumption. We took you at your word. \nIt turns out they didn't know what they were doing.\n  I think the proposal we have in the underlying bill is far \npreferable, much simpler. It puts accountability right at FERC and \ngives FERC flexibility to continue to defer to the industry \norganization, continue to defer to regional organizations, as they \ndetermine appropriate. I urge people to oppose the Thomas amendment on \nthose grounds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have gone over this pretty thoroughly. \nWe have pretty much explained the direction we are taking.\n  I might say this to the Senator from New Mexico regarding his last \ncomment that FERC would have the authority to make these decisions. Now \nwe have local input and different kinds of things, but FERC has the \nauthority. To make the suggestion that FERC would somehow say we could \nnot do it simply is not accurate.\n  So we are trying to ensure transmission grids and delivery of \nelectricity that will be safe and reliable. Consumers need that. The \nlights will go on, and they must stay on.\n  The amendment I am offering establishes a nationwide organization \nthat has the authority to establish and enforce reliability standards. \nThe new reliability organization would be run by participants and be \noverseen by FERC. The idea that somehow there is no authority here is \nsimply not true. The reliability organization would be made up of \nrepresentatives of everybody affected--residential, commercial, \nindustrial, State, independent power producers, electric utilities, and \nothers, as opposed to only FERC.\n  There is no question but that we need a new system. The question is--\nwe can do it in different ways--how will we do it? It gives all the \nresponsibility to FERC and sets the standards. We agree that we need \nprotection. It is not whether we need it, but it is how we get it. I \nthink the Daschle bill takes the wrong approach; hence our amendment. \nWe know there are great differences in geography, market designs, and \neconomics over the different parts of the country. So we want to have \nthose people in those areas having input into how to resolve it in that \nparticular area. FERC is not necessarily sensitive to those particular \nchanges and differences that are there. So we believe very strongly we \nneed to do that.\n  There is a very important question to the Northwest, particularly, \nand that is standards applicable for transmission from Mexico and \nCanada. The Canadian import of power is particularly important, of \ncourse, and we don't want to let that happen. So this amendment \naddresses these concerns. It converts the existing NERC voluntary \nreliability system into a mandatory reliability system.\n  The new reliability organization will have enforcement powers with \nreal teeth to ensure reliability. The amendment provides mandatory \nreliability rules that will apply to all uses of the transmission grid. \nNo loopholes, nobody is exempted. It is the kind of thing, certainly, \nthat most of us believe is the direction we ought to take in \ngovernment; that is, to empower local people who are experts in what \nthey are doing.\n  FERC has been working for a very long time. When we look at the \nCalifornia situation of last summer, we see that reliability was the \nissue that was least important. Reliability was there. So we ought to \nuse that experience rather than trying to build a new bureaucracy in \nFERC which doesn't have the authority or the capability of doing these \nkinds of things.\n  I urge that you vote for this amendment.\n  If I might, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Shelby be added as a \ncosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I strongly support what the Senator from Wyoming has \nbrought to the floor. As we have moved to restructure the electrical \nsystems of our country, the Senator from New Mexico sweepingly turns it \ninto a Federal single authority without the kind of flexibility we have \nsought.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is absolutely correct. What we have had has \nstood the test of time. Western Governors believe in that. If you want \nto take the authority away from the States and put it with the \nbureaucracy in Washington, DC, then you would oppose the Senator from \nWyoming. I believe that is exactly the opposite direction in which we \nare heading. Therefore, I hope my colleagues will support the amendment \ndealing with the reliability issue of this important title.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I move to waive the pertinent section of \nthe Budget Act, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  I also have to add, we did not even know about this until 10 minutes \nago. We have not even had time to look at what they are talking about. \nThe Budget Committee is not able to tell us. I guess if my colleagues \nwant to play this game, we can do it on the whole bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S1897]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 60, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 49 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). On this vote the yeas are 60 \nand the nays are 40. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to and the point \nof order fails.\n  If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment No. 3012 of the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The amendment (No. 3012) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I will comment for a couple of minutes \nregarding what we went through in the last 20 minutes. I note the \npresence of the majority whip on the floor, for whom I have the \ngreatest respect and total trust in terms of fair treatment.\n  Regarding the point of order raised on this amendment, which no one \nknew about until it was raised, from what I can tell, on our side of \nthe aisle--it would have been a good and fair thing had it been called \nto the attention of the proponent of the amendment. I assure Members, \nhad the opponents of the amendment prevailed on the point of order, on \nthis particular amendment, all one had to do was change it. Instead of \ndirected spending, it would be subject to an appropriation and it would \nno longer be subject to a point of order, from what I have been \ninformed in my conversations with the Parliamentarian.\n  So that means we would just go through two votes because somebody \nthought making a point of order on the Budget Act would have gotten rid \nof that amendment. It would not have. Had that vote been 59 instead of \n60, we would fix the amendment, re-offer it, and do what I just said by \nway of altering it.\n  That could have all been understood between enlightened staffers and \nSenators who would like to do that. I don't think the Senators were \naware of it. I just raise it because it shocked me that this very \nimportant amendment, which I worked on and participated in, was subject \nto a point of order. I didn't know it or I would have advised them to \nfix it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I say to Senator Bingaman, no aspersions on you whatsoever on that.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, just to make clear for the information \nof my colleague, I did advise the sponsor of the amendment about a half \nhour before the vote that I had been informed that a Budget Act point \nof order could be raised, and I would intend to raise it. I understand \nfrom him now that was not adequate time for him to get the advice he \nneeded in this connection. Perhaps we should have delayed the vote for \na longer period. That was not even considered by me or him.\n  At this point, unless there are other Members seeking recognition, I \nwill offer another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico. \nI encourage Members to have our staffs try to work a little more \nclosely so we can avoid duplication.\n  Clearly, I personally had not been notified, although I was off the \nfloor. I was across the street with some of the folks who were putting \non a press conference. As a consequence, I had staff going back and \nforth.\n  Rather than belabor that point, I think the recognition that clearly \nwe had an alternative, as the senior Senator from New Mexico indicated, \nunder a budget provision, suggests that in the future we could work a \nlittle more closely to ensure we move along because there may be other \npoints of order on other amendments that will be coming up.\n  I encourage Senator Bingaman to proceed with his proposed amendment, \nand we will move on with this process. We look forward to \nparticipating.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3016 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3016 to amendment No. 2917.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Madam President, this amendment I am offering is a \nsubstitute amendment for the provision that is in the bill at the \ncurrent time related to renewable portfolio standards. I am offering it \ntoday to ensure\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\nwe establish a clear policy statement of our need as a nation to \ndiversify our power generation sector.\n  This amendment establishes a renewable portfolio standard for the \nelectricity sector. This is the corollary, as I see it, to the \nrenewable fuel standard that we have heard so many laudatory statements \nabout yesterday. This amendment will ensure that all retail sellers of \nelectricity have a portion of their generation--produce a portion of \ntheir generation from renewable resources.\n  The amendment is modeled after the very successful Texas program that \nPresident Bush implemented when he was Governor of Texas. The basic \noutline is as follows.\n  All retail sellers with annual sales greater than a million megawatt \nhours will be required to contract for and secure a certain amount of \ngeneration annually from eligible renewable resources. Most co-ops and \nmunicipals would be exempt.\n  Beginning January 2005, 2 years after the date of enactment, retail \nsuppliers will be required to include a minimum of 1 percent of \nrenewables in their electricity sales. The percentage would increase \nannually by .6 percent until 2020.\n  There are several adjustments to the calculation based on existing \nrenewables. A retailer can subtract from its sales base all existing \ngeneration from renewable generation resources, including hydro. The \nrenewable resources include solar, wind, ocean, biomass, landfill gas, \ngeothermal, generation offsets from renewables that are ``net metered'' \nat a customer's facility, and generation from incremental hydropower \nimprovements and incremental generation from repowering or cofiring.\n  For new renewables placed in service after the date of enactment, the \nretailer will get one credit per kilowatt hour generated; 2 credits for \nnet metered offsets; and 2 credits for grid-connected renewables on \nIndian land. Retailers can apply the credits to their own obligations, \nor they can sell the credits.\n  Existing nonhydro renewables, including municipal solid waste, can be \nused to offset a retail provider's own annual obligation, but they \ncould not be used for credit trading.\n  To facilitate the ramp-up of the program, retailers can start to \naccrue credits from the date of enactment, which they can bank to use \nwithin the next 5 years.\n  The first year of the program, the retailer may borrow against \nexpected generation to be installed within the next 3 years. The price \ncap of the lesser of 3 cents per kilowatt hour or 200 percent of the \naverage market value of credits for the previous year is contained in \nthe bill.\n  This is not a guarantee for any renewable generator. This is not a \nnew version of PURPA. Every renewable developer will have to compete in \nthe marketplace. There will be no bureaucrats dictating prices.\n  I think this would be a major step forward in ensuring that we do \ndevelop a diverse set of sources from which we can generate power in \nthis country. I commend to my colleagues the reports on the experience \nthey have had in Texas, in particular, since we have modeled this \nproposal closely after what was approved in Texas.\n  I think it is an excellent proposal. I hope very much at the \nconclusion of our deliberations on this renewable portfolio issue, this \namendment can be adopted.\n  I understand my colleague from Vermont is here and has a second-\ndegree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nBingaman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I believe Senator Bingaman and I can \njust indicate amendments that we have. I will certainly defer to you on \nSenator Jeffords. We have a couple of Collins amendments, I believe, on \nour side, and a Kyl amendment that we know about at this time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, for the information of my colleague, I \nam not familiar with the Collins amendments. But I do know of Senator \nJeffords' intent to offer an amendment, and I did know of Senator Kyl's \nintent to offer an amendment. I will be glad to consult with my \ncolleague about any additional amendments that would be offered.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I direct a question to the Senator from Alaska through the \nChair: The Collins amendment applies to the same subject matter?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In response to the Senator from Nevada, it is my \nunderstanding that they do. One is, I believe, on existing renewables, \nthat they would count. I am not sure that I have information on the \nother one at this time, but I will be happy to provide it.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alaska, it would be good if today \nwe can finish this renewable part of the amendment package. We do know, \nas has been talked about here, the amendment of the Senator from New \nMexico decreases what is in the bill 8.5 percent.\n  The Jeffords amendment increases it to 20 percent, and the Kyl \namendment would wipe out all of them.\n  We will be happy to work procedurally any way possible to have a fair \nvote and have this issue resolved. Maybe we could do all these votes \nlater this evening.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would be happy to encourage Senators on our side to \ncome over with their amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3017 to Amendment No. 3016\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3017 to amendment No. 3016.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment which \nwould do more to encourage development of renewable energy in this \ncountry than any other provision in the legislation currently before \nus.\n  My amendment will gradually increase the amount of electricity \ngenerated by renewable energy in this country to 20 percent by 2020.\n  I am deeply convinced that it is not only possible to achieve this \ngoal, it is the best policy for this country, and for our energy \nfuture.\n  For over 20 years I have pushed clean, renewable energy in this \nCongress.\n  In fact, 25 years ago when I came into this body, we were in another \nenergy crisis. That was brought about by the oil cartel that was \nholding up oil coming from the Middle East. We suffered greatly with \nlong lines of cars. I have been involved with this kind of a problem \never since then. In fact, during that period of time where we had \nproblems created by the OPEC cartel, I was able to offer very \nsignificant amendments, working with my partners at the time.\n  For instance, at that time, we introduced an amendment to make sure \nwe had a photovoltaic effort going on which would help increase the \nutilization of renewable energy by looking to the Sun for the answer. \nThat was a time when a number of us had come to Congress and were \nfreshmen, but we knew the kind of chaos we had.\n  The amendment was to the appropriations bill. It was an $18 million \namendment. I remember it very well. When I went to offer it, the \nchairman of the subcommittee, Tom Bevill of Alabama, came up to me and \nwrapped his arm around me. He said: Son, you don't offer amendments to \nappropriations bills until you have checked with me. I said: Gee, I am \nsorry, but I can't wait for that. He said: Well, why not? I said: \nBecause I have 80 cosponsors. He said: 80 cosponsors? I said: Yes, 80 \ncosponsors. He said: Well, I guess we will have to go ahead.\n  We went ahead. It passed. We created a photovoltaic industry in this \nNation at that time which brought forward a considerable amount of \nenergy relief.\n  In addition, at the same time, three of us--Congressman Mineta, \nCongressman Blanchard, and myself--introduced one to create development \nfor\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\nwind energy. At that time, we did not know who was going to get the \ncredit, so we all kind of flipped coins. The winner was Congressman \nBlanchard from Michigan who went on to be Governor. Of course, Norm \nMineta is now Secretary of Transportation. And I am still here.\n  But those really were the only two significant renewable energy \nprovisions that passed. They are still there. They were important \ncontributions. But it is time for us to put further emphasis and create \nfurther opportunities with respect to the renewable energy field.\n  It is hard not to, when you see the lakes and forests in my State \ndying from acid rain.\n  We have to clean up our act.\n  It is hard to read the health statistics from air pollution, \nparticularly for the very young and elderly, and not worry about the \nemissions that continue to pour from this country's smokestacks.\n  It is difficult not to care about renewable energy when the northern \nmaple trees are disappearing and our ocean temperatures are rising.\n  We all should care. I am disappointed that this White House and many \nin this Congress do not care quite enough.\n  It is unconscionable to continue to shackle ourselves to fuels that \ndirty our air and water, and that compromise our national security, \nwhen clean, abundant, and affordable domestic alternatives exist.\n  We owe something better to our children, to our environment and to \nour future.\n  The amendment that I am offering this morning would gradually \nincrease the amount of electricity produced from renewable energy \nnationwide, reaching 20 percent by the year 2020.\n  States are already out in the forefront on this issue, with 12 States \nhaving already enacted renewable energy standards and almost a dozen \nothers actively considering one.\n  Governor Bush signed one into law in Texas in 1999. Nevada law \ncurrently requires that 15 percent of state electricity come from \nrenewable energy by 2013, and California is on the verge of passing a \nstate requirement of 20 percent renewables by 2010. This is twice as \naggressive as the standard in my amendment.\n  The technology to produce renewables is clearly sufficient to meet \nthese standards.\n  During the more than 20 years that I have been in this Congress, the \ncosts of generating wind and solar energy have decreased by 80 percent. \nThroughout the world, wind is the fastest growing source of electricity \ngeneration, and in this country wind-generated electricity is generally \ncompetitive with traditional fossil and other fuels.\n  In 2001, the U.S. wind industry installed $1.7 billion worth of new \ngenerating equipment. As this chart illustrates, current installed wind \ncapacity almost doubled between 2000 and 2001, bringing total wind \ncapacity in the United States to 4,258 megawatts, representing billions \nof dollars in jobs and investments.\n  These two very different windmill projects, one from the 1800s and a \nmodern Texas wind farm, illustrate how wind has moved from the past, \nand into our future.\n  This Hawaii power plant is operating on geothermal energy, which is \nalso found abundantly throughout the American West.\n  This office complex in Louisville, KY, is heated and cooled by \ngeothermal heat pumps.\n  Vast sources of biomass, such as the wood pulp that fires this \nCalifornia power plant, are found throughout the United States. Biomass \ncurrently generates more electricity than any other U.S. renewable \nresource.\n  As for solar, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District estimates \nthat if every home built in California subdivisions each year had \nphotovoltaic energy roofs similar to the one in this picture, they \nwould produce the energy equivalent of a major 400 to 500 megawatt \npower plant every year.\n  So the technology to produce renewable energy is clearly here. The \nresources also are here. Vast quantities of wind power are found along \nthe East Coast, the West Coast, across large parts of the American West \nand across the Appalachian Mountain Chain. North Dakota also has \nconsistent wind energy sufficient to supply 36 percent of the \nelectricity needed in the lower 48 states.\n  The United States has the technical capacity to generate 4.5 times \nits current electricity needs from a combination of wind, bioenergy, \nand other renewable resources.\n  As to affordability, Federal studies have consistently shown that a \nFederal renewables standard of 20 percent will have little or no impact \non overall consumer energy costs. The most recent study by the \nDepartment of Energy's Energy Information Administration has found that \nconsumer prices for electricity under a 20 percent standard would be \nlargely the same as without one, resulting in an increase of only 3 \npercent by 2020.\n  Further, as indicated on the chart--with purple indicating ``business \nas usual,'' and green representing a 20 percent RPS by 2020--EIA \nstudies have shown that by 2020, a 20 percent Federal RPS would have no \nmeasurable impact on overall consumer energy bills, which would include \nelectricity bills along with home heating and cooling bills, and \ncommercial and industrial energy costs. So the technology is there, the \nresource is there, and the costs to consumers are minimal.\n  Despite this, the contribution of renewables to the U.S. electricity \nmarket is still well under 3 percent. We must help promote these \nindustries, the same way this Federal Government of our has assisted \ntraditional fuels such as coal, oil and gas, nuclear and hydropower \nthroughout their histories. We must level the playing field for the \nrenewables industry and facilitate market entry of these valuable \nresources.\n  Why focus so much on these resources? Renewable energy is good for \nthe environment, provides jobs and investment, and increases our energy \nsecurity.\n  The U.S. Department of Energy has found that, as the demand for \nenergy grows, without changes to Federal law, U.S. carbon emissions \nwill increase 47 percent above the 1990 level by the year 2020. \nHowever, as this chart shows--with green representing carbon emissions \nwith a 10 percent RPS by 2020, purple representing a 20 percent RPS by \n2020 and pink showing the improvements that can be made by additional \nenergy efficiency provisions--with a 20 percent renewables standard, \nU.S. carbon dioxide emissions will decrease by more than 18 percent by \nthe year 2020.\n  Adding renewables to our energy mix will also reduce emissions of \nmercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide, which contribute to the \nproblems of smog, acid rain, respiratory illness, and water \ncontamination.\n  A Federal 20 percent renewable energy standard will create thousands \nof new, high-quality jobs and bring a significant new investment to \nrural communities. It will create an estimated $80 million in new \ncapital investment, and more than $5 billion in new property tax \nrevenues.\n  It will bring greater diversity to our energy sector, creating \ngreater market stability, and reducing our vulnerability to terrorist \nattacks to our energy infrastructure.\n  For all these reasons, I strongly support a requirement that would \nachieve the maximum amount of renewable energy production in this \ncountry.\n  Claims that a 20 percent renewable portfolio standard by 2020 is \nimpossible to achieve, would cost the American consumer billions, and \nwould place an undue burden on industry are simply not supported by the \nfacts. Clearly, renewable standards below this 20 percent are easily \nachievable, and should be strongly supported by this body.\n  I urge my colleagues to support inclusion of a strong renewables \nstandard in this bill. Without such a standard, I think we all must \nquestion whether this bill is in fact going in the right direction to \nensure a clean, secure America.\n  My amendment creates a renewable energy standard under which \nutilities would be required to gradually increase the amount of \nelectricity produced from renewable energy resources, starting at 5 \npercent in 2005 and leveling out at 20 percent in 2020. That is plenty \nof time to adjust, plenty of time to make sure we can get to that goal \nwithout really creating any problems\n  This level allows a long ramp-up time before utilities must begin to \ncomply, and also gives them the flexibility of adjusting their \nrenewable energy generation within 5 year increments rather than every \nyear.\n\n[[Page S1901]]\n\n  My amendment places a cap on the cost of renewable energy credits by \nallowing retailers to purchase credits directly from the Secretary of \nEnergy at 3 cents per credit, thereby ensuring price predictability for \nretail suppliers.\n  The amendment recognizes the special economics of small entities, and \nexcludes small retailers which sell 500,000 megawatt hours or less of \nelectric energy from the requirements of the bill.\n  However, my amendment recognizes that not only do we want to \nencourage renewable energy production and purchase by these small \nentities, they comprise a large part of the market for larger \nretailers. The amendment therefore directs the Secretary of Energy to \napply money generated by the purchase of renewable energy credits to a \nprogram to maximize generation and purchase of renewable energy by \nthese small retailers.\n  My amendment will also allow utilities credit for existing renewable \nenergy production, thereby increasing the potential for additional \nrenewable production from existing facilities and rewarding those who \nhave taken the initiative to develop green energy.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to enlighten my colleagues \nabout renewables because we are going to be spending a good deal of \ntime on the issue of renewables. Senator Jeffords has called for an \nincrease to the underlying bill.\n  I want to make sure everybody knows that we didn't suddenly find \nrenewables. Renewables have been around for a long time. Some Members \naren't too sure of where we have been on renewables. Some are of the \nopinion that we haven't spent much money, time, or attention. Let me \ntry and turn that around because we have spent $6.4 billion on \nrenewables in the past 5 years. That money has been well spent. We are \ngoing to continue to spend money on renewables.\n  We spent $1.5 billion in direct research and development for \nrenewables; $500 million for solar; $330 million for biomass; $150 \nmillion for wind; $100 million for hydrogen; and nearly $5 billion in \ntax incentives; $2.6 billion in reduced excise taxes for alcohol fuels, \nethanol. So it is not that we have been asleep in this process.\n  The problem we have is that nonhydro renewables make up less than 4 \npercent of our total energy needs and less than 2 percent of our \nelectric consumption. I am sorry Senator Jeffords is not present. But \nit isn't that we don't support renewables; the question is, At what \nprice?\n  As I indicated, we spent $6.5 billion in the last 5 years, and we \nhave about 4 percent of our total energy needs in nonhydro renewables, \nand less than 2 percent of our electric consumption. We can throw \nenough money at this. The question is, How much do taxpayers and \nconsumers want to pay?\n  We have some charts. Before I show these charts, I want to show other \ncharts that show a little bit about the footprint of renewables. There \nis a misunderstanding on what kind of footprint is involved in the \nconsideration of renewables and the application of that footprint.\n\n  If you want to talk about solar, it certainly has an application in \ncertain areas. In my State of Alaska in the wintertime, it doesn't work \nvery well. Go up to Barrow where there are probably 4 months of \ndarkness; solar panels aren't going to work very well. Go down to the \nSouthern States; clearly they have an application. But they also have a \nfootprint. The same is true with windmills. They have a significant \nfootprint. I will show you some of those charts as soon as the staff \nbrings them to the Chamber.\n  The point I want to make is, we haven't walked into the discovery \nthat renewables are important. They are important. They are so \nimportant we have spent $6.5 billion in the last 5 years. They are so \nimportant that while we have concentrated on them, they still only \naddress 4 percent of our total energy needs and less than 2 percent of \nelectric consumption.\n  Let me show you a little bit about renewables. They are worthy of \nconsideration and further examination. Wind power is real as long as \nthe wind blows, but sometimes the wind doesn't blow. Around here, we \ncan usually generate enough hot air to keep a little draft going. \nSometimes it doesn't blow. This is the San Jacinto wind farm located \noutside of Banning, CA. If you have driven from Los Angeles to Palm \nSprings, you have driven through it. I guess we all have our views of \nthe beautiful mountains and what lies between the vision. That is a lot \nof windmills. They are probably in this picture, 150 windmills in the \nbackground. Some of them work; some don't.\n  Sometimes the transmissions are torn up because the wind doesn't \nalways blow at the same velocity. Sometimes there are problems. \nEngineering advancements have come along, and it is a significant \ncontributor to energy. What about the footprint? This particular wind \nfarm, which is one of the largest in the United States, takes about \n1,500 acres, and the energy production is 800 million kilowatts of \nelectricity. What does that equate to? That is about 1,360 barrels of \noil. So here we have an equation, 1,500 acres of footprint producing \n1,360 barrels of oil.\n  I hate to be rhetorical, but in comparison, what does 2,000 acres of \nANWR produce? One million barrels of oil.\n  Some people suggest that these windmills are Cuisinarts for the \nbirds. The birds do have a bit of a time getting through there if they \nare flying low. The point is, there is a footprint to renewables.\n  There are a couple other renewables we think highly of and want to \npromote. This is one: Solar panels. Solar panels produce the energy \nequivalent of 4,400 barrels of oil a day. That is 2,000 acres; 2,000 \nacres of solar panels is a lot of acreage. Two thousand acres of ANWR \nproduce 1 million barrels of oil a day. So, again, we are simply \ntalking about comparisons. It would take two-thirds of the State of \nRhode Island to equate to 448,000 acres which would produce as much \nenergy as 2,000 acres of oil in ANWR. So we virtually cover two-thirds \nof Rhode Island with solid solar panels.\n  We have another significant contribution to energy, and that is \nethanol. Ethanol is made from corn. There is a comparison here because \nif you took 2,000 acres of ethanol from the farm, 2,000 acres, and \nproduced the energy equivalent of that, it would produce 25 barrels of \noil a day.\n  Mr. President, 2,000 acres of ANWR will produce a million barrels a \nday. So you are talking about an awful lot of acreage to produce an \nequivalent. All I am talking about is a footprint. It\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\nwould take 80 million acres of farmland, or all of the land of New \nMexico and Connecticut, to produce as much energy as we can get out of \n2,000 acres of ANWR.\n  I think I have made my point, Mr. President. There is a footprint. \nRenewables are important. They do cost money. The question is, How much \ndoes the American taxpayer want to pay?\n  I rise in opposition to the renewable portfolio mandate. I oppose the \nFederal renewable mandate in the underlying Daschle bill. I oppose the \nFederal renewable mandate proposed by Senator Bingaman's amendment, and \nI also oppose the Federal renewable mandate proposed by Senator \nJeffords. The reason is all three are the same theme: Federal command \nand control of the market.\n  Now, all three propose that the Federal Government--Congress, as a \nmatter of fact--decides what kind of energy we like and don't like and, \nas a consequence, force the markets to comply with our views of \npolitical correctness. Let me say that again. Congress decides what \nkind of energy we like and what kind we don't like. Do we want Congress \nto pick the energy ``flavor of the month,'' so to speak, pick the \nwinners and the losers based on regional or local politics? It is one \nthing to support technologies on resource development by tax incentives \nor grants or other direct programs. We do that with conservation, \nrenewables, and our basic fuels. We encourage exploration and \ndevelopment in the ultra deepwaters of the Gulf of Mexico, as we \nshould. That is one thing, but arbitrary dictates on what you must buy, \nwell, that is another issue.\n  I oppose Federal command and control of the market. We have a free \nmarket in this country. If there is anything that we should have \nlearned from the past 200 years in this Nation's existence, it is that \nfree markets work and Government command and control, as a rule, \ndoesn't work. I think the proof is out there.\n  For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, we tried to micromanage the \nnatural gas business. What did we get? We got shortages and price \nspikes. When we deregulated natural gas, we got an abundant gas supply \nand lower prices.\n  Even more fundamental, the U.S. exists today and the Soviet Union \ndoes not exist. Our economy is the envy of the world. Their economy \ncollapsed. I have no doubt that this Nation, and our industry, can meet \nany demand we put upon them. There is no question that it can. If we \nput a man on the Moon, we can certainly build all the windmills we \nwant.\n  So the question isn't, Can it be done? The question is, Should it be \ndone? Should we dictate the market--have Congress tell consumers what \nis good energy and what is bad energy; what they should buy or should \nnot buy?\n  Mr. President, the consumers are better able to decide what is in \ntheir own best interest than is Congress. If consumers want to pay \nextra for ``green power,'' then they should be able to do it. A number \nof States have created programs to allow them to do that. In Colorado, \nfor example, there is a very robust market for green energy.\n  But I ask: Why should Congress tell consumers to purchase something \nthey don't want and that might not even be available? In my opinion, \nthe mandate is not honest. Those States with portfolio mandates have \nconsidered the costs and the fuel mix that is available and made a \ndecision.\n  This amendment decides that customers in Maine--which already has a \nlocally established 30-percent mandate based on local decisions--must \nbuy wind and solar renewables.\n  On its face, the amendment admits that there are utilities that will \nnot have access to the particular mix of fuels that the sponsors \nsupport. Their customers will be forced to pay for credits and to pay \nfor power that they may never receive--power that is uneconomical and \nnot available in their particular area.\n  Why is there this fascination with Federal preemption of State \ndecisions? If the Northwest wants to develop clean, emission-free \nhydro, why must they buy credits to support solar in from the \nSouthwest? The argument will be made that we need to foster renewables \nin order to lessen our dependence on foreign energy. That is a good \nargument--as far as it goes. But if they are really serious about \nlessening our foreign dependence, we need to do much more: Nuclear \npower--there is no cleaner form of power, zero emissions--oil from \nAlaska and other regions, such as the gulf, that have been shut down; \ncoal--we have all kinds of coal in this country; we are the Saudi \nArabia of coal; hydroelectric generation--zero emissions. It amazes me \nthat some people consider hydro nonrenewable.\n  Let me focus for a moment on the Federal renewable dictate in the \nunderlying Daschle bill, which is very similar to the Bingaman \namendment. The Daschle renewable dictate would require a 600-percent \nincrease in renewables by the year 2020. Let me repeat that--a 600-\npercent increase in renewables by 2020.\n  As I indicated in my earlier statement on renewables and what our \npercentage was, clearly, it is a cost. We have expended $6.4 billion in \nthe last 5 years, and it still constitutes less than 4 percent of our \ntotal energy needs and less than 2 percent of our electric consumption.\n  So the question is, If we are going to follow the Daschle renewable \ndictate, we would require a 600-percent increase in renewables by 2020, \nat what cost? Well, I don't think this is achievable. It might be, but \nit would drive costs simply through the roof. After 20-plus years of \nPURPA, and billions of dollars of renewable tax credits and other \nFederal subsidies, renewables today provide a very small percentage of \nU.S. electric power--approximately 2 percent.\n  The 10-percent additional renewable dictate, by 2020, would require 6 \ntimes the amount of renewables we are currently generating. Is a 10-\npercent dictate achievable? Well, anything is achievable, but at what \ncost?\n  We have a chart that shows what the Energy Information Administration \nof the Department of Energy has done. It is an analysis of the proposed \n10-percent renewable portfolio mandate. The EIA estimates that the cost \nof renewable portfolio mandate will grow to $12 billion per year by \n2020.\n  Let me refer to the chart. This chart is perhaps a little difficult \nto comprehend, but what we have are credits moving up in the blue to \nthe very top, where we are comparing, if you will, the penalty payments \nand the credit purchases. The credit purchases are in the light blue \nand the penalty is in the dark red.\n  As we start from 2005 with the credits, you can see they are roughly \nat $2 billion, and they go up in the year 2017 to approximately $10 \nbillion. And they go up more with the advent of the penalty payments.\n  So this attempts to show simply the escalating costs associated with \ntrying to achieve this 10-percent renewable portfolio mandate. There is \na corresponding reference as well. The theory is, as the renewables go \nup, the gas consumption comes down, and when the renewables go up, the \nprice of gas goes down, and the price of renewables comes down. So you \nhave a bit of a tradeoff there, and we can debate that.\n  The fact remains this kind of an increase to 10 percent from our \ncurrent 4 percent--actually 2 percent, less than 2 percent electric \nconsumption, 4 percent of total energy--comes at a significant cost.\n  Who is going to pay that, Mr. President? The consumers are going to \npay it. There is nobody else out there. The companies are not going to \nbe able to offset that cost out of their capital.\n  It is estimated that over a 15-year period, between 2005 and 2020, \nthe renewable portfolio dictate will cost a total of about $30 billion. \nWilbur Mills once said: A billion here, a billion there; after a while, \nit all adds up to real money. To an average family of four struggling \nto pay their grocery bill and put kids through college, this is a lot \nof money.\n  As is pointed out by the Energy Information Administration analysis \nof the renewable portfolio mandate:\n\n       In simple terms, a renewable portfolio standard is a way of \n     subsidizing . . . renewables . . . through a fee on . . .\n\n  What?\n\n     coal, gas, nuclear, and oil facilities.\n\n  It has to come from somewhere. It does not come from thin air. It is \nat the expense of our more traditional energy sources. In other words, \nit is one thing. It is a Btu tax. Remember that: Btu tax. Where have \nyou heard it? It was one of the first efforts of the Clinton \nadministration when they came\n\n[[Page S1903]]\n\ninto office. They tried to put on a Btu--British thermal unit--tax on \nenergy. They failed, coming in the back door.\n  EIA says consumers will not see most of this cost in terms of higher \nretail rates. Instead, it will be paid for by other segments of the \npower industry. I am not that optimistic about EIA's assessment of cost \nor impact to consumers. EIA's numbers are based on a set of assumptions \nabout technology--sending, transmission capacity--economics which may \nor may not pan out.\n  If there is anything more certain than death and taxes, it is that \nthe utilities will pass on consumer costs. In other words, as I have \nsaid, anything more certain than death and taxes is the utilities will \npass on to the consumers the costs.\n  The only exception to that was in California when California chose \nnot to pass on the cost to the consumers because they capped retail \nrates and were not allowed to pass through the true cost of \nelectricity. And what did we have? We had some of the major generating \ncompanies in the United States in chapter 11. We learned something from \nthat, but hopefully we will not forget it so soon.\n  Those costs are going to show up in consumer electric bills one way \nor another, you can be sure of that. Do not be lulled to sleep by \nassertions that the renewable dictate is a free ride. If you believe \nthat, I have a bridge to sell you in Ketchikan, and it has not even \nbeen built yet.\n  Let me point out some of the requirements of the renewable dictate. \nUnder these circumstances, if the utility is not able to meet its \nrenewable portfolio through generation, it is going to have to purchase \nthe credits from someone else who is generating electricity or pays a \nFederal penalty. They have to do it one way or another. In other words, \nconsumers in regions and States that do not have renewable \nopportunities will have to pay for electricity they do not even \nreceive.\n  Let me repeat that. Consumers in regions or States that do not have \nrenewable opportunities will have to pay for electricity they do not \neven receive. I do not know how many people you know, Mr. President, \nbut I know a lot of people who would not want to do that.\n  How much is this going to cost the consumer in New York or Chicago? \nIt is clear what is going on. It is a Btu tax--a British thermal unit \ntax--which will transfer massive amounts of money to one politically \nfavored segment of the electric power industry. What is that? Renewable \nsource. I find it unacceptable to require consumers to subsidize large \nrenewable generators, such as--well, let's choose Enron as an example, \nto the tune of up to $12 billion per year.\n\n  I also wonder why this Federal mandate is necessary. These 14 States \nhave already established a renewable portfolio mandate program. They, \ntoo, would be preempted.\n  I admire what these States have done. They have taken the initiative \nto establish a State renewable portfolio mandate. They did it \nthemselves: Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, \nMassachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, \nTexas, Wisconsin.\n  This is the market working. People in those States are concerned. \nThey want renewables and are ready to pay for them. They have set up a \nsystem, and it works.\n  This legislation would mandate it across the country. The renewable \nmandate would thus penalize those States that have already acted to \nestablish a renewable program by requiring these States to replace \ntheir State program with a new Federal program. For Heaven's sake, if \nit works in these States, why not leave it alone? They are doing their \njob. People are happy. They would be increasing or rejecting. Other \nStates have considered and rejected a renewable portfolio mandate as \nbeing unworkable or too expensive.\n  Senator Jeffords wants to raise the renewable dictate. What does he \nwant to raise it to? He wants to raise it to 20 percent. I oppose that. \nI think it is impractical, unrealistic, and beyond reasonable costs.\n  Senator Bingaman's amendment differs from the underlying Daschle bill \nin a relatively minor aspect. It retains the 10-percent mandate from \nthe underlying bill and gives double credits to renewables on Indian \nland, gives credit for not using energy, and it lengthens the program \nby 50 percent out to the year 2030.\n  I have a little problem with extending these programs out to 2010, \n2020, 2030. My problem is, how many of us are going to be around here \nin 30 years or 28 years to be held accountable for what we are setting \nas a standard today? It lengthens the program by 50 percent by the year \n2030.\n  We should hold ourselves accountable for realistic goals in the \nfuture and not put them out so far that other people are going to come \nalong and look at it and say that was simply unattainable or the cost \nof it was beyond comprehension.\n  In a nutshell, the Bingaman amendment makes only minor changes to the \nDaschle bill. I oppose the Bingaman amendment as well, just as I oppose \nthe Daschle renewable dictate.\n  I believe Federal command and control of the market leads to terrible \ndistortions, economic waste, and inefficiency. It is bad for consumers \nand bad for our economy.\n  I will support Senator Kyl when he offers his amendment to allow the \nStates to set up their own renewable portfolio program. As I mentioned \nbefore, 14 States already have them. They seem very happy with them. \nThey are working. Why do we always have to jump into something the \nStates seem to be doing reasonably well with a Band-Aid as if this is a \nFederal project and we should take the initiative away from the States. \nThe best government is the government closest to you.\n  As I mentioned before, 14 States already have it. Senator Kyl's \namendment will allow States to set up their own renewable portfolio \nprogram. The Kyl amendment requires each State utility commission and \neach nonregulated utility to consider offering consumers renewable \nenergy if available, but it does not require them to do so--only \nconsider doing it. If a State or nonregulated utility concludes that a \nrenewable program is not in their consumers' best interest, then they \nshould be free to not adopt it. That is exactly what the Kyl amendment \ndoes.\n  If a State adopts the program, then consumers will still be free to \ndecide whether or not green power is worth the cost. Consumer choice \nhas worked well in States such as Colorado where 2 percent of the \ncustomers have chosen to pay a modest premium to have their power \ngenerated by wind turbines, and I believe there is some of that in \nCalifornia as well. Allowing consumers to decide what is in their best \ninterest is the essence of good public policy.\n  I have a letter signed by 32 trade associations in opposition to the \nrenewable portfolio mandate in this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We are writing to express our deep \n     concern over the economic impact of the renewable electricity \n     portfolio mandates contained in the Substitute Amendment (the \n     Energy Policy Act of 2002) to S. 517. This renewable \n     portfolio standard would require that 10 percent of all \n     electricity generated in 2020 must be generated by renewable \n     facilities built after 2001. The renewable portfolio standard \n     would become effective next year, and the amount of renewable \n     generation required would increase every year between 2005 \n     and 2020. While we believe that renewable source of \n     generation should have an important, and growing, role in \n     supplying our electricity needs, the provisions contained in \n     the Substitute Amendment are not reasonable and cannot be \n     achieved without causing dramatic electricity price \n     increases. This in turn would have the unintended consequence \n     of reducing the competitiveness of American businesses in the \n     global economy and, thereby, reducing economic growth and \n     employment.\n       Today, according to the Energy Information Administration, \n     non-hydro renewables placed in service over past decades make \n     up only about 2.16 percent of the total amount of electricity \n     generated in the United States. However, even this modest \n     existing renewable capacity will not count under the \n     Substitute Amendment toward satisfying the renewable \n     portfolio requirement. Generally, under that Amendment, \n     renewable facilities that can be used to meet the 10 percent \n     minimum must be placed in service in 2002 or thereafter. \n     Therefore, compliance with the Substitute Amendment's 2.5 \n     percent renewables mandate for 2005 would require doubling \n     the amount of non-hydro renewables that we now have in just \n     three years--even though it took us more than 20 years to get \n     to where we are today.\n\n[[Page S1904]]\n\n       In addition, because the Substitute Amendment requires that \n     10 percent of all electricity generation, not capacity, must \n     come from renewables, vast numbers of renewable electricity-\n     generating facilities will have to be built. Wind energy, \n     perhaps the most promising non-hydro renewable technology, \n     operates effectively only between 20 percent to 40 percent of \n     the time. Solar is also intermittent. Therefore, the actual \n     amount of newly installed capacity needed to generate enough \n     electricity to meet the Daschle Amendment's requirements \n     could well exceed 20,000 megawatts by 2005. To put this into \n     context, according to the American Wind Energy Association, \n     we currently have less than 5,000 megawatts of installed wind \n     capacity in the United States.\n       Simply imposing an unreasonably large, federally mandated \n     requirement to generate electricity from renewables will not \n     guarantee that enough windmills and other renewable \n     facilities can be built on schedule; that the wind (or sun or \n     rain) will cooperate; or that the generating costs will be as \n     low as would be the case from a more diverse, market-dictated \n     portfolio of conventional, as well as renewable and \n     alternative fuels. If retail suppliers do not comply with the \n     mandate, they would face a 3 cent per kilowatt hour civil \n     penalty. Some may suggest that this penalty would operate as \n     a ``cap'' on the inevitable run up of electricity costs under \n     the Amendment. Even if this penalty were effective at \n     limiting skyrocketing electricity costs--and experience with \n     similar ``penalties'' indicates that it will not--the penalty \n     still would constitute an almost doubling of current \n     wholesale electricity prices for renewable power. Clearly, \n     electricity rates will substantially increase if the \n     Substitute Amendment becomes law.\n       The Federal government's past record in choosing fuel \n     ``winners and losers'' is dismal. The Powerplant and \n     Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, which prohibited the use of \n     natural gas in electric powerplants and discouraged its used \n     in many industrial facilities, was essentially repealed less \n     than a decade later when its underlying premises were \n     conceded to be wrong. While holding back the use of natural \n     gas, the Federal government spent billions of dollars \n     attempting to commercialize ``synthetic fuels,'' including \n     oil shale and tar sands, with little to show for its efforts.\n       While we believe that the Federal government has an \n     important role to play in encouraging the development of \n     renewable and other energy technologies, we are troubled when \n     that role turns to mandates and market set-asides for one \n     particular fuel or technology. Mandates and set-asides \n     usually don't work, and create unintended consequences far \n     more severe than the underlying problem being addressed.\n       For these reasons, we respectfully request that you support \n     efforts to modify the language in section 265 of the \n     Substitute Amendment to S. 517, in order to eliminate or \n     mitigate the harmful economic consequences of the renewable \n     fuels portfolio mandate.\n           Sincerely,\n         Adhesive and Sealant Council, Inc.\n         Alliance for Competitive Electricity\n         American Chemistry Council\n         American Iron and Steel Institute\n         American Lighting Association\n         American Paper Machinery Association\n         American Portland Cement Alliance\n         American Textile Manufacturers Institute\n         Association of American Railroads\n         Carpet and Rug Institute\n         Coalition for Affordable and Reliable Energy\n         Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry\n         Edison Electric Institute\n         Electricity Consumers Resource Council\n         Independent Petroleum Association of America\n         Industry Energy Consumers of America\n         International Association of Drilling Contractors\n         Interstate Natural Gas Association of America\n         National Association of Manufacturers\n         National Lime Association\n         National Mining Association\n         National Ocean Industries Association\n         North American Association of Food Equipment \n           Manufacturers\n         Nuclear Energy Institute\n         Ohio Manufacturers' Association\n         Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce & Industry\n         Pennsylvania Foundry Association\n         Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association\n         Texas Association of Business and Chambers of Commerce\n         U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n         Utah Manufacturers Association\n         Westbranch Manufacturers Association.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The signers represent a broad range of affected \nindustries, including chemicals, metals, paper, textiles, cement, \ncarpeting, petroleum, natural gas, mining, nuclear power, as well as \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  A Federal renewable dictate is, in my opinion, bad energy policy, bad \nsocial policy, and bad economic policy.\n  I thank the Chair for persevering with me, and I yield to Senator \nBingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will say a few words about the various \namendments we are considering this afternoon. I proposed an amendment \nto the underlying bill which does modify the provisions we had related \nto this issue of a renewable portfolio standard, and that is the \npending first-degree amendment, and essentially that calls for us \ntrying to increase the generation of electricity from renewable energy \nsources over the next 18 years, between now and the year 2020, up to 10 \npercent. That is what we have proposed in the amendment I sent to the \ndesk.\n  Senator Jeffords has sent a second-degree amendment to the desk, and \nhe has asked that we change that goal and requirement, and that instead \nof going to 10 percent of power having to be generated from renewable \nsources, it should be 20 percent. He has made his statement in support \nof that, and he has indicated a desire to come back and reiterate those \npoints before we actually cast a vote on his amendment.\n  Then there is also, as I understand it, expected to be an amendment \nby Senator Kyl from Arizona which will essentially eliminate any kind \nof a Federal program or requirement to increase the amount of renewable \nenergy that utilities generate. So those are the three main issues \nbefore us.\n  Obviously my position, which is I think is clear to all my \ncolleagues, is that the 10-percent goal we have in the bill and in the \nsubstitute I have sent to the desk is an appropriate goal. It is \nsomething we can achieve. It makes sense. It moves us, as a country, in \nthe direction we ought to be going. It reduces our dependence on fossil \nfuels in very important ways.\n  There are some obvious reasons why I think it is important we act on \nthis as part of a national energy bill. When one looks at a \ncomprehensive energy bill, which we are now debating, there are various \nthings that can be done. The supply can be increased, and we are trying \nto increase the supply of energy from our traditional sources, from oil \nand gas, from coal, from nuclear, from hydroelectric power. All of \nthose are existing sources of energy upon which we believe we are going \nto remain dependent. They should continue to flourish. We support that \nand we have provisions in the bill that support them.\n\n  I firmly believe it is also important we put a particular emphasis on \nrenewable power, renewable energy sources. It is important we do that \nto get a diverse set of sources. It is important we do that because the \nrenewable energy sources do not produce emissions. They are extremely \nbenign to the environment and there are substantial benefits in job \ncreation, quite frankly, from putting a heavier emphasis here.\n  I will put up a couple of charts I referred to earlier in the debate \nso people can be reminded this is where we produce electricity today. \nThis is ``Electricity Generation by Fuel.'' There seems to be a lot of \ninformation on this chart, but it is pretty clear what the big points \nare.\n  The first big point is, this is from the period 1970 to the year \n2020. So over this 50-year period, it shows that by far the biggest \ncontributor to electric generation today is coal. It has been all \nalong. It continues to be, it is going to be in the future--that is a \ngiven--and we have provisions in this bill to encourage additional \nresearch to try to find ways to continue using coal in the most \nenvironmentally benign way possible.\n  Down beneath that we have nuclear. This is as of the year 2000 in \nthis period. The next line is nuclear. Nuclear accounts for something \nin the range of 20 percent of the power we produce today in this \ncountry. It will continue to account for a substantial portion of the \npower we produce for the indefinite future, even if there are no \nnuclear powerplants built, and there may well be. I do not know the \nanswer to that.\n  The other fuel, which is now third as far as the contributors to \nelectrical generation, is natural gas. That is this green line. \nAlthough it is third now, we can see that it is growing dramatically as \na contributor to electricity generation in this country. We are now in \na situation where today 69 percent of the electricity we generate in \nthis country comes from two fuels: coal and natural gas. That is going \nto change by the year 2020, unless we enact legislation in the nature \nof this renewable portfolio standard that I have proposed.\n\n[[Page S1905]]\n\n  The way that is going to change is we are going to be much more \ndependent upon those two fuels, coal and natural gas, by the year 2020 \nthan we are today. Instead of 69 percent, which is where it is today, \nit will be up to 80 percent. So we will be 80-percent dependent upon \nthose two types of fuel.\n  Why is this a problem, some might ask. Who cares? It is a problem \nbecause price spikes, particularly in natural gas, can play havoc with \npeople's electric bills, can play havoc with our ability to maintain a \nstable market for electricity in the country.\n  Eighteen months ago, it was $10 per million Btu of natural gas. Today \nit is more like two-fifty. There is a tremendous volatility in those \nprices, and that is what we are setting ourselves up for if we do not \ndiversify the sources of fuel upon which we rely. We do have real \nconcerns about the adequacy of our supply of natural gas as we go \nforward to the year 2020. We may well be buying a larger and larger \npercentage of our natural gas in the form of liquefied natural gas that \nis brought in by tanker from overseas. This is being brought in from \nthe Middle East, from a lot of countries that we do not currently \nconsider particularly stable suppliers.\n\n  Just as we are currently dependent upon foreign sources of oil, we \ncan see the day, possibly in the future, when we will be substantially \ndependent upon foreign sources of natural gas. A lot of that dependence \nwill be because we have not diversified the sources of power to \ngenerate electricity.\n  Also, of course, if one thinks climate change is a problem, which \nmany people do, it is important we try to find some sources of energy \nthat do not contribute to that problem, and that is exactly what we are \ntrying to do with this renewable portfolio standard.\n  Another one of these charts I think makes the point we have a lot of \nopportunity to do better in this area. This chart is entitled ``The \nCommitment to Renewable Generation.'' This is the period 1990 to 1995. \nThe point it makes is, over on the left-hand side, this is the \npercentage increase in nonhydro renewable generation during that 5-year \nperiod, 1990 to 1995. Spain increased their nonhydro renewable \ngeneration over 300 percent during those 5 years; Germany increased \ntheirs something around 170, 180 percent; Denmark, nearly 150 percent; \nNetherlands, about 70 percent; France, something in the range of 30 \npercent; and then there is the United States. We can see from this \nchart there was hardly any increase during that 5-year period, in \nnonhydro renewable generation in the United States.\n  Frankly, we have a lot of opportunity to catch up with some of the \nEuropean nations in producing more power from renewable sources.\n  In my State of New Mexico, I asked why we did not have wind power. I \nhave seen the charts that say New Mexico is a natural source of wind \npower. We have a lot of wind, particularly this time of year. I found \nthere was very little renewable power generated in my State. I asked if \nwe had any U.S. manufacturers of wind turbines come and put up wind \npower, and I found out the major manufacturers of wind turbines are in \nEurope, not in this country. The main market for wind turbines is in \nEurope, not here.\n  We may want to do in New Mexico what the neighboring State of Texas \nhas done. We have a love-hate relationship between New Mexico and \nTexas; it grates on me to say that Texas did something right, but the \nreality is they have done something right in this area.\n  Frankly, President Bush did something right in this area when he was \nGovernor of Texas. He signed a law to put in place a renewable \nportfolio standard that was very much the same in its provisions as we \npropose as a national program. They have moved ahead very dramatically \nin adding generation capacity based on renewable energy. It is the kind \nof action I wish we had taken in New Mexico. I hope we do it in the \nnear future.\n  I know our major utility in New Mexico is considering putting in a \nwind farm. They realize it is cost effective. It does make sense. They \nhave seen the successes our neighboring State has had.\n  Let me show another chart entitled ``U.S. Renewable Electricity \nConsumption.'' This points out that today 3\\1/2\\ to 4 percent of the \nelectricity that we consume is generated from renewable sources--\nnonhydro renewable sources. Under this bill, under the renewable \nportfolio standard we are proposing--not the one Senator Jeffords is \nproposing; that is more ambitious, but the one I am proposing--we would \nincrease that between now and 2020 up to around 12 to 13 percent. That \nis the expectation under this bill.\n\n  The green area on the chart is what will be added as renewable \ngeneration if this bill is passed with the renewable portfolio standard \nin it. Absent the renewable portfolio, if the Kyl amendment succeeds \nand we eliminate any national renewable portfolio standard, the \nexpectation is we would have this orange strip that we are now at, with \n3\\1/2\\ percent of our generation coming from nonhydro renewables; that \nwould be the same in 2020. We would still be producing about 3\\1/2\\ \npercent from nonhydro renewables.\n  I think there is a very strong case to be made that a forward-\nlooking, comprehensive effort to diversify sources of energy, to deal \nwith global climate change in a responsible way, to ensure we are \ndiversifying our sources and producing all the power we need in the \nfuture, would lead us to conclude we ought to have this modest \nrequirement. This is a modest requirement. This is not excessive. There \nare many people who advocate renewable generation and are critical of \nwhat I have proposed as a renewable portfolio standard because they \nthink it is insufficient. They think we should be doing more. I would \nlove to see more. I think this is a realistic proposal given the \nreality we face today.\n  My proposal is there for anyone to study and review. I think it would \nbe very good public policy for the country.\n  I have some letters I call to my colleagues' attention. One is from \nthe American Wind Energy Association, dated March 13.\n\n       While we believe that all of America's renewable energy \n     technologies--wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and \n     hydropower--are capable of contributing higher levels of \n     electricity generation than would be required by the proposed \n     RPS, the provision is a significant step forward in meeting \n     America's growing energy needs.\n       In 2001 alone the wind energy industry installed close to \n     1,700 megawatts of new generating capacity, enough to meet \n     the needs of about 475,000 households. More than half of this \n     new wind power development (915 megawatts) was produced in \n     Texas--a state with the most effective renewable energy \n     requirement law in the nation. In addition to producing \n     electricity without emitting any pollutants, each megawatt of \n     wind power creates at least $1 million in economic activity.\n\n  Obviously, I would like to see some of that economic activity in my \nState. I assume the Presiding Officer would like to see some in his. \nThat would occur as part of the implementation of this.\n  I also refer to a letter from MidAmerican Energy Holdings Company, \nwhich is headquartered in Omaha, NE. The Presiding Officer is familiar \nwith that company. This is a letter to me from David Sokol, chairman \nand chief executive officer.\n\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman: I am pleased to write in support of \n     your efforts to include provisions to promote the development \n     of renewable energy resources for electric generation in the \n     Senate's comprehensive energy bill. MidAmerican Energy \n     Holdings Company is one of the world's largest developers of \n     renewable energy, including geothermal, wind, biomass and \n     solar.\n       MidAmerican has been a long-time proponent of both a \n     production tax credit for electricity generated by renewables \n     and a federal government purchase standard for renewable \n     electricity. We strongly support these provisions in the \n     comprehensive energy bill before the Senate, as well as \n     recent modifications to the bill's renewable portfolio \n     standard (RPS) section that will ensure that implementation \n     of the RPS is achievable and affordable.\n       Renewable electricity can play a critical role in \n     diversifying the nation's fuel mix and providing emissions-\n     free electricity for American consumers. By including both \n     supply and demand side components in the comprehensive energy \n     package, your legislation will benefit the environment and \n     American energy security.\n       Thank you again for your leadership in promoting renewable \n     energy.\n\n  I have one other letter from the American Bioenergy Association. This \ngroup is headquartered in Washington. There are various members of the \ngroup who have signed the letter to me, dated March 13.\n\n\n[[Page S1906]]\n\n\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: We, the undersigned members of the \n     American Bioenergy Association (ABA)--the leading industry \n     group representing biofuels, biomass power, and bioproducts--\n     are writing to thank you for your support to date and to \n     encourage you to offer an amendment for a renewable portfolio \n     standard that is both aggressive and realistic.\n       It is critical that we level the playing field for \n     renewable energy generation. State RPS programs have met with \n     enormous success. A federal RPS would allow clean energy \n     developers and their customers to use biomass power in all \n     regions of the country where it is technically feasible. The \n     ABA believes that the biomass industry provide a significant \n     contribution to the standard you will offer as a substitute \n     amendment to the Daschle bill. This RPS uses the already \n     over-subscribed Texas legislation as a model. The national \n     policy you propose would allow all renewable energy resources \n     to be developed where they are most applicable.\n\n  I have one other brief issued by the National Hydropower Association.\n  It says:\n\n       The National Hydropower Association writes to strongly urge \n     you to support the Energy & Natural Resources Committee \n     Chairman Jeff Bingaman and Majority Leader Tom Daschle's \n     compromise amendment to S. 517 on the Renewable Portfolio \n     Standard.\n\n  They go on to explain why they believe that is very much in the \ninterests of the Nation.\n  Finally, there is a letter I have here from Michael Wilson, vice \npresident of the Florida Power & Light. He says in a letter to me dated \nMarch 14:\n\n       Please consider this letter an endorsement of the \n     compromise Renewable Portfolio Standard contained in S. 517, \n     the Energy Policy Bill.\n       As you may know, FPL Group, comprised of the two major \n     subsidiaries--\n\n  He lists what those are--\n\n     is one of America's cleanest, most progressive energy \n     companies. Our commitment to the environment is manifested. . \n     . .\n\n  He goes on and on and indicates they are intending to add 2000 \nmegawatts of new wind generation over the next 2 years and that this \nrenewable portfolio standard will allow wind generation to contribute \nto America's energy independence and security.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letters I referred to be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             American Wind Energy Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2002.\n     Hon.

This policy validates a recent \n     poll which showed that 93% of registered voters believe that \n     hydropower should play an important role in meeting future \n     energy needs. What's more 74 percent of America's registered \n     voters support federal incentives for incremental hydropower.\n       With the inclusion of incremental hydropower in the \n     Bingaman-Daschle RPS amendment, approximately 4,300 Megawatts \n     (MWs) of new hydro generation could be developed without \n     building a new dam or impoundment. This additional power will \n     provide clean, renewable, domestic and reliable energy for \n     America's energy consumers in an environmentally-responsible \n     way. Senator Jeffords' amendment, however, has no such role \n     for hydropower.\n       Once again, NHA strongly urges you to vote yes on the \n     Bingaman-Daschle RPS amendment and to oppose the RPS \n     amendment offered by Senator Jeffords.\n       If you have any questions, please contact Mark R. Stover, \n     NHA's Director of Government Affairs, at 202-682-1700 x-104, \n     or at mark@hydro.org.\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                Florida Power & Light Company,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman: Please consider this letter an \n     endorsement of the compromise Renewable Portfolio Standards \n     (RPS) contained within S. 517, the Energy Security Policy \n     Bill.\n       As you may know, FPL Group, comprised of its two major \n     subsidiaries, Florida Power & Light (FPL) and FPL Energy \n     (FPLE), is one of America's cleanest, most progressive energy \n     companies. Our commitment to the environment is manifested by \n     FPL's diverse generation mix and by FPLE's largely renewable \n     energy portfolio. FPLE operates the two largest solar \n     projects in the world, over 1,000 megawatts of hydroelectric \n     power, a number of geothermal projects, and a number of \n     biomass plants. And, significantly, with over 1,400 megawatts \n     of net ownership in wind energy, FPLE is the nation's largest \n     generator of wind power.\n       FPLE plans on adding up to 2,000 megawatts of new wind \n     generation over the next two years. Due to the wind energy \n     production tax credit (IRC Sec. 45(c)(3)) and the industry's \n     success in reducing production costs, wind energy has become \n     economically feasible. A long-term extension of the credit \n     combined with your RPS will allow wind generation--and, \n     hopefully, other renewable sources--to contribute to \n     America's energy independence and security. Ultimately, such \n     an aim should be the keystone of any American energy policy.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this important issue, and \n     we strongly support your efforts to enact a fair and balanced \n     RPS. Please do not hesitate to call on me should you require \n     any assistance in your endeavor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael M. Wilson,\n                                                   Vice President.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I will have other comments to make later in the debate, \nbut at this point I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I came to the Chamber in support of the \namendment of Senator Jeffords. I am proud to join him on this \namendment.\n  We are talking about a portfolio that has to do with renewable energy \nfor production of electricity. The bill would require the amount of \nelectricity produced from renewable to increase from 2.5 percent in \n2005 to 10 percent in 2020. This is certainly an improvement in the \nright direction.\n  The amendment I am cosponsoring with Senator Jeffords argues that the \nSenate should go higher. We are talking about basically going up to 20 \npercent by the year 2020.\n  I wish to make three or four points.\n  First, I admit that I am speaking as a Senator from Minnesota. For \nMinnesota, this is a no-brainer. We are a cold-weather State. We are at \nthe other end of the pipeline. When we import barrels of oil--although \nwe are not talking about so much oil, because we also rely on natural \ngas and coal--we have the following consequences: First of all, we \nimport the energy and we export the dollars--probably to the tune of \nabout $11 billion a year.\n  The more we can produce of our own energy, the more capital we keep \nin our communities, and the better it is for our States.\n  On environmental grounds, I don't, frankly, know what we are doing \nwith more reliance on coal.\n  In our State, we love our lakes. We are the ``land of 10,000 lakes.'' \nBut if you look in different manuals, you will see the warnings: If you \nare a woman expecting a child, don't eat fish. We love walleye. Don't \neat too many walleye a week; or, don't eat any; or, for small children, \ndon't let them eat walleye. One way to get to the hearts of Minnesotans \nis to talk about walleye. Why? Because of airborne toxins, poison, \nPCBs, acid rain, and coal.\n\n  What in the world are we doing relying more on coal, relying more on \nfossil fuels, and relying more on utility industries that barrel us \ndown a path which goes exactly in the wrong direction?\n  Minnesota is rich in wind. In rural Minnesota and farm country, we \nare talking about biomass electricity. We are talking about solar. We \nare talking about renewables. We are talking about safe energy. We are \ntalking about clean technology. We are talking about small business \nopportunities. We are talking about job-intensive and job-creating \nindustries that are respectful of the environment, that are respectful \nof our community, that lead tomorrow's economic development, and that \nmake all the sense in the world.\n  When we are able to rely more on renewable energy policy--we have the \ntechnology--we are far less dependent not only on Mideastern oil but we \nare far less dependent on large energy companies that end up being the \nones making decisions that affect all of our lives, not always so much \nfor the good.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Jeffords. Frankly, I know the votes on \nthis. I don't think we will get very many votes. As a matter of fact, \nmaybe we will. I shouldn't say that on the floor of the Senate before \nthe vote. But there are other amendments that want to go below 10 \npercent.\n  I must admit that the position I take in this debate doesn't get me a \nheck of a lot of support from the utility industry. That is true. I am \nnot sure I had much in the beginning anyway. But, with all due respect, \nI do know what is best for my State. I don't think it is just for \nMinnesota. I think it is good for people in this country.\n  I will say this one more time. Our country is behind the curve. Clean \ntechnology is going to be a big growth industry. We can do so much \nbetter than we are doing right now. We can do that if we set a target, \nand we make it clear that we are committed to making sure that \nrenewable energy is much more a part of the production of electricity.\n\n  Look again at what we do that is good. We do a so much better job for \nour environment. Coal, I mentioned. Nuclear power. I am not giving a \nspeech today in this Chamber that says: Let's dismantle all the nuclear \npowerplants. As a matter of fact, that is not my position. But we do \nnot know what to do with the waste. We are going to now build more \nplants which are incredibly capital intensive.\n  I think the Presiding Officer is one of the people here who knows the \nmost about finances. I am not even sure it is a go from the point of \nview of cost-effectiveness.\n  But beyond that, can anybody tell me whether or not we should be \ngoing forward with more nuclear powerplants when we do not even know \nwhat to do with the waste right now? In case anybody has not noticed, \nour good friends from Nevada do not want it there. If all of us were \nSenators from Nevada, we would take the same position. And there are \nsome legitimate questions that are being raised about Yucca Mountain.\n  Then others say: Well, maybe not. Then it should be above ground, in \ndry-cast storage. Then others will say: What about the transportation \nof it?\n  So we do not know what to do with the waste. Yet we are now talking \nabout maybe we are going to rely more on nuclear power. We do not know \nwhat to do with the expense. By the way, most people do not want the \nplants near where they live. There are all sorts of public health \nconcerns. I have already mentioned coal. What do we need? More acid \nrain? Why do we want to rely on these big utility companies to \nbasically be in charge of our energy future? Have the consumers of the \ncountry maybe noticed they are not always so kind to us in terms of the \nbills that we pay?\n  We could make the decisionmaking much more back at the State level, \nmuch more back at the community level with renewable energy policy. \nBetween the potential of wind and biomass electricity and solar, along \nwith what we have been talking about with biodiesel and other clean \nalternative fuels, such as ethanol, we have a real opportunity. It is a \nperfect marriage. I will finish on this point and then take a question \nfrom my colleague. It is a marriage made in Heaven between being \nrespectful of the environment and a huge growth industry, which is much \nmore small business oriented, with the creation of more jobs and \nkeeping capital in the community and having better economic \ndevelopment.\n  It could be done, and it should be done. If we took a poll, 80 \npercent of the American people would agree. The only problem is, these \nutility companies and this big energy industry have too much clout. \nThey have too much money, they have too much power, and\n\n[[Page S1908]]\n\nthey have too much influence. We should be reaching beyond 10 percent. \nI think Senator Jeffords and I are attempting to lay down a landmark \nbecause we want to be part of the debate and, at a very minimum, not \nturn the clock backward and even go below the 10-percent requirement. \nFrankly, we should be doing much better.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Does my friend agree that on this energy bill yesterday he \nand I were terribly disappointed because we had the opportunity to do \nsomething about consumption in this country, to cut the amount of \nfossil fuels we use, by making our automobiles more energy efficient, \nand we lost on that? Does the Senator agree that we lost on that?\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Also, there is an effort here where some think we can \nproduce our way out of the energy crisis in which we find ourselves. \nDoes the Senator acknowledge, out of the worldwide reserves of \npetroleum, the United States has 3 percent, including Alaska, and the \nrest of the world has 97 percent? Does the Senator acknowledge that as \na fact?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. So I say to my friend, I do not personally know how we are \ngoing to produce our way out of this situation. We are not going to do \nit by drilling in ANWR. So when this legislation is ended, we are going \nto get nothing out of ANWR, and we are going to have no more fuel-\nefficient vehicles.\n  So I ask my friend, isn't the only thing left for the American \nconsumer to look to with pride that we will have done on the energy \nbill is to do something with renewables? Isn't that right?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada \nbecause that is why I said to Senator Jeffords earlier today that I \nwould be out here joining him on this amendment.\n  Frankly, the rest of my time on this bill will be on this renewable \nportfolio because this is the only item left in the bill that is \nstrongly proconsumer and also enables our country to reduce our energy \nconsumption and presents some alternatives to barreling down exactly \nthe wrong path. Absolutely.\n  The sad thing--I know this sounds a little arrogant; and I don't mean \nto sound arrogant; and I don't think I am being arrogant--I used to be \non the Energy Committee. If we took a poll, about 80 percent of the \npeople in this country would agree, saying: Absolutely, more \nrenewables. We really like that idea. We like it because of the \nenvironment. We like it because we can keep the capital in our \ncommunity. We like it because small businesses can develop. We like it \nbecause it is job intensive. We like it because it is good for our \ncountry's independence.\n  Remember, with electricity we are talking less about oil; we are \ntalking about coal, nuclear, whatever.\n  I am not arguing conspiracy. And I am not arguing every Senator who \nvotes the other way votes that way because of money. That is a horrible \nargument to make. We could all say that about each of us on every vote.\n  I will say this. Institutionally, from a sort of systemic point of \nview, the unfortunate thing is there are these huge energy \nconglomerates, these big utility companies. They do not want to budge \nfrom the monopoly they now have. They do not want to see this \nalternative future. But, boy, this is the direction in which we have to \ngo. That is why I thank Senator Jeffords and am honored to be a part of \nthis debate and do this amendment with him.\n  Am I making sense?\n  Mr. REID. Of course. That is why I came to the Chamber, because the \nSenator is making a lot of sense. I feel so desperate to get something \nthat helps the American consumer when we finish this energy bill, which \nwe have been talking about for so long.\n  Does the Senator realize that in 1990 the United States produced 90 \npercent of the electricity produced by wind? We produced 90 percent 10, \n11 years ago. Today, we produce--not 90 percent--25 percent of the \npower. Germany--the relatively small area of Germany--produces more \nelectricity by wind than we do.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes. I say to my colleague, first of all, again, wind \nis near and dear to my heart. You should see Buffalo Ridge in \nMinnesota. We produce much of the wind power in the country in \nMinnesota.\n  Brian Baenig, who does wonderful work here, points out that there \nhave been two Department of Energy analyses, and they have found, under \na 20-percent renewable portfolio standard, total consumer energy bills \nwould be lower in 2020 than ``business as usual'' because this would \nalso reduce the natural gas prices. This would be far better for our \nconsumers. But also other countries--that is what I was saying \nearlier--are putting us to shame. The thing of it is, this isn't just \nan environmental issue. This is also, I say to both colleagues in the \nChamber, a business issue.\n  Mark my words--let me shout it from the mountaintop of Senate today--\nclean technology will be a huge growth industry in this new century. We \nshould be at the cutting edge of it, we should be nurturing it, and we \nshould be promoting it. It is absolutely the right direction in which \nto go.\n  That is what is so important about this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Minnesota, I join with him in \ncomplimenting the Senator from Vermont, the chairman of the Environment \nCommittee, for moving this issue forward. I think he has not done it in \na tepid fashion. I say that because we should be able to do this. There \nare 14 States in the United States that have renewable portfolios. \nStates do it. Why can't we, as a country, do it? The answer is there is \nno reason in the world we should not be able to do this.\n  I believe this so much that, in addition to this--I say to my friend \nfrom Minnesota, he talked about the cost. One of the costs that he \ncannot attribute to alternative energy is what it saves in lost lives, \nwhat it saves in added health care costs for this country.\n  The three of us in this Senate Chamber are not kids. We have all \nlived a long time and are very fortunate in that regard. But we can all \nremember, even the State of Vermont, as pristine as the State of \nVermont is, how the air quality has changed over our lifetimes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to the Senator, on the whole issue of air \nquality, I am out here with a little bit of a sense of urgency. I want \nto hold on to this standard, and I want to increase it because it is \nthe best thing for my State.\n  It is for all the reasons I just mentioned, but also having to do \nwith what we love the most. We love our lakes and rivers and streams. \nIn fact, I don't know how it came to be. It is as though people in the \ncountry have lost their sense of indignation. Their expectations are so \nlowered about the environment. I am surprised that people are not \nfurious. I think they are, but they don't know what to do.\n  As to a lot of our beautiful lakes, people are being told with regard \nto lake after lake after lake in Minnesota, if you are expecting a \nchild, don't eat the fish. If you have little children, don't let them \neat the fish because of the air toxins. This is acid rain. This is \ncoal. This is mercury poisoning.\n  I want to put a stop to it. That is in part what the amendment is \nabout, much less all the good economic and energy efficiency arguments \nI could make.\n  I yield the floor and thank both of my colleagues. I am proud to join \nthem in this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend my good friend. He has \narticulately outlined and put the issues in focus as to what we are \ndiscussing. Coming from Vermont, one of the States that has the most \ndesire, perhaps, to take advantage of the situation, going to my own \npersonal history back to 1939, I was just a kid, but we had the first \ncommercial windmill in the United States. It was working fine until a \nhurricane blew it away. It was an example to us of what the potential \nis.\n  Now we have windmills going over the State, up and down the State. \nHopefully, there will be more and more. We have them located in nice \nplaces that do not spoil the view. What a great source of energy to \ntake advantage of, especially in a State that is really being hard hit \nby all of the acid\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\nrain and other stuff that floats to us from places known and unknown. \nBut I want to share with everyone the experiences we have had.\n  Going back again, 29 years ago, the wind energy program started. It \nhas come quite a ways, but now is the time to really maximize its \nutility and to keep this Nation going in the direction which will lead \nus away from the huge problems we have with being so dependent upon \nforeign oil and all those matters.\n  Perhaps my good friend, the leader, can tell us what we are going to \ndo next, but at this point I will save the floor and then come back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. In response to the Senator from Vermont, Senator Kyl is \ntied up in the Judiciary Committee. They are on a very important \njudicial nomination now dealing with an appellate court judge to be or \nnot to be. Therefore, he is unable to come and offer his amendment at \nthis time. There have been a number of things we have talked about \ndoing. One would be to vote soon on the Jeffords amendment, then debate \nthe Kyl amendment as soon as he gets here, and vote on that tonight or \ntomorrow. That is where we are.\n  The Senator has arrived. I say to my friend--because I know he has \nbeen so tied up in the Judiciary Committee; I listened to his statement \non television--the Bingaman amendment has been laid down. That calls \nfor 10 percent, but the growth on renewables is ramped up more slowly \nand gives credit to hydropower and existing renewables. The Jeffords \namendment is a second-degree amendment. That calls for raising the \nrenewables to 20 percent. It is my understanding the Senator from \nArizona wishes to offer an amendment to eliminate the renewables in \nthis bill.\n  Maybe we could have a brief quorum call to explain to the Senator \nwhat procedurally we would like to do.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I inquire, my understanding is the pending second-\ndegree amendment would have to be disposed of before I could offer my \nsecond-degree amendment. It would have to be defeated. I guess it could \nprevail either way. Then I would offer a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. REID. We would be happy to work that out with the Senator however \nhe wishes. We have talked about it for a couple days, this being the \ncase. The only question is when we vote on his amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the pending business is the Jeffords \namendment. I am going to speak briefly to that. I am also going to \nassume we are going to be disposing of that amendment sometime around 5 \no'clock. If the vote on that amendment is in the negative, then I will \noffer an amendment in the nature of a second degree to the underlying \nBingaman amendment. I will discuss that. In order to conserve time, I \nwill discuss some elements of that right now, while there is no other \nbusiness pending. I will have to go back to the Judiciary Committee and \nvote on the Pickering nomination as soon as that rollcall starts. I can \nat least take some of the time necessary to respond to my colleague \nfrom Vermont and also describe the amendment I intend to offer.\n  I am going to show the nature of the cost of the Jeffords amendment \nand the underlying Bingaman amendment in a moment on the charts behind \nme. I will describe the issue before us and what my approach is, as \nopposed to the approach that has been presented so far by the Senators \nfrom New Mexico and Vermont.\n  The underlying bill has a premise, which is that it is a good thing \nfor the U.S. Government to foster the increased production of \nelectricity through so-called renewable energy sources. Now, current \nlaw does that through a series of incentives--some tax breaks--to \nentities that develop windmill farms or solar energy production or \nother kinds of so-called renewable electrical energy production. That \ncosts quite a bit of money--about a billion dollars a year. But the \nidea is that we need to foster the development of these renewable \nsources because they are good energy; whereas, existing nuclear and \noil-fired, coal-fired, or gas-fired are not the preferred sources of \nenergy production.\n  Today there is something in the neighborhood of 2 percent of our \nenergy being supplied by so-called renewables. The definition of \nrenewable, by any logic, would also include hydropower. That, as I \nunderstand it, accounts for about another 7 percent of the electrical \ngeneration in the country. So the total of renewables would be about 9 \npercent. But, of that, only 2 percent is the nonhydro kind of energy. \nThe idea is to get that to a much higher percentage.\n  In fact, I have to put a footnote here. One of the problems is that \nthe Bingaman amendment has been very much in flux. It has changed at \nleast three times since last night at 11 o'clock--that I am aware of--\nin terms of the amount of coverage. I am not sure right now whether it \nmandates that 8.5 percent of the electricity be generated by renewables \nand what the definition is or whether it is 10 percent. It has gone \nback and forth yesterday and today.\n  The underlying bill has a philosophy that the U.S. Government must \nnow go beyond the mere incentives for renewable energy electricity \nproduction and move toward a mandate, and that the U.S. Government now \nhas the responsibility to tell utilities all over the United States of \nAmerica that they must, under penalty of law--severe penalties, which I \nwill get to in a moment--produce a certain percentage of their \nelectricity through the use of these so-called renewable energy \nsources, such as solar, wind power, biomass, and the like--10 percent, \nas I understand it. Again, I think the underlying Bingaman amendment \nmay be 8.5 percent now, but it is not clear to me at this time.\n  That is a mandate not just on the States but one that will directly \nimpact all electric customers throughout the United States because, \nobviously, most utilities are not just going to say, thank you, we will \nbe happy to pay for that. It costs a lot more than production through \nnuclear, coal, or gas. I think they are going to pass those costs on to \nthe consumers. That is what they are entitled to do and probably will \ndo.\n  We are talking about basically a Btu tax on the electric customers of \nthe United States of America. I say a Btu tax because the reality is \nthat the cost is going to be shifting to the people who buy their power \nthat is produced by coal or nuclear or gas from those who produce it \nfrom these so-called renewable sources of energy production.\n  The way the U.S. Government will do this is through a Federal law, \nwhich we are debating right now, on a mandate to the State that the \nutilities in the State must achieve this level of production within a \ntimeframe. Essentially, the timeframe goes for the next 15 years--\nroughly, from 2005, when it begins, to 2020, a 15-year period. We have \nthe cost calculations for that. I will get though that in a moment.\n  There is an alterative way to do this. Senator Jeffords said, ``10 \npercent isn't good enough; I propose we go to 20 percent.''\n  I hope my colleagues will agree that is not a good idea, that we do \nnot want to mandate that kind of percentage on the States. In fact, we \nshould not mandate anything. That goes to my alternative, which is to \nsay the States must consider all of these alternatives, including a \nmandate of a percentage of renewable energy production, even \nconsideration of a program, a so-called green program whereby customers \nwithin a State would be entitled to buy renewable energy as long as \nthey were willing to pay the cost of it, and the producers there must \nproduce that energy so that under the law, all of the States would have \nto consider all of these different options, but they would be required \nto implement no particular option.\n  It is the difference, on the one hand, between those of us in the \nSenate and the House of Representatives knowing what is best for the \nentire country: We know that 10 percent or 20 percent or 8.5 percent is \nexactly the right number; that we should mandate production through \nrenewable energy sources regardless of what the cost of that may\n\n[[Page S1910]]\n\nbe, versus my proposal which says: We can suggest to the States that \nthey consider different forms of incentives or even mandates if they \nwant to do that, but we should leave it up to the States to decide what \nthey want to implement.\n  There are three or four different reasons that I think this is a \nbetter approach. First, obviously, is I do not think the source of all \nwisdom in the United States resides in 100 U.S. Senators. I think there \nare a lot smarter people in the States with respect to the particular \nneeds of their States.\n  I point out to the distinguished Presiding Officer, for example, that \non the east coast, the opportunities for solar and wind power are not \ngreat. So the net result of the passage of the Bingaman amendment or \nthe underlying bill or the Jeffords amendment is going to be a huge \ntransfer of wealth from New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, and other \nStates, to States such as mine, Arizona, which has lots of sunshine and \ncan produce lots of solar energy, and California that has lots of solar \nenergy opportunities and windmills to produce wind energy.\n  There will be a huge transfer of wealth. Why? Because the law will \nsay: If you do not produce electricity through these renewable sources, \nthen you have to pay a penalty, you basically have to buy credits from \nthose States that do, and that is going to cost you money. Do you get \nelectricity from it? No. You just pay money, and that keeps you out of \ntrouble. You do not get any electricity for what you are paying. But \nthe cost of the penalties or the cost of doing this either way is going \nto be passed on to your electric customers.\n  I say to any of my friends from the States that are not blessed, \nshall we say, with a lot of wind or sun: Get ready, you are going to be \nsending a lot of money to States in the Southwest, States such as \nArizona that I represent.\n  Let me give an idea of the cost. Let's look at how much it is going \nto cost to develop this renewable production capability. It is \nrepresented by the blue. It starts in the year 2005 on the far left-\nhand side where the arrow is pointing. That is about $2 billion a year \ncost to produce this much power with renewable sources. This is gross \ncost.\n  The far line on the chart is the year 2020. The blue line goes up to \nabout $10 billion a year to produce the power, but under the law, as \nthe bill is currently written, there would be little incentive to \ncontinue to build the facility since it sunsets. My understanding is \nthe amendment may remove the sunset, but the total cost is the same \neither way.\n\n  The red represents the penalties that will have to be paid because \nyou cannot build the generating capability to meet the requirement \ncalled for under the law. That would total just about $12 billion a \nyear in the year 2020.\n  Whether it is the actual construction of the facilities or the \npayment of the penalties, we are talking just under $12 billion a year. \nMuch of that, as I said, is going to be paid by States that do not \ndevelop the generation but have to buy the credits and send them to the \nStates that do provide the generation and excess amount of that \ngeneration. The total amount of that is $88 billion over the 15-year \nperiod. That is $88 billion gross cost.\n  To show what the pending Jeffords amendment will do, it is even \nworse.\n  The Jeffords amendment: Starting in the year 2005, $20 billion a \nyear, which goes up to, in the year 2020, more than $22 billion a year; \nagain, the production capacity lining out at about $13 billion a year \nand the remainder in penalty, but there is a total gross cost of about \n$23 billion, and the total cost over the 15 years is about $181 \nbillion.\n  Have we done a cost-benefit analysis to understand what we are going \nto be getting with $181 billion? These charts are produced by the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy. They have done the numbers, but nobody has done a \ncost-benefit analysis of what we are going to get out of this.\n  Some say: Maybe this will replace some of the fuels that are \ncurrently being used, such as coal or oil, and therefore there will be \nless demand for those particular fuels, so the cost of those fuels will \ngo down, so energy produced by coal or gas will go down--you get the \nidea.\n  That may happen, but obviously we are still talking about a huge cost \nto implement this law. Let's just take a wild presumption and say that \nall of this generation replaced the generation from natural gas and it \ndrove the gas prices down to such an extent that we ended up with a \nwash, which is not the case even according to the Department of Energy, \nbut even if we did that, what would that represent? It represents a Btu \ntax, as I said, on nuclear, coal, oil, and gas production, and even \nhydro production, as a matter of fact, and a big wealth transfer from \nStates that would have to buy the credits to States that generate the \nelectricity from the preferred fuels, these so-called renewable \nsources.\n  I think that is bad public policy. It is arrogant on the part of the \nFederal Government to mandate something such as this, to presume we \nwould know the right mix of fuels to use in producing electricity in \nthis country, to require that some States would get hurt by it more \nthan other States, to not have ever done any kind of cost-benefit \nanalysis, notwithstanding the huge costs involved.\n  I am assuming, by the way, that this is possible, that we can do \nthis, even though 2 percent of the generation today is through the so-\ncalled renewable sources. This is why President Bush supports our \napproach, which is a voluntary approach by the States where the States \ncan determine themselves what mandate to impose.\n  By the way, 14 States already have a mandate. My State has a 2-\npercent mandate. The State of Maine has a 30-percent mandate. Texas has \na mandate. What the President believes is each State should be able to \ndecide for itself, based on its unique circumstances, what is possible \nin that State. It may be in my State it is possible to do a lot of wind \nand solar generation. It may not be so possible in New Jersey or New \nYork. That is why each State ought to determine for itself what the mix \nshould be, of course, based upon what it is willing to impose upon the \nretail and wholesale customers in the respective States.\n\n  I spoke with the Secretary of Energy today, who assured me I could \nrepresent to all of my colleagues that he supports the Kyl amendment, \nthat he opposes the underlying Bingaman amendment and the underlying \nbill and, of course, the Jeffords amendment, which would all impose by \nFederal mandate a standard for renewable portfolio.\n  Let me address this cost in another way. As I said, this is a \nmandate. The Federal Government already provides an incentive, and the \ncost of that incentive right now is about $2 billion over a 2-year \nperiod. This is the production tax credit which will be renewed, \nextended, and expanded in terms of its scope. That is what came out of \nthe Finance Committee, on which I sit.\n  We are going to be providing for expanded and extended tax credits \nfor the production of electricity through these renewable fuels. It is \nnot necessary for the U.S. Government to mandate it as long as we can \nachieve that result through the use of the tax incentives which we will \nbe, as I say, dealing with here a little bit later on, but that is what \ncame out of the committee.\n  I want now to address briefly this question of discrimination. It is \napparent to me that the effort being made is to round up votes by \npicking and choosing between the politically correct fuels and those \nthat are not politically correct and making some other changes in the \namendments so some areas are impacted and other areas are not. Let me \ngive an illustration.\n  We know this underlying amendment of Senator Bingaman and the \namendment of Senator Jeffords that is pending would both impose \nsignificant unfunded mandates on the States and localities. Part of \nthis is due to the fact that States would have to buy credits. Part of \nit is due to the fact there are a lot of municipal power producers in \nalmost every State.\n  It is my understanding--and I would love to be corrected by the \nSenator from New Mexico if I am wrong on this--that as a result of the \nfact that a point of order would lie against his amendment because of \nthis unfunded mandate, the provision with respect to municipal \ngeneration or public subdivision generation, Federal or State or local, \nhas been removed from the bill. I will assume, unless I am corrected, \nthat is the case. I am seeing a nod, so that is good.\n\n[[Page S1911]]\n\n  I do not think we should impose this mandate on our political \nsubdivisions. So that would remove the point of order with respect to \nthe generation.\n  I am not sure with respect to the purchase of credits, and I would \nhave to analyze that. But at least what we have done is to say that 10 \npercent of the power, more or less, that is produced in the country by \nthe municipal generators would not be subject to this mandate.\n  In my State I have a fairly large public power producer and a bunch \nof little co-ops and a couple of very large investor-owned utilities. \nSo I ask: Is it fair for the Senate to impose upon one group a mandate \nthat 10 percent or 20 percent or even 8\\1/2\\ percent of power be \ngenerated by renewables, whereas it would not apply to the political \nsubdivisions?\n\n  I am happy for the political subdivisions. I am glad they do not have \nthe mandate applied to them, although they do in the case of Arizona \nbecause the State applies a mandate, but that is the determination of \nthe State. I do not think it is fair. I think it is discriminatory.\n  I also understand hydro is treated a little differently; that hydro \nis only considered a renewable resource. Now if water is not renewable, \nI do not know what is. Water over the dam has always been considered a \nrenewable, the best of the renewable resources, but it is not \npolitically correct by certain environmental groups and so it is not \nincluded, except to the extent there are incremental economic \nimprovements or efficiency improvements in the electrical generation \nfacility, the dam through which the water passes. You rewind the \nturbines and that gives a greater efficiency, and apparently you get \nsome credit for doing that. But otherwise you get no credit for \nhydrogeneration.\n  I understand Senator Collins will have an amendment to say, wait a \nminute, in Maine we do a lot of hydrogeneration and we should get some \ncredit for that. I understand that may be accepted. I do not know \nwhether or not it will be, but clearly there is discrimination going on \nwhen one kind of clearly renewable resource counts but another kind \ndoes not count. Why would we have a double credit for solar energy or \nenergy produced on Indian lands versus biomass or hydro, for that \nmatter, or wind? Why is that? Perhaps the authors of the bill could \nexplain that to us.\n  In other words, my point about discrimination is we have done some \npicking and choosing, some winners and losers. It, again, is the \narrogance of Federal power that we decide what is best. Based upon \nscience? Based upon the merits? No, based upon what it is going to take \nto get the amendment passed. That is what is happening.\n  Let us get real specific about it. What we are doing is trying to \nconstruct something that can pass, and what I am saying is that the \nfairest and most nondiscriminatory way of all is to say, let each State \ndecide for itself. That is really fair. So if New Mexico decides to do \nsolar generation, it can do that. If my State of Arizona says, wait a \nminute, you mean we are going to have to put acres and acres of shiny \nmirrors in our pristine desert that we love to look at because it is so \nbeautiful--that is the way we could generate that power in Arizona is \nthrough solar--that is how we would have to do it? We are going to be \nrequired to degrade our environment by putting--I do not know how many \nhundreds of acres of mirrors it would take to generate this solar \npower; that is how we would do it, I guess----\n  I think the State of Arizona would say that is environmentally \nunacceptable; we are not going to do that. We are not going to spoil \nthe beauty of our State, not to mention what would happen to the flora \nand fauna that could be affected in an adverse way by such a massive \namount of solar in the State of Arizona. I think we would like to make \nthat decision ourselves. If it is possible to produce, let us say, 3 \npercent of power through solar generation in Arizona, and our people in \nthe State decide that can be done and it can be done in an \nenvironmentally sensitive way, and that is a good thing, then let the \nState of Arizona decide that.\n\n  I do not think representatives from the State of Florida, which also \nhas a lot of good sun, or the State of Vermont, which may not have \nquite as much sun, should be dictating that to the State of Arizona.\n  I have one more point, and then I will make the rest of my points \nlater.\n  The procedure--and I will close very quickly--as I understand it, is \nwe have the underlying bill, that pending to that is a Bingaman \namendment that would reduce the Federal mandate to 8\\1/2\\ percent, but \nit still would be a Federal mandate--and correct me if I am wrong on \nthat, but it would exclude the municipal providers and it has a phase-\nin period different from the underlying bill; those are some of the \nessential differences between that and the underlying bill--that the \npending second-degree amendment is a Jeffords amendment that would \nmandate 20 percent and does not exclude the municipal generators, and \nif that is defeated, then we would be back to the point I could offer \nmy second-degree amendment, which very simply provides that the States \nmust consider the alternative of renewable fuels generation, as well as \nconsumer choice, so the consumers could require that they be provided \nrenewable fuel electricity if they are willing to pay for it but it \nwould be up to each individual State as to what to order.\n  What I would hope is we would defeat the Jeffords amendment, that we \ncould then approve the Kyl amendment which would be a substitute for \nthe underlying Bingaman amendment, and there may be later some \nclarifying amendment by Senator Collins that we would consider at that \npoint. That would deal with the subject of renewable fuels, and I think \nit would do so in a fair way, in a nondiscriminatory way, in a way that \nwould not necessarily cost as much, although each State could decide to \nimpose those costs on themselves if they chose to do so in a way that \nwould be consistent with the President's energy plan and a way that I \nsuggest to my colleagues would be much more likely to be successful \nwith our House colleagues in a conference on this bill.\n  So I hope when we get to the point, after I have offered my \namendment, we will be able to support that which will have the effect \nof defeating the underlying Bingaman amendment.\n  Excuse me. I stand corrected. I am advised the Bingaman amendment is \nstill at 10 percent, but it pushes out to the year 2019. So it is still \na 10-percent mandate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. During the debate today, the Bingaman amendment was \nchanged, it was modified, and a substitute maintaining the 10 percent \nof the bill made it a different way of getting there. I made the same \nmistake the Senator of Arizona did today.\n  Prior to the Senator from Arizona leaving, I wanted to make a \nunanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n5:35 p.m. today be for debate with reference to the Jeffords second-\ndegree amendment No. 3017, with the time equally divided and controlled \nin the usual form; that at 5:35 p.m., the Senate vote on or in relation \nto the Jeffords amendment; that upon disposition of amendment No. 3017, \nSenator Kyl be recognized to offer a second-degree amendment to the \nBingaman amendment No. 3016; that no intervening amendment be in order \nprior to disposition of either amendment, nor any language which may be \nstricken.\n  I further ask that Senator Craig be recognized for 25 minutes; and \nthat Senator Nelson be recognized for 5 minutes--Senator Craig has no \nobjection to Senator Nelson going first--and that Senator Jeffords have \nthe final 5 minutes prior to the vote that would occur at 5:35.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Hearing this debate, it reminds me a little \nbit about the debate on miles per gallon, whether or not that would be \netched into law that would have to be met.\n  If we do not set such a standard, we will never get to it. If we do \nnot set a percentage of years that are required in the energy \nproduction, we are not going to have that standard to meet.\n  I support the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I believe under the unanimous consent \nagreement I have 25 minutes.\n\n[[Page S1912]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are discussing a very important \namendment to a very complicated bill that will once again require a \nFederal mandate to meet a specific goal; or should we allow our States, \nthrough the incentive of the marketplace, to meet the goals relating to \ncertain levels of energy production being of a given type.\n  The reason I mention this is that, for the past couple of weeks, we \nhave witnessed an unprecedented attempt to write very complex \nlegislation on the floor of the Senate--an electricity title of an \nenergy bill.\n  Three years ago, Senator Murkowski, then serving as chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, on which I am privileged to \nserve, laid out three criteria for action as we move toward the \ndevelopment of a comprehensive energy policy.\n  Deregulate where possible; streamline when deregulation is not \npossible; and the third, respect the prerogatives of the States.\n  While that was not a mandate of the committee, it was certainly \nsomething to which all Members largely agreed.\n  To that, I add a fourth elementary principle that I think is \npertinent in crafting the legislation: Know what we are doing when we \nlegislate and when we grant new authority or change our delegation of \nauthority to a regulatory agency. In other words, look at the whole and \nnot just each of the pieces now scurrying to the Chamber to be attached \nto this Title of the Bill.\n  Title 2 fails all four tests.\n  The approach we are taking to create this Title is simply too \ndangerous for me: Trying to write complex legislation without \nunderstanding it, without allowing our staffs in a bipartisan way to \ncollectively make sure all the pieces fit together. Somehow politics \nleads us to this very precarious endeavor.\n  A few general observations before I go into the provisions of this \ntitle that the Senator from Vermont is amending. We have this month \nreceived a landmark Supreme Court decision on the authority of the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to order transmission \nrestructuring that has significant implications on the balance of \nFederal-State responsibility and authority for regulation of public \nutilities.\n  The majority opinion requires careful analysis in light of the \nstatements, on the one hand, that the Federal Commission could not \nassume jurisdiction over retail transmission without possibly running \nafoul of the Federal Power Act that gave jurisdiction to States over \nretail sales, and, on the other hand, that the Commission could take \ncontrol if it makes certain factual findings.\n  Mr. President, what have I just said? Has anyone really, here, \nunderstood the intricacy of what I have just said. Are we, today, \nmeasuring our actions against what the Supreme Court laid down \nrecently?\n  We must know how far the Commission can go now and how far we want it \nto go before we enact this law. Yet there is fundamentally no effort to \nmake that happen. The Commission has pursued a restructuring program to \nestablish regional transmission organizations, a virtual stand-alone \ntransmission business, as the Commission called it in 1999.\n  Before we enact a law, we need to carefully study that new reality. \nHow does the Supreme Court's decision in New York v. FERC affect those \nregional transmission organizations or RTOs? I note also that in all \nthese hundreds of pages of comprehensive energy bill, not one word \naddresses the issue of regional transmission organizations.\n  How can we enact a title on electricity without taking RTOs into \naccount, now that the Supreme Court has ruled? Yet we are not doing \nthat. If we are to call the electric title ``comprehensive,'' then we \nhave just taken a big chunk out of it, letting what the Court has said \nstand without explanation in the context of the current policies of the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  Even if we choose to remain silent on this important topic of the \nday, our choice should be a conscious one, clearly expressed and based \non a complete record and, at a minimum, after hearings in the committee \nof jurisdiction, not the lapse of haphazardly working out numerous \nspecifics on the floor of the Senate.\n  We are now in a scurry with amendments, one that has just been \noffered and one that is about to be offered. Staff are over speaking \nwith the Budget committee right now, seeing if amendments violate the \nBudget Act. Why? Because they were never tested, discussed, or reviewed \nin jurisdictional committees. So we are literally at this moment doing \nsomething that to my knowledge rarely occurs on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Many experts and the administration's ``National Energy Policy \nReport'' note that this country needs more investment in transmission. \nBetter returns bring investment. The Commission, in its RTO rule in \n1999, provided for certain kinds of price reforms to make investment \nmore attractive. This title has not one word on the reform of \ntransmission rates or prices.\n  Even if we conclude that it is not necessary to address the issue in \na statute because we support the course that the Commission is on, our \nconclusion should come from conscious choice after hearings in the \nappropriate committee--not, as I have already said, the lapse of \nhaphazardly legislating on the floor.\n  If you read these provisions, and I have, you will notice that, \nexcept for repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and \nthe Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978--two obsolete \nstatutes, I think most recognize, whose repeal I support--not one word \nin the title takes authority away from the Federal Government.\n  So as was our intent in 1992 to move electrical production in this \ncountry away from a structured environment, we now have an amendment on \nthe floor that takes us back to Federal mandates and Federal controls \nunder the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  I would like to spend a few minutes now, before my time runs out, on \nsome of the other provisions within this electrical title. Mr. \nPresident, let me assure you. At the end of the day, this is what I \nplan to do.\n\n  I have filed at the desk an amendment, an amendment that would strike \nthe electric title as it is proposed and amended by the actions of the \nSenate. In striking it, my amendment would replace the reliability \nlanguage that was just put in this afternoon, and would include the \ncurrent language in the bill repealing PURPA and PUHCA. It would also \ninclude consumer protection language that is currently in the bill \ncovering information disclosure, consumer privacy, and involuntary \nslamming and cramming.\n  These provisions address issues that have been debated in Committee \nand considered for quite some time. The provisions offered fall within \na general consensus that has evolved over the several years. These \nprovisions will do no harm, and will advance important solutions to \nproblems that have hobbled efforts to assure that our electricity \nsystem remains the most reliable in the world as well as ensure that \nconsumers of electricity are protected. Leaving the Title as is does \nnot advance deregulation, or a reform, but reregulation and a move \ntowards the centralizing of Federal authority at the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission.\n  Let me go to a provision in the bill, if I can: electricity mergers. \nThe provision raises the floor on merger review to $10 million from \n$50,000. How many transactions does it affect? I doubt that anyone has \nany idea. There have been no hearings, no analysis of the market to \ndetermine the impact of this proposal. More importantly, section \n(a)(1)(D) gives the Federal Government jurisdiction over acquisitions \nof generating plants, unless they are used exclusively in retail. \nUtilities sell at wholesale and retail, largely from the same plants. \nThey don't create separate generating facilities for those kinds of \npurposes. This section blurs the distinction between regulation of \nretail suppliers of electricity, traditionally the province of the \nStates, with the regulation of wholesale supply of electricity.\n  Why? Have States not been vigilant? Have they been too restrictive? \nWill the Federal Commission now preempt State procedures for assuring \nadequate supply? Will the Commission now use generation acquisitions as \na club to force restructuring, as it did with mergers previously?\n  No one knows the answer to what I believe is a significant question \nthat I\n\n[[Page S1913]]\n\nhave just asked. Yet if we had done our homework in committee, those \nanswers would already be on the table. You or I may agree or disagree \non them, but at least we would not be on the floor asking what is going \non and what are we doing. On the floor we cannot swear in witnesses and \nask questions. We cannot deliberate and write a committee report.\n  Finally, on mergers, paragraph (5) says:\n\n       The Commission shall, by rule, adopt procedures for the \n     expeditious consideration of applications . . ..\n\n  I like that.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Such rules shall identify classes of transactions or \n     specify the criteria for transactions that normally meet the \n     standards established in paragraph (4).\n\n  What does ``normally'' mean? If you have ever watched these kinds of \ntransactions or determinations, then you better understand what the \nword means because there is a long history of meaning as determined by \nCourts of law.\n  In the vacuum of the floor deliberations, we don't know nor will FERC \nunderstand our intent because they will have to thumb through pages and \npages of Congressional Record instead of a full committee report.\n  Going further, if the Commission does not act within 90 days on these \ntransactions, such application shall be deemed granted.\n  Maybe that is fine. Now comes the hook:\n  Unless the Commission finds that further consideration is required to \ndecide the issues and the Commission issues one or more orders tolling \nthe time for acting on the application for an additional 90 days.\n  What am I saying? How complicated is that? Is there a clear \nunderstanding of what is intended here?\n  The provision appears to permit the Commission to recoil from the \nvery speed the proposal is attempting to introduce.\n  As I said, I am generally for speed in decision-making, within \nreason, so that it isn't dragged out month after month and hundreds of \nthousands, if not millions, of dollars are lost and ultimately recouped \nfrom the ratepayers.\n  Under this provision, as I read it, the Commission could take away \nwith one hand what we have required with the other.\n  What standard do we set here to make sure FERC doesn't toll away the \n90 days into long delay? How does FERC intend to use this loophole? \nWhat has FERC done in the past? We cannot know because in the Chamber \nwe cannot hold a hearing to get an interpretation from the Commission \nitself or legal and consumer groups as to what they believe the intent \nwould be and how they would choose to carry it out.\n  That is the reality.\n  Let me touch on one other subject, market-based rates.\n  This section in the legislation on the floor would tell the \nCommission it can do what it wants because this section says it shall \nconsider ``such factors as the Commission may deem relevant.'' That is \na phenomenal grant of authority.\n  The Federal Commission can use this as a club for forcing \nrestructuring, as it has in the past forced, and it can again force \nutilities to buy and sell electricity against their will, subordinate \ncapital retail consumers, reveal proprietary information, and join \nregional transmission organizations. Each of these goals appears very \nmuch to be in the Commission's sights as we speak.\n  The section lists possible factors: ``the nature of the market and \nits response mechanisms.'' What does ``the nature'' of the market mean? \nResponse mechanisms? What kind? And to what? To me, the best response \nmechanism we have is the law of supply and demand. But that is not \nnecessarily the response mechanism at which the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission would be looking.\n  My colleagues may argue that the Commission knows what it means. \nMaybe so. But we need to know what this means before we give the \nCommission such vast authority.\n  Revocation of market-based rates in section (f) says FERC shall set \nthe just and reasonable rates by order. Under what terms? From the time \nit does so forward, or can FERC subject utilities to open-ended \nretroactive refunds, as it is trying to do now?\n  Of course, in all of those situations we have seen the frustration \nthat has been brought about by the attempt of FERC to do this recently. \nWe don't know because we are legislating on the fly again without \ncommittee deliberations.\n  How about a refund effective date?\n  This section changes the date from which the Commission can order \nrefunds of existing rates. Current law makes it, at the earliest, 60 \ndays from the complaint or FERC investigation. This gives utilities \ntime to digest the complaint to know the extent of their jeopardy. \nSixty days also gives companies time to secure financial hedges and, \nmost importantly, in this era of post-Enron disclosure, to make timely \ndisclosure to the investors, the shareholders, and security regulators.\n  Perhaps other considerations of consumer protection outweigh these \nharms. But can anyone tell me what they are? Has the current law harmed \nanyone? Will this fix any harm? This would not have appeased my \ncolleagues from California two summers ago, I can tell you that. We \ncannot know when we legislate from the floor.\n  I could go on. My time is running out. I will speak more about this \npossibly tomorrow and on Monday because I want to walk my colleagues \nthrough the substance of this title and to justify why I think it is \nnecessary to strike this Title and replace consensus provisions. We \nmust do no harm and we do no harm by establishing not only reliability \nbut by repealing obsolete law--PURPA and PUHCA and by putting in the \nkind of consumer protections that all of us, or most of us, have agreed \nare fitting and proper.\n  That is what we ought to do in the Senate. But there is a rush to \njudgment today in a time when the committee has had no opportunity to \nhold this fine print up to the light of day and to have our staff in a \nbipartisan way--our professional staff who have dealt with this law and \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for years--to examine it and \nat least give us the reasonable interpretation of what all of this \nmight mean.\n  If I have confused anyone today, I hope I have because this is \nphenomenally complicated law. My guess is that most of my colleagues \nhave not read the bill. If they had, they could not understand it. That \nis in no way to impugn the chairman of the committee. It is his bill. \nMy guess is he is ready, and certainly his staff is. But when it deals \nwith the kind of complications that I bring out and the simple \ninterpretation that can turn a utility on its head, destroy hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of investment, or redirect it in another manner, it \nis time we understand what ``normal'' means in the eyes of the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, and a lot of other words that are now \ninjected into what could become new utility law for this country.\n  I will conclude my remarks for the day. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, if I may, I would like to respond to \nsome of the statements that have been made by my colleagues.\n  First of all, my friend from Alaska quoted a figure of $6.4 billion \nhaving being spent in the last 5 years on renewable energy. That sounds \nlike a lot. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates \nthat between 1999 and 2003 the oil and gas industry received $11 \nbillion in direct tax breaks--over three times what was given, in that \nsense, to renewables.\n  If you want to take a look at where your money ought to go, it ought \nto go where you can get the best buck. It is certainly not with coal.\n  These kinds of subsidies have been there for decades and decades--in \nsome years greater than others. For example, in a typical year, $21 \nbillion in Federal subsidies go to fossil fuels, $11 billion to \nnuclear, and $1 billion to renewables.\n  Again, when you look at energy costs with those kinds of subsidies, \nrenewables are obviously the best way to go. But you have to have the \nsources to be able to provide the electricity.\n  As to the cost of the Federal 20 percent RPS, I note that the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy has consistently found that it will not raise the \naverage overall energy sector costs at all.\n  My friend says that whatever costs are incurred are passed on to the \nconsumer. That is true. Consumers also\n\n[[Page S1914]]\n\npay the massive cost from powerplant emissions, both environmental and \nhealth related.\n  For instance, recent studies have shown that emissions from coal-\nfired plants lead to a massive 12-percent increase in lung cancer. \nObviously, if you are using wind, you do not have any ramifications.\n  The Senator from Alaska, who just came back to the Chamber, points to \na large ``footprint'' from wind turbines. Let me show you this picture, \nwhich shows how wind turbines are indeed ``multiple use'' in the best \nsense, with farmers able to raise crops and graze livestock beneath \nthem.\n  The wind energy alone from a 20-percent renewable standard will \nprovide $1.2 billion in new income for farmers, ranchers, and rural \nlandowners. That is $1.2 billion in income to our farmers.\n  My amendment of a 20-percent standard by 2020 is achievable, good for \nthe economy, good for consumers, and good for the environment.\n  I urge all Members to please support my amendment. We have to make \nprogress. It has been some 30 years that we have been working on \nrenewables. The successes are growing, and they are spreading \nthroughout world. But we are not maximizing it. In this Nation, we are \nnot taking anywhere near the advantage we should in renewables.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment. Hopefully, this \nwill lead to a much more prosperous future for not only the energy \nusers but for those who produce the energy, such as those on our farms.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time is remaining prior to the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes 12 seconds under the \ncontrol of Senator Craig.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  My colleague was referring to millions rather than billions. I think \nhe used the term ``billions of dollars saved.'' I think on the chart it \nshows ``millions.'' But nevertheless, I----\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The total was $1.2 billion.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. So $1.2 billion. The chart said $125 million.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That was only for that farm.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Just that farm?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator.\n  I want to make a point on renewables because renewables certainly \nhave a value. But this isn't the first time we have come to find the \ncontribution of renewables.\n  We have expended $6.4 billion on renewables in the past 5 years. We \nare going to continue to do that at a relatively high rate.\n  We have had $1.5 billion for R, $500 million for solar, $330 \nmillion for biomass, $150 million for wind; and $100 million for \nhydrogen; almost $5 billion in tax benefits, and $2.6 billion in \nreduced excise taxes for alcohol fuels.\n  I support renewables, as does virtually every Member of this body. \nBut the question in my mind, of increasing to the point that the \nSenator has suggested--an aggressive 10 percent to 20 percent--will \ncost an extraordinary amount of money when you consider that nonhydro \nrenewables make up less than 4 percent of our total energy needs and \nless than 2 percent of our electricity consumption.\n\n  So we need a realistic national energy strategy that includes \nrenewables as part of a balanced energy portfolio. But let's not fool \nthe public into thinking that renewable energy can replace coal, oil, \nnatural gas, and nuclear anytime soon.\n  Even if we adopt an aggressive 10- to 20-percent RPS, where will the \nother 80 to 90 percent of our electric needs come from? Fossil and \nnuclear, clearly.\n  Even with 3 to 5 percent renewable fuels, the other 95 to 97 percent \nwould still come from oil. Let's move it. Let's recognize the world \nmoves on oil.\n  As a consequence, Mr. President, I encourage Members to reject the \nproposed doubling of renewables simply because the cost-benefit ratio \nis so far out of line with what is technically achievable.\n  I think the National Research Council that reviewed the Department of \nEnergy's renewable energy programs would substantiate that substantial \nimprovements in performance and reductions in the costs of renewable \nenergy technologies certainly have been made. But deployment goals for \nrenewable technologies are based on unreasonable expectations and on \nunrealistic promises, and to mandate this would put an extraordinary \ncost on the consumer. And I assure you, that is where the costs would \nhave to be passed.\n  So I encourage Members to reject the proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Jeffords amendment No. 3017. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wellstone). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there will be no more votes tonight.\n  In consultation with the Republican leader and the managers of the \nbill, and Senator Reid, I do not believe we are in a position to come \nto any further conclusions on amendments tonight. So I do not expect \nthere will be any additional rollcalls.\n  There will be a rollcall vote on one of the two judicial nominations \npending on the calendar tomorrow morning at 9:15. Then there will be an \nadditional vote on the second judicial nomination on Monday at 6 \no'clock. So Senators should be made aware that tomorrow morning we will \nhave a vote on a judicial nomination. It appears that may be the only \nvote we will have scheduled tomorrow, unfortunately. Then, on Monday, \nwe will have a second vote which may or may not be the only vote. We \nare not sure at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1914-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1914-S1915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 2356\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have been working with colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle with regard to the campaign finance reform \nbill. I am now in a position to announce that we are able to reach a \nunanimous consent agreement on the motion to proceed to the campaign \nfinance reform bill.\n\n[[Page S1915]]\n\n  So I ask unanimous consent that, at 3 p.m., Monday, March 18, the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 318, H.R. 2356, the \ncampaign finance reform legislation, and that the cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we will continue to take this matter one \nstep at a time. We are encouraging Senators to express themselves on \ncampaign finance reform tomorrow, or on energy tomorrow. My hope is \nthat the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, and other Senators who wish to \nbe heard on their amendments, will offer them tomorrow, will debate \nthem tomorrow, will make sure that we use the day we have available to \nus tomorrow to move the legislative process along. That is also true on \nMonday. We will come in at 3. We encourage Senators to offer amendments \non the campaign finance reform bill on Monday. We will have further \ndiscussions, of course, with our colleagues with regard to the campaign \nfinance reform bill. I will say, if there are amendments to be offered, \nwe will have debate and further consideration of those amendments on \nMonday and Tuesday.\n  It would be my expectation to file cloture on the bill for a cloture \nvote on Wednesday, as we currently expect it. That would then require \nthe vote, as I have said on many occasions, no later than Friday, which \nwould accommodate our schedule for the balance of next week.\n  I have said, and will repeat, if there is a way we can resolve \nwhatever other outstanding procedural questions between now and Monday, \nor between now and Wednesday, I am certainly more than ready to do so. \nBut I appreciate at least this progress. We will have more to say \nbeginning Monday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Assuming, Mr. President, the schedule of campaign \nfinance being resolved Wednesday, is it the majority leader's \nintention, then, to go back to energy?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. My hope is we can \nfinish this bill sometime soon. It would be my desire to continue to \nwork on it until we do so, with the exception, of course, of the \ncampaign finance reform bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And, Mr. President, recognizing that may be extended, \nI gather the agreement is still under consideration, but if it is \nprolonged, do you intend to proceed and conclude campaign finance and \nthen ultimately go back to energy?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, notwithstanding that, and after a discussion \nwith Senator Daschle, I will take leader time to make some remarks \nabout the vote just taken in the Judiciary Committee. I yield myself \nleader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is my 14th year in the Senate. There \nhave been a lot of high moments and low moments in that tenure. I \ncertainly worked very hard, and in my position as majority leader, I \nlearned a lot of lessons. As you go along, sometimes you do things that \nSenators agree with, and sometimes they do not--on both sides of the \naisle. I understand that.\n  But I must say that I feel about as bad about the Senate right now as \nI have in the years that I have been watching the Senate and that I \nhave been in the Senate. I think the Senate Judiciary Committee just \nparticipated in a miscarriage of justice. I am very much concerned \nabout the effect it is going to have on the Senate, and on our \nrelationship on both sides of the aisle.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee just voted against the nomination of \nJudge Charles Pickering from Mississippi to move from the Southern \nDistrict Court of Mississippi to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nThey voted against, as I understand, reporting out his nomination \nunfavorably, and they voted against reporting out his nomination \nwithout recommendation. That was not exactly the sequence, or exactly \nthe motion. The fact is they have voted against the nomination of this \nvery fine man.\n  I think for the Judiciary Committee to take the action as they did is \nvery unfortunate and very unfair to a man I have known directly and \npersonally for about 40 years.\n  I know him as an individual. I know his family. I have been in his \nhome. I have been to football games with him. I have been to campground \nrallies with him, and I know him very well. He certainly is qualified \nand certainly deserves better treatment than he has received in this \nprocess. I think this is a continuation of the politics of personal \ndestruction. I think his character has been smeared. I think a lot of \nincorrect information and misleading information was put out about the \njudge. That was wrong.\n  Now a number of Senators are saying: Well, yes, we realize that \ninformation is not right but voted against him anyway. As a matter of \nfact, this judge has been very courageous and has been a moderating \nforce and a leader in trying to bring about reconciliation and bringing \npeople together--not drive them apart, particularly in the area of race \nrelations in our State.\n  I think one thing that strikes me so hard and has hurt me about this \nis because, once again, I believe this is a slap at Mississippi, my \nState. I think that some people thought: Oh, well. Good. This is a \nFederal district judge. He is a known conservative. He is a known \nRepublican. He was selected on the recommendation of Trent Lott and \nThad Cochran by President George W. Bush, and he is from Mississippi. \nThis is one we can nail. He surely must have a bad record over his \nlifetime, being from that State, on race relations.\n  Now, people and members of the media that had earlier been critical \nof him said: No, no, no. We didn't mean that. We never really said \nthat. We take it back. Maybe he has been OK in this area, but now our \ncomplaint is something about his demeanor on the bench that we don't \nlike.\n  But I think, once again, there are people trying to use the ghosts of \nthe past to keep us from rising up and looking toward the future \ntogether in a positive way.\n  When you have African Americans, women, and just about every Democrat \nin the State saying this is a good man and he ought to be confirmed, \nyou ought to begin to ask yourself something. In fact, somebody said: \nWell, the national NAACP said he shouldn't be confirmed. However, the \nlocal people within the NAACP who know him best say he should be \nconfirmed. When asked about that, and about the response of the people \nwho know him best, one of the critic's responses was: well, they were \nduped. You don't dupe a lot of people when you live in Laurel, MS, on \nissues such as race relations. Everybody knows everybody. Everybody \nknows where you were in 1967, where you were in 1980, and where you \nhave been in the 1990s.\n  So I take it personally. I am hurt by the attacks on this fine man. \nHe does\n\n[[Page S1916]]\n\nfeel strongly about his faith. He is a believing Christian. He is an \nactive participant in the church. He was president of the Mississippi \nBaptist Association. He was president of the Mississippi Gideon \nAssociation.\n  Is that a problem? Is that a disqualification?\n  This is the second nomination I have seen this year where it has \nlooked as though if you feel strongly about your faith--your Christian \nfaith--that there is something suspicious about that. Whatever your \nfaith is--I think if you are committed to your faith--it should not be \na disqualification from office. One of the things I admire most about \nJoe Lieberman is that he feels strongly about his faith, and he goes to \nextra lengths to abide by it, even during the campaign.\n  I remember during the campaign of 2000 when I came into National \nAirport. The campaign plane of the Vice Presidential candidate for the \nDemocrats was sitting there at the airport on Saturday. Most of us were \ncampaigning like crazy on Saturday. But not Joe Lieberman. He was \nfulfilling his commitment to his faith.\n\n  So, all of this bothers me. It is an attack on my State. It is an \nattack on the nominee's religion. It is an attack on his positions on \nrace, which have been inaccurately portrayed. I think this is a real \ntragedy I am so sorry to see.\n  I saw a letter in a newspaper just last night from an African \nAmerican. I think maybe it was a paper in New Jersey. The caption of \nthe letter was ``The Fruit Never Falls Very Far From the Tree''. This \nwas an African American talking about his run for Congress. I guess he \nwas an incumbent House Member, a Democrat, and he was running in the \nprimary. When he got to a particular site, he didn't really have enough \nequipment to put up his signs. When he started working and scurrying \naround trying to get it done, Congressman Charles ``Chip'' Pickering \nshowed up.\n  He said: We will help you. Take some of our stuff. He didn't win, but \nCharles ``Chip'' Pickering went on to win. It is a small thing. But it \ntells you a lot about a man and about a man's son.\n  Charles Pickering's son worked for me. Chip Pickering is one of the \nfinest young men I have known. He was a missionary behind the Iron \nCurtain. He was my legislative director, and a great legislator. He not \nonly knew the substance, but he knew the art of the possible. Senator \nFritz Hollings can tell you that we got the telecommunications bill \npassed because of the brilliance of Congressman Chip Pickering, the son \nof this nominee. This young man has now worked day and night to try to \nhelp his dad get through this unfair crucible--now without success.\n  I feel like I failed him. I have tried to understand: Why is this \nhappening? What is happening here? Is it just about this man? I don't \nthink so. No. I think it is a lot bigger than that. I think it is \nreally directed at future Supreme Court nominees. This is a message to \nthe President. You send us a pro-life conservative man of faith for the \nSupreme Court, and we will take care that he or she does not get \nconfirmed.\n  That is what it is really about. But I also think it is a shot at \nthis man. I think it is a personal shot at me. This is a: ``We will \nshow you; you didn't always move our nominees'' payback. But, as I \nrecall, the Judiciary Committee under the Republicans didn't kill a \nsingle nominee during the Clinton years in the committee. We did defeat \none of them, but we first reported him out of the committee and then \ndefeated him on the floor with a recorded vote. Yes, there were some \nthat didn't get through the process. There were some that took a long \ntime to get through.\n  But again, I think this is payback. The problem with payback is, \nwhere does it ever end? You know: We paid you back. You pay us back. \nNow we are going to pay you back. Where does it end? Is this the way \nfor the Senate to act? Is this the process which this body should use \nto confirm judges?\n  Senator Joe Biden, in 1997, said: Hey, these nominees should not be \nkilled in the Judiciary Committee. As he put it, ``Everyone that is \nnominated is entitled to have a shot, to have a hearing, and to have a \nshot to be heard on the floor and have a vote on the floor.''\n  Where in the Constitution does it say that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee will decide on the confirmation of nominees? The Constitution \nsays the Senate is to give its advice and consent. That's where Senator \nBiden was in 1997. I think a week or so ago he kind of hinted at the \nsame sentiment again, particularly when you have straight party-line \nvotes.\n  But I think really, under any conditions, these judicial nominees \nshould come to the floor for a vote. It does not take a whole lot of \ntime. But maybe we need to try to find a way to work something such as \nthat out.\n  But in the meantime, it is obvious that this very fine judge has been \ntreated very badly. I think it is beneath the Senate and its dignity \nwhen we do that to nominees.\n  Judge Pickering will not be the loser. He is and will be revered more \nthan ever in my State. Former Governor William Winter came up and \ntalked about him. The sitting attorney general came up and said: We \nought to confirm him. So did the sitting Lieutenant Governor. These are \nall Democrats.\n  Again, this man's stature has gone up, not down, in the State. And \nthis whole process probably greatly enhances his son's stature as a \nCongressman in the State of Mississippi. His head will be high and he \nwill be a sitting judge. And he will handle himself with dignity and \nhonesty, like he always has.\n  No, he is not the loser. We are the loser. We have lost the services \nof a good man. And we have demeaned the institution by what has \nhappened in this instance.\n  Every newspaper in our State--every one--has editorialized and run \nnews stories about this, saying this is wrong. And these newspapers are \nlike the news media up here, they are not exactly your basic \nRepublican-leaning organizations. These are Gannett newspapers, \nThompson newspapers, the national newspaper chains. And they rip me \nregularly, as they do most Republicans and most conservatives. But \nevery one of them, including the Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, MS, the Sun \nHerald on the Mississippi gulf coast and the Northeast Mississippi \nJournal have editorialized about how unfair, unfortunate, and really \ndastardly this deed has been.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this editorial from the Tupelo Daily \nJournal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Tupelo Daily Journal, Mar. 11, 2002]\n\n                           5th Circuit Fiasco\n\n\n              attacks on pickering likely to be successful\n\n       Twelve years ago, the U.S. Senate approved Charles \n     Pickering's nomination for a federal district court judgeship \n     unanimously. This week, it's likely that President Bush's \n     nomination of Pickering to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals won't even make it out of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       Democrats on the committee, under pressure from liberal \n     interest groups, oppose Pickering. They've either bought into \n     or allowed the grossly distorted picture of Pickering as an \n     unreconstructed, Old South segregationist to go unchallenged.\n       It doesn't matter that Mississippi Attorney General Mike \n     Moore, a well-known figure in the national Democratic Party, \n     led a delegation to Washington last week in support of \n     Pickering and took him letters of support from Democratic \n     Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck and former Gov. \n     William Winter, himself a respected leader in national party \n     circles.\n       It doesn't matter that black political and civil rights \n     leaders in south Mississippi who have worked with Pickering \n     for decades almost uniformly support his nomination, a fact \n     confirmed when the New York Times--which editorially opposes \n     Pickering's confirmation--sent a reporter to Laurel to look \n     into his relationships with those leaders.\n       It doesn't matter that the American Bar Association, hardly \n     a conservative bastion, has given Pickering its top rating of \n     ``highly qualified.''\n       What matters is that Pickering is a political and judicial \n     conservative whose nomination happens to come along at a time \n     when the left is looking to send a message to the president \n     that they'll fight him--and win--on appellate court nominees, \n     including Supreme Court choices.\n       No one who has been before him in the 12 years he has been \n     on the federal bench has stepped forward to say that \n     Pickering was anything but fair and unbiased. Those who know \n     Pickering know a man whose deep religious faith--an attribute \n     looked upon with suspicion by some of his opponents--has been \n     the impetus for his active role in racial reconciliation \n     efforts in Mississippi. They also know a man whose personal \n     character and\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\n     integrity has never been questioned--until now, when the \n     political ends apparently justify the means in some people's \n     minds.\n       When confronted with his support in Mississippi among the \n     people--Democrat and Republican, black and white--who have \n     known him longest and best, opponents have simply said that \n     those opinions don't matter, or even that Pickering has duped \n     the home folks. They know the real Pickering, they say, and \n     he's a right-wing extremist who'll turn back the clock on \n     civil rights by decades.\n       This is sheer demagoguery, made all the more deplorable \n     because it exploits Mississippi's easy-mark image to smear a \n     man who doesn't deserve it. The only bright side of all this \n     is the way so many politically and racially diverse \n     Mississippians have rallied to Pickering's defense.\n       Barring a political miracle, Pickering's nomination appears \n     doomed. This political mugging will say a lot more about the \n     perpetrators than about their victim.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am going to read it because it sort of \nsums up what a lot of the editorials are saying in these newspapers.\n  It is entitled: ``5th Circuit Fiasco.''\n\n       Twelve years ago, the U.S. Senate approved Charles \n     Pickering's nomination for a federal district court judgeship \n     unanimously. This week, it's likely that President Bush's \n     nomination of [Judge] Pickering to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court \n     of Appeals won't even make it out of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       Democrats on the committee, under pressure from liberal \n     interest groups, oppose Pickering. They've either brought \n     into or allowed the grossly distorted picture of Pickering as \n     an unreconstructed, Old South segregationist to go \n     unchallenged.\n       It doesn't matter that Mississippi Attorney General Mike \n     Moore, a well-known figure in the national Democratic party, \n     led a delegation to Washington last week in support of \n     Pickering and took him letters of support from Democratic \n     Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck and former Gov. \n     William Winter, himself a respected leader in national party \n     circles.\n\n  Madam President, All those people have been leaders in trying to help \nmove our State forward in many ways, including in race relations. Let \nme continue from the editorial.\n\n       It doesn't matter that black political and civil rights \n     leaders in south Mississippi who have worked with Pickering \n     for decades almost uniformly support his nomination, a fact \n     confirmed when the New York Times--which editorially opposes \n     Pickering's confirmation--sent a reporter to Laurel to look \n     into his relationships with those leaders.\n       It doesn't matter that the American Bar Association, hardly \n     a conservative bastion, has given Pickering its top rating of \n     ``highly qualified.''\n\n  Madam President, this is not in the article, but I will say from my \nstandpoint, that I am always concerned that the American Bar \nAssociation looks particularly hard to find some improper demeanor on \nthe bench, or some hint of some misunderstanding of the Constitution, \nor some slight in a racial area regarding Republican nominees. But no, \nnot in this instance, they found Judge Pickering highly qualified, the \nhighest rating they can give a judge.\n  Now reading on from the editorial:\n\n       What matters is that Pickering is a political and judicial \n     conservative whose nomination happens to come along at a time \n     when the left is looking to send a message to the president \n     that they'll fight him--and win--on appellate court nominees, \n     including Supreme Court choices.\n       No one who has been before him in the 12 years he has been \n     on the federal bench has stepped forward to say that \n     Pickering was anything but fair and unbiased. Those who know \n     Pickering know a man whose deep religious faith--an attribute \n     looked upon with suspicion by some of his opponents--has been \n     the impetus for his active role in racial reconciliation \n     efforts in Mississippi. They also know a man whose personal \n     character and integrity have never been questioned--until \n     now, when the political ends apparently justify the means in \n     some people's minds.\n       When confronted with his support in Mississippi among the \n     people--Democrat and Republican, black and white--who have \n     known him longest and best, opponents have simply said that \n     those opinions don't matter, or even that Pickering has duped \n     the home folks. They know the real Pickering, they say, \n     and he's a right-wing extremist who'll turn back the clock \n     on civil rights by decades.\n       This is sheer political demagoguery, made all the more \n     deplorable because it exploits Mississippi's easy-mark image \n     to smear a man who doesn't deserve it. The only bright side \n     of all this is the way so many politically and racially \n     diverse Mississippians have rallied to Pickering's defense.\n       Barring a political miracle, Pickering's nomination appears \n     doomed. This political mugging will say a lot more about the \n     perpetrators than about their victim.\n\n  Madam President, this is an editorial from a newspaper that certainly \nisn't known for endorsements, on a regular basis, of Republicans or \nconservatives. So I think it sums up very well what has happened here.\n  Now, the larger question is what does it mean for the committee and \nthe Senate? I am not going to let go of this. This is going to stick in \nmy mind for a long time, but I am going to try to look at from a \nbroader perspective.\n  There are still eight nominees pending before the Judiciary Committee \nthat were sent there last May--I think May 8 or 9----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Ninth.\n  Mr. LOTT. May 9th for the circuit court: men, women, and minorities \nwho have not even had a hearing to date.\n  Now, I realize that the majority changed hands in June, but these \nwere the first nominees sent up. They are some of the best \nintellectually qualified nominees to come before the Senate in a long \ntime.\n  Judge Pickering who was nominated later on May 25th has endured not \none, but two hostile hearings. However, the remaining eight nominees \nfrom May 9th have not even their first hearings. Why not?\n  It is true that district judges have moved along a little better. I \nthink there are over 50 court nominees now pending before the Senate. \nThis cannot continue.\n  I went through the same thing when I was majority leader. And there \nwere complaints on the other side. A lot of things were done by the \nother side to tie up the Senate and make it difficult to get our work \ndone. And that is unfortunate. But I think that we are fixing to see \nthe same thing occur from our side this time.\n  We cannot let stand a plan to deny President Bush his nominees to the \nfederal courts. If they are not qualified by education, by experience, \nif there are some ethical problems, opposition to them is \nunderstandable. Don't move them, don't vote on them, don't confirm \nthem. But if we don't see marked progress in general, and if we don't \nsee an end to the orchestrated character assassinations, the Senate \nwill not be the same for a long time. I don't mean it as a threat. I \nmean it as a requirement, and, therefore something we should find a way \nto avoid if possible.\n  It is hard for me to really express the disappointment and the \npassion I feel about this because I am so disappointed in how this \nunfair and unfounded episode has turned out. But I could not let this \nvote go unnoted or without a response this very night.\n  So I wish to begin the process by offering a Sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. It is a simple one. It basically cites the statistics of \nthe nominations that are pending, the vacancies. There are 96 current \njudicial vacancies. It does talk about what has happened in previous \nadministrations. And all it says is:\n\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that, in the interests of the \n     administration of justice, the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     shall hold hearings on the nominees submitted by the \n     President on May 9, 2001, by May 9, 2002.\n\n  Isn't a year long enough to at least have a hearing? That is all it \nsays, just a hearing.\n  I do want to take a minute to thank President Bush for nominating a \nfine jurist in Charles Pickering and for sticking by him. I really \nappreciated the fact he had a press conference yesterday and commenting \nhow fine a man he is and that he should be confirmed. The President \nalso said it is not about this one man; it is about a quality system of \njustice in our Federal judiciary. That is what has suffered here.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3028\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I was present in a conversation that the \nmajority leader and minority leader had just a short time ago. It is my \nunderstanding that the distinguished Senator from Mississippi will \nallow, if Senator Daschle chooses, to offer a second-degree amendment \nat some subsequent time. The majority leader has not yet decided.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I certainly would have no objection to \nthat. That was my understanding. I think we ought to have a full \ndebate. I assume the Democrats are going to vote for the resolution I \nhave offered. If they have\n\n[[Page S1918]]\n\nsomething else they want to offer, fine. Let's have a full debate on \nit. Maybe that will begin a process that will lead to some changes in \nthe way we are doing things. I hope for the best.\n  Mr. REID. Continuing my reservation, the majority leader has \nindicated to me and to the minority leader that he has not decided \nwhether he wants to offer a second-degree amendment. The courtesy of \nthe Senator from Mississippi is appreciated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3028:\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     ``SEC.   . FAIR TREATMENT OF PRESIDENTIAL JUDICIAL NOMINEES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Senate Judiciary Committee's pace in acting on \n     judicial nominees thus far in this Congress has caused the \n     number of judges confirmed by the Senate to fall below the \n     number of judges who have retired during the same period, \n     such that the 67 judicial vacancies that existed when \n     Congress adjourned under President Clinton's last term in \n     office in 2000 have now grown to 96 judicial vacancies, which \n     represents an increase from 7.9 percent to 11 percent in the \n     total number of Federal judgeships that are currently vacant;\n       (2) thirty one of the 96 current judicial vacancies are on \n     the United States Courts of Appeals, representing a 17.3 \n     percent vacancy rate for such seats;\n       (3) seventeen of the 31 vacancies on the Courts of Appeals \n     have been declared ``judicial emergencies'' by the \n     Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts;\n       (4) during the first 2 years of President Reagan's first \n     term, 19 of the 20 circuit court nominations that he \n     submitted to the Senate were confirmed; and during the first \n     2 years of President George H. W. Bush's term, 22 of the 23 \n     circuit court nominations that he submitted to the Senate \n     were confirmed; and during the first 2 years of President \n     Clinton's first term, 19 of the 22 circuit court nominations \n     that he submitted to the Senate were confirmed; and\n       (5) only 7 of President George W. Bush's 29 circuit court \n     nominees have been confirmed to date, representing just 24 \n     percent of such nominations submitted to the Senate.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that, in the interests of the administration of justice, the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee shall hold hearings on the \n     nominees submitted by the President on May 9, 2001, by May 9, \n     2002.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to respond very briefly to \nthe minority leader's comments.\n  I am a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Let me say at the \noutset that one of the most painful assignments I have found serving in \nCongress, particularly in the Senate, is to stand in judgment of \nanother person. We are called on to do that regularly in the advice and \nconsent process. It is never easy, particularly when there is \ncontroversy and particularly when you end up voting against that person \nfor whatever reason.\n  I cannot appreciate the pain that the minority leader feels at this \nmoment. A good and close friend of his has not been successful before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, and his words, I am sure, were \nheartfelt about his love for Judge Pickering and his close friendship. \nWhatever I am about to say I hope will in no way reflect negatively on \nwhat is clearly a strong personal friendship between the minority \nleader and Judge Pickering. But there are two or three points which I \nwould like to make so that they are clear on the record.\n  I have served on the Senate Judiciary Committee for 4 of the 6 years \nnow that I have been in the Senate. I have witnessed the Senate \nJudiciary Committee under the control of Republicans, and I have seen \nit for the 8 months that the Democrats have been in control. I can tell \nyou that the courtesies that were extended to Judge Pickering in terms \nof a timely hearing were extraordinary.\n  They were extraordinary because his first hearing was in October of \nlast year, when this Capitol complex was virtually closed down for \nsecurity reasons. Exceptional efforts were made to keep our word to \nJudge Pickering that he would have a full hearing. It was impossible to \nuse the ordinary buildings we use, so the hearing was held in the \nCapitol Building. Many of us stayed over to give him his opportunity \nfor testimony.\n\n  At that hearing, it was established that he had some 1,000 or 1,200 \nunpublished opinions as a Federal district court judge, and we made it \nclear we wanted to review those before making a final decision. So a \nsecond hearing was scheduled. And as soon as those had been reviewed, \nthat hearing was held in February. The hearing went on for the better \npart of a day under the chairmanship at the time of Senator Feinstein \nof California.\n  Judge Pickering was given complete opportunity to explain his point \nof view and to answer all questions--another timely hearing. That led \nto the decision today on Judge Pickering's nomination to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.\n  I could go into detail, but I will not, about why I voted against \nJudge Pickering. There was one point that was raised by Senator Lott as \nminority leader which I must address. It is a point that, frankly, \nshould not be left unresolved on the floor of the Senate. Until Senator \nLott came to the floor and announced the religious affiliation of Judge \nPickering, I had no idea what it was. No question was ever asked of \nJudge Pickering about his religious affiliation--none whatsoever. Nor \nin any private conversation with any member of the committee was that \nsubject ever raised. To suggest that anyone on this committee voted \nagainst Judge Pickering because of his religious belief is just wrong.\n  I will say this: If anyone ever raises that issue concerning any \nnominee, I hope they will join me in protesting questioning a person's \nreligious belief, which should have nothing whatsoever to do with the \nqualifications to serve this country.\n  That issue never came up. To suggest he was rejected for that reason \nis just wrong. There were many questions that were raised. Those can be \naddressed tomorrow, and I am certain they will be by Senator Patrick \nLeahy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and others who will \ncomment on the activities of the committee. I will leave that to them \nentirely.\n  I do want to make clear for the record one last point. The Fifth \nCircuit has been a controversial circuit--it is a circuit that includes \nthe States of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi--controversial in that \nsince 1994, no vacancy had been filled in the Fifth Circuit until last \nyear when President Clinton submitted the names of three judges to fill \nvacancies to that Fifth Circuit. Not a single one of his nominees was \neven given the courtesy of a hearing. Those judges were pending before \nthe Judiciary Committee under the control of the Republican Party for \nan extraordinarily long period of time. Let me be specific.\n  Jorge Rangel, nominated in July of 1997, was returned in October of \n1998. It sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee under the direction \nof the Republican Party for 15 months with no action taken. An effort \nto fill this vacancy in the Fifth Circuit and the nominee was never \neven given the courtesy of a hearing.\n  Enrique Mareno, nominated by President Clinton in September of 1999, \nrenominated in January of 2001, was finally withdrawn in March of 2001; \n17 months pending before the Senate Judiciary Committee; never given \nthe courtesy of a hearing.\n  Alston Johnson, nominated April of 1999, finally, his name was \nwithdrawn 23 months later--never even given the courtesy of a hearing \nin the same Fifth Circuit. Now, the minority leader comes before us and \nsays all of the nominees of President Bush as of last year have to \nreceive immediate hearings before this committee.\n  Well, let the record reflect that the action taken today on Judge \nPickering was the 43rd Federal judge who has been considered by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee since control of the Senate passed to the \nDemocrats. More Federal judges have been reported out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee under Chairman Pat Leahy, a Democrat, with a \nRepublican President in the White House, than in 4 of the years that \nthe Republicans controlled the Senate Judiciary Committee and President \nClinton, a Democrat, was in the White House.\n  To suggest we are blocking and stopping the efforts of the President \nto fill judicial vacancies is just wrong and not supported by the \nfacts.\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\n  Let me add one last thing. To suggest this is some discriminatory \naction against people who live in the Fifth Circuit is wrong as well. \nThe fact that Judge Pickering was from Mississippi, frankly, had no \nrelevance as far as I was concerned. Just last year, Judge Edith \nClement of Louisiana, nominated by President Bush to fill a spot on the \nFifth Circuit, was approved in record time by a unanimous vote on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and a unanimous vote on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  For the record, so there is no doubt about it, Judge Edith Clement \nwas conservative, a Republican, and a member of the Federalist Society, \nand none of those things slowed down the consideration of her \nnomination by the Judiciary Committee. We gave Judge Clement her \nopportunity to serve, and we gave President Bush his nominee in record \ntime. We extended courtesies to Judge Clement which were denied \nconsistently by the same Committee under Republican leadership when \nPresident Clinton was in the White House.\n  So I think the record has to be clear in terms of where we stand and \nwhere we are going. I am troubled that we have reached this impasse, \nand I hope we can find our way through it. But I hope the record will \nbe clear as we go through this consideration. For those who have argued \nthat someone called Judge Pickering a racist, I have not heard that \nword used in reference to Judge Pickering, and repeatedly, on both \nsides of the table, Democrat and Republican, today in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, that conclusion was rejected. I personally reject \nit. I don't believe Judge Pickering is a racist. I believe if you look \nat his personal history, you will find he did things in the fifties and \nsixties in Mississippi which he personally regrets, and said as much to \nthe committee.\n  Let me be honest. We have all done things in our lives that we \nregret. It should not be held against him, and it wasn't.\n  He has also done exceptionally good things in the area of civil \nrights, and that was made a part of the record as well. Judge Pickering \nwas judged on the basis of his service on the Federal district court \nbench. Good people can reach different conclusions about whether or not \nhis service merited a promotion to the appellate court. A majority of \nthe Judiciary Committee today adjudged that it did not.\n  I am not going to take any more time, other than to say it is an \nunfortunate outcome for a close friend of the minority leader, but I \nthink the committee treated him with courtesy, treated his nomination \nwith dispatch, and gave him every opportunity to present his point of \nview. He was given better treatment by this committee than many of the \nnominees submitted by the Clinton White House. I think that shows we \nare going to start a new day when it comes to the Judiciary Committee. \nWe want to work with the White House so that people who have excellent \nlegal and academic credentials, of the highest integrity and with \nmoderate political views, have a chance to serve.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if that is treating a person good, I would \nhate to see one who is treated badly, is all I can say. I am going to \ntalk a little about Judge Pickering before I am through.\n  I have been hearing comments about how badly the Clinton nominees \nwere treated. Lately, I have heard Democrats suggesting that their \ntreatment for Bush nominees is payback for how I treated Clinton \nnominees when I was chairman.\n  I want to take a moment to defend my record on Clinton nominees. I \nfirst want to state that President Clinton got 377 Federal judges \nconfirmed during the time I was either ranking member or chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee. That is a number which is only 5 short of the \nall-time record that Ronald Reagan had of 382. President Clinton would \nhave had 3 more than Reagan--385--had it not been for Democrat holds \nand objections on this floor. Keep in mind President Reagan had 6 years \nof a favorable Republican Senate. President Clinton had 6 years of the \nopposition party Senate, where I was chairman, and he still got that \nmany judges through.\n  By the way, to talk in terms of the 2 or 3 people I have been hearing \nabout all day who did not get hearings, think of the 54 who were left \nhanging when Bush I left office--54 Republicans. Terry Boyle, who has \nbeen renominated by President George W. Bush, has been sitting in \ncommittee since May 9. John Roberts, about whom I had a conversation \nwith one of the Justices--and he said John Roberts is one of the two \ngreatest appellate lawyers appearing before the Supreme Court today--\nhas been sitting there since May 9. Both were first nominated by \nPresident George H.W. Bush, and were 2 of the 54 nominees that the \nDemocrats left hanging at the end of his Administration.\n  I admit 6 nominees were put up so late that, literally, nobody could \nhave gotten them through. So say 48 were left hanging. Compare that to \nwhen President Clinton left office. By the way, when Bush I left \noffice, there were 97 vacancies, and 54 were left hanging--but we can \nreduce it to 48 because of the 6 who were probably nominated too late. \nWhen President Clinton left office, there were 67 vacancies--30 less \nthan when the Democrats held the committee, when George Bush the first \nwas President. There were 41 nominees left hanging when Clinton left \noffice. Of the 41, there were 9 put up so late that it was a wash; in \nother words, it was just to make it look good. They could not have \ngotten through no matter who tried.\n  In essence, there were 32 nominees left hanging at the end of the \nClinton Administration versus 48 who were left hanging at the end of \nthe first Bush Administration. Of those 48 left hanging, I can match \nthe Senator from Illinois and every other Democrat person for person, \nand much more, with decent, honorable, wonderful people who just didn't \nmake it through. But you haven't heard us come to the floor every day, \nor in the Judiciary Committee every day, talking about how badly they \nwere treated, even though they were treated badly. People like John \nRoberts, one of the greatest appellate lawyers in the history of the \ncountry.\n  Think of that--382 for Reagan, the all-time champion, with the \nopposition party in the minority for 6 of those years, and 377 for \nClinton, with the opposition party in the majority for 6 of those \nyears. Comparing the number confirmed to the number nominated, \nPresident Clinton enjoyed an 85 percent confirmation rate on the \nindividuals he nominated.\n  There were only 68 article III Judicial nominees who were nominated \nby President Clinton, in all of his 8 years, who did not get confirmed. \nOf those, 3 were left at the end of the 103rd Congress, when the \nDemocrats controlled the Senate. That leaves 65. Of those, 12 were \nwithdrawn by the President, leaving 53. Nine were nominated too late \nfor the Congress and committee to act on them or they were lacking \npaperwork. That leaves 44. Now, 17 of those lacked home State support, \nwhich was often the result of a lack of consultation with home State \nSenators. There was no way to confirm them without ignoring the \nsenatorial courtesy that we afford to home State Senators in the \nnomination process. That left 27. One nominee was defeated on the \nfloor, which leaves only 26 remaining nominees.\n  Of these, some had other reasons for not moving that I simply cannot \ncomment on because of the security of the committee. So in all 6 years \nI chaired the committee, while President Clinton was in office, we are \nreally only talking about 26 nominees who were left hanging.\n  During the first Bush administration, when the Democrats controlled \nthe committee, 59 nominees were not confirmed. I don't know the reasons \nfor all of those. There probably were some. But if you look at those 59 \nnominees and subtract the 1 who was withdrawn, that leaves 58 Bush I \nnominees who weren't confirmed over the course of 4 years. If you take \nthe 65 Clinton nominees who were not confirmed over my 6 years, and \ntake away the 12 who were withdrawn, that leaves 53.\n  So at the end of the day, even subtracting only the withdrawn \nnominees, there were only 53 Clinton nominees the Senate didn't act on \nin the 6 years I was chairman, while the Democrats allowed 58 \nnominations to perish in the committee in only 4 year's time. Do not \ntell me they were abused. That is part of the process. Some of these \npeople we do not have time to get through. There are reasons why they \ncannot get\n\n[[Page S1920]]\n\nthrough--for a number of them, for instance, there is not support of \nhome State Senators.\n\n  Of those 41 nominees left at the end of the 106th Congress, 1 was \neventually confirmed in the 107th Congress. Twelve lacked home State \nsupport or had incomplete paperwork. That leaves only 20 nominees who \ndid not go forward at the end of the Clinton administration.\n  There were 41 Clinton nominees left in committee at the end of the \n106th Congress when Clinton left office. When Bush left office, there \nwere 54 nominees left in committee, as I said. So the argument that \nthis all began because the Republicans were unfair to Clinton nominees \nis simply untrue. We were not. I was more fair to Clinton in confirming \nnominees than the Democrats were to President George H.W. Bush.\n  I also heard the allegation that Republican inaction during the \nClinton Presidency is to blame for the current vacancy crisis. This is \nuntrue. There were only 67 vacancies at the end of the 106th Congress. \nToday there are nearly 30 more vacancies; 96 after almost a year. Madam \nPresident, 11.2 percent of the Federal judiciary is vacant. At the end \nof my tenure as chairman during the Clinton Presidency, that rate was \nonly 7.9 percent.\n  We are in the middle of a circuit court vacancy crisis, and the \nSenate is doing virtually nothing whatsoever to address it.\n  There were 31 vacancies in the Federal courts of appeals when \nPresident Bush sent us his first 11 circuit nominees on May 9 last \nyear, and there are 31--the exact same number--today. We are making no \nreal progress.\n  Eight of President Bush's first 11 nominees have not even been \nscheduled for hearings, including John Roberts and Terry Boyle (both of \nwhom were on the nomination schedule of the first President Bush but \nwho did not get a hearing back then). This time around, they have been \npending for 309 days as of today. All of these nominees received \nqualified or well-qualified ratings from the American Bar Association.\n  A total of 22 circuit court nominations are now pending for those 31 \nvacancies, but we have confirmed only 1 circuit judge this year and \nonly 7 since President Bush took office.\n  The Sixth Circuit is half-staffed, with 8 of its 16 seats vacant. \nThat is a crisis. They cannot function appropriately. This crisis \nexists despite the fact we have seven Sixth Circuit nominees pending \nmotionless before the Judiciary Committee right now.\n  Although the Michigan Senators are blocking 3 of those nominees by \nnot returning blue slips, the other 4 are completely ready to go. All \nhave complete paperwork, good ratings by the ABA, and most importantly, \nthe support of both home State Senators.\n  The DC Circuit is two-thirds staffed with 4 of its 12 seats sitting \nvacant. This is despite the fact that President Bush nominated Miquel \nEstrada and John Roberts, who have not yet been given a hearing and \nwhose nominations have not seen the light of day since they were \nnominated better than 300 days ago. There is simply no explanation for \nthis situation other than stall tactics.\n  The Senate Democrats are trying to create an illusion of movement by \ncreating great media attention concerning a small handful of nominees \nin order to make it look like progress.\n  Some try to blame the Republicans for the circuit court vacancy \ncrisis. That is complete bunk. Look at the record.\n  Some have suggested that 45 percent of President Clinton's circuit \ncourt nominees were not confirmed during his Presidency. That number is \na bit of Enron-ization. It is inflated by double counting individuals \nwho were nominated more than once.\n  For example, by their numbers, Marsha Berzon, who was nominated in \nthe 105th Congress and confirmed in the 106th Congress, would count as \n2 nominations and only 1 confirmation. If you remove the double \ncounting and count by individuals, without counting withdrawn nominees, \nPresident Clinton nominated 86 individuals for the circuit courts and \nonly 21 were not confirmed. That is 24 percent as opposed to 45 \npercent.\n  Of those 21 nominees who were not confirmed, 9 lacked home State \nsupport, one had incomplete paperwork, and another was nominated after \nthe August recess in 2000. That leaves 10 circuit court nominees who \ndid not receive action, some of which had issues I cannot discuss \npublicly.\n  As I said, there are currently 31 circuit court vacancies. During \nPresident Clinton's first term, when Republicans controlled the \nJudiciary Committee, circuit court vacancies never exceeded 21 at the \nend of any year.\n  There were only 2 circuit court nominees left pending in committee at \nthe end of President Clinton's first year in office. In contrast, 23 of \nPresident Bush's circuit court nominees were pending in committee at \nthe end of last year.\n  At the end of President Clinton's second year in office, the Senate \nhad confirmed 19 circuit judges, and there were only 15 circuit court \nvacancies.\n  In contrast, today, in President Bush's second year, the Senate has \nconfirmed only one circuit court nominee, and there are 22 pending, and \n17 of those are considered emergency positions.\n  At the end of 1995, my first year as chairman, there were only 13 \ncircuit court vacancies left at the end of the year. At the end of \n1996, the end of President Clinton's first term and in a Presidential \nelection year, there were 21 vacancies, only 1 higher than the number \nthe Democrats left at the end of 1993 when they controlled the Senate \nand Clinton was President.\n  Taking numbers by the end of each Congress, a Republican-controlled \nSenate has never--never--left as many circuit court vacancies as \ncurrently exist today. At the end of the 104th Congress, the number was \n18. At the end of the 105th Congress, that number was 14, and even at \nthe end of the 106th Congress, a Presidential election year, that \nnumber was only 25. Today there are 31 vacancies in the circuit courts.\n  Despite all the talk, and lack of action, the unmistakable fact is \nthat there is a circuit court vacancy crisis of 31 vacancies, which is \nfar higher than the Republicans ever let reach, and the current Senate \nleadership is doing nothing about it. Actually, I should correct \nmyself. They are doing something about it. They are making it grow even \nlarger. They have acted with a deliberate lack of speed, and that is \nsomething the American people do not deserve.\n  Having said this to set the record straight, there are always a few \nnominations that have a difficult time whether the Republicans or \nDemocrats are in control. I have to admit, I wish I could have gotten a \nfew more through when I was the committee chairman, but everybody who \nknows, who really watched the process, knew that I pushed people \nthrough, against the wishes of a significant number of outside people. \nI told a number of the conservative groups to get lost because they \nwere basically distorting the judicial process.\n  Having said all that, let me talk about Charles Pickering because I \nam disappointed in what happened today. The real problem that many of \nthe interest groups have with Charles Pickering is he does not think as \nthey do. These groups want to impose an ideological litmus test on \njudicial nominees. They will mount a campaign against any nominee who \ndoes not agree with their position on abortion, civil rights, and a \nhost of other issues, and they will try to label anyone who disagrees \nwith them as an extremist who is out of the mainstream. But the key \nhere is that a nominees's personal or political opinion on such issues \nis irrelevant when it comes to the confirmation process.\n  The real question is whether the nominee can follow the law, and \nJudge Pickering has certainly proved that he can. Judge Pickering has \ndemonstrated an ability to follow the law. This is reflected in his low \nreversal rate of a half percent during his decade-plus tenure as a \ndistrict court judge.\n  Although I have heard some of my colleagues complain about his 26 \nreversals, let's put this in context. Judge Pickering in his nearly 12 \nyears on the Federal bench handled 4,000 to 4,500 cases.\n  In all of those cases, he has been reversed only 26 times. This is a \nrecord to be proud of, not a reason to vote against him.\n  I suspect many of my colleagues' misperceptions about Judge\n\n[[Page S1921]]\n\nPickering's record as a district judge stem from the gross distortion \nof that record by the liberal special interest groups. For example, one \noften-cited area of concern is Judge Pickering's record on Voting \nRights Act cases, but the bottom line is that Judge Pickering has \ndecided a total of three of those cases on the merits: Fairley, Bryant, \nand Morgan. None of these cases was appealed, a step that one can \nreasonably expect a party to take if it is dissatisfied with the \ncourt's ruling.\n  Moreover, the plaintiffs in the Fairley case, including Ken Fairley, \nformer head of the Forrest County NAACP, have written letters in \nsupport of Judge Pickering's nomination. Judge Pickering's \nqualifications are also reflected in his ABA rating, which some members \nof the committee have referred to as the ``gold standard'' in \nevaluating judicial nominees. The ABA, of course, rated Judge Pickering \nwell qualified for the Fifth Circuit.\n  I also find it ironic that many of the complaints Judge Pickering's \nopponents have lodged against him pertain to events that occurred \nbefore he became a Federal district court judge, a position for which \nhe was unanimously confirmed by both this committee and the full \nSenate.\n  The way liberal special interest groups are working and have worked \nto change the ground rules on judicial confirmations is evident in the \nnomination of Charles Pickering for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. \nThis is a gentleman who had overwhelming support in his home State of \nMississippi from Democrats and Republicans alike, from the Democrat \nattorney general of the State, and from prominent members of the \nAfrican-American community.\n  Those who know Judge Pickering well know he has worked to improve \nrace relations in Mississippi. For example, he testified against the \nImperial Wizard of the KKK for firebombing a civil rights activist in \nMississippi in 1967, at great risk to both himself and his family. He \nhired the first African-American Republican political worker in \nMississippi in 1976; represented a black man falsely accused of robbing \na 16-year-old white girl in 1981 and won the case for him; chaired a \nrace relations committee for Jones County, Mississippi, in 1988; served \non the board of the Institute of Racial Reconciliation at the \nUniversity of Mississippi since 1999; and worked with at-risk African-\nAmerican youth in Laurel, Mississippi, in 2000.\n  I have to say I was pleased that my colleagues on the other side said \nthey do not believe he is a racist and they do not believe that such a \ncase can be made, and they were disappointed that some tried to make \nit.\n  I say, in addition, Judge Pickering has compiled an impressive record \nas a Federal district court judge. During his more than 11 years on the \nbench, he has disposed of an estimated 4,000 to 4,500 cases, but he has \nbeen reversed only 26 times. This means his reversal rate is roughly \none-half of 1 percentage point and is lower than the average reversal \nrate for Federal district court judges in this country.\n  Despite this impressive career, Judge Pickering had become the target \nof a smear campaign instigated and perpetrated by liberal Washington \ninterest groups and lobbyists with their own political agenda, some of \nwhom called him, in essence, a racist. These groups painted a \ncaricature of a man that bears little resemblance to reality, all in \nthe name of attempting to change the ground rules for the judicial \nconfirmation process and impose their political litmus test for all of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees.\n\n  We are now seeing the same thing starting with another circuit court \nof appeals nominee, D. Brooks Smith, with the same type of approaches \nthey have used against Judge Pickering.\n  We had a number of Senators say they voted against Judge Pickering \nbecause of his 26 reversals, some of which they considered questionable \nin the areas of voting rights, in the area of civil rights, in the area \nof prisoners' rights, and in the area of employment rights. We blew \nthose arguments away today because we cited nearly every case about \nwhich they are complaining. They claim Judge Pickering did not follow \nsettled law, and we showed that there was not settled law in many of \nthose cases.\n  We did not hear those cases really argued today from the principal \npeople who argued them before. They could not. So what did we hear an \nargument on? The Swan case. Now what was the Swan case? The Swan case \nthe case of a cross burning on the lawn of an African-American family.\n  I might mention that is a vicious, rotten, lousy thing for anybody to \ndo.\n  Of the three boys who did it, one of them was a vicious racist who \nhad shot into the house with a gun. Because two of them cooperated, the \nJustice Department prosecutors gave them basically a giveaway, easy \nsentence. The third was absolutely drunk at the time. He had not shot \ninto the home, he had not issued any racist comments, but he was with \nthem. He did not think he did anything wrong. He contested the case, \nlost, and under the mandatory minimum he had to be sentenced to 7 \nyears.\n  The judge did not think that was right, that the other two really \nwere as or more culpable, and when he looked and found out that this \nyoung man had never made a racist comment and he was drunk at the time, \nhe thought it was a tremendous injustice. So what he did was he \ncomplained to one of his friends, Frank Hunger, who was with the \nJustice Department at the time, but not at the Civil Rights Division at \nthe Civil Division. Swan still got a sentence of 27 months, a fairly \nlong time when his two co-defendants got only home confinement and \nprobation.\n  Because he talked to Frank Hunger, who was with the Civil Division, \nnot the Civil Rights Division, we had efforts to paint that as a \ntremendous violation of ethics. Hardly. Hunger does not even remember \nthe conversation and is one of the strongest supporters of Judge \nPickering, a Democrat from the Clinton Administration Justice \nDepartment. He is very disappointed with what happened to Judge \nPickering's nomination.\n  There are other things I would like to say, but I know my colleague \nwould like to speak. I will close with this: I am sorely disappointed \nwith the vote on Judge Pickering's nomination. I am sorely disappointed \nwith the way these outside groups tried to paint Mississippi as the old \nSouth, prejudiced, rotten, acting in ways that fly in the face of civil \nrights, when there have been so many strides made, part of them made \nbecause of the efforts of Judge Charles Pickering.\n  I do not understand this type of thing. In each case in which a \nnominee was stopped in Committee, I have wondered why they were \nstopped.\n  I do not live in Mississippi, but I feel for the people of \nMississippi because this action today, it seems to me, is a \ncondemnation of a State that does not deserve it, and a condemnation of \na Federal judge who went through the Senate the first time unanimously, \nwho has served well for nearly 12 solid years, and who now has a \nreputation besmirched because of what I consider to be phony \nallegations which should never have been accepted.\n  I am disappointed. But unfortunately, that is the way it is around \nhere. I hope we do not have to put up with much more of this in the \nfuture.\n  I notice my colleagues want to speak, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, one of our colleagues earlier, in \ntalking about the Pickering nomination, talked about the difficulty of \nmaking judgments. Of course, that is what they\n\n[[Page S1922]]\n\npay us to do. It is sometimes difficult. But what is really important \nfor us to be sure of is that the judgment we make is our own, \nindependent judgment, made with integrity, and not influenced by unfair \ncharges or pressure from groups outside the Senate.\n  I think a nominee is entitled to that. If charges are made against a \nnominee, we ought to hear about them. We ought to find out if they are \ncorrect. Maybe delay the vote and have another hearing, if that is what \nis required, so be it. But when the nominee can show that the charges \nagainst him in case after case after case after case are not justified \ncharges, and there are perfectly good and sound reasons for the actions \nhe has taken, that his words are being taken out of context, outside \nthe normal bounds of any kind of fair criticism, when he can explain \nthat in matter after matter after matter that the charges are untrue, I \nbelieve the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee ought to listen \nto that. Senators should not allow friends from the outside, who have \nan agenda and a commitment to defeating a nominee who they have picked \nas the person they want to go after, to control the situation and, in \neffect, cast a vote in these matters. That is what I am concerned \nabout.\n  Judge Pickering came before our committee. He was a superb witness. \nHe testified with integrity, with skill, with understanding. He is a \nman I believe the committee related to well. I was very impressed with \nhis testimony, his whole history as a lawyer and as a judge and as a \nhuman being. I thought, what a wonderful presentation he made. But it \nseemed not to have changed a single vote.\n  When point A was knocked down, we would go to point B, and when that \nwas knocked down, to point C. Finally, we ended up with the most weak \nexcuses, weak reasons that I do not believe rise to the level, in any \nway, that would justify rejecting this fine man.\n  He finished No. 1 in his law class at the University of Mississippi \nSchool of Law, an excellent school of law. He decided to go back home \nwhere his family were farmers, in the dairy business, in Laurel, MS.\n  Some suggested he did a lot of things in the past, in the 1960s, of \nwhich he wasn't proud. They said over and over again, with great \nunctuousness: We don't think he's a racist. We are not saying he's a \nracist. But he is a southerner, you know, from Laurel. We have some \ncomplaints up here in Washington about him.\n  What did his record look like? In the 1960s, things were not easy in \nLaurel, MS. Having grown up in the rural South, I know that. I know a \nlot of people made choices they are very greatly disappointed that they \nmade, many years ago. A lot of us should have been more alert to \nfighting more aggressively for civil rights than we were. I was in high \nschool in those years and I remember the debates that came about. I \nknow how deeply the passions and feelings were running.\n  In Laurel, there was a trial of a Klansman who was involved in a \nmurder. Judge Pickering, in the 1960s, signed a warrant for his arrest \nin that murder.\n  Another case involved a head of the Ku Klux Klan in that area. It was \na tense case in a tough time. Something needed to be done to send a \nsignal to that jury that good men and women, in Laurel, MS, knew that \nhe ought to be convicted of the crimes he committed.\n\n  Judge Pickering volunteered and testified as a character witness \nagainst that defendant, saying that he had a bad reputation for \nviolence in the community. Nobody, I am sure, relished having to do \nthat task at that time. Sure enough, the next election, he lost that \nelection. And the Klan bragged that was the reason, that they got the \nman who went against them.\n  That is his background. He has a superb legal mind. He finished at \nthe top of his class at the University of Mississippi. A man, faced \nwith difficult times, was on the right side of the issue.\n  We had Charles Evers, the brother of Medgar Evers, the slain civil \nrights worker in Mississippi visit members of the Judiciary Committee. \nHe came up here on Judge Pickering's behalf and spoke strongly and \npassionately for him. As did an African-American judge. As did others \nwho came. By the way, I think 26 out of 26 living Presidents of the \nMississippi Bar Association endorsed Judge Pickering. But this group \ncame here. I asked them, each one of them: During the 1960s and into \nthe 1970s, when civil rights was really a matter of some courage in the \nSouth, was Judge Pickering on the good guys' side or the bad guys' \nside? They all said he was on the right side. He was on the good guys' \nside. He took actions to reach out and to build harmony and he believed \nthat is important.\n  He, in fact, serves now as co-chairman--or did until recently--with \nformer Governor Winter, a Democrat of Mississippi, on the Ole Miss \nCommission to Promote Racial Harmony. He was chosen to be co-chairman \nof that commission.\n  Oh, but they say we didn't accuse him of being a racist. He is \nhostile to employment cases. So Senators Hatch and DeWine went through \nall the employment cases that he dealt with, delineated the two, I \nbelieve, that were reversed on matters unrelated to the merits, really, \nof employment cases. I also point out in the state of Mississippi, \nthere are a group of lawyers who specialize in employment cases \nrepresenting plaintiffs who sue to get their jobs back or for damages \nfor mistreatment. The top plaintiffs' lawyer in Mississippi, who \npracticed before Judge Pickering many times, wrote an op-ed in the \nMississippi paper. Not just a letter, he wrote an op-ed in the paper \nwith his name on it, saying Judge Pickering should be confirmed; the \nplaintiffs' lawyer said that Judge Pickering is a fair man and that \nJudge Pickering treated employment cases fairly in court.\n  Why would we want to even continue to talk about that issue after \nthat matter is raised? But still people do.\n  There were other complaints. They said he had asked lawyers to write \nletters on his behalf and that this somehow violated ethics. We had a \nprofessor who said this was ambiguous at best, and cited histories \ngoing back to Learned Hand, where judges got letters written on behalf \nof nominees. So I don't think that was the matter.\n  They said he had them given to him. The Department of Justice asked \nhim to collect the letters and have them sent up. The U.S. Department \nof Justice asked him to collect those letters and send them forward. It \nwas during the time of the anthrax scare, when the mail was shut down. \nThey wanted him to be sure to collect them all so they could be sent \nstraight to the Department of Justice so they could be disseminated to \nthose of us in the Senate who needed to know about it.\n  I am, frankly, concerned for about the suggestion that there is an \nunfairness, or an excessive conservative bent on the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. The Fifth Circuit is one of the great circuits in \nAmerica. It has consistently had some of the great judges in America. I \njust had the honor to participate in the swearing in of Ginny Granade, \nthe granddaughter of Judge Richard Reeves on the old Fifth Circuit to a \nFederal judgeship in my hometown of Mobile. She worked for me for 12 \nyears when I was U.S. attorney there. She is one of the finest people I \nknow. She has never been political in any way. She was confirmed and is \nnow serving there. But the old Fifth Circuit and the Fifth Circuit \ntoday is a great circuit. It has a good record of being affirmed by the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  We have had some concerns about the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, I \nwill admit. I have raised that issue on occasion. One year the Ninth \nCircuit had 27 out of 28 cases that went to the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States reversed. Year after year--one year it was 13 out of \n15. The Ninth Circuit has the highest record of reversals of any \ncircuit in America by far. The Fifth Circuit is nowhere close.\n\n  I opposed, I will admit, two nominees to the Ninth Circuit. But they \nwere confirmed.\n  I would have to add, however, that my concerns have been a bit \nvalidated in that Judges Paez and Berzon, the two I did vote against, \nthose two judges on separate occasions have eviscerated and declared \nunconstitutional the ``three strikes and you are out'' law in the State \nof California which the State supreme court, which is not a \nconservative court had previously upheld.\n  I will just note that was discretion. Perhaps there was a legal basis \nfor those reversals of the important California habitual offender law. \nMaybe the\n\n[[Page S1923]]\n\nlaw needs to be changed by the legislature. But judges ought to be \nreluctant to be whacking out long-established State law of this kind. I \nam interested in studying those cases.\n  At any rate, I believe we had a good process in the last 8 years of \nPresident Clinton. In 8 years, 1 judge was voted down--1 judge was \nvoted down in 8 years--and 377 judges were confirmed.\n  When President Clinton left office, there were only 41 judges \nnominated and pending unconfirmed.\n  When former President Bush left office, on the other hand, in 1992, \nthere were 54 judges nominated and unconfirmed.\n  It is clear that at least 13 fewer judges were pending when Senator \nHatch chaired the committee and the Republicans left office than when \nthe Democrats controlled the Senate and President Bush left office--a \nvery similar circumstance. I think it is impossible to say that \nPresident Clinton's judges were abused.\n  With regard to the historic right of Senators to refuse to submit the \nblue slip, giving home State Senators, in effect, an ability to block \nnominees in their home States, that did slow down some of the nominees \nand keep them from being confirmed. Whether those Senators were right \nor not, I don't know. But it is a power we have always held.\n  Let me say this: Do the Democrats in the Senate say this is an abuse \nof power and ought to be reduced, and it is something that ought not be \nallowed to go forward? No, they do not. They are now pushing to expand \nthe power of the home State Senators beyond what we have had in the \npast to block nominees.\n  I am very sad for the Pickering family, and the young Chip Pickering, \nthe Congressman from Mississippi. He is one of the very finest Members \nof the House of Representatives. He loves his father. It was painful \nfor me to see him have to sit through all of that today. But he is a \nstrong young man. His father has a great record. He has served well. I \nam sure he too will bounce back from this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton).

Mr. President, I heard the distinguished minority leader \nspeak a couple of hours ago on behalf of the resolution which he \nsubmitted to the Senate for its consideration, and hopefully a vote \nperhaps Tuesday of next week, in which he called for moving forward in \na way that was less politicized with respect to judicial nominations. \nHe had just witnessed the defeat in the Senate Judiciary Committee of \nhis candidate for the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals from his State of \nMississippi. The President had nominated this fine man, Judge Thomas \nPickering. The judge currently sits on the Federal district court. \nPresident Bush nominated him to serve on the Fifth Circuit.\n  The minority leader had witnessed his defeat in the committee just a \nfew moments before and expressed himself, I thought, quite eloquently, \nwithout anger but with a great deal of sadness. I share that sadness \ntonight because I think a very fine man has been ill treated.\n  Some of my colleagues have said the process was fair. And I don't \nargue that the process was unfair. But what I argue was unfair was the \ncharacterization of the man. It was done so that there would be a \nreason to vote against him.\n  As I will point out in a moment, I think the real reason there were \nobjections to Judge Pickering was that he was a conservative from \nMississippi nominated by President Bush. There were too many groups on \nthe outside. Yes, I do think they had some influence with Members of \nthe Senate and characterized him as an extremist, as out of the \nmainstream, and therefore it became difficult for some Senators to vote \nfor him.\n  I wish to make it clear that this was not a vote by the Senate. For \nthose who might be watching, what happened today was the Senate \nJudiciary Committee voted along party lines to defeat his nomination. \nThe majority would not agree to send him to the Senate, as has been \ndone in a few cases, without a recommendation, or even with a negative \nrecommendation. The reason is that had he come to the full Senate for \nconsideration, because of the expressions of support by some members of \nthe majority party, it is clear he would have been confirmed. They were \nunwilling to let the full Senate vote on him so that he could be \nconfirmed.\n  There is a question about the advice and consent clause of the \nConstitution which speaks to the advice and consent of the Senate being \nexercised by just 10 members of the Judiciary Committee. I think that \nperhaps is the right of the majority on the Judiciary Committee. But I \nam not necessarily certain--at least certain in some cases--that it is \nthe right thing to do. It was not a full Senate vote that defeated \nJudge Pickering; it was just the committee.\n  The unfair characterization of Judge Pickering was designed to find \nsome reason or some rationale for voting against him.\n  Why do I say that?\n  There were a lot of different charges: One, that he was a racist. No \nSenator was ever willing to stand up to make that charge. There were \ncases cited. But nobody was ever willing to make that charge.\n\n  There was a suggestion that he had collected some letters to support \nhim and that it was unethical. There is no ethics provision that says \nthat one way or the other. As a matter of fact, none of us can stand up \nand say, yes, or, no, it wasn't. But I think had a decision been made \non that basis alone, it would have been extraordinarily unfair.\n  The American Bar Association, which rated Judge Pickering well \nqualified, considered all of these matters, obviously. Certainly, the \nAmerican Bar Association's imprimatur of qualification has been one of \nthe standards most of the members on the majority side have held up as \njustifying a vote for or against a nominee. When the ABA says this \ncandidate is qualified, it is a little hard for me to justify an \nassertion that somehow he was unethical because he collected letters of \nsupport on his behalf and presented them to the full Senate.\n  There was an argument made that he had done a lot of reversals. I \nheard that for several weeks. This morning before the committee, \nSenator Hatch debunked that totally. The reversal rate is good by any \nstandard. If you take the total number of cases, it is far below the \naverage judge. If you take the number of appeals, it is below the \naverage judge.\n  If you are going to say how his record stands up against all other \njudges, he is much better than the average Federal judge.\n  The reversal rate--25 out of some 5,000 cases--is hardly a reason to \nvote against him. That was debunked.\n  This morning, I heard that the reason one Senator was voting against \nhim was that the nomination was so controversial that it was \npolarizing.\n  I must say, it is a little like saying, don't you stick your chin out \nat me or I will hit you, and you will have started a fight. It is hard \nfor me to figure this one out because some outside groups object to a \ncandidate, create a fuss and a stir about the candidate, and the \ncandidate, therefore, becomes controversial. We are supposed to vote \nagainst him? There have been a lot of controversial people in history.\n  I cited this morning people such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Sir \nThomas More, and Justice Hugo Black. History is replete with great \npeople who were indeed controversial. In fact, it took courage to stand \nup for them at the time that they were controversial. But they were \nright. And the people who stood with them at the time have been \nvalidated in their view of what was right, and in their courage.\n  It seems to me as constitutional officers we have an obligation to \nfollow our constitutional duty and make our decision based on whether a \nperson is qualified or not, not based upon whether that person is \ncontroversial.\n  There is also a very significant undercurrent of retribution. Hardly \nany conversation about Judge Pickering could occur without members of \nthe majority party saying: And let us remind you of all of the judges \nwho were\n\n[[Page S1924]]\n\ntreated unfairly when Republicans were in power in the Senate and \nPresident Clinton was the President.\n  Only one judge was defeated on the floor of the Senate, and I do not \nthink any were defeated in the committee, as Judge Pickering was today. \nBut there were some judges who did not get a hearing. Maybe there were \ntoo many. But I think that it is quite unfair to try to dream up \nreasons to vote against somebody if the real reason is that you do not \nlike what happened to some of President Clinton's nominees. That is not \nright.\n  We talk about the cycle of violence in the Middle East and say we \nhave to stop it. Yet some people apparently are willing to maintain a \ndifferent kind of cycle of retribution in the Senate.\n  I think what it boils down to is a matter of philosophy. I think, if \npeople are honest with themselves, a lot of this boils down to the fact \nthat some members of the majority are uncomfortable supporting a \nconservative nominated by President Bush. And some on the committee \nhave been courageous enough to, in fact, say that.\n  One of the Senators from the majority this morning said: Look, I \nthink that he's out of the mainstream. I think that President Bush is \nnominating waves of conservative ideologues, and that offends my sense \nof what is proper, and, therefore, I am going to vote against that kind \nof nominee.\n  That is an honest statement, at least, even though I think it is very \nwrong. But I think that really is the reason why a lot of people \ndecided not to support this nominee. And the question is, A, are they \nright? And, B, is that right?\n  Well, are they right? I do not doubt that Judge Pickering may be \ncharacterized as a conservative, but he has been on the Federal bench \nfor a long time, and I have not seen anybody say that his decisions \nreflected some kind of conservative bias. Moreover, one man's \nconservative is another man's mainstreamer, or however you want to \ncharacterize it.\n  I think we get on a slippery slope when a Senator from New York says, \nfor example: Why, those candidates are outside the mainstream. They are \nconservative ideologues. I say: Gosh, they look pretty good to me. Of \ncourse, I am a conservative from Arizona. So it is all in the eye of \nthe beholder. The question is, Who got elected as President of the \nUnited States?\n  I remember when Al Gore said in one of the debates with George Bush: \nYou don't want to elect George Bush because, if he gets elected, he \nwill nominate conservatives to the bench. Everybody in the country \nknows that whoever is elected President is going to nominate people \nthey like to the bench.\n  President Clinton nominated a lot of people I thought were pretty \nliberal. I did not vote for all of them, but I voted for a lot of them \nbecause they were qualified, I had to admit. But I thought they were \nliberal. They were liberal. And I did not like that. And they have \nadded to liberal courts. But, again, he was elected President, not me. \nI am a conservative from Arizona.\n  You can characterize President Clinton however you want \nto characterize him. He had the right to nominate candidates of his \nchoice because he got elected by the whole country. And so did George \nBush.\n\n  I daresay that George Bush probably is a better representative of the \nmainstream of America than a lot of individual Senators in this body \nwho are answerable to specific constituencies in Arizona or New York or \nNew Jersey or Minnesota or whatever State it might be. Therefore, I \nthink it is wrong for any of us to have a litmus test of politics \ndetermining our vote for judges on the courts. I think if they are \nqualified, if the ABA says they are qualified, if we acknowledge they \nare qualified, then we should not be voting against them just because \nof their judicial philosophy.\n  That brings me to the conclusion here.\n  When I saw the distinguished minority leader express himself tonight, \nafter his fellow Mississippian had been defeated in the Senate \ncommittee, and he offered his sense of the Senate, I admired Senator \nLott because what he was saying, in effect, was: I am not going to \nforget this personally. But it is time to move on and stop this \nbusiness of retribution, this business of saying Clinton judges were \ntreated unfairly, so, therefore, we are justified in doing the same to \nPresident Bush's nominations.\n  What Trent Lott was saying was let's move on. Let's stop this \nnonsense. And the way we can do it is to begin to deal with the backlog \nof circuit court nominees that we face today. And he pointed out the \nstatistics. Only one of the nine nominees of just about a year ago--on \nMay 9--have even had a hearing. There is no excuse for that. There is \nabsolutely no reason that all nine of these candidates could not have \nhad a hearing.\n  Judge Pickering is only one. The other eight have not had hearings. \nMiguel Estrada, for example: No hearing. He is right here. There is no \nproblem. He can have a hearing. But it is going to be a year before he \ncan even conceivably have a hearing now. There is clearly something \nwrong when that is the situation.\n  So what Senator Lott said was let's have a sense of the Senate and \nagree as a Senate that at least those eight nominees of May 9, 2001, \nshould have a hearing by May 9, 2002; that is not too much to ask; and \nit isn't. So I hope all of my colleagues will join us in supporting it.\n  Now, that does not guarantee it, but it expresses the sense of the \nSenate that we ought to do it. I think that is a good way for us to \nbegin to put some of this acrimony behind us.\n  I remain disappointed about Judge Pickering. I am resigned to the \nfact that he is not going to be, at least for now, confirmed to the \ncircuit court. But I do think we can learn from this exercise, adopt \nSenator Lott's resolution, agree to hold hearings on these judges, and \nthen, of course, follow through with action by the committee and then \naction by the full Senate.\n  The statistics are such that in order for this Senate to confirm the \nsame number of judges that were confirmed for President Reagan, the \nfirst President Bush, and President Clinton, in their first 2 years of \noffice--the measure for the end of this current year--we would have to \nhold a hearing every single week--we, the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nof which I am a member--that we are in session until the end of this \nyear, with five district court judges and one circuit court judge per \nhearing.\n  We would have to do that every single week. And the committee would \nhave to vote on five district court nominees and one circuit court \nnominee. The full Senate would have to vote on five district court \nnominees and one circuit court nominee every single week. That is just \nfor us to confirm the same number of judges for President Bush, the \nsecond, as we confirmed for his father and for President Clinton and \nfor President Reagan.\n  Obviously, we have dug ourselves a big hole. We have to start to get \nout of this hole. An old rancher friend of mine once said: If you're in \na hole and want to get out, the first thing you want to do is stop \ndigging.\n  We have to stop the delay and the recrimination and get on to \nconfirming qualified judges. The best way to do that is to commit to \nholding hearings and having the Judiciary Committee vote on those \nnominees. If they vote a nominee down, all right, but let's make sure \nit is on the qualifications and not some excuse. Then bring those \nnominees who are supported to the floor so the full Senate can act on \nthem as a body.\n  I support Senator Lott's resolution. I hope my colleagues will do so \nwhen we have a chance to vote on it, perhaps Tuesday, so we can move \nbeyond the kind of actions that I believe characterize Judge \nPickering's rejection today. I hope this is the last time we will have \nto have a conversation such as this.\n  I appreciate the Presiding Officer's patience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1924-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1924-S1925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      APPEAL IN THE LOCKERBIE CASE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today justice was shining as the Scottish \ncourt in the Netherlands upheld the conviction of Libyan intelligence \nofficer Abdel Basset al-Megrahi for the terrorist bombing of Pan Am \nflight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland on December 21, 1988.\n  In this heinous crime, Libyan terrorists blew up Pan Am flight 103, \nruthlessly murdering 270 innocent people, including 189 Americans. \nUntil the September 11 terrorist attack, the Pan Am\n\n[[Page S1925]]\n\ncase was the most fatal terrorist atrocity in American history.\n  Since 1989, our Nation has joined the victims' families to bring the \nterrorists to justice and to compel the Libyan Government to \nacknowledge its responsibility for this terrible act. Today, after more \nthan 13 years, a measure of justice has finally been achieved.\n  This verdict by the Scottish court is a victory for the families of \nthe victims who have been tireless advocates for justice. Thirteen \nfamilies from Massachusetts lost loved ones in the Pan Am flight 103 \nattack. Over these 13 difficult years, we have worked with them and the \nother families to bring about today's verdict.\n  From the outset, the families of the victims have translated their \ngrief into action. They stood up to powerful interests of the oil \nindustry, and they have kept the prosecution of those responsible for \nthe death of their loved ones at the top of our Nation's agenda. This \ntrial and this verdict would not have happened without their impressive \nand ongoing efforts.\n  Discussions between the American, British, and Libyan Governments \nregarding compliance with outstanding U.N. Security Council resolutions \nare underway in London.\n  Now that the legal case has run its course, diplomatic efforts will \nintensify to ensure that the Government of Libya fully and \nsatisfactorily complies with Security Council resolutions before \nsanctions can be permanently lifted.\n  In Security Council Resolution 748, the United Nations required the \nLibyan Government to comply with requests addressed to Libyan \nauthorities by the governments of France, the United Kingdom, and the \nUnited States. One of those requests clearly states that the British \nand American governments expect the Government of Libya to ``accept \ncomplete responsibility for the actions of Libyan officials.''\n  This requirement must be fulfilled completely, totally, and \nunequivocally. The United States Government has consistently maintained \nthat the Libyan Government carried out this atrocity. Indeed, when two \nLibyan intelligence officials were indicted in 1991, State Department \nspokesman Richard Boucher said: ``This was a Libyan Government \noperation from start to finish. The bombing of Pan Am 103 was not a \nrogue operation.''\n  Although the explosion did not take place on American soil, America \nwas clearly the target of this attack. The Scottish court concluded \nthat Libya was responsible for the bombing, and the Libyan regime must \naccept that responsibility as well. As the London discussions proceed \nbetween our government, the British Government and the Libyan \nGovernment the U.S. must make it crystal clear that we will accept \nnothing short of an explicit acceptance of responsibility by Qadhafi's \ngovernment to satisfy this condition.\n  Security Council Resolution 748 also requires the Libyan Government \nto ``disclose all it knows of this crime, including the names of all \nthose responsible.'' The head of Libyan intelligence, Musa Kusa, has \nbeen participating in the trilateral discussions in London. At the time \nof the Pan Am bombing, Musa Kusa was the Deputy Chief of Intelligence, \nworking under colonel Qadhafi's brother-in-law, and he should be able \nto provide a significant amount of information to satisfy this \ncondition. I expect that the U.S. Government is asking Musa Kusa to \nprovide this information with the goal of fulfilling this requirement.\n  Another clear requirement of Security Council Resolution 748 calls on \nthe Libyan Government to ``pay appropriate compensation.'' Discussions \nare underway between private attorneys and the representatives of the \nLibyan Government to address this condition. I am aware that the State \nDepartment is not directly involved in these negotiations. However, our \ngovernment must ensure that any financial agreement is not considered a \nsubstitute for acceptance of responsibility accompanies the financial \nagreement.\n  Finally, the Security Council Resolution calls on the Government of \nLibya to ``commit itself definitively to cease all forms of terrorist \naction and all assistance to terrorist groups and promptly, by concrete \nactions, demonstrate its renunciation of terrorism.'' Libya has in the \npast supported, trained, and harbored some of the most notorious \nterrorist groups in the world. Our Government must be convinced, beyond \na doubt, that Libya has abandoned all support for terrorism before \nconcluding that this requirement has been satisfied.\n  The Congress has consistently stated its view that the Libyan \nGovernment must fulfill all Security Council resolutions related to the \nPan Am 103 bombing, most recently when it overwhelmingly approved a \nfive-year extension of sanctions in the Iran Libya Sanctions Act.\n  I know the administration is working diligently on this matter, and I \nlook forward to full and satisfactory compliance with Security Council \nresolutions. These brave families deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, this tragedy took place 13 years ago. It is \ninstructive for all of us to understand that the only way we are going \nto be able to deal with terrorists is by developing the kind of hard-\nedge determination, resolution, persistence in pursuing justice that \nthis case has followed over 13 years.\n  Too often, with the kinds of challenges we are facing, we find out \nthat there is a flurry of activity, and then we find other forces come \nto bear to try to override the underlying issues which are basically at \nstake. We have seen the powerful interests of the oil industry trying \nto push aside the sanctions which we have had in effect. We have seen \npowerful interests in Europe as well try to discount these sanctions.\n  It is only because the United States has been resolute, determined, \nand persistent over the period of 13 years, both in the area of \nsanctions as well as pursuing this in the international courts, that we \nhave the judgment as we have seen today. That judgment is extremely \nclear in pointing out responsibility to the world. The Scottish court \nis pointing the world to the cause of the terrorism which took 13 \nfamilies from my State, 67 members of the U.S. Armed Forces, and scores \nof other Americans. This is a victory for those families.\n  It is a very important step that has been taken. It is a \nreaffirmation in our system of justice, and it is a clear indication to \ncountries around the world that the United States is going to be \nconsistent and persistent to bring those who have created terror to \njustice, no matter how long it takes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1925-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1925-S1926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n APPLAUDING THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP IN THE LAWSUIT \n                      AGAINST THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, about 13 years ago I went to get on an \nairplane in Phoenix, AZ. I was a Member of Congress. I was late for my \nplane, as usual. I came running into the airport, went to the United \nticket counter, and said: Can I still make the plane? And the lady at \nthe counter said: Yes, I think you can. Hurry up. I said: Can you get \nme a seat in the nonsmoking section of the plane? It was too late. She \nsaid: The only seat I have left is a middle seat in the smoking section \nof the plane. So I said to her: Isn't there something you can do? She \nlooked down at my airline ticket and at my title and said: No, \nCongressman. But there is something you can do.\n  So I got on that airplane and sat in a middle seat in the smoking \nsection between two chain-smoking sumo wrestlers and thought to myself: \nThere has to be a better way.\n  When I got off that plane, I decided to offer an amendment to ban \nsmoking on airplanes across America, and was successful, to the \nsurprise of myself and everybody else. No one had ever beaten the \ntobacco lobby on the floor of the House of Representatives. We did it \nby five votes. It was very bipartisan. It came over to the Senate. \nSenator Lautenberg of New Jersey picked up the cause. He was successful \non this side. We put into law a ban on smoking on airplanes, which I \nthink was the domino that triggered smoking being banned all across \nAmerica, in restaurants, in office buildings, in hospitals, and not \nonly on planes, but on trains and buses. There has been a real \nrevolution in just 13 years.\n  But the battle against the tobacco companies goes on. I give credit \nto a lot of those who followed after that historic legislation, \nparticularly the State attorneys general who filed lawsuits against \ntobacco companies and successfully brought in billions of dollars to \nStates because of the fraud perpetrated on the public by the tobacco \nindustry.\n\n[[Page S1926]]\n\n  I was happy to support those State suits. But at the same time, \nPresident Clinton was President, and many of us said: Why isn't the \nadministration in Washington doing the same thing? Why don't we bring a \nlawsuit on behalf of taxpayers across America who have had to pay out \nbillions of dollars for medical care for tobacco-related disease and \ndeath? Why shouldn't they be compensated, as the States successfully \nprosecuted the tobacco companies for compensation at the State level?\n  To their credit, in the closing days of the Clinton administration, \nthey prepared a lawsuit and started it against the tobacco companies by \nthe Federal Government. And then, with the change in the \nadministration, there was a question as to whether or not this new \nadministration would still dedicate its resources and determination to \nsuccessfully prosecute the same lawsuit.\n  We were concerned because initially there was criticism that the \nDepartment of Justice was putting too much money into this lawsuit. \nAttorney General John Ashcroft, as a Senator in this Chamber, was \ncritical of this lawsuit against the tobacco companies. So many of us \nhad justifiable concerns about whether or not the Federal Government \nwould really vigorously pursue the lawsuit against the tobacco \nindustry.\n  I am happy to report to you today that what has been disclosed within \nthe last several weeks gives us great encouragement because we now have \nhad disclosed documents that have been prepared by our Government, by \nour Department of Justice, demanding, in this lawsuit, changes in \npolicy by the tobacco companies which could not be more encouraging.\n\n  Many of the things I am about to read to you have been proposed by \npeople such as myself concerning the tobacco industry for years, and it \nhas fallen on deaf ears in Congress. Congress is one of the worst \nplaces in the world to go and discuss the tobacco issue. The tobacco \nlobbyists are all over the Capitol. The tobacco interests fund \ncampaigns right and left, and they make it very difficult for anything \nto be done on Capitol Hill. That is why the courts have been more \nsuccessful.\n  But let me give you an idea of a number of the things this \nadministration is asking for as part of their lawsuit which would \nreally change the way tobacco products are going to be sold in America.\n  It would restrict all cigarette advertising to black and white print-\nonly formats, with 50 percent of the space dedicated to graphic health \nwarnings. In other words, all the glamour and glitz of the billboards, \nand all the other advertising on cigarette packaging and in magazines, \nwould be replaced by very stark and clear black and white advertising \nwith very graphic health warnings.\n  This is not a new idea. The Canadians have been in this business for \na long time. Other countries around the world, such as Poland, for \nexample, have started doing things relating to tobacco advertising the \nUnited States should have done years ago.\n  It would require cigarette packaging, under this demand from the \nDepartment of Justice, to carry health leaflet inserts.\n  It would end trade promotions and giveaways.\n  It would ban all vending-machine sales, which is the avenue by which \nmany underage smokers start their habit.\n  It would forbid ``light,'' ``low-tar,'' or ``mild'' labels, which are \ndeceptive on their face.\n  It would require the industry to publicly disclose all ingredients, \nadditives, and toxic chemicals.\n  It would require the industry to publicly disclose manufacturing \nmethods and marketing research.\n  And it would eliminate the slotting fees paid to retailers for \nfavorable placement of tobacco products.\n  This is an amazing array of remedies being asked for by the \nDepartment of Justice. I stand in this Chamber as someone who has been \nskeptical of their commitment. I applaud them for the real leadership \nthey are showing in this lawsuit. If this is a change of heart in the \nadministration, let this Democrat stand here and be the first to praise \nthe administration for its leadership.\n  We need this. We need a commitment not just of resources, but a \ncommitment of talent at the Department of Justice to make this legal \naction successful. Congress now needs to ensure, in our appropriation, \nthat we adequately fund the Department of Justice to pursue this \nlawsuit. Give the Department of Justice the resources it needs to fight \nthe tobacco industry. They are going to put together hundreds of \nlawyers to defend their miserable product and their practices. We need \nto have a team just as good and well funded on our side.\n  I can tell you as well, don't be deceived by the advertising from the \ntobacco industry. They have not changed. The Department of Justice \nuncovered documents that show, as recently as 1997, when the State \nsettlements were being negotiated, the tobacco industry was conducting \nstudies so that they could determine the brand preferences of young \nsmokers between the ages of 12 and 20. Despite all of that beautiful \nadvertising put on by Philip Morris and other companies on the \ntelevision, which says: No we can't sell you these cigarettes, kiddo; \nyou know what the law is. The fact is, this industry would die if they \ncould not recruit teenage smokers. They are still trying to find ways \nto reach them.\n\n  As long as they are doing that, this insidious effort to make addicts \nof our children so that they ultimately become hooked and die from \ntobacco-related disease has to be fought every step of the way. It is \ntime for us in Congress to wake up to the need for the Food and Drug \nAdministration to have new authority to regulate tobacco products. They \nhave slipped through the cracks entirely too long when it comes to \nGovernment oversight. It is time to change it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1926-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1926-S1927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF TOM WINSHIP\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I share a loss which many in New England, \nand Massachusetts particularly, feel today. Thomas Winship, editor of \nthe Boston Globe from 1965 to 1984, and a champion of the role that the \nAmerican newspaper plays in our lives and the lives of our country, \ndied early this morning after a long and brave battle with cancer, \nleaving behind his wife Beth, a sister, Joanna Crawford; two sons, \nLawrence and Ben; two daughters, Margaret and Joanna, and eight \ngrandchildren.\n  Our condolences from all in the State of Massachusetts and all who \nknew him. Our prayers go out to them today as they grieve the passing \nof this very special man.\n  Their loss is also our country's loss. I can say without \nembellishment that Tom Winship was one of America's great newspapermen. \nHe was an extraordinary editor, a giant among a generation of editors \nthat includes people such as Ben Bradlee and Joe Lelyveld, and a host \nof others, all of whom were a band of brothers at that time, who sought \nto change the face of America, our politics, our culture, and our \nlives, in a positive way, using their power of the print to be able to \nreach the American people with what they thought were best \ninterpretations and aspirations of our country.\n  Tom was a man who lived the word ``citizen'' to its fullest. He loved \nhis family, his country, his community, and the newspaper business, all \nwith a burning passion. In his years at the Boston Globe, he left an \nindelible mark on the newspaper lore of our Nation. It is not an \nexaggeration to say that through his efforts and the efforts of others, \nthey made a real and a significant contribution, certainly to the \nhistory of Massachusetts, of New England, and, in the conglomerate of \nall of them, of the country.\n  I first met Tom Winship when I was a young veteran, recently returned \nfrom Vietnam. I went to see him to talk about the war, a visit which \nled to a friendship that lasted some 31 years. When we veterans came to \nWashington in the early 1970s to speak our minds about the war in which \nwe had fought, as veterans who believed we had no other choice but to \ntell another side of the story, something we thought was not \nsufficiently reported, Tom Winship showed a special and personal \ninterest. He understood the meaning of that effort. He insisted that \nhis paper cover that story, our story, and I think, even fairly stated, \nAmerica's story. He insisted that be covered when others were not so \nsure that was wise or that it mattered.\n\n[[Page S1927]]\n\n  Tom's courage was measured not just in printing ``The Pentagon \nPapers,'' for which he was bitterly attacked by some, but in covering \nall the words of the time--harsh words sometimes, honest words always, \nand words that might much more easily, were it not for him, have been \nignored.\n  Tom's brand of special leadership did not begin or end with Vietnam. \nPerhaps it began even with the civil rights movement when he faced not \njust the segregation of the South but a segregation that he also \nrecognized existed at home in the North. It was also his early \nactivism, his willingness to protect the environment in the days when \nRachel Carson and her book ``Silent Spring'' touched a new \nconsciousness about clean air, clean water, and the birth of the \nenvironmental movement that never could have reached full momentum \nwithout Tom's stewardship of a newspaper determined to make it an \nissue.\n  It was the unflinching effort to press for reforms--in Massachusetts, \nin the State legislature, in the State constitution--and his creation \nof the Globe's Spotlight Team that awoke citizens to what was happening \nin too many instances in government, that made it possible for a new \ngeneration of reformers, Governors, to have a voice and find the \nplatform that ultimately helped usher in the modern era of politics in \nour State.\n  On all these issues and so many more, it was Tom Winship who never \nshied away from steering the Boston Globe by his own moral compass. He \nbelieved that a newspaper served an important national purpose: To \nreport the news, yes, but also, he believed equally importantly, to \nhelp his fellow citizens understand how events in their neighborhoods \nand beyond their borders impacted their lives. He believed in the role \nof the newspaper to help frame choices for each of us, to help us find \na direction as a people, to open our eyes to the outcomes and \npossibilities which, as it always is in a democracy, are left up to the \npeople to decide.\n  Tom thought it was entirely appropriate to make public a sense of \nmoral outrage about the actions of people in public life whose choices \nor whose unwillingness to make choices, their inaction, came into \nconflict with the public interest. Tom Winship did not easily accept \nthe changes he perceived in America's print media which seemed more and \nmore interested in personality and conflict and less and less \ninterested in ideas and ideals. Tom's sense of what was news and what \nwas merely new never shifted. It was seared into him by his passion for \na debate on big choices and his deep and unshakable belief that the \nnewspapers were there to help us wrestle with those decisions.\n  For his enduring faith in the responsibility of journalists to our \ncountry, and for his remarkable energy spent to preserve that special \nrole of the American newspaper in our democracy, for his courage in \nfighting to put real news, however contentious, on the front pages of \nAmerica's consciousness, Tom earned the enormous and unfailing respect \nof his peers. He also earned the admiration of a generation of \nactivists and outsiders who might well have otherwise been written out \nof our Nation's dialog.\n  For all that he did in his life and throughout his career, Tom leaves \nan enormous legacy, one that will endure, even as newsprint fades and \nnewspapers yellow with age. It will not be just a memory but a \nstandard, a standard that teaches us lessons about telling the truth \nand focusing on what is really important. When you lose a man such as \nTom Winship, your first instinct is to say you will not see another one \nlike him. But knowing what we do about Tom Winship, knowing all he \nstood for and all he accomplished, we also know he would not want that. \nHe simply would not believe it. He would want us to think that the \nworld we live in, in the future will be a world with more people \npursuing the same goals, with more people who believe they can change \nthings and follow his example.\n  He would have believed nothing less than that. Although the standard \nhe set is exceedingly high, it will mean so much more to our country to \nsee another generation that walks the path Tom Winship so courageously \nblazed for all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1927-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1927-S1928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OTTO REICH IS ON THE JOB\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, this past Monday, March 11, I was among \nthe hundreds of Otto Reich's friends and supporters when he was sworn \nin by Secretary of State Colin Powell to serve as Assistant Secretary \nfor Western Hemisphere Affairs.\n  His nomination had been delayed, to a frivolous extent, by a few \nSenators who held a grudge against Mr. Reich because he so ably served \nPresident Reagan in the 1980s as head of the U.S. Office of Public \nDiplomacy for Latin America.\n  Now, on this past Monday, March 11, surrounded by his family, his two \ndaughters held the Holy Bible on which Otto placed his hand while \ntaking the oath of office by Secretary Powell. There followed a \nthunderous and prolonged applause when the oath was concluded and \nSecretary Powell turned over the podium to Secretary Reich.\n  Madam President, it occurs to me that many will find Otto Reich's \nremarks on that occasion of special interest. Therefore, I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of those remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks by Otto J. Reich Upon His Swearing-In as Assistant Secretary \n  for Western Hemisphere Affairs, in the Benjamin Franklin Room, U.S. \n                  Department of State, March 11, 2002\n\n       Mr. REICH. As President Bush would say, ``Basta.''\n       Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary, for those very kind \n     words and for your presence here. I know how busy your \n     schedule is and I very much appreciate your officiating at \n     this ceremony.\n       Excellencies, Senator Helms--Chairman Helms, Secretary \n     Martinez, colleagues from many years of service in the U.S. \n     Government, Army buddies, un-indicted co-conspirators, \n     friends, family, and special guests:\n       I know many of you have traveled many hours to be here, and \n     I want to thank you all for sharing this important occasion \n     with me and with my family.

If anybody else has traveled longer, we \n     have a prize for you afterwards.\n       As much as I appreciate your presence, my first words of \n     gratitude, on behelf of myself and my brother, my family and \n     my fellow Cuban-Americans, must go to this most generous of \n     countries, the United States of America.\n       As most of you know, my country of birth, Cuba, lost its \n     liberty to a totalitarian dictatorship forty-three years ago. \n     My family, like so many other nonpolitical families, was in \n     danger simply because of our love of liberty, which ran \n     counter to the communist ideology being imposed by force on \n     that island.\n       The United States of America opened its doors to us, as it \n     has done for millions yearning to breathe free. It did not \n     ask anything in return, except allegiance and respect for the \n     laws. It protected our lives, gave us liberty and the \n     opportunity to pursue our happiness.\n       The Greek philosopher Thucydides said that Justice is the \n     right of any person to do those things which God gave him the \n     ability to do. By that or any other definition, this is a \n     just country. Our nation is not perfect, but it allows its \n     citizens to do that for which God gave them the ability. To \n     say that I am proud to be an American is the height of \n     understatement.\n       I want you to reflect for a minute on what you have just \n     witnessed: where else but in the United States of America \n     could the son of Jamaican immigrants rise to be the National \n     Security Advisor to the President, then become the highest \n     ranking officer in the most powerful Armed Forces in the \n     world and then the Secretary of State.\n       Where else could he administer the oath of office to \n     another son of the Caribbean--half-Cuban, half-Austrian, \n     half-Catholic, half-Jewish--and charge him with directing our \n     country's relations with the 34 nations of our home \n     hemisphere. But I don't want you White Anglo Saxon \n     Protestants out there to despair. There is room in our \n     society for you, too.\n       I wish all of you had the opportunity I now have to work \n     with Secretary Powell and President Bush. I have been in \n     meetings with them and with heads of state or foreign \n     ministers of other nations. And in private, in staff \n     meetings, I can tell you that you would sleep better at night \n     knowing how calm, competent, strong and dedicated they are.\n       I would sleep better at night also, except for Deputy \n     Secretary Armitage calling me to ask where is the memo that \n     was supposed to be upstairs by close of business!\n       I am proud today not just because I am being sworn in to \n     this office. I was proud when I was given the opportunity by \n     this\n\n[[Page S1928]]\n\n     country to be the first one in my family to graduate from \n     college, and then to obtain a graduate degree; to be an \n     officer in the U.S. Army; and to be sworn-in three previous \n     times to Presidential appointments. I am proud of every \n     single job I have performed in service to our country.\n       Much has been written in the so-called ``prestige press'' \n     about my previous work. Some of it even true! There were \n     charges of ``covert propaganda'' by the office I headed in \n     the 1980's: the Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America \n     and the Caribbean. Well, Mr. Secretary, today I have a \n     confession to make about the work of that office. Now that \n     the Statute of Limitations has expired, I think it is safe \n     for me to confirm what so many on the other side suspected: \n     Yes, the Office of Public Diplomacy for Latin America and the \n     Caribbean was single-handedly responsible for the downfall of \n     the Soviet Union!\n       There are so many things for which I am grateful today. \n     Like two beautiful and intelligent young ladies who held the \n     Bible. The person responsible for their being smart and \n     pretty is here, their mother--Connie--my friend and former \n     wife, and someone who made many sacrifices to help get me to \n     where I am today. I don't think anyone has a more supportive \n     ex-spouse than I do. Thank you, Connie.\n       And also here is another very special lady, Lourdes Ramos, \n     who this past weekend accepted my proposal of marriage. Thank \n     you, Lourdes. I look forward to our life together. It's a \n     busy weekend.\n       Standing up here, I stand figuratively on the shoulders of \n     all of you. Each of you is here because you had something to \n     do with my being here, some more than others. As George \n     Orwell said in Animal Farm, ``All animals are equal but some \n     are more equal than others.''\n       I am not going to start naming the names of those who are \n     more equal than others, but you know who you are. Since I \n     can't possibly name each one, please consider yourselves \n     properly singled out.\n       I do want to thank President Bush and Secretary Powell not \n     only for selecting me to this incredibly exciting post, but \n     for sticking with me in the face of unfair, anonymous or just \n     plain false charges. I want to thank those who kept \n     encouraging me to ``Hang In There.''\n       Believe me, I hung in there and I have the rope burns \n     around my neck to prove it!\n       But how could I not persevere? I am an American. When the \n     Founding Fathers pledged their lives, their fortunes and \n     their sacred honor to create this experiment in democracy in \n     1776, they did not qualify their words. They didn't say they \n     were going to reconsider if they ran into some resistance \n     from the British. Well, I was not going to reconsider either.\n       How could I? My late parents were not quitters, and they \n     are proud of my service to their adopted country. My mother \n     was a poet and a free spirit. She was also practical and \n     hard-working, a telephone operator and a union member.\n       I like to remind my Democrat friends that I come from a \n     labor union family and am proud to have served the only U.S. \n     President to have been president of a labor union: Ronald \n     Reagan, the man who with his foreign policy vision and \n     courage laid the groundwork for the end of the Evil Empire. \n     And by the way, with the help of a lot of people who are in \n     this room, such as Ambassador Kirkpatrick, Secretary Powell, \n     and many others.\n       How could I quit? The memory of my father would not have \n     let me. He left his home in Vienna in August of 1938, after \n     being beaten up numerous times by Nazi thugs because of his \n     Jewish religion. He rode 700 kilometers on a motorcycle, \n     driven by his best friend, a Catholic, to the Swiss border, \n     and crossed the Alps on foot into Switzerland.\n       He made his way to France and joined the French Foreign \n     Legion so he could fight the Nazis who had taken over his \n     beloved Austria. The same Nazis who would later kill his \n     parents, my grandparents, along with millions of other \n     innocent victims.\n       More than a year after the French Army surrendered, he \n     boarded a Portuguese freighter in Casablanca, headed for \n     Jamaica and Cuba, and in 1942 he landed in Havana, where he \n     found work, met my mother, started a family and hoped he \n     could finally live in peace.\n       I would not be deterred, also because of the memory of my \n     maternal grandfather, Juan Fleites. At the age of fifteen, \n     exactly one hundred and seven years ago, in 1895, he joined \n     the Cuban insurgents who were fighting for Cuba's \n     independence from the Spanish. He was too young to serve as a \n     warrior, so he became a medic's assistant and a stretcher-\n     bearer, helping to carry the casualties off the battlefield \n     and cleaning their wounds as best he could.\n       Secretary Powell is rightfully proud of his heritage and \n     his accomplishments as a military officer and a civilian. But \n     I am also proud, Mr. Secretary, that my grandfather served in \n     Cuba's liberation army under a general named Antonio Maceo.\n       Maceo was the equivalent of the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Cuba's insurrection. He was a black man and the \n     descendant of slaves. Today we would call him Afro-Cuban. \n     Over one hundred years ago, Cubans of all races willingly \n     fought and died for their independence under the general they \n     called ``El Titan de Bronze,'' the Titan of Bronze, in honor \n     of the color of his skin.\n       Antonio Maceo was the highest-ranking military officer of \n     African heritage in this hemisphere until Colin Powell came \n     along. And today I am proud to serve under another ``Titan de \n     Bronze.''\n       Much has been made of my Cuban-American heritage. One group \n     said that I couldn't possibly handle our relations with this \n     hemisphere because I don't have the right temperament, by \n     virtue of my ethnic background. They actually put that in \n     writing. They said that I can't make rational decisions \n     because of my ideology! Well, they are not saying that \n     anymore, because I had them all arrested this morning!\n       Seriously, I think it is time that Cuban Americans cease to \n     be the one ethnic group which the media still finds \n     acceptable to denigrate. How could I not persevere to be \n     appointed into what I think is the best job in the \n     government? Where else can you work twice the number of hours \n     as in the private sector, make half the money, and get public \n     abuse in the process? As my father would have said: ``Such a \n     deal!''\n       I am part of a great team of professionals, both career and \n     non-career. I am both excited and apprehensive about this \n     assignment, because seldom have we faced as many challenges \n     and opportunities simultaneously in the Americans as we do \n     today.\n       This is a continent of contrasts: incredible wealth and \n     unbearable poverty; freedom and repression; world class \n     literature and high illiteracy; abundance and injustice. It \n     is a continent where peasants and workers and laborers work \n     from dawn to dusk, but reach the end of their lives in \n     misery. What is the reason for that? It is not for lack of \n     resources.\n       This continent has all the natural and human resources \n     necessary to achieve levels of development like those of \n     Europe or North America.\n       The creative forces of all the population must be allowed \n     to flourish. Governing elites must encourage, not discourage, \n     individual initiative. People must be given the freedom to \n     produce and then to enjoy the fruits of their work.\n       There is too much false nationalism and not enough \n     commitment to national advancement. Those who keep the masses \n     of the people from climbing the social and economic ladder \n     are condemning their nations to perpetual underdevelopment.\n       We must battle a number of threats all at once: terrorism, \n     drug trafficking, common crime, disease, ignorance, \n     illiteracy, poverty, apathy, racism, despotism, selfishness. \n     As Secretary Powell mentioned--corruption. Corruption is the \n     single largest obstacle to development in the developing \n     world. Those who steal from the public purse are doing as \n     much harm to their country as a foreign invader would.\n       Whether it is the policeman who takes a $2 bribe to tear up \n     a traffic ticket or the Cabinet official who takes $2 million \n     to rig a government contract, they are doing untold damage to \n     their countries.\n       But in adversity there is opportunity. For each financial \n     collapse there is the possibility of recovery. For every war \n     there is the prospect of peace. The Mexican patriot, Benito \n     Juarez, said ``El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz.'' \n     Peace, he said, is achieved through respect for the rights of \n     others. And when governments and persons follow Juarez's \n     advice and respect the civil, political and economic rights \n     of others, we will have peace.\n       The U.S. cannot solve all the problems of this Hemisphere. \n     But we can help those who help themselves.\n       Finally, as I said earlier, questions were raised about my \n     ideology. If you want to know what my ideology is, you need \n     not go far. Just drive a few blocks from here to the \n     Jefferson Memorial.\n       Inscribed in the largest letters at the highest point of \n     the inside of the monument is a quotation from that great \n     Virginian and first Secretary of State: ``I have sworn upon \n     the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of \n     tyranny over the mind of man.'' That is where my American \n     ideology is founded.\n       As Thomas Jefferson's words remind us, our struggle against \n     tyranny is not finished. Since September 11, exactly six \n     months ago today, we are more determined and indivisible than \n     at any time since World War II. Whether they are terrorists \n     in Afghanistan or Colombia, or despots in Baghdad or Havana, \n     anyone trying to impose tyranny over the mind of man has \n     earned our eternal hostility.\n       Thank you all for sharing this very important day with me \n     and my family.\n       God Bless you and God Bless this great country of ours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1928-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1928-S1929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ARSENIC-TREATED RESIDENTIAL-USE LUMBER PROHIBITION ACT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nshare with the Senate a letter I received from a 13-year-old named \nKevin from St. Cloud, FL. It is a town in Osceola County, near Orlando, \nFL, in the center of our State. Kevin writes this letter, and I will \nread part of it:\n\n       I'm 13 years old and a Boy Scout of America. I would like \n     to address you about a problem in a local park, that may be a \n     problem in other parks. The park near my house has arsenic in \n     the wood.\n       Please help with this quickly. I have a little brother who \n     plays in the park.\n\n  That is from a 13-year-old writing to a Senator.\n\n[[Page S1929]]\n\n  Kevin, I hear you. I hope my colleagues do, too.\n  Kevin is addressing a problem many families and communities all \nacross our Nation now find themselves confronting. They are all asking \nthe question: Is my local park safe from the arsenic-treated wood \nwhich, when the rains come, leach the arsenic from the playground wood \ninto the soil? Should I tell my children they cannot play in the park \nbecause of the wood that is treated as a preservative with arsenic?\n  What I found is that local officials, county commissioners, city \ncommissioners all across Florida and many other States have raised \nsimilar questions about the use of arsenic to treat wood in playgrounds \nand backyard decks. The fact is, none of these communities has been \ngiven any clear guidance of what to do about arsenic-treated wood in \ntheir parks, in their backyards, and neither have the parents of kids \nsuch as Kevin. That is why I wanted to share Kevin's letter with the \nSenate today. The Senate has an opportunity, after more than two \ndecades of delay, to finally ban the use of arsenic-treated wood and to \nprovide parents and communities and local officials the information \nneeded so they can make intelligent decisions about safety.\n  While the Environmental Protection Agency recently announced a \nvoluntary phaseout of arsenic-treated wood, this agreement with the \nwood-preserving industry does not go far enough. For one, it is only a \nvoluntary agreement, reminiscent of a voluntary agreement 20 years ago \nthat the industry did not honor. Remember, we are talking about arsenic \nwhich can cause cancer and other serious illnesses, which is what this \nlittle boy from St. Cloud, FL, is writing me about because his little \nbrother plays in the park.\n  Many European countries recognized the dangers long ago. It is time \nwe get serious about a process we know can be harmful to children and \nconsumers. The EPA has studied and negotiated this issue to death. Yet \nthe best deal for consumers that they can come up with is a voluntary \nphaseout. Also, the EPA agreement with the wood-preserving industry \nfails to provide enough guidance to consumers, fails to provide the \nguidance to parents and local government officials about what to do \nwith all that arsenic-treated wood on those playgrounds about which \nlittle Kevin is writing.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in enacting legislation I filed to \npermanently ban this potentially harmful product. It is S. 1963.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1929-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARVIN SEDWAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the official \nopening of the Marvin Sedway Middle School in Las Vegas, NV. This \nstate-of-the-art facility provides an enduring tribute to one of \nNevada's most esteemed and courageous political figures.\n  Marvin Sedway was a man with a ferocious spirit. His language was \nrough and his determination was fearless, but in everything that he \ndid, Marvin was dedicated to the betterment of Nevada. As a State \nassemblyman he demonstrated an unwavering dedication to the children of \nhis State and made their education his top priority.\n  Marvin Sedway moved to Las Vegas from New York City when he was 13 \nyears old. In 1946 he graduated from Las Vegas High School and then he \nattended the University of Nevada at Reno. After completing his \nprofessional education at Pacific University in 1954, Marvin worked as \nan optometrist for almost 40 years. Throughout his career, Marvin \nSedway's compassion and generosity were evident. It was widely known \nthat Marvin volunteered thousands of hours to serve handicapped and \nunderprivileged children who could not afford proper care.\n  Even before his election to the Nevada State Assembly in 1983, Marvin \nwas an integral part of the Nevada political scene. In 1958 Marvin was \na member of the Democratic Party Reform Commission, and in 1968 he \nbecame the State chairman of the ``Humphrey for President'' campaign. \nMarvin was also selected by several Nevadan Governors, including my \ngood friend Governor Mike O'Callaghan, to serve on various State \nboards. He was a member of the Governor's Task Force on Rural Health \nEmergency Services and an advisory board member for Clark County \nCommunity College. In addition, he served as secretary of the State \nBoard of Optometric Examiners and president of the Clark County Mental \nHealth Society.\n  As a member of the Nevada State Assembly, Marvin gained prominence \nacross the State for his service as chairman of the Assembly Ways and \nMeans Committee, which allowed him to determine which bills would \nsurvive and which bills would not move forward. Marvin used his coveted \nposition to advocate for those who often are voiceless including \nwelfare mothers and low-income workers and families. In addition, while \nmany others shied away from unpopular tax increases, Marvin's courage \nled him to support increases that would fund the State's expanding \nservices and social programs.\n  Marvin's greatest cause was improving the education of Nevada's \nschool children. He was a great believer in the importance of a strong \npublic education system and continuously pushed for increasing funds \nfor State schools. Throughout his 8 years in the Nevada State Assembly \nand even before then, he worked to ensure that Nevada's children had \nthe resources to improve their lives, receive a solid education, and \nfulfill the American dream.\n  When Marvin Sedway died of lung cancer on July 7, 1990 at the age of \n61, Nevada lost a great leader. But as the doors of the Marvin Sedway \nMiddle School officially open, we can celebrate his legacy as a public \nservant committed to education. Thousands of young Nevadans will be \neducated in this remarkable facility, fulfilling Marvin's hopes and \nambitions for Nevada's children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1929-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in August \n1994 in Sioux City, IA. Two gay men were attacked when two intruders \nbroke into their residence. The assailants, Anthony L. Smith, 17, and \nHenry White, 18, were charged with first-degree burglary and second-\ndegree criminal mischief under the State hate crime statute.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1929-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1929-S1930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT SECURITY ADVICE ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I am adding my name as a co-sponsor of \nthe Retirement Security Advice Act of 2002, S. 1978, introduced by my \ngood friend from Arkansas, Senator Tim Hutchinson. I do so, and submit \nthis statement for the Record, because the bill holds important \nimplications for small businesses in this country and the millions of \nAmericans they employ.\n  In 1996, we created the Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees \nSIMPLE, as a pension-plan option for small firms in this country. The \ngoal was a simple one: provide a pension plan with low administrative \ncosts for employers so they can offer pension benefits to encourage \nemployees to save for their retirement. I am pleased that these plans \nhave become quite popular, and together with the other pension \nsimplifications and improvements enacted in the last five years, they \nhave contributed to better access to pension benefits by small \nbusinesses and their employees.\n  Greater retirement savings, however, have raised new and complex \nissues for many employees who have seen their pension accounts grow \nsubstantially. As the Ranking Member of the Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship, I have heard many constituents raise difficult \nquestions in this area: What are appropriate investments for my \npersonal circumstances and risk tolerance? Should I buy stocks, bonds, \nannuities, or something\n\n[[Page S1930]]\n\nelse? How should I diversify my investments? When should I modify my \ninvestment mix? And so on.\n  The importance of these questions has increased substantially in \nlight of recent high-profile business failures and more generally \nbecause of the economic downtown. Gone are the days of the momentum \nmarket where any dollar invested seemed to grow with little effort or \nrisk.\n  The return to more cautious investing has left employees who \nparticipate in employer-sponsored pension plans in a real dilemma, hire \nan outside investment advisor or go it alone in most cases. Why? \nCurrent pension rules effectively preclude most employers from offering \ninvestment advice to their employees. In fact, recent estimates are \nthat only about 16 percent of participants have access to investment \nadvice through their pension plan. In today's complex investment \nenvironment that is simply too little help for employees who are trying \nto manage their retirement security.\n  Senator Hutchinson's bill addresses this situation in a responsible \nway. For most businesses, and particularly small firms, the logical \nplace to look for an investment advisor would be the company that \nmanages the plan's investment options or an affiliated firm. Under \nSenator Hutchinson's bill that option would now be available, opening \nthe door for countless businesses to offer this important benefit at a \nlow cost to their employees who participate in the company's pension \nplan. In addition, by allowing more businesses to offer investment-\nadvice benefits, the bill creates an opportunity for increased \ncompetition among investment advisors, which can lead to better advice \nproducts and lower costs overall.\n  Senator Hutchinson's bill, however, does not simply change the rules \nto help the business community. It also includes critical protections \nfor the plan participants. Investment advisors must satisfy strict \nrequirements concerning their qualifications, and they must disclose on \na regular basis all their business relationships, fees, and potential \nconflicts of interest directly to the participants. In addition, and \narguably most importantly, the investment advisor must assume fiduciary \nliability for the investment advice it renders to the employee \nparticipants in the plan. In short, if the investment advisor does not \nact solely in the interest of the participant, it will be liable for \ndamages resulting from the breach of its fiduciary duty. Together, the \nbill's provisions provide substantive safeguards to protect the \ninterests of the plan participants who take advantage of the new \ninvestment-advice benefit.\n\n  Some have contended that a better alternative is to force small \nbusinesses to engage an independent third party to provide investment \nadvice. I disagree. The result would simply be the same as under \ncurrent law. Cost is a real issue for small businesses seeking to offer \nbenefits like pension plans and related investment advice, hence, the \ngenesis of the SIMPLE pension plan. As under the current rules, if the \nonly option is a costly outside advisor, the small firm will not offer \nthe investment-advice benefit. As a result, we would not move the ball \neven a yard further, employees would still be left to their own devices \nto figure out the complex world of investing or they would have to seek \nout and hire their own advisor, which few have the wherewithal to do.\n  More to the point, nothing under the Hutchinson bill prevents a \nbusiness from engaging an independent advisor if the employer deems \nthat the best alternative. The standard under the Hutchinson bill for \nselecting the investment advisor is prudence; the same criteria that \nthe employer must exercise under current law when selecting the company \nthat manages the pension plan and its investment options. If a prudent \nperson would not hire or retain the investment advisor, then under the \nHutchinson bill, the employer should not do so either or face liability \nfor breach of fiduciary duty. Again, additional protection for the plan \nparticipants.\n  In my assessment, investment advice is an increasingly important \nbenefit that employees want and need. Moreover, small businesses in \nparticular need the flexibility to offer benefits that keep them \ncompetitive with big companies as they seek to hire and retain the very \nbest employees possible. And when we talk about small business, we are \nnot dealing with an insignificant employer in this country. In fact, \naccording to Small Business Administration data, small businesses \nrepresent 99 percent of all employers and provide about 75 percent of \nthe net new jobs in this country.\n  The Retirement Security Advice Act provides a carefully balanced and \nresponsible solution to this situation. Most importantly, it provides a \nsolution that employers will actually use to offer the investment \nadvice sought by their employees who struggle to put money aside in the \nhopes of having a nest egg that someday will provide them with a \ncomfortable retirement.

Mr. President, today, I speak with great pain in my heart \nas our country remembers the victims of September 11. Monday was the 6-\nmonth anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon. Once again, I want to offer my condolences for the people who \nlost family members, friends, and loved ones.\n  The amazing generosity and outpouring of love expressed by so many \npeople in our country over these past six months has been heartwarming, \nand I have never seen such unity.\n  Our country has been through a very difficult time. Each of us will \nremember where we were when we heard the news that commercial planes \nwere turned into weapons against the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon. Each of us will remember how we felt when we realized the \nincredible devastation of terrorism in our midst.\n  On that day I was in the Capitol in a meeting with Senate Majority \nLeader Tom Daschle and several other Senators when the planes struck \nthe World Trade Center. As we evacuated the Capitol building, our brace \nCalifornians on Flight 93 were bringing down the plane, hijacked by the \nterrorists and most likely headed for us. I truly believe that those \nCalifornians on Flight 93 that day have made it possible for me to be \nhere today.\n  Even as time has gone on, all I can think of is the people on those \nplanes, every one of whom had a family. It is the families today that \nare coping with the results of September 11, and it is the families \nthat will continue to keep the memory of the victims alive in all of \nour hearts. We have decided to fight and stand up for them and their \nmemories.\n  I want to read the names of the victims--in the planes, in the \nTowers, and in the Pentagon--from the State of California: David Angell \nand Lynn Angell, Seima Aoyama, Barbara Aresteguis, Melissa Barnes, Alan \nBeaven, Berry Berenson, Yeneneh Betru, Carolyn Beug and Mary Alice \nWahlstrom, Mark Bingham, Deora Bodley, Touri Bolourchi, Richard \nGuadagno, Daniel Brandhourst and David Brandhourst, Charles ``Chic'' \nBurlingame III, Thomas Burnett, Suzanne Calley, Jefferey Collman, Jason \nDahl, Dorothy Dearaujo, Darlene Flagg, Dee Flagg, Wilson Flagg, Lisa \nFrost, Ronald Gamboa, Andrew Garcia, Edmund Glazer, Jeremy Glick, \nLauren Grandcolas, Andrew Curry Green, Stanley Hall, Gerald Hardacre, \nJohn Hofer, Stephen Hyland, Barbara Keating, Chandler Keller, Jude \nLarson, Natalie Larson, Daniel John Lee, Maclovio ``Joe'' Lopez, Dora \nMenchaca, Hilda Marcin, Nicole Miller, Mildred Naiman, Laurie A.

Mr. President, I rise today to give tribute to \nsome of\n\n[[Page S1931]]\n\nthe health care heroes in my home State of Oregon. During a recent \nvisit to the Volunteers in Medicine Clinic in Eugene, OR, I was \ntremendously impressed by the strong public service ethic of the \nprofessionals who deliver high quality health care to their uninsured \nclients.\n  In 1999, a concerned group of citizens in Eugene, OR, convened to \nstudy the extent of the health insurance problem in Lane County. It \nfound that 28,000 of their friends and neighbors in the county were \nuninsured. Of these, almost half were working families or low-income \npeople.\n  As a result of that study, the Volunteers in Medicine Clinic came \nabout. Under the executive director and board chair, Sister Monica \nHeeran, the mission of the clinic is to meet the health and wellness \nneeds of the working poor by providing free medical care.\n  The Volunteers in Medicine model relies on practicing and retired \nmedical professionals to serve individuals and families who have \nlimited access to health care, typically the working poor. Over 300 \nhealth care professionals have generously given their time for this \nworthy cause that has helped hundreds of families secure a medical \nhome.\n  One of the volunteers at the Volunteers in Medicine Clinic is Dr. \nJohn Haughom, vice chair of the Board and volunteer physician. He told \nme about a woman he had seen recently at the clinic, Mrs. Gonzalez, who \nhad presented with a large mass under her right jaw. It had been \ngrowing for some time, but she had not sought medical care because she \nknew she could not afford it. Dr. Haughom diagnosed Mrs. Gonzalez with \nnon-Hodgkins lymphoma and was able to arrange for the best possible \ntreatment for her advanced condition. As she was treated, Dr. Haughom \ncontinued to visit her at her workplace. He clearly shared her joy when \nshe told him that a surgeon had been able to remove the entire tumor, \nand that her recovery is expected to be complete.\n  I also heard from a patient who had gone to the Volunteers in \nMedicine Clinic with what he thought was a case of acid reflux--\nheartburn. In addition to being given medication to control the \nsymptoms, the patient was referred to a cardiologist, who advised the \npatient to get an angiogram. It turned out that the underlying \ncondition was no less than five clogged arteries, and the patient was \nscheduled for open-heart surgery the following day, which saved his \nlife.\n  In both these cases, the high-quality care by dedicated medical \nprofessionals clearly saved the lives of these patients.\n  In my mind, every single person who volunteers his or her time at the \nVolunteers in Medicine Clinic is a true health care hero. It is truly \ninspiring to see what can happen when people share a vision and work to \nmake life better for thousands one patient at a time. Today, I salute \nthe work and workers of the Volunteers in Medicine Clinic, true heroes \nfor Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1931-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1931-S1933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CELEBRATING GIRL SCOUTS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today during the \ncelebration of the 90th anniversary of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., \nto express my support for this respected organization.\n  The mission of the Girl Scouts is to help all girls grow strong. Girl \nScouting empowers girls to develop to their full potential and to \ndevelop values that provide the foundation for sound decision-making. \nScouting teaches girls to relate positively to others and to contribute \nin constructive ways to society.\n  Through Girl Scouting, girls acquire self-confidence, learn to take \non responsibility, and are encouraged to think creatively and act with \nintegrity. Girl Scouts take part in activities that teach them about \nscience and technology, finance, sports, health and fitness, the arts, \nglobal awareness, and community service. These experiences allow Girl \nScouts to develop the qualities that are essential in developing strong \nleaders.\n  Perhaps the best proof that Girl Scouting has had an important impact \non women leaders in our country is the fact that over two-thirds of our \ndoctors, lawyers, educators, and community leaders were once Girl \nScouts.\n  I also would like to thank the many volunteers who make the Girl \nScouts such a successful organization. These mentors and role models \nare essential in providing support to girls and empowering them to \nrealize their potential and to achieve.\n  I think it is important to take this time today to celebrate and \nrecognize the contribution Girl Scouting has made to our society by \nproviding positive role models for girls and by encouraging them to \nbecome good citizens and effective future leaders.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the Girl Scouts of the USA, as they are celebrating their \n90th anniversary this week. Today, as the result of founder Juliette \nGordon Low's vision, 2.7 million girls in more than 233,000 troops are \nlearning the skills and building the character necessary to make a \npositive impact in the world. It is the Girl Scouts mission to help all \ngirls grow strong by empowering them to develop their full potential, \nrelate positively to others, and contribute to society. The Girl Scouts \nrecognize the importance of training girls to become effective leaders \nby instilling in them strong values, increasing their social awareness, \ngiving them responsibilities, and encouraging them to think creatively \nand act with integrity. The Girl Scouts also provide experience and \ninstruction through a wide range of activities related to science and \ntechnology, money management and finance, sports, health and fitness, \nthe arts, global awareness, and community service.\n  This significant undertaking would not be possible without the \ncommitment and sacrifice of Girl Scout adult members. I would like to \nnote that 99 percent of the nearly one million adults involved with the \nGirl Scouts are volunteers. Their willingness to invest in the girls of \nAmerica is highly commendable and is the kind of service that President \nBush has been praising and encouraging. It provides a perfect example \nof the good that can be accomplished when dedicated people get involved \nin their communities. More than 50 million Girl Scout alumnae are a \ntestament to their success. Over two-thirds of our doctors, lawyers, \neducators, community leaders, and women Members of Congress were once \ngirl scouts, as were 64 percent of the women listed in Who's Who of \nAmerican Women.\n  Another facet of the Girl Scouts that makes them so admirable is the \ndiverse membership they embrace. Troops can be found in every kind of \ncommunity; girls are not limited by racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, or \ngeographic boundaries. The Girl Scouts continue to expand, with troops \nnow meeting in homeless shelters, migrant farm camps, and juvenile \ndetention facilities. And because of a Girl Scouts initiative, called \nGirl Scouts Beyond Bars, girls can meet in prisons where their mothers \nare incarcerated. In addition to creating more troops, the organization \nhas also established a research institute and has received funding to \naddress violence prevention.\n  The Girl Scouts is an organization that we in this country are very \nproud of. The combination of educational and service-oriented programs \nand exemplary leadership produces the caliber of responsible citizens \nAmerica needs, especially in this time of uncertainty. So today I would \nlike to thank the Girl Scouts for their outstanding contribution to our \nsociety, and I want to express my firm support and congratulations as \nthey strive to carry out the mission that was begun 90 years ago.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, often when we think of Girl Scouts, we \nthink of those delicious cookies that come to our door every year, \ndelivered by smiling-faced girls. But we may not realize the positive \nimpact Girl Scouts has had on so many women in our society.\n  Established by Juliette Gordon Low in 1912, Girl Scouts has evolved \nfrom a group of 18 girls in Savannah, GA to a national membership of \n3.8 million. This week Girl Scouts celebrates its 90th anniversary and \nI want to recognize these exceptional girls and women who work so hard \nto become leaders in our society.\n  Currently, more than 50 million women are Girl Scout alumni, over \ntwo-thirds of which are doctors, lawyers, educators, and community \nleaders. Today, there is even a ``Troop Capitol Hill'' which is made up \nentirely of congresswomen who are honorary Girl Scouts.\n\n[[Page S1932]]\n\n  In a time when more positive role models are needed, Girls Scouts \noften become good citizens and strong leaders through learning self-\nconfidence, responsibility, and the ability to think creatively and act \nwith integrity. They also participate in activities that teach them \nabout science and technology, money management, sports, health and \nfitness, the arts, global awareness, community service, and much more.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, the Girl Scouts--Red Lands Council has \nlaunched an initiative to serve girls who have special financial and \neducational needs. This project has allowed many girls to become Girl \nScouts who might not have otherwise had the opportunity.\n  Please join me in recognizing this outstanding organization for its \nrole in giving today's girls a chance to become tomorrow's leaders.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Girl \nScouts of America on celebrating 90 years of making a difference in the \nlives of millions of girls and young women. Founded by Juliette Gordon \nLow on March 12, 1912, the Girl Scouts of America has a long and \nstoried tradition of providing girls with the tools they will need to \nbe successful members of our communities. America is a better country \nbecause this organization has led the way in preparing girls for \nleadership roles.\n  I have long supported efforts and organizations that help our young \npeople deal with the very unique challenges they face. The Girl Scouts \nis an organization that is doing just that. In fact, that is exactly \nthe mission of the Girl Scouts. I am proud of the efforts that the Girl \nScouts has made in understanding and addressing the needs of girls.\n  As you know, I believe that we need to do better in teaching math and \nscience to our young people. This is particularly true when it comes to \nour girls and young women. I am told that women constitute only 22 \npercent of our scientists and engineers in spite of making up 46 \npercent of our work force. The Girl Scouts is working successfully to \nchange this through the Girls at the Center program, the National \nScience Partnership, the Elliott Wildlife Values Project, and one of \nthe newest initiatives, Girls Go Tech. These programs have been very \nsuccessful in helping girls realize their full potential in the areas \nof Math and Science and I look forward to the continued success of \nthese programs.\n  Another feature of the Girl Scouts that I am excited about is its \nvolunteer component. I believe that the Girl Scouts is exactly the type \nof organization that the President has referred to in his call for more \nvolunteers. I don't think anyone could disagree when I say that this \norganization is only successful because of the efforts of its \nvolunteers. Over 99 percent of the adults involved in the Girl Scouts \nvolunteer their time.\n  In closing, I want to thank the women who came by my office yesterday \nto share with me the exciting things that the Girl Scouts of America is \ndoing in my state of New Mexico. Based on the quality of women who made \nthe long trip to our nation's capitol, I am confident in predicting \nmuch continued success for this organization in our state and in this \ngreat country.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncontributions an extraordinary organization has had on the lives of \nyoung women in America. In 1912, the Girl Scouts of America was founded \nin my home State of Georgia by a visionary young lady named Juliette \nGordon Low. Juliette's hope was to bring girls together in the spirit \nof service and community. Within a few years of the establishment of \nthe first troop, the Girl Scouts had expanded to many different cities \nacross the country, and had opened their doors to girls of all races \nand backgrounds. Since that time, the Girl Scouts have been a symbol of \nleadership in this country, from their involvement in relief efforts \nduring the Great Depression to their activism for civil rights and \nenvironmental responsibility in the turbulent 60s and 70s. The Girl \nScouts have celebrated traditional values like volunteerism and have \ntaught young women the importance of leadership, financial literacy, \ngood health, and global awareness.\n  Today, Girl Scouts organizations across America play a role in the \nlives of over 3.7 million young women. On this, the 90th anniversary of \nthe creation of the Girl Scouts in Savannah, GA, I wish to recognize \nthe vision of Juliette Gordon Low and the contributions of the Girl \nScouts of America to the development of the intelligent, self-confident \nyoung women who play such an important role in America today.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I would like to take the \nopportunity to honor the Girl Scouts of the United States of America \nfor all that they have accomplished for America's young women. This \nweek, the Girl Scouts is amazingly celebrating its 90th anniversary, \nand I believe it appropriate that we congratulate all involved with \nthis storied institution for having the courage and capability to \nwithstand and conquer the hands of time.\n  March 12, 1912, Juliette ``Daisy'' Gordon and 18 girls from Savannah, \nGeorgia gathered for what was to become the first official meeting of \nthe Girl Scouts. Like most great innovators, Juliette Gordon began her \njourney with a very simple and progressive idea. She thoroughly \nbelieved that every young woman deserves the opportunity to fully \ndevelop physically, mentally, and spiritually. Today, the Girl Scouts \nof the United States of America has a membership of 3.8 million--2.7 \nmillion girl members and over 900,000 adult members. That small \nsouthern group of 18 Savannah women has grown over the last 90 years \ninto the largest organization for girls in the world. Through its \nmembership in the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, \nGirl Scouts is part of the worldwide family of 10 million girls and \nadults in 140 countries. They even received a charter from the United \nStates Congress in 1950 officially establishing the Girl Scouts of the \nUnited States of America.\n  By enrolling in the Girl Scouts, a young women is afforded the unique \nopportunity to enhance her communication and social skills, to develop \na strong sense of self, to participate in innovative programs, and to \nfoster her creative side. At the different levels of Girl Scouting, \ngirls learn relevant and applicable skills relating to science and \ntechnology, money management and finance, health and fitness, community \nservice, sports, and global awareness. These young women are learning \nhow to be productive and pro-active citizens, who will some day have \nthe chance to change the way the world works. In fact, over two-thirds \nof women doctors, lawyers, educators, community leaders, and members of \nCongress in the United States were once proud participants in the Girl \nScouts. In 1999 ``Troop Capitol Hill'' was founded to honor those women \nmembers of Congress who were in the Girl Scouts. Furthermore, 64 \npercent of the women listed in the Who's Who of American Women were at \none point Girl Scouts. The Girl Scouts has found a successful way to \nbring out the best in its young women, and I personally thank the \nleaders and supporters of this great organization for continually \nproducing strong and bright young women committed to making this \ncountry a better place to live.\n  I would now like to pay a special tribute to the Girls Scouts of \nKentucky. In the Commonwealth of Kentucky, over 43,000 girls and 13,000 \nadult volunteers participate in the Girl Scouts. In fact, all five of \nmy daughters were Girl Scouts and six of my beautiful granddaughters \nare currently learning what it means to live by The Girl Scout Law. \nGirl Scouts of Kentucky has made a substantial effort to reach out to \nyoung girls who typically might not be able to be involved in the \nprogram due to monetary issues. They have even gone as far as to \nestablish troops in homeless shelters and low-income housing projects. \nThe women of Girl Scouts of Kentucky have gone above and beyond their \ncall of duty to ensure that every young woman in the Commonwealth has \nthe opportunity to realize the vision Juliette Gordon set out in 1912. \nI ask that my fellow colleagues join me in applauding their selfless \nefforts.\n  Finally, I would like to share with my colleagues the timeless words \nof The Girl Scout Law.\n\n     I will do my best to be\n         honest and fair,\n         friendly and helpful,\n         considerate and caring,\n         courageous and strong, and\n\n[[Page S1933]]\n\n         responsible for what I say and do and to\n         respect myself and others,\n         respect authority\n         use resources wisely\n         make the world a better place, and\n         be a sister to every Girl Scout.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on the occasion of the 90th anniversary \nof the Girl Scouts, I want to take this opportunity to discuss the \nexciting work of the Girl Scouts in New York State. I am proud to \nreport that over 190,000 girls participate in New York Girl Scout \ntroops, with the help of over 50,000 adult volunteers.\n  For 90 years, the Girl Scouts have been hard at work building the \nself-esteem of girls, raising awareness about the importance of public \nservice, building character, and developing leadership skills. Today, \nas scouting enters the 21st century, Girl Scouts in New York are \ninvolved in a series of new projects and outreach efforts.\n  Immediately after September 11th, New York troop leaders quickly \nrevised a curriculum on tolerance and diversity to include the attack \non New York and our country. The revised curriculum helped to provide \nlocal leaders across the State with the tools they needed to help girls \ndeal with our national tragedy.\n  New York Girl Scouts are reaching out to new members in underserved \ncommunities. Troop leaders are working through the schools and through \nhousing programs to recruit girls who may not be familiar with \nscouting, and to create opportunities for new experiences and \nchallenges.\n  The Genesee Valley Girl Scouts offer an innovative conflict \nresolution program that provides anger and conflict management training \nfor middle school girls referred by school guidance counselors. Role-\nplaying is used to teach girls a range of peaceful solutions to \ndifferent situations. This program has been a huge success: 88 percent \nof participants maintained or improved school attendance, 72 percent \nmaintained or improved their GPA and 82 percent reduced disciplinary \nproblems.\n  From Buffalo to Chappaqua, from Elmira to Long Island, Girl Scout \ntroops across New York are committed to public service projects that \nhelp instill in our youth the importance of helping others. And girls \nacross the State are learning the value of hard work and commitment \nthrough their efforts to meet the requirements of merit badges.\n  Every year in New York, a small number of girls are honored with the \nGold Award, the highest achievement award given by the Girl Scouts. In \norder to be eligible for a Gold Award, a Girl Scout must first meet the \nrequirements of a series of awards that require leadership and work on \nbehalf of their community. Gold Award recipients must also design and \nfollow through with an extensive community service project. I want to \ntake this opportunity to congratulate the New York Gold Award honorees \nfor their great public service accomplishments and commitment to \nscouting.\n  As a member of the Honorary Congressional Girl Scout Troop and a \nformer Girl Scout, I encourage my colleagues to support Girl Scouts in \nthe 21st century. I look forward to working with New York Girl Scouts \nto help create opportunities for girls and to encourage youth \ninvolvement in public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1933-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n IN RECOGNITION OF DR. CHARLES H. WRIGHT: DOCTOR, HISTORIAN, AND CIVIC \n                                 LEADER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me today in \nextending my condolences to the family and friends of Dr. Charles H. \nWright, who passed away on March 7, 2002. During his 83 years, Dr. \nWright left an indelible mark on this country through his work as a \ndoctor, a civil rights leader, a community activist and a leader in the \nnational movement to create museums celebrating the history, culture \nand accomplishments of African Americans.\n  Legend has it that it was Charles Wright's mother who inspired him to \nattend medical school, by declaring at age eight that he would become a \ndoctor. Growing up in segregated Alabama, to parents who's own \neducation stopped at elementary school, Wright had to overcome many \nobstacles to make his mother's dream a reality. But, as those who knew \nDr. Wright can attest, he was not one to shy away from a challenge. He \ndid attend medical school, and in 1946 he moved to Detroit, where he \nserved his community as an obstetrician/gynecologist. He delivered more \nthan 7,000 babies, including those of some of my staff. Today, you can \nstill meet adults in Detroit who will refer to themselves as ``Dr. \nWright's babies.''\n  Dr. Wright was always concerned about the plight of black people, \nboth here and in Africa. He answered the call of Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, traveling to the South to protest and to help those protesters \nwho required medical assistance. He worked to end discrimination in \nhospitals, where empty beds were being denied to blacks because the \nhospital refused to put black patients and white patients in the same \nroom together. He traveled to newly post-colonial Africa to work in \nvillages lacking adequate health care resources. He helped raise money \nso that African children could come to American universities. He was \nconstantly driven to serve others, and to serve those whom he felt he \ncould best help.\n  Dr. Wright is perhaps best known as the man responsible for Detroit's \nMuseum of African American History, the largest such museum in the \nworld. Inspired by his travels to Africa, and concerned that the \nchildren he was helping to bring into the world had no place to learn \nabout themselves and their history, he decided to create a museum \ndedicated to educating people about the contributions of African \nAmericans to society. In 1965, he opened the International Afro-\nAmerican Museum in the basement of his home and office. Investing \nsignificant amounts of his own money and time into the museum, it \neventually outgrew his home and was moved into a new, larger building \nin the heart of Detroit's University Cultural Center and was renamed \nthe Museum of African American History.\n  That museum moved again in 1997 to an even larger building, and has \nreceived international recognition as one of the finest museums of its \nkind. In 1998, it was renamed the Charles H. Wright Museum of African \nAmerican History in recognition of the vision and dedication of Dr. \nWright. Each year millions of Americans of all races visit this museum \nand learn about the history of African Americans, ensuring that Dr. \nWright's legacy will live on and be passed down to future generations.\n  Dr. Wright's life should serve as an example to all Americans. \nThroughout all his endeavors, he stressed the values of education, \nunderstanding and overcoming obstacles. But perhaps most importantly, \nhe lived his life in service to others. While he will be sorely missed \nby those whose lives he touched, he will long be remembered for all \nthat he gave.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1933-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1933-S1934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KYLIE WHITE\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK.

I am proud that Kylie has been \nselected to receive this honor on behalf of the State of Kansas.

Ever \n     since then I have been solving all different kinds of \n     problems, whether they only took a couple minutes or months \n     to figure out. What I like about problems is that each and \n     every one of them is different and you have to pull together \n     all of your knowledge and creativity to figure them out.\n       I got interested in problem solving when I was little. My \n     Dad taught me how to solve all kinds of problems. Whether it \n     was figuring out the money in Monopoly or deciding how to \n     make a stable structure out of Legos all kinds of \n     ``problems'' were tackled. I was very lucky to have great \n     first and second grade teachers who daily stretched my skills \n     and encouraged me to set high goals. Mrs. Davidson and Ms. \n     Newton taught me how to really push myself.\n       In second, third and fourth grades, my principal offered \n     the ``Principal's Problem of the Week.'' These were optional \n     challenging word or math problems that always got me \n     thinking. I was awarded top ``Principal's Problem of the Week \n     Solver'' three consecutive years. In grade school I went to \n     the library once every week and solved challenging problems \n     for gifted children.\n       I've been in Odyssey of the Mind for three years now. \n     Odyssey of the Mind is a team problem-solving competition \n     with both ``long-term'' and ``spontaneous'' problems. The \n     long-term solution you work on for months before you go to \n     the competition. The spontaneous problem's name kind of \n     explains itself. You get the problem and usually you get 1 \n     minute to think and 2 minutes to answer. The team I was on in \n     fourth grade made it all the way to World Finals in \n     Knoxville, Tennessee. Raising the money to get there was a \n     problem in itself. We had a lot of fun there and we took 25th \n     place out of 44 teams in our division even though we were a \n     very young team.\n       This year in 5th grade my biggest challenge has been \n     learning how to speak French. I have also served as a peer \n     mentor in a group for students having problems making and \n     maintaining friendships. I like helping others solve their \n     problems.\n       Problem solving opens up a lot of opportunities for me. The \n     cure for cancer is a problem. Putting the pieces together at \n     a crime scene and helping find a serial killer are important \n     problems that will help people feel safer in their beds. I \n     could help people solve their problems if I were to become a \n     psychologist. I could be a teacher and help kids learn how to \n     solve problems. Or maybe I could be a top presidential \n     adviser and solve international problems.\n       Problems solving is a way to exercise your brain. It is a \n     fun way to expand your knowledge horizon. I hope to stay at \n     it for a long, long time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1934-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNITION OF THE LYON COLLEGE CONCERT CHOIR\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \nbring to your attention the lovely waterfront community of Absecon, \nwhich is celebrating its centennial year on March 24, 2002. Absecon, \noriginally Absecum, comes from the Algonquin Indian word Absegami, \nmeaning ``Across Little Water.'' Located in Atlantic County, Absecon \nwas incorporated as a city on March 24, 1902. It is governed by an \nelected body consisting of a mayor and council members. The community, \nwhich lies adjacent to Atlantic City, encompasses 6 square miles and is \npredominantly residential, with a population of approximately 7,700 \nresidents.\n  Finding the area lush with pines, cedars, and bayberry bushes, early \nEnglish settlers in Absecon earned their living clamming and oystering. \nSoon wharves lined the creek, and boats large and small were built \nalong the banks of this bustling seaport. In 1795, Thomas Budd \npurchased 10,000 acres of land in what later became Atlantic County. He \npaid 4 cents an acre for the land on which Atlantic City now stands. It \nwas called Further Island, further from Absecon, and later called \nAbsecon Beach and finally became Atlantic City. The land was originally \npurchased for control of the waterways and not for farming.\n  In 1819, Dr. Jonathan Pitney, saddlebags brimming with medical \nsupplies, a blanket, and clothing, rode into Absecon on horseback to \nset up his medical practice. Only 21 years old, Dr. Pitney came to \nAbsecon after completing 2 years as an assistant in a hospital on \nStaten Island, following his graduation from a New York medical school. \nFew in the village could have known that this young doctor would one \nday become famous and be forever known as the ``Father of Atlantic \nCity.'' For by 1834, the village known as Absecum in Galloway Township \nstill only consisted of a tavern, store, and 8 to 10 dwellings.\n  When not visiting patients, Dr. Pitney could always be found \nstrolling the shoreline taking in the sea air. It did not take long for \nDr. Pitney to realize the benefits of the sea air and to determine that \nthis area was magical and had the ideal climate for a health resort. \nConvincing the municipal authorities that a railroad to the beach would \nbe beneficial, he was to be responsible for the construction of the \nrailroad east across New Jersey through the salt marshes to Absecon \nIsland, now Atlantic City. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Pitney again became \na leading force in the Village, petitioning Congress to construct a \nlighthouse at the north end of Absecon Island. Years later the Absecon \nLighthouse was constructed putting an end once and for all to the \ncountless scores of shipwrecks along the shoals and beaches near \n``Graveyard Inlet.''\n  By 1899, Absecon's population was only 530 people but, in March of \n1902 the legislature of the State of New Jersey approved an act to \nincorporate Absecon City in the County of Atlantic, as a city. From \nthese humble beginnings, Absecon has grown to become a charming city by \nthe water, housing a Central Business District and Light Industrial \nareas.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mayor Peter C. \nElco and the citizens of Absecon on their centennial. May they have \nanother 100 years of prosperity and community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1934-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1934-4", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1934-5", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:06 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2341.

A bill to clarify the authority of the Secretary of \nAgriculture to prescribe performance standards for the reduction of \npathogens in meat, meat products, poultry, and poultry products \nprocessed by establishments receiving inspection services; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Meat and \nPoultry Pathogen Reduction Act of 2002. On December 6, 2001, the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals upheld and expanded an earlier District Court \ndecision that removes the U.S. Department of Agriculture's, USDA, \nauthority to enforce its Pathogen Performance Standard for Salmonella. \nPassage of this bill is vital because the Fifth Circuit's decision in \nSupreme Beef v. USDA, Supreme Beef, seriously weakens the substantial \nfood safety improvements adopted by USDA in its 1996 Hazard Analysis \nCritical Control Point and Pathogen Reduction, HACCP, rule.\n  According the Fifth Circuit's opinion in Supreme Beef, today, USDA \ndoes not have the authority to enforce Performance Standards for \nreducing viral and bacterial pathogens. This decision seriously \nundermines the new meat and poultry inspection system.\n  The Pathogen Performance Standard rule recognized that bacterial and \nviral pathogens were the foremost food safety threat in America, \nresponsible for 5,000 deaths, 325,000 hospitalizations and 76 million \nillnesses each year. To address the threat of foodborne illness, USDA \ndeveloped a modern inspection system based on two fundamental \nprinciples.\n  The first was that industry has the primary responsibility to \ndetermine how to produce the safest products possible. Industry must \nexamine its plants and determine how to control contamination \nthroughout the food production process, from the moment a product \narrives at their door until the moment it leave their plant.\n  The second, even more crucial principle was that plants nationwide \nmust reduce levels of dangerous pathogens in meat and poultry products. \nTo ensure the new inspection system accomplished this, USDA developed \nPathogen Performance Standards. These standards provide targets for \nreducing levels of pathogens and require all USDA-inspected facilities \nto meet them. Facilities failing to meet a standard may be shut down \nuntil they create a corrective action plan to meet the standard.\n\n  So far, USDA has only issued one Pathogen Performance Standard, for \nSalmonella. The vast majority of plants in the U.S. have been able to \nmeet the new standard, so it is clearly workable. in addition, USDA \nreports that Salmonella levels for meat and poultry products have \nfallen substantially. The Salmonella standard, therefore has been \nsuccessful. The Fifth Circuit Court's decision threatens to destroy \nthis success and set our food safety system back by years.\n  The other major problem is that we have an industry dead set on \nstriking down USDA's authority to enforce meat and poultry pathogen \nstandards. Ever since the original Supreme Beef decision, I have spent \nmany hours trying to find a compromise that will allow us to ensure we \nhave enforceable, science-based standards for pathogens in meat and \npoultry products. I have previously introduced legislation to address \nthis issue and I have worked with industry leaders attempting to reach \na reasonable compromise.\n  However, despite repeated attempts to address industry concerns, \nindustry has continually back-tracked and moved the finish line. Many \ntimes, I have made changes in my legislation to address their concerns \nof the moment only to have them come back and say we have not gone far \nenough. We cannot let the intransigence of the meat and poultry \nindustry place our children and our families at increased risk of \ngetting ill or dying, because some in the industry want to backtrack on \nfood safety.\n  I plan to seek every opportunity to get the Meat and Poultry Pathogen \nReduction Act enacted. I think it is essential, both to ensuring the \nmodernization of our food safety system, and ensuring consumers that we \nare making progress in reducing dangerous pathogens.\n  I hope that both parties, and both houses of Congress will be able to \nact to pass this legislation without delay. The public's confidence in \nour meat and poultry inspection system depends on it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am joining Senator Harkin in \nintroducing legislation that will clarify the United States Department \nof Agriculture's, USDA, authority to enforce pathogen reduction \nstandards in meat and poultry products. I am pleased to join in this \nvery important effort.\n  Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with one of the safest \nand most abundant food supplies in the world. However, we can do \nbetter. While food may never be completely free of risk, we must strive \nto make our food as safe as possible. Foodborne illnesses and hazards \nare still a significant problem that cannot be passively dismissed.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, estimate that as \nmany as 76 million people suffer from foodborne illnesses each year. Of \nthose individuals, approximately 325,000 will be hospitalized, and more \nthan 5,000 will die. Children and the elderly are especially \nvulnerable. In terms of medical costs and productivity losses, \nfoodborne illnesses cost the nation billions of dollars annually, and \nthe situation is not likely to improve without decisive action. In \nfact, the Department of Health and Human Services\n\n[[Page S1937]]\n\npredicts that foodborne illnesses and deaths will increase 10-15 \npercent over the next decade.\n  In an age where our Nation's food supply is facing tremendous \npressures, from emerging pathogens to an ever-growing volume of food \nimports, from changing food consumption patterns to an aging population \nsusceptible to food-related illnesses, and from age-old bacterial \nthreats to new potential food security risks, we must have a stronger \nsystem in place to ensure the safety of our food.\n  A key tool for addressing foodborne illness in this country has been \nUSDA's Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point, \nPR/HACCP, regulations that were phased in beginning in January 1998. \nUnder these regulations, USDA developed a scientific approach aimed at \nprotecting consumers from foodborne pathogens. Instead of a system \nbased on sight, smell and touch, USDA moved to a system that would \nsuccessfully detect harmful pathogens whether visible or not and keep \nthem from entering the food supply. A major part of this system \nincluded testing for Salmonella, which is not only one of the most \ncommon foodborne pathogens, but also one of the easiest to detect. USDA \nused this testing data to determine if meat and poultry plants were \nproducing products that were safe for human health.\n  Research indicates that USDA's system was working well. According to \nformer Secretary of Agriculture, Dan Glickman, the testing techniques \nwere successful in controlling Salmonella and other deadly pathogens. \nIn less than three years, the Salmonella standard was working, cutting \nthe incidence of Salmonella in ground beef by a third.\n  USDA's pathogen testing regulations provided consumers with much \nneeded confidence in the safety of meat and poultry products. However, \nthat confidence has been shattered by a recent court decision. Last \nDecember, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that USDA could not \nclose down the meat processor Supreme Beef, Inc., a supplier providing \nproducts to our Nation's school children through the Federal school \nlunch program, even after USDA inspectors tested and found the presence \nof potentially harmful levels of Salmonella at the plant on three \nseparate occasions. The result of this court case is that USDA can no \nlonger ensure that meat and poultry plants comply with pathogen \nstandards. This creates a significant risk that meat and poultry \nproducts contaminated with common but potentially deadly foodborne \npathogens will be sold to unsuspecting consumers.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will clarify USDA's \nauthority to enforce strong safety standards for contamination in meat \nand poultry products. Specifically, this legislation will provide the \nSecretary of Agriculture with the clear authority to control for \npathogens and enforce pathogen performance standards for meat and \npoultry products. Only with this authority will the Secretary of \nAgriculture be able to ensure the safety of the meat and poultry \nproducts sold in this country.\n  The court's decision in the Supreme Beef case is a step back for food \nsafety. We must work together to ensure that USDA has the necessary \nauthority to enforce pathogen performance standards that will protect \npublic health. Let's not turn our back on food safety and consumer \nprotection at such a critical time for food safety and security. I \nencourage my colleagues to join us in this effort to protect our food \nsupply and public health.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2014. A bill to provide better Federal interagency coordination \nand support for emergency medical services; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  By Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nMaine to introduce legislation that will help to improve and streamline \nFederal support for community-based emergency medical services. Our \nproposal will also provide an avenue for local officials and EMS \nproviders to help Federal agencies improve existing programs and future \ninitiatives.\n  Five Federal agencies currently provide technical assistance and \nfunding to State and local EMS systems. These Agencies are the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services' Health Resources and Services Administration, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency's U.S. Fire Administration, and the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services.\n  Last year, the General Accounting Office cited the need to increase \ncoordination between these agencies as they address the needs of local \nemergency medical service providers. According to GAO, these needs, \nincluding personnel, training, equipment, and more emergency personnel \nin the field, tend to vary between urban and rural communities.\n  The Federal Government needs to step up to the plate and provide \nsupport to our firefighters, EMTs, emergency physicians, emergency \nnurses, state medical directors, and others who provide the emergency \ncare to those in need. And the Federal agencies must listen to their \npriorities. We have five Federal agencies currently involved in \nsupporting EMS services, but they lack coordination and the necessary \ninput from our local EMS providers.\n  Over the past few years, each of the five Federal agencies has \nseparately initiated attempts to promote activities to strengthen \nsupport for EMS providers and address the needs cited in the GAO \nreport. While these efforts are certainly welcome, our legislation will \nhelp to coordinate and prioritize Federal EMS activities that support \nfirst responders, and at the same time, ensure effective utilization of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  This legislation does not begin to address many of the challenges \nfacing our local EMS providers, but it is an important first step. I \nknow it is an important step because this legislation is a direct \nresult of the input by Wisconsin's fire chiefs, members of Emergency \nMedical Service Board and others. In particular, I would like to thank \nDr. Marvin Birnbaum of the University of Wisconsin, Fire Chief Dave \nBloom of the Town of Madison, and Dan Williams, the Chair of \nWisconsin's EMS advisory board, for their advice and guidance.\n  I am also pleased that my legislation has support from public health \ngroups such as the American Heart Association and other important \ngroups such as the State EMS Directors. In particular, I would like to \nexpress my appreciation to Steve Hise of the State EMS Directors and \nKarl Moeller of the American Heart Association for their input and \nconsistent advocacy on issues facing the EMS community.\n  We must be aggressive in seeking the advice of our local EMS \nproviders, and helping them to attain the resources that they need to \nprovide effective services. They are on the front lines, and deserve \nour support. I ask my colleagues to join me in taking this important \nfirst step to cosponsor this legislation and improve and streamline \nFederal support for community-based emergency medical services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n  S. 2015. A bill to exempt certain users of fee demonstration areas \nfrom fees imposed under the recreation fee demonstration program; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that would provide equity and fairness to the application \nof the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program, or the Fee Demo Program, \nas it is more commonly called. This bill, the Host Community Fairness \nAct, would exempt local residents from fees imposed as part of the Fee \nDemo Program.\n  As I am sure my colleagues are all aware, the Fee Demo Program, which \nstarted in fiscal year 1996, was established to fund recreational and \nresource needs, and repair facilities throughout our national forests, \nparks and other public lands. Currently, each land management agency \ncan establish any number of fee projects and retain and spend all the \nrevenue collected. However, at least 80 percent of the fees collected \nare retained at the site where collected. The program was originally \nsupposed to end at the end of FY98; however, due to extensions that \nhave occurred through the appropriations process, it is now set to \nexpire at the end of FY04.\n\n[[Page S1938]]\n\n  While I agree that the intentions of this program are good, there are \nflaws that must be addressed. What concerns me most is double-taxation \nfor the local residents who live in and around these Fee Demo areas. \nThese individuals should not also be required to pay to use these \nlands. Especially when they already suffer from a decreased tax-base \ndue to the presence of Federal lands in their community and who help to \nprovide emergency services. It is wrong to ask them to pay to use land \nthat they already support and is essentially in their own backyard.\n  Just to be clear, this legislation would exempt residents of any \ncounty or counties that host any Federal land that has a Fee Demo \nproject from paying the fee, regardless of where in the forest or park \nthe fee is being imposed. When I say Federal land, I mean any National \nForest, National Park, National Wildlife Refuge or Bureau of Land \nManagement land.\n  I would like to take a moment to talk about how this impacts the \nState of New Hampshire. Nearly 50-percent of Berlin, New Hampshire, \nwhich has a population of about 10,000, falls within the boundaries of \nthe White Mountain National Forest. Unfortunately, the city of Berlin \nhas dealt with several economic setbacks, including the recent closure \nof a local paper mill, its largest employer. When this situation is \ncombined with the fact that half their land is tied up in the National \nForest, the result is a severe hit to this city's tax base. Asking \nthese citizens to pay a fee to hike in their own backyard is not only \nunfair, it is also wrong. I think it is also reasonable to assume that \nthis kind of economic situation is not unique to host communities in \nNew Hampshire.\n  Finally, it should be noted that a clear and convincing majority of \nthe New Hampshire House of Representatives sent a message to the U.S. \nCongress regarding their serious concerns with this program. On \nFebruary 14, 2002, the New Hampshire House overwhelmingly voted in \nfavor of a resolution that clearly outlines what they see as the \nnegative effect this program has had on their local communities.\n  The New Hampshire House is one the largest parliamentary bodies in \nthe world. Its 400 members receive only a $100 per year stipend and \nthey are truly citizen legislators. The resolution's primary sponsors \nincluded both Republicans and Democrats as well as the Speaker of the \nHouse and the former Speaker of the House, who is now a State Senator.\n  What concerns me most with what these citizen legislators are saying \nis that, ``. . . the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program has \nundermined the longstanding goodwill between the White Mountain \nNational Forest and New Hampshire citizens and communities . . .'' and \n``. . . the traditional support of the New Hampshire citizens for \nactivities such as trail maintenance and fire safety have been \ncompromised . . .''. As the senior Senator from New Hampshire, I find \nthese statements very disheartening. In New Hampshire, there is a \nlongstanding tradition of open access to both public and private lands. \nThe Fee Demo program runs counter to that tradition. Members of \nCongress have a duty to their constituents to maintain a cooperative \nrelationship between the Federal land management agencies and the \ncommunities that are required to host them.\n  Enactment of the Host Community Fairness Act is one small step we can \ntake in addressing these legitimate concerns and restoring the goodwill \npreviously enjoyed between the Federal lands across this country and \ntheir host communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2015\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Host Community Fairness Act \n     of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to authorize the exchange of lands between an Alaska \nNative Village Corporation and the Department of the Interior, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto address a critical concern for one of Alaska's rural villages.\n  The village of Newtok, in far western Alaska, is facing the loss of \nits homes and facilities to ever-encroaching erosion by the Ninglick \nRiver. The village is presently located on the north bank of the river, \njust downstream of a sweeping bend, which is reclaiming the bank at a \nrate of several feet per year.\n  By at least 2008, some homes will no longer be habitable and the \nvillage airport will begin to suffer irreparable damage. It is critical \nfor the future of Newtok's residents that Congress act this year to \nmake provision for the relocation of the village.\n  Newtok is located within the boundaries of the Yukon Delta National \nWildlife Refuge. Under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, \nNewtok had land selection rights within the Refuge. Most of the lands \nselected by and conveyed to the village by the United States lie on the \nnorth side of the Ninglick River, although a portion of the village \nland holdings are on Nelson Island, to the south.\n  The village has identified 5,580 acres on Nelson Island that will be \nmore suitable for a permanent village location. The land on Nelson \nIsland is higher in elevation and is underlain with rock and gravel. \nFurthermore, it is situated such that hydraulic forces of the river are \nunlikely to pose any future threat to the well-being of the village.\n  The proposed legislation authorizes an equal value exchange of lands \nbetween the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Newtok Native \nCorporation, the ANCSA corporation organized by the village which owns \nthe Newtok Village lands. The proposed exchange is the first important \nstep in allowing the Newtok villagers to relocate their village to safe \nground.\n  The exchange is proposed primarily for health and safety reasons, to \nprotect the lives and property of Alaska Native villagers. However, \nthere is a direct benefit to the broader interest of the United States. \nThe land Newtok proposes to relinquish contains habitat of higher value \nfor geese, brant, and Spectacled Eider than the land on Nelson Island \nthat has been selected for the new village location. Thus the Yukon \nDelta National Wildlife Refuge, while receiving lands of equal economic \nvalue in the exchange, will actually be receiving lands of greater \nvalue for waterfowl habitat.\n  We should not underestimate the importance of congressional action \nthis year on this matter. It will take several years to actually \nrelocate the village. Facilities must be constructed and homes must be \nbuilt. Before any of that can begin, the land must be exchanged. I \ntherefore urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2017. A bill to amend the Indian Financing Act of 1974 to improve \nthe effectiveness of the Indian loan guarantee and insurance program; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to introduce the \nIndian Financing Act Amendments of 2002 to improve the effectiveness of \nan economic development program essential to our Native American \ncommunity. As one of the legislative flowerings of President Nixon's \n``Special Message to Congress on Indian Affairs,'' the Indian Financing \nAct joins the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act as \npillars of Federal Indian policy. Since Congress enacted the Indian \nFinancing Act of 1974 and established the\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\nIndian Revolving Loan Fund program, the Secretary of the Interior has \nhad the ability to insure and guaranty the repayment by qualified \nNative American borrowers of small business loans issued by private \nbanks and lenders. The focus of the loan program is commercial lending \nto Native American-owned businesses who cannot otherwise obtain \nfinancing in conventional credit markets.\n  The Indian Revolving Fund Program has grown over the past 28 years to \nreach $60 million in annual lending to Native Americans, though the \nneed for capital in Indian economies far outstrips this amount. The \n``Mortgage Finance News'' reports that for housing finance alone, there \nis $2.7 billion in pent-up demand in the Indian community. In addition, \nthe ``Native American Lending Study'' released by the Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions shows, there are great needs in \nNative communities for more capital and liquidity. These unmet needs \nare holding back the growth of Indian economies.\n  The purpose of a Federal loan guaranty is to stimulate the private \nlending community into being more active with clients and customers \nthey should be serving. Under the current Indian guaranteed loan \nprogram, the lender shares in the cost of any loan default, and is not \n100 percent guaranteed by the government.\n  Lenders across the country have told the Committee on Indian Affairs \nthat a major problem restraining their participation in this program is \nthe lack of liquidity once the loan is made. These small business loans \ntend to stay on the books for a long time. They are paid down but not \nas rapidly refinanced as conventional loans. Therefore, a bank has its \ncapital tied up in these loans, and cannot easily turn around and use \nthat capital again.\n  The financial community long ago came up with a system to respond to \nthis general need, and that is to allow investors to buy loans on the \nsecondary market. This is the cornerstone for our private mortgage \nmarket and the essential job of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But it is \nalso an important part of commercial lending. The Small Business \nAdministration, which makes loan guaranties available through over \n1,000 lenders nationwide, 17 years ago recognized the importance of \nsecondary market for its SBA loan guaranties. At its request, Congress \nenacted legislation which allows for the orderly transfer and sales of \nthe guaranteed portion of the SBA loans through a secondary market \nfiscal transfer agent. This system operates largely at no cost to the \ngovernment, as the fees for the transfer are paid by the buyers and \nsellers of the loans, and not passed back to the borrowers.\n\n  The SBA loan program is highly successful. It assists smaller lenders \nwho may not regularly participate in these government programs by \ngiving them a standardized and simple process for transfer of the loan. \nThe use of the fiscal transfer agent ensures that loan repayments made \nto the original lender are properly flowed through any investors. Most \nimportantly, the ability of the SBA to regulate or otherwise discipline \noriginating lenders is unimpeded by the secondary market.\n  The ``Indian Financing Act Amendments of 2002'' directs the Secretary \nof the Interior to take similar steps to the SBA program by allowing \nthe efficient functioning of a secondary market for Native American \nloans or loan guaranties made by the Interior Department.\n  It is my hope that the Indian Financing Act Amendments of 2002 will \nprofoundly effect Native American small business owners throughout the \nUnited States, and that the support of the Department, and the Native \nAmerican and financial communities, we can effect positive change not \njust for Native American small business owners, and for Indian \ncommunities generally.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2017\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Financing Act \n     Amendments of 2002.''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1451 et \n     seq.) was intended to provide Native American borrowers with \n     access to commercial capital sources that, but for that Act, \n     would not be available through loans guaranteed by the \n     Secretary of the Interior;\n       (2) although the Secretary of the Interior has made loan \n     guarantees available, acceptance of loan guarantees by \n     lenders to benefit Native American business borrowers has \n     been limited;\n       (3) 27 years after enactment of the Act, the promotion and \n     development of Native American-owned business remains an \n     essential foundation for growth of economic and social \n     stability of Native Americans;\n       (4) acceptance by lenders of the loan guarantees may be \n     limited by liquidity and other capital market-driven \n     concerns; and\n       (5) it is in the best interest of the guaranteed loan \n     program to--\n       (A) encourage the orderly development and expansion of a \n     secondary market for loans guaranteed by the Secretary; and\n       (B) expand the number of lenders originating loans under \n     that Act.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to stimulate the use by lenders of secondary market \n     investors for loans guaranteed by the Secretary of the \n     Interior;\n       (2) to preserve the authority of the Secretary to \n     administer the program and regulate lenders;\n       (3) to clarify that a good faith investor in loans \n     guaranteed by the Secretary will receive appropriate \n     payments;\n       (4) to provide for the appointment by the Secretary of a \n     qualified fiscal transfer agent to administer a system for \n     the orderly transfer of the loans;\n       (5) to authorize the Secretary to--\n       (A) promulgate regulations to encourage and expand a \n     secondary market program for loans guaranteed by the \n     Secretary; and\n       (B) allow the pooling of the loans as the secondary market \n     develops; and\n       (6) to authorize the Secretary to establish a schedule for \n     assessing lenders and investors for the necessary costs of \n     the fiscal transfer agent and system.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to extend the authority of the Export-Import Bank \nuntil April 30, 2002; considered and passed.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill \nthat would create a unique area within the Cibola National Forest in \nNew Mexico, entitled the T'uf Shur Bien Preservation Trust Area. The \nimportance of this bill cannot be overstated. It would resolve, through \na negotiated agreement, the Pueblo of Sandia's land claim to Sandia \nMoutain, an area of significant value and use to all New Mexicans. The \nbill would also maintain full public ownership and access to the \nNational Forest and Sandia Mountain Wilderness lands within the \nPueblo's claim area; clear title for affected homeowners; and grant the \nnecessary rights-of-way and easements to protect private property \ninterests and the public's ongoing use of the Area.\n  The need for this bill and the basis for Sandia Pueblo's claim arise \nfrom a 1748 grant to the Pueblo from a representative of the King of \nSpain. That grant was recognized and confirmed by Congress in 1858, 11 \nStat. 374). There remains, however, a dispute over the location of the \neastern boundary of the Pueblo that stems from an 1859 survey of the \ngrant. That survey fixed the eastern boundary roughly along the top of \na foothill on the western slope of the mountain, rather than along the \ntrue crest of the mountain. The Pueblo has contended that the \ninterpretation of the grant, and thus the survey and subsequent patent, \nare erroneous, and that the true eastern boundary is the crest of the \nmountain.\n  In the early 1980's, the Pueblo approached the Department of the \nInterior seeking a resurvey of the grant to locate the eastern boundary \nof the Pueblo along the main ridge of Sandia Mountain. In December \n1988, the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior issued an opinion \nrejecting the Pueblo's claim. The Pueblo challenged the opinion in \nfederal district court and in 1998, the court issued on Order setting \naside the 1988 opinion and remanding the matter to Interior for forther \nproceedings. Pueblo of Sandia v. Babbitt, Civ. No. 94-2624, D.D.C., \nJuly 18, 1998. The Order was appealed but appellate proceedings were \nstayed for more than a year while a settlement was being negotiated. \nUltimately, on April 4, 2000, a settlement agreement was executed \nbetween the United States, Pueblo, and the Sandia Peak Tram Company. \nThat agreement was conditioned on congressional ratification, but \nremains effective until November 15, 2002.\n  In November, 2000, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia \nCircuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the \nDistrict Court's action was not a final appealable decision. Upon \ndismissal, the Department of the Interior proceeded with its \nreconsideration of the 1988 Solicitor's opinion in accord with the 1998 \nOrder of the District Court. On January 19, 2001, the Solicitor issued \na new opinion that concluded that the 1859 survey of the Sandia Pueblo \ngrant was erroneous and that a resurvey should be conducted. \nImplementation of the opinion would therefore remove the area from its \nNational Forest status and convey it to the Pueblo. The Department \nstayed the resurvey, however, until after November 15, 2002, so that \nthere would be time for Congress to legislate the settlement and make \nit permanent.\n  To state the obvious, this is a very complicated situation. The area \nthat is the subject of the Pueblo's claim has been used by the Pueblo \nand its members for centuries and is of great significance to the \nPueblo for traditional and cultural reasons. The Pueblo strongly \ndesires that the wilderness character of the area continue to be \npreserved and its use by the Pueblo protected. Notwithstanding that \ninterest and use, the Federal Government has administered the claim \narea as a unit of the National Forest system for most of the last \ncentury and over the years has issued patents for several hundred acres \nof land within the area to persons who had no notice of the Pueblo's \nclaim. As a result, there are now several subdivisions within the \nexternal boundaries of the area, and although the Pueblo's lawsuit \nspecifically disclaimed any title or interest in privately-owned lands, \nthe residents of the subdivisions have concerns that the claim and its \nassociated litigation have resulted in hardships by clouding titles to \nland. Finally, as a unit of the National forest system, the areas has \ngreat significance to the public and in particular, the people in the \nState of New Mexico, including the residents of the Counties of \nBernalillo and Sandoval and the City of Albuquerque, who use the claim \narea for recreational and other purposes and who desire that the public \nuse and natural character of the area be preserved.\n\n  Because of the complexity of the situation, including the significant \nand overlapping interests just mentioned, Congress has not yet acted in \nthis matter. In particular, concerns about the settlement were \nexpressed by parties who did not participate in the final stages of the \nnegotiations. I have worked with those parties to address their \nconcerns while still trying to maintain the benefits secured by the \nparties in the Settlement Agreement. I believe the legislation that I \nhave introduced today is a fair compromise. It provides the Pueblo \nspecific rights and interests in the area that help to resolve its \nclaim with finality but also, as noted earlier, maintains full public \nownership and access to the National Forest system lands. In that \nsense, using the term ``Trust'' in the title recognizes those specific \ninterests but does not confer the same status that exists when the \nSecretary of the Interior accepts title to land in trust on behalf of \nan Indian tribe.\n  Most importantly, the bill I am introducing today relies on a \nsettlement as the basis for resolving this claim. Although other \napproaches have been circulated, this bill is the only one with the \npotential to secure a consensus of the interested parties. Not only is \na negotiated settlement the appropriate manner by which to resolve the \nPueblo's claim, it also allows for a solution that fits the unique \ncircumstances of this situation. To my knowledge, Sandia Pueblo's claim \nis the only Indian land claim that exists where the tribe may \neffectively recover ownership of federal land without an Act of \nCongress. Nonetheless, the parties have negotiated a creative \narrangement to address the Pueblo's interest, protect private property, \nand still maintain public ownership of the land. That is to be \ncommended and I am proud to introduce this legislation to preserve the \nsubstance of that arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/14/senate-section/article/S1941-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 226--DESIGNATING APRIL 6, 2002, AS ``NATIONAL MISSING \n                             PERSONS DAY''\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to Calendar No. 141, S. 1372, the Export-Import Bank \nreauthorization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1372) to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of \n     the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1372, the \nExport-Import Bank Reauthorization Act. This legislation, which was \nreported out of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs by \na 21-0 vote, would reauthorize the Export-Import Bank through September \n30, 2006.\n  The Export-Import Bank of the United States was created in 1934 and \nestablished under its present law in 1945 to aid in financing and \npromoting U.S. exports. The Bank operates under a renewable charter, \nthe Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, and was last authorized in 1997 \nthrough September 30, 2001. A short-term extension through March 31, \n2002 was contained in the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill \nenacted last year. It is thus urgent for the Congress to act on this \nreauthorization in order for the Eximbank to remain open and able to \nassist U.S. exporters to compete in international markets. In order to \nensure that the Ex-Im Bank will be able to continue to function until \nthis reauthorization bill is enacted, I am also seeking consent today \non a short-term extension of the authorization of the Ex-Im Bank until \nApril 30, 2002.\n  In my view, there are two compelling market-based reasons for the \nexistence of the Ex-Im Bank. First, the Ex-Im Bank has a critical role \nto play in leveling the playing field for U.S. exporters by matching \nthe public financing made available by foreign governments. In \naddition, the Ex-Im Bank provides leverage to U.S. negotiators seeking \nto achieve international agreements to limit the use of government \nexport subsidies. U.S. exporters are able to compete effectively in \ninternational markets on the basis of price and quality. When foreign \ngovernments provide subsidized financing for their exporters, U.S. \nexporters are placed at a competitive disadvantage.\n  Second, emerging market economies can pose credit risks of such \nmagnitude that commercial banks are reluctant to finance U.S. exports \nto those countries even though they may present extraordinary \nopportunities for U.S. exporters. The Ex-Im Bank has the difficult but \nimportant task of weighing the project in light of the country risk \nrating and determining if a guarantee should be provided for a \ncommercial export loan that would make possible an export deal that \notherwise would not occur.\n  For these reasons, the Export-Import Bank has traditionally enjoyed \nstrong bipartisan support in the Congress. That support is reflected in \nthe unanimous 21-0 vote in the Banking Committee in support of this \nlegislation. I would like to thank Senator Bayh, Chairman of the \nInternational Trade and Finance Subcommittee, and Senator Hagel, the \nRanking Member of the Subcommittee, for their strong support and \nleadership on this legislation. I would also like to thank Senator \nGramm, the Ranking Member of the Banking Committee, for his cooperation \nin moving this important legislation forward.\n  There are four key issues addressed in this legislation: the term of \nthe reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank; the competitive challenge posed \nto the Bank by foreign market windows; Ex-Im Bank financing for small \nbusiness; and the collection of information on the activities of \nforeign export credit agencies as part of the Ex-Im Bank's annual \nreport. Following is a brief discussion of these issues, as well as a \ndiscussion of an amendment that will be offered on the floor by Senator \nAllard to establish an Inspector General for the Eximbank.\n  The legislation intentionally provided an authorization until \nSeptember 30, 2006 in order to take the reauthorization of the Ex-Im \nBank out of the Presidential election cycle. When the reauthorization \nof the Ex-Im Bank falls in the first year of a President's term, it \nruns the risk that a new President will be taking office, as occurred \nlast year. In that case, a new Administration must struggle not only to \nput in place a new Chairman of the Ex-Im Bank but also cope with \nproviding leadership for the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank as well. \nThe Banking Committee believed that it makes more sense to put the \nreauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank in the second year of a President's \nterm to assure that a new Ex-Im Bank Chairman has been put in place and \nhas been on the job with sufficient time to provide leadership for the \nreauthorization of the Bank.\n\n  The second issue addressed in the legislation is the competitive \nchallenge to the Ex-Im Bank posed by foreign market windows. In \nhearings held in the International Trade and Finance Subcommittee last \nyear, witnesses from industry, academia, and the Administration \ncommented on the growing challenges to U.S. exporters posed by foreign \nmarket windows.\n  Market windows are government-sponsored enterprises (for example, \ngovernment owned or directed financial institutions) which provide \nexport financing at below market rates. However, the foreign \ngovernments--notably Germany and Canada--which support them claim that \nthese enterprises are not official export credit agencies, and thus not \nsubject to the disciplines of the OECD Arrangement. Currently, two \ngovernment entities operate very active market windows. They are the \nGerman market window KfW and the Canadian market window, the Export \nDevelopment Corporation (EDC). The result is that these foreign market \nwindows can provide subsidized export financing outside the OECD \nArrangement and give their exporters a competitive advantage over U.S. \nexporters. Also, because these foreign market windows are not subject \nto the OECD disciplines, there is often a transparency problem--it is \ndifficult to find out the terms of the financing they provide.\n  The Ex-Im Bank Act currently authorizes the Ex-Im Bank to ``provide \nguarantees, insurance, and extensions of credit at rates and on terms \nand other conditions which are fully competitive with the Government-\nsupported rates and terms and other conditions available for the \nfinancing of exports of goods and services from the principal countries \nwhose exporters compete with the United States.'' Since market windows \nare government-supported entities, the Ex-Im Bank views its current \nstatute as providing Ex-Im Bank authority to match windows financing \n(but not to create its own market windows institutions). The Bank \nCommittee agreed with that view. However, the Banking Committee \nbelieved it would be helpful to make this authority explicit so as to \nremove any question about Ex-Im Bank's authority and also to send a \nmessage to\n\n[[Page S1955]]\n\nthe foreign market windows of U.S. concern about their operations.\n  As a result, the legislation contains two provisions which address \nmarket windows. The first provision directs the executive branch to \nseek increased transparency over the activities of market windows in \nthe OECD Export Credit Arrangement. If it is determined that market \nwindows are disadvantaging U.S. exporters, the U.S. would be directed \nto seek negotiations in the OECD for multilateral disciplines and \ntransparency for market windows.\n  The second provision authorizes the Ex-Im Bank to provide financing \non terms and conditions that are inconsistent with those permitted \nunder the OECD Export Credit Arrangement to match financing terms and \nconditions that are being offered by market windows if such matching \nadvances negotiations for multilateral disciplines and transparency \nwithin the OECD, or when market windows financing is being offered on \nterms that are more favorable than available from private financial \nmarkets. Ex-Im Bank could also match market window financing when the \nmarket window refuses to provide sufficient transparency to permit Ex-\nIm Bank to determine the terms and conditions of the market window \nfinancing. The Banking Committee understood that Ex-Im Bank has the \nauthority to match market windows financing that is consistent with the \nterms of the OECD Arrangement.\n\n  In addition, the Banking Committee held the view that increased \ninformation was needed on the activities of foreign market windows. As \na result, the bill specifies that the Bank's annual report to Congress \non export credit competition should include information on export \nfinancing available to foreign competitors through market windows.\n  The Banking Committee believed that it was very important to make \nclear that Eximbank has the authority to match market windows financing \nin order to allow U.S. exporters to compete on a level playing field, \nand to direct the executive branch to seek negotiations in the OECD for \nmultilateral disciplines and transparency for market windows financing.\n  The third issue is small business financing by the Eximbank. The \nBanking Committee has strongly supported the Ex-Im Bank's efforts to \nprovide financing for small business. The Ex-Im Bank Act currently \nrequires that ``the Bank shall make available, from the aggregate loan, \nguarantee, and insurance authority available to it, an amount to \nfinance exports directly by small business concerns which shall not be \nless than 10 percent of such authority for each fiscal year.''\n  The legislation increases the requirements to 18 percent. According \nto the Ex-Im Bank, in FY 2000 small business comprised 18 percent of \nthe total value of all Ex-Im Bank financing authorizations and 86 \npercent of all transactions supported by Ex-Im Bank. In FY 1999 these \nnumbers were 16 percent and 86 percent respectively. In FY 1998 they \nwere 21 percent and 85 percent respectively.\n  The Banking Committee believed that the requirement for Ex-Im Bank \nsmall business financing could reasonably be raised to a level of 18 \npercent without causing disruption to Ex-Im Bank's lending programs. \nEx-Im Bank remains free to go above this level, as it has in the past, \nbut the Committee was concerned the requiring a higher level could have \nthe unwanted effect of tying up available Ex-Im Bank resources if the \nEx-Im Bank could not achieve higher levels of small business financing \nin a given year.\n  The legislation makes a number of changes to Ex-Im Bank reporting \nrequirements to ensure more timely and complete reporting of the \nactivities of foreign export credit agencies.\n  The legislation requires the Ex-Im Bank to submit its annual \ncompetitiveness report to Congress not later than June 30 of each year. \nCurrently, the annual competitiveness report comes to Congress in late \nsummer/early autumn, too late to be used for any oversight or \nlegislation in any given year. Also, with the current submission date, \nthe Advisory Committee's annual recommendations, completed in December \neach year, are 8 to 9 months old. Finally, by moving the reporting date \nto June 30, the Ex-Im Bank will have ample time to include data on \nother export credit agencies, in light of the fact that the Berne Union \nreports on global export credit agency activity come in 45 days after \nthe close of each quarter.\n  As previously mentioned, the legislation also specifies that the \nBank's annual competitiveness report to Congress should include \ninformation on export financing available to foreign competitors \nthrough market windows. The legislation also requires the Ex-Im Bank to \nestimate the annual amount of export financing available from the \ngovernment and government-related agencies and include that information \nin Ex-Im's annual competitiveness report.\n  Finally, during the Banking Committee markup on the legislation, \nSenator Allard offered an amendment that would have established an \nInspector General for the Ex-Im Bank. Members of the Banking Committee \nagreed in principle that Ex-Im Bank could benefit from having an \nInspector General, but concerns were raised about how an Inspector \nGeneral provision should be structured. Senator Allard withdrew his \namendment with the understanding that an effort would be made to reach \nan agreement so that this issue could be addressed on the Senate floor. \nAn agreement has been reached on an amendment by Senator Allard, which \nhe will offer on the floor, to establish an Inspector General for the \nEximbank that is acceptable to the members of the Banking Committee.\n  I believe that S. 1372, the Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act, \nis a very balanced piece of legislation which will assure that the \nExport-Import Bank will be able to continue to provide critically \nneeded export financing to U.S. exporters to compete in foreign \nmarkets. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \ncharter reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. \nThe Ex-Im Bank was last reauthorized in 1997, and its charter expired \nin September of last year.\n  As Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance, I \nheld two hearings last year in order to craft a bipartisan \nreauthorization bill that is both helpful to the Bank and to the export \ncommunity. The present bill, which authorizes the Ex-Im Bank for 5 \nyears, includes a number of important provisions that will help make \nthe Bank more competitive with other export credit agencies.\n  Among other provisions, this bill requires Ex-Im to submit its \nCompetitiveness Report to the Banking Committee by June 30 of each \nyear. It will be more helpful to the Committee to receive that report \nearlier in order to be able to use its information during the \nreauthorization. The bill also requires Ex-Im to compile and analyze \ndata regarding market windows and their effects on the Bank's \ncompetitiveness for the annual Competitiveness Report. This will give \nthe Committee a clearer understanding of the amount of market window \nactivity taking place around the world. Finally, the bill requires the \nBank to estimate the annual amount of export financing available from \nthe government and government-related agencies and to include that \ninformation in Ex-Im's Competitiveness Report. This provision would \nessentially require Ex-Im to rank itself against other export credit \nagencies.\n  Although the Ex-Im Bank has played an important role in increasing \nour country's exports, there have been a few instances in which the \nBank has lent its support to exports that have helped foreign companies \nwho are engaged in dumping products into our domestic market. For this \nreason, I offered an amendment to Bank's reauthorization that would \nprohibit the extension of a loan or guarantee to any entity subject to \na countervailing or anti-dumping order. I will continue working with \nSenators Sarbanes, Dodd, Gramm, and Hagel to develop a compromise \nversion of my amendment that will improve the Ex-Im Bank's adverse \neconomic impact standards.\n  I understand that some people who favor a pure model of economics \nwould view the Export-Import Bank as essentially a subsidy that would \nbe unnecessary in the give and take of free markets and free economy. \nMy own view is that while that model has some merit in terms of \neconomic theory, we do not live in a theoretical world. We live in a \nreal world. America is currently suffering from a significant balance \nof\n\n[[Page S1956]]\n\ntrade deficit that will undoubtedly have an impact on our currency and \noverall economic health in years to come. It is essential that we work \nto provide a level playing field for American companies, particularly \nat a time when many of our foreign competitors receive financial \nsupport for their exports from their own governments. If our \ncompetitors offer their exporters assistance, so should we.\n  Since its creation in 1934, the Export Import Bank of America has \ncontributed greatly to the welfare and well-being of America's economy. \nI hope that we will allow the Bank to continue its function, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support reauthorization of this important \norganization.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand Senator Allard has an amendment \nat the desk. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be considered and \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table; that the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3029) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish an Inspector General at the Export-Import Bank \n                         of the United States)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 7.
