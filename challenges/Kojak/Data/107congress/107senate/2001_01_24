I don't think there is any question that the nominee, in \neffect, received a mandate from our committee.\n  It is interesting to note the thoroughness under which the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee conducted 2 days of hearings.

All the questions, of course, were not in on \nthat particular occasion.

I rise today to address the situation in California. I \nwant to make sure there is no misunderstanding. We all have a very \nlegitimate concern for the plight of California from the standpoint of \nthe energy crisis that is underway.\n  Yesterday the Secretary of Energy extended the order which requires \nthat outside providers of power provide power to the State of \nCalifornia for a period of about 2 weeks. This has serious consequences \nbecause there may be some in California who see this as relief, which \nit is, and believe that relief can continue without any significant \ncorrection internally within California.\n  I do not want to mislead anybody because I am convinced that the \nadministration, in issuing this order of 2 weeks, stands firm in its \nstatement that it will not extend that beyond 2 weeks, which means \nCalifornia is going to have to address a procedure to ensure that \npayment is made for electricity coming into that State.\n  I am concerned that the Federal Government has assumed a contingent \nliability by this order because it has ordered the generators to move \nthat power into California. It did not address how it was going to be \npaid for. So if the State of California can't pay for it, then there is \npotentially a cost to the Federal Government. By taking this step, the \nGovernment may well have picked up a liability, perhaps a contingent \nliability. Nevertheless, it is a reality.\n  This morning at the Energy and Natural Resources Committee business \nmeeting, after discussion with Senator Bingaman and other members, we \nagreed we would hold a hearing next week on the California situation. \nIt would bring in the surrounding States--Oregon, Washington, Idaho, \nperhaps Arizona and Nevada--that are kind of interconnected and \naffected.\n  We will talk about the Bonneville Power Administration and its role. \nWe will talk about Seattle City Light. And we will talk about short-\nterm and long-term contracts.\n  We are going to talk about take-or-pay contracts. We are going to \ntalk about the reservoirs at Bonneville's hydroelectric dams are at an \nall-time low, and prospects for adequate power in the Northwest this \nsummer when there is a heavy load for air conditioning. We are going to \ntalk about the situation of aluminum companies that are now reselling \ntheir Bonneville power. We will talk about a situation that came about \nas a consequence of the Forest Service's inability to provide sales to \nsome of the companies that were generating power from biomass that \nsuddenly find they have no biomass, so the powerplants are shut down.\n  It is a grave responsibility, and it has come out of a policy of \nignorance. When I say ignorance, I don't mean to belittle those who are \nresponsible for the direction of California's energy, but ignorance in \nthe sense that you cannot continue a growing economy, such as \nCalifornia has had--it is equivalent to the sixth largest economy in \nthe world--where you have increased demands for power without \nincreasing generation.\n  So California consumers face unprecedented problems, zooming electric \nrates, power shortages. We have two major investor owned utilities on \nthe brink of bankruptcy. Some have suggested they have been guilty of \nhaving price structures that are unrealistic. On the other hand, it is \nhard to believe that they would drive themselves into bankruptcy. I am \nsure that the Governor of California, Governor Davis, wants cheap rates \nin California. The question is, are some of those rates going to be \nunderwritten by taxpayers in other parts of the country? Again, we have \nto help California, but California has to help itself.\n  Now, in my view, the activities so far in California to correct this \nhave been kind of like shifting the deck chairs around on the Titanic--\nperhaps for a better view or a more comfortable position. But if they \ndon't take real corrective action, the ship is going to sink. The \nquestion is, what is it going to take with them? The stockholders and \nbondholders in Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California \nEdison--various teacher unions, and people throughout California who \nhave invested in what previously were the highest rated utilities in \nthe country--suddenly find themselves questioning whether those \ninvestments are going to be made good. For all practical purposes, one \ncorrective action may be, if indeed the utilities go into bankruptcy, \nis that a Federal bankruptcy judge will dictate the price that \nCalifornia consumers are going to have to pay. Now, that is hard ball, \nbut that is not too far away from happening. In my own opinion, to a \nlarge degree California's problems are self-created. They started out \nwith a program that they called deregulation, but really wasn't. It is \nkind of interesting to reflect on that because they called it the \nCalifornia competition program--a competition enacted by the State \nlegislature in 1996, and the implementation of that law really came \ninto effect January 1, 1998. What they did, they made a mandatory \nprogram for California's investor owned utilities, Pacific Gas & \nElectric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric. \nTwo-thirds of California consumers are served by these three utilities.\n  But the interesting thing is that California made it voluntary for \nits publicly owned utilities to join the State's competition program--\nbut none of them joined. So the law and the wisdom of the California \nlegislature said it is voluntary for the publicly owned utilities, but \nmandatory for the investor owned utilities.\n\n  I am not here to discuss the issue of equity. But the essence of \nCalifornia's competition program was to create a vigorous deregulated \nwholesale power market. And once there was a vigorous wholesale power \nmarket, it would create a deregulated retail power market. That sounds \ngood, but the problem is that it never happened on the retail side.\n  The key elements of the California program were, a rate freeze on the \nretail price of electricity to consumers until the year 2002, or until \nthe stranded costs were paid off. Those are costs associated with, say, \na nuclear plant that shut down, never paid for, and you have to pay for \nit in the rate structure.\n  Now, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the authority to \nregulate wholesale rates. They have seen fit not to put a hard cap on \nwholesale rates. They say it will harm competition. It is kind of \ninteresting to note that we have seen a bill introduced that would give \nthe authority of FERC to put caps on wholesale rates to the Secretary \nof Energy. My first reaction to that is you are taking the problem from \nan objective group that has some expertise in this area and moving it \ninto the political spectrum. I don't know what you really accomplish on \nthat. My first inclination is that that is not a solution to the \nproblem. That is simply transferring the problem into the political \nrealm.\n  Now, it is kind of interesting because under the California \ncompetition program investor owned utilities are required to purchase \nfrom the wholesale spot market all of the electricity they sell at \nretail to consumers. No long-term contracts. The investor owned \nutilities were not allowed to enter into electricity contracts to hedge \non electric prices. The investor owned utilities were directed to \ndivest their fossil fuel fired powered plants, but allowed\n\n[[Page S509]]\n\nto retain their nuclear and hydro facilities. So they did not sell \ntheir hydro and nuclear facilities. They were mandated to do this under \nthe California program. The investor owned utilities were directed to \ndivest the fossil fuel, but allowed to keep the nuclear and hydro.\n  But now some are suggesting that the State of California ought to \ntake over the hydro facilities and, in turn, accept the debt \nassociated, which is somewhere in the area of $11 billion to $12 \nbillion. What are you going to do then, have the state run those \nfacilities? Can the State do it better than the private sector? I don't \nknow. But it is another Band-Aid, in my estimation, that doesn't really \naddress the problem.\n  One, there is a credit problem in California because you can't pay \nfor the power and, B, there is a shortage of generation because the \ndemand has exceeded substantially the generating capacity. California \nrelied on that power company from outside the State, which is fine up \nto a point; but when the other States' prosperity and economy increases \nand their demand increases, they suddenly look to the old adage that \ncharity begins at home. They want to take care of the people around \nthem. As a consequence, to depend on outside power is very risky, just \nlike it is very dangerous for this Nation to depend so much on outside \noil. We are now 56 percent foreign-oil dependent in this country. By \nthe year 2004, we will be 64 percent dependent on foreign oil, \naccording to the Department of Energy. In 1973-74, we had an oil \nembargo. Some people are old enough to remember that. We had lines \naround the block at gas stations. People were outraged, that this \nshould not happen. Congress set up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We \nwere 36 percent dependent on imported foreign oil at that time. The \nparallel is, to what point, what percentage, do you want to be \ndependent on imported energy?\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed another 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I also ask unanimous consent that when morning \nbusiness is due to expire at 11 a.m., it be extended until 11:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I appreciate my colleague from Maine accommodating me.\n  As I indicated, it is a credit problem. It is also a supply problem.\n  It is kind of interesting to see what is happening. People are \nrushing out in California to buy generators to generate their own \npower. I don't blame them. What does that do to air quality? There is \nno clean air restriction on that kind of generation, unlike utility-\nowned generation. We are seeing a situation where there is a threat of \nbankruptcy. You have the threat of bankruptcy just in determining what \nthe rates are going to be in California. You have convoluted non-\nworkable deregulation in California. The question is: What is \nCalifornia going to do to correct the situation? Action that is overdue \nbecause this 2-week order has some significant ramifications which are \ngoing to end.\n  I think there are high hopes that California will have addressed the \nproblem before the end of the two week period.\n  Now we can point fingers. This is not a partisan issue, it is a \nbipartisan issue. The question is, How can we put an end to the \nproblem? I think we all learned in Economics 101 that when demand \nexceeds supply, you get shortages and price increases.\n  The answer to why California doesn't have enough generation is fairly \nsimple. They have gone out of their way to discourage construction of \nnew powerplants. The permitting of new powerplants has taken forever. \nThey have a severe case of ``not in my backyard'' when it comes to new \nelectric powerplants and transmission lines.\n  Remember last summer when Pacific Gas & Electric tried to bring \nbarge-mounted generators into San Francisco--but environmentalists \nobjected?\n  And right now a major consumer of electricity in California--the \nhigh-tech firm called Cisco--is fighting the construction of a new \npowerplant nearby its office building near San Jose.\n  For some time now, California has relied on out-of-State generation \nto meet its growing needs.\n  As I have said, they did not have to build any new powerplants in the \nState.\n  According to the California Public Utility Commission, between 1996 \nand 1999, only 672 megawatts of new generation were added to \nCalifornia's system.\n  But during the same period peak demand increased 5,500 megawatts--\nmore than 7 times as much.\n  You can see this happening. California should have reacted. But the \npolitical realities obviously dictated to a large degree the lack of \naction, because if had they reacted they would have passed these \nincreases, from the standpoint of the purchase price of the generation, \non to the California consumer--the taxpayer. There is a political \nfallout associated with that.\n  Today California's powerplants within the State are capable of \nsatisfying only three-quarters of the State's hot day peak demand. The \nremaining one-quarter of California's electricity must be imported from \noutside the State. That is a very dangerous situation. As they say, the \nchickens have finally come home to roost, and California's situation is \nnot going to get better anytime soon.\n  If California's electrical demand grows at only 5 percent annually, \nas some have projected, California will have to add three 1,000-\nmegawatt powerplants every single year just to stay even--the \nequivalent of two Diablo Canyon nuclear plants every 6 years. But \naccording to the California Energy Commission, no major powerplants \nhave been built in California for more than a decade and very little is \nnow under construction.\n  What is the solution? Is it more regulation? Should we try to turn \nback the clock? The answer is clearly no. Experience has proven that \ngovernment regulation cannot stop the forces of supply and demand. To \nhave reasonably priced electricity, you have to have more generation, \nyou have to have transmission. The State will probably have to provide \neminent domain for transmission lines, and we must free the market from \nunnecessary Federal interference.\n  Consumers in the State of California, this administration, and the \nFERC must provide the necessary incentives for new generation and \ntransmission to be built. Consumers in the State of California, FERC, \nthis administration, and Congress must help. We must all be part of the \nsolution. And, hopefully, from our hearing in the Energy Committee next \nweek we will begin to get some of the answers and recommendations.\n  Consumers in California are going to have to shed their ``not in my \nbackyard'' mentality. If consumers want power, new powerplants have to \nbe built somewhere. The power isn't going to appear magically. New \ntransmission lines have to be built. It is unfair for California to ask \npeople in other States to build powerplants necessarily to satisfy \nCalifornia's demand.\n  Consumers are also going to have to pay for the power they need. \nSomebody has to pay for it. We are going to have to do a better job \nencouraging conservation. But there has to be, if you will, some kind \nof a carrot and stick. If the consumers are encouraged to conserve and \nbuy a new refrigerator that uses less energy, they have to be motivated \nto do that because of the increased costs to the consumer. It has to be \nmade worth his or her while, whether it be an air-conditioning unit or \nsome other item.\n  The government of California is going to have to take leadership in \nbuilding new generation of transmission facilities, expediting permits, \nand so forth. They need to expedite those permits and the siting so \nthat the power will be there when it is needed.\n  In California, for example, 67 percent of the electric powerplants \nare more than 20 years old, and 37 percent are more than 40 years old.\n  California must also allow consumer prices to rise to reflect the \ncost of the power they are consuming. I think California must also \nallow consumer prices to rise to reflect the costs of the power they \nare consuming.\n  FERC must provide the necessary incentives for new generation and \ntransmission to be built and act more quickly than they have under the \nprevious administration. They have to make decisions to get the facts, \nand to protect\n\n[[Page S510]]\n\nthe public. But you have to make the decision.\n  This administration must support new generation of transmission and \nmake sure that existing generation continues and is not prematurely \nshut down.\n  There are impediments to competition. For example, it is high time \nthat PUHCA and PURPA are repealed. We need to find ways to allow \nconstruction of new transmission lines. We need to enact legislation to \nprotect the reliability of the grid.\n  Finally, the State of California made systematic decisions over a 10-\nyear period to not build new powerplants in California while at the \nsame time they watched their power consumption grow. The State made \nderegulation decisions that didn't remove regulations, it simply \nchanged the regulations, and now, in the face of mounting debt and \npossibly utility bankruptcy, the State refuses to allow rate increases \nto pay for expensive non-utility power.\n  While it would be unrealistic for the State of California to ask the \nrest of the Nation to pay for its power, notwithstanding the fact that \nCalifornia consumers enjoy--this is a fact--California consumers today \nenjoy some of the lowest monthly bills in the United States, California \nneeds to make a good-faith effort to accept responsibility in this \ncrisis. It needs to address its credit problems. It must not pursue \npolicies that appear to be intended to bankrupt utilities rather than \nsolve those problems. Then the Federal Government can look at its role \nin providing assistance. But it is not up to the Federal Government to \nbail out California from a series of bad decisions. And for the long \nterm, the State needs to be looking at building powerplants and \ntransmission facilities to meet its power needs. The situation in \nCalifornia demonstrates that our energy future is in our hands \ncollectively--the State of California first.\n  We can take the path of least resistance, as California did, and we \ncan suffer the consequences. Or we can take the actions necessary to \nensure our energy future--oil and natural gas as well as electricity.\n  That is why President Bush and we are seeking to revitalize our \nenergy industry and to formulate a long-term energy strategy that will \nensure that the United States has the energy we need to fuel our \neconomy.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator on \nthe floor, I think this would be an appropriate time to report on some \nforeign travel which I recently undertook for a 2-week period in late \nDecember and early January, accompanied on part of the trip by Senator \nVoinovich. Our trip took us to the Mideast, where we had the \nopportunity to confer with Egyptian President Mubarak, and then in \nIsrael, Prime Minister Barak, and Minister Ariel Sharon, who was \ncontesting for the post of Prime Minister in an election to be held in \nIsrael on February 6; and also former Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.\n  I then continued on to Aqaba in Jordan and had the opportunity to \nmeet with King Abdullah in Jordan.\n  We found the Mideast to be very tense, with the exacerbation of \nviolence inspired by Palestinian youth. The Palestinian Authority has \nnot observed their obligation under the Oslo accords to have an \neducational system which omits the traditional incitement to violence \nof youngsters. Their educational materials in the sixth grade, seventh \ngrade, ninth grade and beyond, urges the young people to engage in \nviolence--a holy jihad for the glory of Allah--encouraging acts which \nresult in their own deaths as martyrs. That has set into motion a \nsequence of events in the area where the violence has just been \nextraordinary.\n  I think we are really looking at a generational problem--perhaps more \nthan a generational problem--until there is some recognition that the \nIsraelis and Palestinians can live side by side under the terms of the \nOslo accords and the implementation, as may be worked out.\n  When we were there, and to this day, the atmosphere was heavy with \ndoubts as to whether a peace treaty could be reached.\n  I have complimented President Clinton privately and publicly, and I \ndo so again today, for the efforts he maintained right to the end of \nhis term in office. Now the new administration, I know, will pick up \nthis very difficult issue and will work as best they can to implement \nthe peace process and try to bring stability to that region.\n  Before traveling to Egypt and Israel, Senator Voinovich and I visited \nBelgrade in Yugoslavia and made a trip into Bosnia. We were enormously \nimpressed with the U.S. military presence in Bosnia, and U.S. soldiers \nhelping to maintain a very fragile peace in that area of the world.\n  In Yugoslavia, we met the new leaders, who are very impressive men \nwho are carrying forward.\n  The problem of former President Milosevic is a very big issue in \nYugoslavia. The new Yugoslav leaders say they want to try him in \nYugoslavia, as he has committed horrendous crimes against the people of \nYugoslavia--embezzlement which is estimated as high as $1 billion, and \nstealing the election on election fraud. But at the same time, there \nare competing demands from the War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague.\n  On my return trip, after Senator Voinovich had departed in Israel, I \nhad the chance to meet with the chief prosecutor of the International \nCriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Carla del Ponte, at The \nHague. She is insistent on bringing Milosevic to trial at The Hague.\n  Under the U.N. resolution, there is a priority status accorded to The \nHague to try Milosevic.\n  Perhaps these interests can be reconciled by trying Milosevic first \nin Yugoslavia, but before he serves a sentence if one is imposed, he \ngoes to The Hague for trial. Ms. del Ponte was concerned that there not \nbe a long interval because the War Crimes Tribunal is a temporary \ninstitution. There have been some suggestions that Milosevic be tried \nby the War Crimes Tribunal in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, but that remains to \nbe worked out.\n  One thing which must be accomplished, in my judgment, is that \nMilosevic must be tried and brought to justice. It is enormously \nimportant that a head of state be tried.\n  I note my distinguished colleague, Senator Grassley, has arrived on \nthe floor, so I will conclude these remarks with a comment or two on \nthe discussions which were held with the leaders in India and in \nPakistan where there has been a problem of nuclear confrontation and \nthe dispute in Kashmir. There were also discussions on the persecution \nof Christians, which is a very rampant problem.\n  Mr. President, on December 28, Senator Voinovich and I departed from \nAndrews Air Force Base and flew across the Atlantic landing late in the \nevening in Munich, Germany. Consul General Bob Boehme and Economic \nOfficer John McCaslin met us in Munich. The two shared with us their \nthoughts on a wide variety of subjects ranging from a potential U.S. \nmissile defense system to the current refugee situation in Germany. The \nnext morning we had a working breakfast with representatives of the \nGerman/American business community. Our discussions ranged form lack of \nan educated workforce in Germany resulting in the need for skilled \nimmigrants to staff many of their high-tech companies to harmonization \nof a European defense force with NATO to the ever-evolving situation in \nthe Balkans. After our breakfast we departed Munich and arrived in \nBelgrade, Yugoslavia on Friday December 29.\n  My first visit to Yugoslavia was in 1986, when I visited with then \nPresident Moisev. I was last in Belgrade in August 1998 in an attempt \nto visit then President Slobodan Milosevic to urge him to turn over \nindicted war criminals. Yugoslavia today is a country undergoing \ndramatic changes. Recently and most notably is the formation of a \ndemocratic form of government. The greatest political achievement of \nthe Serbian people was a peaceful democratic revolution. Public \nprotests usually happen before elections are held when the political \ntensions are at their\n\n[[Page S511]]\n\ngreatest. In Yugoslavia, the opposite happened. Mass protests were the \nonly way to guarantee that the popular will expressed at the polls was \nto be respected by former President Milosevic.\n  The transfer of power following the electoral victory has not been \nsimple, primarily because of Mr. Milosevic's attempts to falsify \nobvious electoral results. With widespread support from the citizens, \nthe Democratic Opposition of Serbia secured the recognition of the \nelectoral results and Dr. Kostunica was declared head of state on \nOctober 5, 2000. However, full legal transfer of power was not fully \naccomplished by this proclamation. President Kostunica has insisted on \na strict observance of the rule of law. The immediate challenge ahead \nfor President Kostunica and the Federal Government includes dealing in \na clear and transparent way with relations in the Yugoslav federation \nand, in Serbia, resolving the political and security issues related to \nKosovo. After my discussions with the various officials from the \nSerbian and Yugoslav Government, it was clear there is a strong desire \nfor Mr. Milosevic to be tried by the Serbian government and be held to \npay for what he has done to the Serbian people before they were willing \nto turn him over to the officials at The Hague.\n  We were met at the airport by U.S. Ambassador Bill Montgomery and \nproceeded to our first meeting with Mr. Vojislav Kostunica, President \nof the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Sen. Voinovich and I were the \nfirst Congressional leaders to meet with the newly elected President \nand we congratulated him on his monumental victory. President Kostunica \nproudly told us that after the recent December 23 elections, democratic \nparty candidates won 176 out of 250 seats in Parliament, Yugoslavia was \nnow ready to push forward with reform. Unfortunately, the new \ndemocratic Yugoslavia is now having to pay for ten years of corruption \nand mismanagement under the Milosevic regime. Basic public services and \nhealth care are lacking as well as energy production resulting in \nrolling blackouts in Belgrade during the time of our visit. Another \ninternal problem facing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a \npolitical problem--dealing with the integration of Serbia and \nMontenegro. President Djukanovic of Montenegro has declared that \nMontenegro should be a separate state loosely aligned with Yugoslavia \nwhile Mr. Zoran Djindjic of Serbia, expected to be Prime Minister, \ndesires a more traditional federal alliance with the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia.\n  During our discussion, I told President Kostunica that I thought \nSlobodan Milosevic should be turned over to the prosecutors at the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague \nfor prosecution. President Kostunica told me that while he agreed that \nSlobodan Milosevic should be held accountable, the Serbian people \nshould first be given the opportunity to prosecute Mr. Milosevic for \nhis many transgressions against them, such as stealing the September \nelections and stealing approximately $1 billion from the coffers of the \nYugoslav government. President Kostunica was quick to point out that he \nwelcomed the office of The Hague Tribunal, which had recently reopened \nin Belgrade, as the first step in the eventual investigation and \nprosecution of Mr. Milosevic and also other indicted war criminal who \nwere seeking safe harbor in Yugoslavia.\n  We then met with Professor Miroljub Labus, the Federal Deputy Prime \nMinister in charge of economic policy as well as Mr. Bozidar Djelic, \nthe Serbian Minister of Finance. Professor Labus as well as Minister \nDjelic, both were emphatic in their desire to bring pro market, \ntransparent transactions to the economy of both the federal republic of \nYugoslavia as well as Serbia. Two of the major moves the federal \ngovernment had undertaken that week was to cut defense spending in \norder to direct more money into infrastructure repairs which had been \nbadly neglected under the Milosevic regime and deregulate foreign trade \nin order to attract more overseas investment. Both felt that while the \nnew democratic government had a good deal of support of the people \nbehind them, they only had about 3 to 6 months to help get the \ngovernment on the right track since the people were expecting to demand \nresults soon.\n  We next met Mr. Zoran Djindic who won his election only 6 days prior \nto our arrival. He told us that while he had won the political battle, \nthe battle to undertake the reforms the people of Serbia demanded was \njust beginning. He said that for the past 50 years the government of \nSerbia had been a facade and that he intended to have a transparent, \nfunctioning democratic government. When we discussed Mr. Milosevic \nbeing tried at The Hague, he said Mr. Milosevic was merely a small time \ncriminal but had been in the position to have the opportunity to commit \nbig time crimes. He further said the will of the Serbian people was to \ntry Mr. Milosevic in the Serbian courts first. On the topic of \nMontenegro, he said that integration into the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia was imperative for the establishment of joint institution of \ngovernment so that Yugoslavia could begin to slowly move towards \ngaining membership into the EU.\n\n  On the morning of December 30, we met with His Holiness Paul, \nPatriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The elderly Patriarch was a \ndistinguished looking gentleman who served as a priest in Kosovo for 34 \nyears. The Patriarch felt that while the Serbians had done many things \nwrong during the recent conflicts, others did as well, and the \nunfortunate result was that many ancient churches and mosques were \nsenselessly and unnecessarily destroyed. The Patriarch stated that he \nfelt that the Church had assisted in highlighting moral issues during \nthe elections and the Church had always advocated peaceful solutions \nand a peaceful transfer of power.\n  After our meeting with the Patriarch we flew to Bosnia to meet \nsoldiers from the multinational peace keeping force in Tuzla. Major \nGeneral Sharp, Commander of the 3rd Infantry Division, headquartered in \nTuzla, Bosnia met us at the airport. General Sharp commands over 3900 \nAmerican soldiers, which help constitute a combined force of over 6700 \nsoldiers including those from Russia, Denmark, Poland, Estonia, \nFinland, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden and Turkey. We discussed his \nsoldier's mission, which was supporting implementation of the Dayton \nPeace Accords and maintaining force protection awareness in the region. \nWe discussed the problem of war criminals and he said that he knew of \nno indicted war criminals in his area of responsibility but that the \norders for his division were to detain and hold any of the personnel \nthat had been indicted for war crimes. We also discussed the increasing \nrole of the National Guard in the peacekeeping role in the Balkans and \nthe fact that Pennsylvania's 29th Infantry Division will be taking over \nthat critical peace keeping mission there in 2002.\n  We then flew by UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters from Tuzla to Camp Dobol \nto visit with some of the soldiers who are stationed there. During \nlunch we discussed many issues with the soldiers ranging from the need \nto continue to reform Tri-Care to the transferability of a soldiers GI \nbill to his family members. After having lunch we departed in Humvee's \nand went on a patrol through the towns of Flipovici and Katonovici with \nthe soldiers of the 3rd Infantry Division.\n  Upon returning from Tuzla late in the afternoon, we met with Yugoslav \nMinister of Justice Momcilo Grubac who told us that the new Yugoslav \nstate would be formed under the rule of law and the massive legal \nreform was just beginning. The Minister told us that they were working \non harmonizing existing Yugoslav law with EU law in order to comply \nwith international standards and to attract overseas investment and \nprovide legal and economic stability. When we discussed the trial of \nMr. Milosevic, the Minister of Justice felt strongly that Milosevic \nshould first be tried and held accountable in the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia before being turned over and tried in The Hague. The \nMinister of Justice said a new prosecutor for the City of Belgrade \nwould be responsible for trying Milosevic. The current DA was a \nholdover from a Milosevic government and until December parliamentary \nelections could not have been removed. The Minister anticipated that in \nlate January or early February the DA would be replaced with one that \nwould be able to prosecute Milosevic.\n\n[[Page S512]]\n\n  Later that evening we met with Professor Dragoljub Micunovic, the \nPresident of the Federal Parliaments Chamber of Citizens ``the \nRepublic's Upper Body'' and his colleagues. We met in the same \nParliament building that we all saw on CNN only a few months earlier \nbeing stormed by citizens demanding fair counting of the elected \nresults. These same citizens then were hanging out of windows waving \nthe Yugoslav flag after they were successful in forcing Mr. Milosevic \nto declare President Kostunica the rightful winner of the federal \nelections. The Parliamentarians told us that they felt they had laid a \nsuccessful groundwork for reform and that now it was time for them to \ndeliver. They, like all the other officials we talked to in Yugoslavia, \nfelt that Mr. Milosevic should be first tried in Yugoslavia. We were \ntold that they were sure that the prisons in Serbia were much less \ncomfortable that those in The Hague and thus Mr. Milosevic would face a \nmuch harsher sentence in Serbia. After serving his time in Serbia, they \nagreed it would be possible for him to go to The Hague to be tried.\n  On New Years Eve we departed Belgrade for Cairo, Egypt. In Cairo that \nevening, we met with Ambassador Daniel Kurtzer to discuss the status of \nthe negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. My first meeting \nwith Ambassador Kurtzer occurred on January 7, 1998, his second day in \nEgypt.\n  On New Years Day we visited with President Mubarak at Itihadiya \nPalace in Heiliopolis. As always, the President was gracious as he \nrearranged his busy schedule in order to meet with our delegation. \nPresident Mubarak and I discussed the negotiations between Chairman \nArafat, Prime Minister Barak and President Clinton. When we asked \nPresident Mubarak when the Egyptian Ambassador would be returned to \nIsrael, he said the withdrawal of his did not lessen diplomatic \ncontacts between Egypt and Israel and should not be construed as his \nlack of support for comprehensive peace between the Palestinians and \nthe Israelis.\n  President Mubarak said he felt that there was no pressure to conclude \ntalks because of President Clinton's departure or because of Prime \nMinister Barak's upcoming election. I asked President Mubarak if he \nwould be willing to participate at the negotiations in Washington. \nPresident Mubarak said that he did not feel that it would be helpful to \nnegotiate along-side Chairman Arafat, Prime Minister Barak and \nPresident Clinton as the issues really need to be resolved between \nBarak and Arafat on their own.\n  President Mubarak said that the younger leaders in the region--The \nKing of Jordan, the King of Morocco, and Crown-prince of Bahrain--were \nall bright stars on the horizon in the region and could be counted on \nto be supportive of the peace process.\n  We discussed the problem of persecution of religious minorities with \nPresident Mubarak. Egypt, a Muslim country, also has a large vocal \nChristian community which is comprised of Copts and Evangelicals. I had \npreviously discussed the plight of religious minorities with President \nMubarak in February of 1998, in January of 1999, and again in September \nof 1999. I was informed on my previous trips as well as back in \nWashington that both the Copts and other religious minorities faced \nwide-spread discrimination and persecution sometimes rising to the \nlevel of violence. President Mubarak assured Senator Voinovich and me \nthat the Egyptian government would not tolerate such activity. We \ndiscussed the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 with \nPresident Mubarak who downplayed the significance of the Act in Egypt. \nHe said there was no need for its application because his government \nwould not tolerate religious persecution and that any incidents that \ndid occur were undertaken on an isolated basis and investigated by the \ngovernment.\n  At mid morning on New Years day, we departed from Cairo and flew to \nTel Aviv. Upon reaching Jerusalem, we were briefed by Ambassador Martin \nIndyk and headed off to our first meeting at the Kennesset with former \nPrime Minister Shimon Peres. Former Prime Minister Peres was under the \nimpression that there was not sufficient time to conclude the \ncompressive negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis before \nthe upcoming elections in Israel on February 6 and the end of President \nClinton's term. In Prime Minister Peres' opinion, there was not enough \nfocus on the economic issues surrounding a comprehensive peace plan. \nThe former Prime Minister held the common opinion that the major \nstumbling blocks to the current negotiations were Jerusalem, the holy \nsites and the Palestinian claim to a right of return. He emphasized \nthat there could be no Israeli concession on the right of return \nwithout endangering the continuation of a ``Jewish state'' which was \nthe fundamental reason for the creation of Israel after the Holocaust.\n  Our next meeting was with Prime Minister Barak whose frustration with \nnegotiations was palpable. Barak stated that he had been very flexible \nin his negotiations with Arafat and that Arafat had taken no risks in \nthe positions he was articulating. He stated that the continuing \nviolence between the Palestinians and Israeli's lead to unrest in the \nregion and did not help the current peace with Egypt and Jordan. The \nPrime Minister reminded us that last year was the best year in the \nhistory of Israel for Israel's economy. Prime Minister Barak stated \nthat the only reason he had not already ended his negotiations with \nArafat was to give President Clinton, who had personally invested so \nmuch in the negotiations, one last chance to broker peace in the \nregion.\n  Our final meeting on New Years day was with Minister Ariel Sharon. \nMinister Sharon said that his much maligned visit to the Temple Mount \nserved only as an excuse for the Palestinians by which to mount \nviolence against the Israeli people. He stated that he had visited the \nTemple Mount a number of times in the past without incident. Minister \nSharon told us, if elected as Prime Minister on February 6, he would be \nwilling to immediately talk to Arafat about continued negotiations. \nMinister Sharon said he was astounded that Prime Minister Barak was \nwilling to ``give away'' Jerusalem and the holy sites without any \ndebate or discussion with the people of Israel.\n  He felt that the problems of Jerusalem, ensuring there are adequate \nsecurity zones inside Israel, and the return of refugees were the major \nstumbling blocks to peace. Minister Sharon said although he was a \nGeneral, he was committed to peace, not war. He recounted how he \nstarted as a young private in the Israeli Defense Force and rose to the \nlevel of General, fighting in every battle in the history of the State \nof Israel. He said that he had experienced all the horrors of war that \nhe had seen many of his friends killed and wounded and was in fact \ntwice wounded himself and therefore he understood, perhaps more than \nmost, the importance of peace. However, he said, negotiating peace for \nIsrael was almost as painful as war because peace means security for \nIsrael and it was something that he was not going to undertake lightly.\n  At the conclusion of that day after meeting with President Mubarak, \nPrime Minister Barak, former Prime Minister Peres and Minister Sharon, \nSenator Voinovich and I decided to send telefaxes to the leaders of \nJordan, Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Tunisia, as well as President \nMubarak, urging them to publicly express their support for President \nClinton's proposal. The letter stated:\n\n       We are advised that you think President Clinton's suggested \n     parameters for the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiation is a \n     reasonable proposal and should be accepted by both sides. If \n     that is true, we urge you to say so publicly to demonstrate \n     there is support in the Arab world to encourage Chairman \n     Arafat to give President Clinton an affirmative reply \n     promptly.\n\n  Later that evening I departed Tel Aviv and flew to Aqaba, Jordan. \nSenator Voinovich stayed in Israel and had a separate schedule for the \nbalance of his trip.\n  I met with King Abdullah in his summer palace on January 2. I had \npreviously met with the King's father for many years. King Abdullah \nsaid that he had found President Clinton's peace proposals to be very \nreasonable and that he had encouraged Chairman Arafat to use the \nproposal as a framework from which to build a comprehensive peace. The \nKing and I discussed whether or not he believed that Chairman Arafat \nhad control of the street violence and protest in Israel, and King \nAbdullah opined that he believed that at the outset of the Intifada, \nArafat\n\n[[Page S513]]\n\nhad more control but recently the influence of the Islamic Jihad and \nHamas were on the rise. I discussed with the King the possibility of \nother Arab countries using their influence to publicly persuade Arafat \nthat the Clinton peace proposal was something that should be seriously \nconsidered. King Abdullah stated that President Mubarak had by far the \nmost influence on Chairman Arafat. King Abdullah thought that he along \nwith the Crown Prince of Bahrain, President Ben-Ali of Tunisia, \nPresident Mubarak of Egypt, and King Mohamed of Morocco would consider \npublicly supporting the Clinton peace proposal.\n\n  Later that afternoon we departed for New Delhi. We arrived in New \nDelhi at 10:15 p.m. and Albert Thibault, the Deputy Chief of Mission \nand Paul Mailhot, First Secretary, met us at the airport. The following \nmorning we had a working breakfast meeting with members from the U.S. \nEmbassy. At the briefing, we discussed the current issues that were of \nconcern to India including the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty (CTBT), India-Pakistan relations, and the future of U.S.-India \nrelations under the Bush Administration. President Clinton visit in \nMarch of 2000 was the first Presidential visit since President Carter's \nvisit to India. The main focus of our discussions was the relationship \nbetween India and Pakistan.\n  My first meeting that morning was with Foreign Secretary Lalit \nMansingh. I congratulated Foreign Secretary Mansingh on his designation \nas the next Indian ambassador to the U.S. We spoke briefly about the \nelections in the U.S. and the Foreign Secretary asked me if I thought \nthat the election would result in some momentum for reform of our \nsystem of voting. I responded that reform was on the horizon but that \nthe electoral college would not be eliminated. On the issue of the \nCTBT, the Foreign Secretary expressed his sentiment that the U.S. \nshould not expect India to sign a Treaty that the U.S. itself perceives \nas flawed. He went on to state that the Indian neighborhood was getting \nmore dangerous and that India had no choice but to ``go nuclear'' to \nprotect itself against both China and Pakistan ``but we want to \nconvince you that India is a responsible country.'' I then posed the \nquestion to him of what his assessment was of the likelihood was that a \nnation, excepting those classified as so-called rogue nations, would \nlaunch an attack against another country. The foreign secretary \npromptly responded that unless there was an ``act of madness'', one \ndoes not anticipate nuclear attacks from democratic regime. India, he \nsaid, is producing thousands of graduates every year, whereas Pakistan \nis producing thousands of terrorists each year. He went onto expressed \nhis concern about the role of Pakistan in fostering religious fervor, \nwhich manifested themselves into acts of terrorism.\n  The Foreign Secretary stressed that India shared the United States \ncommitment to reducing nuclear weapons, but have not always agreed in \nhow to reach this common goal. The United States believes that India \nshould forego nuclear weapons. India believes that it needs to maintain \na credible minimum nuclear deterrent in keeping with its own assessment \nof its security needs. Nonetheless, he said, India would be prepared to \nwork with the U.S. to build upon the bilateral dialogue already \nunderway.\n  Next, I asked the Foreign Secretary the impact of the religious \npersecution legislation that was enacted in law in 1998. He responded \nthat the legislation had no impact because there is no real problem \nwith discrimination in India. When I asked him what steps the Indian \ngovernment had taken to protect minority communities and prosecute \noffenders, the Foreign Secretary responded that there had been isolated \nincidences in the remote tribal areas of Orissa and Gujarat and that \nthe Government had strongly condemned these murders. Prime Minister \nVajpayee had committed that reducing communal violence was one of the \nmain goals of his government and in that light he had spent last week \nin the state of Kerala focuses on the issue. He went onto note that \nmany religious minorities held seats in Parliament including Defense \nMinister George Fernandes.\n  That afternoon, Ambassador Celeste hosted a luncheon at his residence \nwith leaders from the business, civil, political and philanthropic \ncommunities. We discussed a wide range of issues ranging from brain \ndrain in India to the middle-east peace process.\n  My next meeting that afternoon was with the Leader of the Opposition \nin the Upper House of Parliament Dr. Manmohan Singh. Dr. Manmohan Singh \nwas also Finance Minister under former Prime Minister Narashima Rao and \nthe architect of India's economic reform program in the early 1990's. \nWe discussed topics ranging from the continued strengthening of U.S.-\nIndia ties under the Bush Administration to the perseverance of India's \neconomic liberalization. When Dr. Singh asked me about my general views \non South Asia, I told him that I believed that with a population of \nover 1 billion, one fifth of the world's population, India has a lot of \nunrealized potential. I told him that I applauded India's move from a \nsocialist economy to a free market economy and its achievements in \nscience and technology. He said that India is committed to economic \nexpansion and reform--especially in the emerging knowledge-based \nindustries and high-technology areas, and it is determined to bring the \nbenefits of economic growth to all its people.\n  My final meeting that evening was with K. Natwar Singh, who is the \nchief foreign policy advisor to Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi. \nMr. Singh also served as foreign minister under Prime Minister Rajiv \nGandhi, Sonia Gandhi's late husband. We met in the room that used to \nserve as the late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's office. Mr. Singh took \nme to the memorial, which marked the spot that on October 31, 1984, \nwhile walking to her office from her nearby residence, Indira Gandhi \nwas assassinated.\n  We discussed issues ranging from the middle east peace process to the \nbalance of power in the newly elect 50-50 Senate to India-Pakistan \nrelationship. Mr. Singh expressed the belief of his party that \nreestablishing a bilateral dialogue with Pakistan is critical if any \nprogress is to be made in the Kashmir region. I told him that following \nmy visit to the subcontinent in 1995, I wrote a letter to President \nClinton summarizing my meetings with then Prime Minister Rao and Prime \nMinister Bhutto and suggesting that it would be very productive for the \nUnited States initiate and broker discussions between India and \nPakistan regarding nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems.\n\n  When I raised the issue of persecution of religious minorities, he \nresponded that there is no state sponsored discrimination, but there \nhad been isolated case by case incidents. Mr. Singh expressed to me \nthat these were isolated incidents and that the government had strongly \ncondemned the attacks. He informed me that Prime Minister Vajpayee \npersonally was distressed over these attacks and had just returned from \nmeeting with a group of Christian Bishops in the state of Kerala.\n  The following day I attended a luncheon meeting with the \nConfederation of Indian Industry. Approximately 40 business leaders \nparticipated in a lively question and answer session where I responded \nto wide array of questions about from bipartisanship in the newly \nelected Senate, the U.S. economy, China PNTR and the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty.\n  I left the luncheon and arrived at the Mother Child Welfare Center in \nChanakyapuri, New Delhi. This Welfare Center also serves as the local \npolio immunization clinic. Launched in 1988, the global Polio \nEradication Initiative is spearheaded by the U.S. Center for Disease \nControl and Prevention, WHO, Rotary International, National Governments \nand UNICEF. The Governments of the United States, Denmark, Germany, \nItaly, Japan, UK, the European Commission, Bill & Melinda Gates \nFoundation, and the UN Foundation and the World Bank have all been \nsupporting the effort to eradicate polio in India by 2002. This would \nbe only the second disease to be eradicated after small pox. Here, I \nhad the opportunity to hold and administer the polio vaccine drops to \nthe infants at the clinic.\n  Later that afternoon, I met with Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh. We \ndiscussed India signing the CTBT, FMCT--Fissile Material Production \nTreaty which would end the production of nuclear materials--India's \nnuclear\n\n[[Page S514]]\n\nweapons program, Kashmir, the problems in Afghanistan with the Taliban. \nHe told me that India was committed towards any hostility in the region \nand that the CTBT was a meaningless Treaty in their eyes because they \nhave already taken on a voluntary moratorium. He went on to stress that \nIndia recently signed a treaty with Pakistan that recently no \naggressive use of nuclear weapons.\n  The next morning we departed for Udaipur. That afternoon I met with \nProfessor P.C. Bordia, an expert on India's licit opium production \nprogram. India is the world's largest source of opium for \npharmaceutical use. However, located between Afghanistan and Burma, the \ntwo main world sources of illicitly grown opium, India is a transit \npoint for heroin. Opium is produced legally in India under strict \nlicensing and control, and the Government of India tries to extract \nevery gram from the cultivators. The United States and India signed an \nagreement in June 2000 to jointly survey and study samples of licit \nopium poppy crop. Professor Bordia explained to me the methodology of \nthe three year study. This collaborative DEA funded project seeks to \nproduce reliable data on the yields of opium gum from India's poppy \ncultivation, which would help the Government of India to maintain tight \ncontrol over its licit poppy production to prevent diversion and ensure \nan adequate supply to meet the international medical and scientific \nneeds. The project is scheduled to begin in mid-January 2001 with the \nvisit of two U.S. scientists, Drs. Basil and Mary Acock.\n  Later that afternoon, my staff toured the Udaipur Solar Observatory \nGONG project--Global Oscillation Network Group--which has been funded \nby the National Science Foundation for the last nine years. The GONG \nproject is an international project conducting a detailed study of the \ninternal structure and motions of the Sun using helioseismology. The \nU.S. National Observatory developed GONG stations in six stations all \nover the world. These are in Hawaii, California, Chile, Canary Island, \nIndia and Australia, and the National Solar Observatory in Tucson, \nArizona. Dr. Arvind Bhatnagar and Dr. S.C. Tripathy explained that this \nproject enables surveillance of the Sun 24 hours a day. My staff saw \nfirst hand the working of the sophisticated $1.5 million state of the \nart telescope that has been installed in Udaipur under this project. \nThis telescope monitors the Sun automatically, and takes digital \nvelocity images of the sun every minute. This data is then combined \nwith the data from the other five sites at the central facility located \nin Tucson. Dr. Bhatnagar explained to my staff with tremendous \nenthusiasm that the GONG project promises to unravel several \nfundamental problems of solar interior and general astrophysics.\n  On Sunday, January 7, prior to departing for Islamabad from New \nDelhi, I met with the Station Chief and agents in-charge of the FBI and \nDEA in New Delhi.\n  That same morning I also met with Dr. John Fitzsimmons and Dr. Gary \nHlady to discuss the National Polio Surveillance Project and to see \nwhat might be done to expand that program to cover other illnesses such \nas measles, rubella, tetanus etc. They told me that polio eradication \nwithin Asia was within reach by the year 2002 and that measles was on \nthe horizon. We also discussed ways in which Congress could assist the \nCDC and NIH to develop programs targeted at eradicating these diseases.\n  It was apparent by comments in both India and Pakistan that the \nSenate's 1999 vote against ratifying the CTBT was closely watched and \nthat the vote diluted our power to persuade nations like India and \nPakistan to support the CTBT. In my discussions with officials, it \nbecame evident that securing compliance with the CTBT by these two \nnations without U.S. ratification would be problematic.\n  We departed New Delhi on the morning of January 7 traveled to \nIslamabad, Pakistan. I last visited Pakistan in 1995 meeting with then \nPrime Minister Benezir Bhutto who is now living abroad in exile and \nfacing corruption charges in Pakistan. Upon our arrival, the Charge, \nMichele Sison, met me at the airport and we departed for our first \nmeeting. General Musharraf, the Chief Executive and current political \nleader of Pakistan as well as the foreign minister, were out of the \ncountry on foreign travel.\n  Our first meeting was with the Foreign Secretary, Inam ul-Haq. \nSecretary Ul-Haq is Pakistan's highest-ranking career diplomat having \npreviously been posted as Pakistan's Ambassador to the United Nations \nand as Pakistan's Ambassador to China. Our meeting began with a \ndiscussion of Pakistan's nuclear tests and the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty (CTBT). The Foreign Secretary told me that General Musharraf and \nthe current government was in favor of ratification of the CTBT. \nHowever, I was told that there was a very vocal group in Pakistan which \nwas opposed to Pakistan's ratification of the Treaty and that the \nForeign Minister was personally working on persuading opponents of the \nTreaty and its benefits. The foreign secretary informed me that the \nPakistani government closely followed the limited debate and vote in \nthe U.S. Senate regarding the CTBT and that ratification by the U.S. \nwould be very helpful in Pakistan's internal debate on the issue.\n  I next discussed the procedure by which General Musharraf came to be \nthe current political leader of Pakistan. I was told that after the \nGeneral's ouster of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and ascension to power, \na lawsuit was filed against the General in the Supreme Court \nchallenging the legitimacy of his actions. When I asked if the outcome \nof that suit was predetermined, the foreign secretary informed me that \nthere was a similar situation when a previous General had ousted a \nprevious Prime Minister and a lawsuit was filed challenging the \nlegitimacy of the action. The Supreme Court in that case found the \nGeneral's actions to be unjustified and returned the Prime Minister to \npower. I told the Foreign Secretary of the great concern in the United \nStates Congress regarding the return of democracy to Pakistan and that \nI was hopeful General Musharraf would honor the October 2002 Supreme \nCourt deadline for restoring democracy.\n  Our discussion then turned to Kashmir and the ongoing conflict there. \nThe Foreign Secretary stated that his government was pleased with the \neasing of tensions and was hopeful, but not optimistic, that the Indian \ngovernment would engage in dialogue regarding Kashmir.\n  I asked the Foreign Secretary what could or should be done with the \nTaliban and Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan. The Foreign Secretary told \nme that Undersecretary of State Pickering had conducted meetings with \nofficials from the Taliban and that they were very grateful for the \nsupport of the U.S. provided during their war with the former Soviet \nUnion. The Foreign Secretary felt that the U.S. should continue to \nprovide humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and that perhaps through \ndialogue with the Taliban some solution regarding Osama Bin Laden could \nbe reached. The Foreign Secretary thought that more sanctions would do \nmore harm than good. The Foreign Secretary told me that Pakistan \nsuffered from more terrorist attacks than any other country and that \ncombating terrorism in Afghanistan worked to Pakistan's benefit as \nwell.\n  Finally, we discussed the situation facing religious minorities in \nPakistan. Pakistan is a predominately Muslim country with roughly 90 \npercent of its population belonging to that religion. The remaining \nreligious minorities are roughly 3 percent Hindu, 6 percent Christian \nand 1 percent Sikh. The major problem facing non-Muslims in Pakistan is \nthe blasphemy law, which allows for the death of anyone who blasphemes \nthe Prophet Mohammed. I was told that the interpretation of the law is \nvery liberal and mere attendance of mass by Catholics is a sufficient \nbasis on which to charge someone for the crime. I urged the Foreign \nSecretary to have his government repeal this law and play a more active \nrole in the protection of religious minorities.\n  After my meeting with the foreign secretary, we attended a working \nreception at the Charge's home in Islamabad. The attendee's at the \nreception were leaders from the Government, the Academy, various NGOs, \nreligious and American communities. During the course of the evening, \nwe engaged in spirited debate on topics such as the CTBT, missile \ndefense, religious tolerance and the importance of democracy.\n\n[[Page S515]]\n\n  The next morning I had the opportunity to sit down with Mr. Shahbaz \nBhatti, Founder and President of the Christian Liberation Front of \nPakistan whom I had met in Philadelphia earlier this year. His group is \nan umbrella organization whose self described mission is the \n``liberation of the oppressed from social subjugation, economic \ndeprivation, religious discrimination, religious intolerance and \nexpression.'' Mr. Bhatti and I discussed Pakistan's blasphemy law, \nwhich he told me is broadly interpreted, and states that anyone who \nblasphemes the Prophet Mohammed is to be sentenced to death. Mr. Bhatti \ntold me that there were many individuals currently being detained in \nPakistani jails under the law and he provided me with a list of names. \nI asked Mr. Bhatti if he thought that the religious persecution act the \nCongress had passed had any effect on his situation in Pakistan.\n  He told me that he thought the Act was a useful instrument for the \nenhancement of interfaith harmony and religious tolerance, not only in \nPakistan, but also all over the world. Mr. Bhatti told me that he felt \nthat the U.S. State Department needed to be more focused on persecution \nin Pakistan in the coming year. Mr. Bhatti said that while he had met \nwith the U.S. Ambassador when he had visited Pakistan and that he had \nmet with the Ambassador again in Washington, he felt that Pakistan \nshould be elevated to a country of special concern in the State \nDepartment's annual report. Mr. Bhatti felt that Islamic militants \ninside Pakistan were pressuring the government to be even less tolerant \nof religious minorities. Mr. Bhatti told me that he had received \ntelephonic threats at his home and that vandals had done property \ndamage to his office. He told me that he had a meeting with General \nMusharraf to discuss religious tolerance and while the General seemed \nto be genuinely concerned about the plight of the religious minorities, \nhe told Mr. Bhatti that he had to deal with a constituency, which did \nnot share his tolerant views.\n\n  After my discussion with Mr. Bhatti I called the Foreign Secretary to \ndiscuss the plight of the religious minorities and the detention of \ncertain individuals under the blasphemy law. The Foreign Secretary told \nme that he would look into the matter and I told him I would send him a \nlist of those imprisoned because of their religion which Mr. Bhatti \nprovided me.\n  We departed Islamabad and arrived into Istanbul on the night of \nJanuary 8. The next morning we had a working breakfast with the \nAmbassador, his wife, Station Chief and the regional head of the DEA. \nOur discussions at breakfast covered a wide range of issues from \nresolution of Turkey's long-standing conflict with Cyprus, Syrian-\nTurkish relations, Turkey's entry into the European Union, and the \nstrong political and military ties between Turkey and the United \nStates.\n  After departing Istanbul, we traveled to Mons, Belgium to meet with \nGeneral Ralston, the Supreme Allied Commander of all NATO forces in \nEurope. General Ralston and I discussed the United State's proposed \nNational Missile Defense System and the views our European allies had \nof that plan. General Ralston told me that he felt that the European's \nfelt vulnerable to strategic missile attack under the U.S. plan which \njust proposed to protect the United States. We discussed the stand-\nalone European Defense force in addition to NATO. General Ralston had \nhigh praise NATO's new members, Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary and \nin fact was headed to the Czech Republic that afternoon.\n  General Ralston told me that his forces were ready, willing and able \nto assist the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia \n(ICTY) in effectuating the arrest and return to The Hague of persons \nindicted for war crimes as soon as his political leadership instructed \nhim to do so.\n  After our meeting with General Ralston, we traveled to The Hague to \nmeet with the Chief Prosecutor of the ICTY, Carla del Ponte, and some \nof her staff. She expressed her strong sentiment to me that Slobodan \nMilosevic must be returned to The Hague for trial at the ICTY before \nstanding trial in Belgrade. Madam del Ponte felt very strongly about \nMilosevic being brought to trial in Belgrade for a number of reasons. \nFirst of all, she said, the ICTY had a clear mandate and enjoyed \nprimacy over domestic courts--this was a Security Council mandate. \nSecondly, she expressed her fear that the Milosevic regime would still \nretain some power--even behind the scenes--for a long time; Further, \nshe stressed that The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must first \nestablish its credibility before it takes on the daunting task of \njudging a former President. She said that the whole basis of the ICTY \nwas to tackle those difficult, painful cases for which domestic courts \nare ill-equipped. I told the Chief Prosecutor that I shared her desire \nto have Mr. Milosevic prosecuted at The Hague but was doubtful that Mr. \nMilosevic would be turned over to The Hague after my recent meeting in \nBelgrade.\n  The Chief Prosecutor and I also discussed the ongoing negotiations to \nestablish an International Criminal Court and the concerns surrounding \nsuch a body. I told her that there were concerns in the United States \nCongress regarding the vulnerability of U.S. servicemen of being \nsubjected to charges that are purely politically motivated and had no \nbasis in fact. We discussed her consideration of requests by Russia and \nYugoslavia under Milosevic to charge NATO officials with war crimes. \nMadam del Ponte told me that as a prosecutor she had no discretion in \nthe matter and that, as a matter of course, she had to investigate the \ncharges which she eventually deemed to be without merit.\n  I asked Madam del Ponte if the ICTY needed any additional resources. \nShe told me that resources continued to be tight--stressing that there \nwas a great deal of work to do collecting evidence of the war crimes \nand that additional resources would be beneficial.\n  My next meeting was with ICTY Judge Patricia Wald who resigned from \nthe federal judiciary to serve at The Hague. We discussed the \nfunctioning and legal rules of the ICTY. Judge Wald informed me that \nthe ICTY bench consists of members from the U.S., England, France, \nAustralia, Portugal, Italy, China, Vienna, Malaysia, Zambia, Colombia, \nJamaica and Egypt.\n  My meetings with Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte and Judge Pat Wald, \nfollowing on my earlier meetings in Belgrade, supported my notion that \nbringing Milosevic to justice at The Hague rather than in Yugoslavia \nwould prove to be complicated. The new Yugoslavian democratic \ngovernment's persistence on trying Milosevic in Serbia and the ICTY's \ninsistence that it had primacy over Milosevic established the \ncomplexity of the issue. The concept on an International Criminal Court \narose because of the failure of national courts to bring individuals \nlike Milosevic to trial. On one hand, to permit Yugoslavia to try \nMilosevic, at least first, would encourage national courts to deal with \nsuch issues. On the other hand, Madam del Ponte's adamance that the \nICTY had primacy granted under U.N. Resolutions and should not have to \nnegotiate. She further expressed her concern that Yugoslavia could not \nbe trusted to prosecute Milosevic due to problems of witness \nintimidation and the Milosevic regime still retaining influence in the \nJustice system. It is a difficult problem with no easy solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/24/senate-section/article/S515-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session and resume consideration of the nomination of \nTommy G. Thompson, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Tommy G. Thompson, of \nWisconsin, to be Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes each under the control of the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley; \nthe Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus;\n\n[[Page S516]]\n\nand the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, I, as I did yesterday, urge my colleagues to vote to \nconfirm President Bush's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, the outstanding Governor of the State of Wisconsin, Tommy \nThompson.\n  Statements made during yesterday's session by Senators from both \nsides of the aisle made it apparent that the qualities that have made \nGovernor Thompson so successful in Wisconsin also make him an ideal \nchoice to lead this very all-encompassing Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  Governor Thompson is a problem solver. He is an innovator and really \nis a leader with a record of success, particularly during the 14 years \nhe has served as Governor of the State of Wisconsin.\n  His record as Governor of the State of Wisconsin should show \neverybody that he is a person committed to improving the lives of real \npeople. The impressive results he has brought about in his great State \nshould inspire all of us. In fact, his success in welfare reform there \ninspired Congress to pass the Welfare Reform Act of 1996. He was, even \nwhile Governor, an advisor to many Members of the Congress who felt we \nought to move people from welfare to work, move people from the fringe \nof our economic society to the center, to the mainstream of that \nsociety so they can benefit, as others do, from the dynamics of our \neconomy.\n  Most Wisconsinites--94 percent--have health insurance because of his \nleadership. The disabled and elderly persons needing long-term care \nhave a state-of-the-art support system to turn to, thanks to Governor \nThompson's leadership.\n  Programs such as Pathways to Independence and Family Care are \nefficient and effective and are part of a reliable safety net program. \nThey call the program he instituted in Wisconsin the Wisconsin Works \nWelfare Reform Program. It has helped the State reduce its welfare \ncaseload by nearly 95 percent. Think of that: reducing the welfare \ncaseload by 95 percent. This is good for government, but, most \nimportant, we do not have welfare reform to help government; we have \nwelfare reform to help people.\n\n  The program that has been before the country for the last 4 years is \nnot doing everything we want it to do. It is not good to have people on \nthe fringe of our society, people who know no other life than a public \ncheck coming from the welfare office. That is not a humane way to treat \npeople. It is humane in our society to help people who cannot help \nthemselves, but for those people who can help themselves--and people \ngenerally, if given the incentive, do want to help themselves--we have \nthe responsibility to move them from the edge of society into the \nmainstream of society. That is exactly what happened in Wisconsin.\n  More specifically, there was a program in place in Wisconsin before \nwe adopted ours in Washington, DC, for the entire nation, and that \nprogram reduced the caseload by 95 percent.\n  Governor Thompson's record in Wisconsin is, indeed, impressive, and \nwe are prepared, I believe, to confirm his nomination. He will bring a \nwealth of knowledge, a very positive outlook, and an innovative style \nto the national debate on welfare reform and to Medicare improvements, \nincluding prescription drugs.\n  Governor Thompson made it clear during his nomination hearings that \nhe welcomes the opportunity to work with any Member, Republican or \nDemocrat, who has a special interest or special concern. One only needs \nto listen to the glowing recommendations from the distinguished \nSenators from Wisconsin, both Democrats, to be assured of his \ncommitment to bipartisanship. Such bipartisanship, if anything is going \nto get done, is dictated by the makeup of the Senate and the closeness \nof the Presidential election.\n  More importantly, it is the way that Governor Thompson has worked in \nWisconsin. Obviously, it is the way he is going to work with us.\n  I look forward to his collaborative approach to getting the job done \nand urge my colleagues to join me in approving this nomination.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time. Just in case \nthere is an interest in speeding this nomination along, I am prepared \nto yield back any time I have left.\n  Before I sit down, Mr. President, I have this request from the \nleader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/24/senate-section/article/S516-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--NOMINATION OF NORMAN MINETA\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nsupport of the nomination of Governor Tommy Thompson to be Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. Governor Thompson brings an extraordinary \nrecord to Washington, DC, and he has accomplished a great deal as \nGovernor of the State of Wisconsin.\n  He began his political life in the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1966. \nHe was elected to an unprecedented third term in Wisconsin, and then he \nbroke his own record by being elected to a fourth term--of course again \nunprecedented. He has had remarkable accomplishments in the field of \neducation, and tax cuts, where the tax rolls in Wisconsin have been \nvery substantially reduced, in crime control, and perhaps his greatest \nachievement has been in welfare reform in Wisconsin. While Governor, \nWisconsin got more waivers from the Department of Health and Human \nServices than any other State. Now it will be interesting to see how, \nin his capacity as Secretary of the Department, he will function to \ncreate policies in a climate where the Federal Government can \narticulate and implement policies which will not require States to seek \nwaivers, as he was so successful at doing.\n  His reform of the welfare system in Wisconsin has received national \nacclaim. He initiated the program called ``Learnfare.'' He was able to \nchange the approach in Wisconsin to have work instead of welfare--all \nenormous accomplishments.\n  When I looked at the record of Governor Thompson, candidly, I \nwondered why he did not run for President with those accomplishments \nbehind him. I know some consideration had been given by Governor \nThompson to that. It is an onerous road, considering all the \ndifficulties. Perhaps foremost was the formidable candidacy of Gov. \nGeorge Bush of Texas, who is now our President. So we have done very \nwell indeed on the Presidency, and on the designation of Secretary \nThompson for Health and Human Services.\n  He will be facing some very difficult problems. One of the problems \nhe will be facing is the controversial issue of stem cells, where I and \nothers have introduced legislation to remove the ban on Federal funding \nfor the extraction of stem cells from embryos. This has been a \ncontroversial matter because I think it is really not understood that \nthe embryos from which the stem cells are extracted are to be \ndiscarded. They had been created for in vitro fertilization and are not \nto be used. So, instead\n\n[[Page S517]]\n\nof discarding them, it seems most appropriate to use them to save \nlives.\n  The stem cells are a veritable Fountain of Youth, with stem cells \nalready having been very useful in efforts to cure Parkinson's and \nspinal cord injuries. There is great promise for stem cells on \nAlzheimer's, perhaps in heart ailments to replace cells in the \ncirculatory system and in the heart, and perhaps even on cancer. That \nis an issue which Senator Lott, our distinguished majority leader, has \npromised listing on a free-standing bill.\n  Governor Thompson will also be a key player in implementing the \ndistribution of organ transplants. We will, perhaps, call on him to \nimplement a system which has been put into effect that he personally \ndisagreed with as Governor of Wisconsin but now, as a national \nofficeholder looking after the interests of 50 States, there is \nobviously going to be a different perspective.\n  In Wisconsin, there had been great success in encouraging people to \ndonate organs so there was an abundance of organs. Perhaps those \ntechniques can be implemented by the new Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to create a national response, to have more organs donated so \nwe need not have the controversy we have on the distribution of organs. \nAs the chairman, for the past two Congresses, of the subcommittee on \nLabor, Health, Human Services and Education, I have had the role of \nworking on the legislation of organ transplants, which we finally have \nworked out. It is my hope we will retain the policy which we have in \neffect.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nGovernor Tommy G. Thompson, the nominee for Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  I am extremely pleased with President Bush's choice to be the next \nSecretary of Health and Human Services because I believe Governor \nThompson's extensive background will bring a fresh approach to an \nagency that has a history of underachievement.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, has \nfar too often operated with a Washington knows best mentality, instead \nof taking into account what a state or local community might actually \nneed.\n  As a former Governor, Secretary Thompson, will bring an invaluable \nwealth of experience to HHS and more importantly the practical \nexperience of having confronted and addressed the unique problems and \nneeds that arise at the local level.\n  Governor Thompson has gained a reputation for his innovative \napproaches to implementing Welfare and Medicaid reform during his \ntenure as the Governor of Wisconsin. Moreover, during that time he \ndealt with the Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, on a regular \nbasis and I believe that experience will serve him well, as he also \nknows first hand the frustrations shared by many Members of Congress in \ndealing with HCFA.\n  While Governor, he completely overhauled Wisconsin's Welfare system \nand reduced welfare rolls by 93 percent and additionally, he attempted \nto provide individuals with the tools to succeed by increasing \nsubsidies for child care, health insurance, and job training.\n  Governor Thompson also created Wisconsin's State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, SCHIP, ``BadgerCare'' and eighteen months ago the \nprogram became the first state in the nation to offer health coverage \nto the parents of eligible children.\n  I also believe that New Mexico stands to benefit from the leadership \nof Secretary Thompson. For instance, HCFA has previously denied several \nwaiver requests by the New Mexico Department of Human Services to \nobtain greater flexibility regarding the use of unspent SCHIP funds and \nI am hopeful Secretary Thompson will review any similar request \nsubmitted by New Mexico.\n  I am also looking forward to working with Secretary Thompson on the \nissue of Medicare reimbursement disparity between states like New \nMexico and the remainder of the country. Just last year Congress took a \nfirst step to address the issue by passing the ``Medicare Geographic \nFair Payment Act of 2000.'' Specifically, the law raises the \nreimbursement rates for historically underpaid areas under the \nMedicare+Choice program.\n  In closing, I think we all begin the 107th Congress with unlimited \nopportunities to improve our nation's health through a prescription \ndrug benefit for Medicare, Medicare reform, and a continued commitment \nto medical research.\n  I believe there is a lot of agreement on the need to emphasize these \nissues and I look forward to working with Secretary Thompson to address \nthese important issues for not only New Mexico, but our country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, few appointees in the Cabinet are more \nimportant than the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The agency's \n63,000 dedicated employees serve America well. With its budget of $427 \nbillion, if it were a country, HHS would have a GNP larger than all but \n14 of the nations in the world.\n  But the vast importance of the Department cannot be measured by \nnumbers of employees or dollars of spending. As the HHS motto itself \nstates, ``Hope is the anchor of life.'' The programs directed by the \nSecretary are an anchor of life for tens of millions of Americans. They \nbring hope to the hopeless and help to the helpless. They express the \nbest ideals of our country.\n  It has been said that the measure of a society is how it treats the \nvery old and the very young. The Secretary of the Department is \nresponsible for stewardship of Medicare, which along with Social \nSecurity, states the promise of our society to our senior citizens that \ntheir golden years will be as healthy and secure as possible. Medicare \nis a compact between the American people and their government. It says \nwork hard and contribute to your country during your working years--and \nyou will have good medical care in your senior years.\n  For the very young, the Secretary has an equally profound \nresponsibility. The Secretary is the leader of Head Start, one of the \nmost effective government programs to help disadvantaged children join \nthe mainstream of American life. It brings help and hope for millions \nof children who would otherwise have no chance at the American dream--\nbut it still serves only half of all those who are eligible.\n  Whether the issue is health care for the disadvantaged or assistance \nfor low-income families, HHS is the lead federal agency for some of the \nmost serious challenges the nation faces. HHS safety net programs are \nthe protection of last resort for millions of Americans, and other HHS \nprograms are also vital to the well-being of affluent and average \nAmericans alike.\n  Without the Food and Drug Administration, Americans could not go to \nthe grocery store with any confidence that the food they buy is safe \nand healthy. No American could be confident that their prescription \ndrugs are safe and effective, and no American needing a medical device \ncould be sure that the device will do more good than harm.\n  Biomedical research supported by the National Institutes of Health is \nunequaled by any other country. NIH leads the world in the effort to \nconquer cancer, heart disease, mental illness and other dread diseases \nthat threaten the life and happiness of American families.\n  We all know the important challenges that the new Congress, the new \nPresident, and the new Secretary of Health and Human Services will face \nthis year. We need to enact prescription drug coverage under Medicare, \nto assure that the promise of health security in retirement will \nfinally be fulfilled. We must expand health insurance, so that the \nright to health care can be a reality for every American, not just an \nexpensive privilege for the few. We must pass a strong, enforceable \nPatients' Bill of Rights to end the abuses of managed care and give \nevery patient the confidence that their health insurance will be there \nwhen they need it.\n  We should expand quality day care, child care, and Head Start, so \nthat we mean what we say when we state that no child shall be left \nbehind. We must maintain our commitment to biomedical research at the \nNIH, to reap the benefits of the century of the life sciences that has \njust begun, and increase our commitment to research on health care \nquality and the delivery and utilization of health services.\n  I hope we can move forward together in a spirit of bipartisanship to \naddress each of these great challenges. But it is\n\n[[Page S518]]\n\nalso important that we do not move backward by advancing partisan and \ndivisive proposals that would undermine the accomplishments of the \npast.\n  We must not undermine the federal commitment to guaranteed health \ncare for poor children, poor parents, senior citizens, and the \ndisabled. A new effort to enact a Medicaid block grant would be \ncounterproductive. And so would an attempt to repeal the Medicaid \ncommitment by stealth, through the use of the waiver process in a way \nthat undermines the Medicaid entitlement, rather than providing \nservices in new and better ways.\n  Congress approved the CHIP program for children's health by an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority, because it struck the right balance \nbetween state flexibility and achievement of national goals. Steps to \nprovide additional flexibility should be carefully considered--and \nshould not be undertaken without congressional review. I know that \nGovernor Thompson is interested in expanding coverage to parents of the \nchildren covered by Medicaid and CHIP. I hope that he will support our \nbipartisan efforts to provide new funds and clear authority to support \nstates that want to accomplish this important objective, rather than \nusing the waiver process and limited Title XXI funds to cover parents \nat the expanse of children.\n  We must be more sensitive to ethical concerns in federally financed \nmedical research--but we must also not roll back existing research \ncommitments because of ideology--and certainly not without \ncongressional action to guarantee that the commitment to such change is \nbipartisan.\n  We must maintain our commitment to comprehensive family planning \nservices--and not return to the old days of ``gag rules'' and \nharassment of family planning clinics.\n  We must not politicize the scientific judgements of the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  We must do more--much more--to reduce youth smoking, and protect as \nmany children as possible from the dangers of tobacco.\n  We should improve Medicare, in addition to prescription drug \ncoverage, by adding measures to assure the highest quality care to \nsenior citizens and the disabled. We must place a new emphasis in \nMedicare on keeping beneficiaries healthy rather than simply caring for \nthem after they become ill. We can expedite Medicare's coverage of \nbeneficial new products and procedures, and provide more adequate \nfinancial support for the nation's great teaching hospitals, its \ncommunity hospitals, its nursing homes, and its home health agencies. \nBut reform should not be an excuse to undermine Medicare's commitment, \nto impose additional financial burdens on the elderly, or to force \nsenior citizens to give up conventional Medicare and join HMOs. And the \nfailure to reach rapid consensus on Medicare reforms should not be an \nexcuse for failure to act promptly on the most important reform of \nall--Medicare coverage of prescription drugs.\n  Finally, responsible leadership at HHS requires support for new \nmeasures and new ideas to meet the challenges facing our country. To \nstand still is to fall behind in all these ongoing battles of our time.\n  Governor Thompson comes to us with a genuinely outstanding record of \naccomplishment in Wisconsin. He recognizes that access to good health \ninsurance, child care, job training and transportation services are \ncritically important if families are to successfully leave welfare for \nwork. Wisconsin's Badger Care health insurance program is a path-\nbreaking model for the nation. Governor Thompson was an early and \nactive supporter of the Jeffords-Kennedy work incentives legislation to \nhelp persons with disabilities work without fear of losing their health \ninsurance, and he has created a long-term care initiative that would \ngive families the freedom to choose the best forum for their long-term \ncare needs--whether in the home or in the community.\n  Governor Thompson is a hard worker, and a man of strong convictions. \nBut he is also pragmatic and willing to work with others who have \ndifferent views in order to achieve a common goal.\n  Though the Senate is voting today, members of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee are submitting written questions to \nGovernor Thompson on issues that were unable to be fully explored at \nlast Friday's hearing.\n  I intend to vote for Governor Thompson's confirmation, and I look \nforward to working with him in the years ahead to improve and protect \nthe nation's health and welfare.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination \nof Gov. Tommy Thompson to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nand also to speak to a vital public health issue on which I know many \nof my colleagues are looking forward to working with him: namely, the \nimplementation and enforcement of policies to improve our nation's \norgan procurement and allocation system.\n  I hold Governor Thompson in very high regard for his expertise in \nhealth care policy and for his long and distinguished record on \ninnovations in health care delivery in the state of Wisconsin, and I am \noptimistic that in his new role as guardian of public health laws and \nregulations for the country we can work together toward ensuring that \nnational interests triumph over parochial ones.\n  As my colleagues well know, over the past several years Congress has \nbeen unable to reach consensus on reauthorizing the National Organ \nTransplant Act, NOTA, though I look forward to working with Governor \nThompson this Congress to reauthorize this important public law, and \nespecially to develop a clear mandate and strategies for increasing \norgan donation. But in the absence of NOTA reauthorization, the country \nhas benefitted immensely from the credible scholarship of the Institute \nof Medicine's 1999 study which underscored not only the need for \nreforming organ procurement and allocation, but also the proper role \nthat the federal government should play in overseeing and enforcing \nsuch reforms.\n  I cannot fathom that the American public would countenance that a \nlife-and-death issue such as organ allocation would be based on \nprinciples of geographic happenstance, instead of medical necessity. \nBut it is just this outdated paradigm that has largely contributed to \nthe fact that about 4,000 Americans die each year--at least 11 per \nday--while awaiting organ transplants. Of those, it is estimated that \n1,000 Americans--more than 3 each day--might have been saved if the \nsystem operated more fairly.\n  In light of harrowing statistics such as these, following the release \nof the IOM study and in the absence of NOTA reauthorization, the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services last year put forth a Final \nRule which enjoyed bipartisan support here in Congress and which \nengendered the primary recommendation of the IOM study: to establish \ngoals for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, OPTN, to \nmake changes that would assure equity with regard to patient access to \norgans.\n  On March 16, 2000 the Final Rule governing the OPTN took effect, \nestablishing that the medical and allocation policies of the OPTN \nremain the responsibility of transplant professionals, in cooperation \nwith transplant centers, patients and donor families represented on the \nOPTN board. The Final Rule also rightly provides--as NOTA intended and \nthe IOM study recommended--for the public accountability that is \nnecessary for a national program on which so many lives depend.\n  Toward the goal of public accountability, the Final Rule requires the \nNation's OPTN contractor to submit to the Secretary new policies \ngoverning liver allocation to needy patients, in order to achieve the \nfollowing performance goals: utilize standardized, objective criteria \nto determine medical urgency; give highest priority to the most \nmedically urgent candidates, based upon such new criteria; and \ndistribute organs over as broad a geographic area as is feasible.\n  I am pleased that the current contractor has submitted a proposal to \nthe Department that meets many of the criteria stipulated in the Final \nRule and the recently renewed OPTN contract. The contractor's proposal \nwould create a more precise scale for determining how sick waiting \npatients are, thereby allowing the network to direct more livers to the \nsickest patients. However, the proposal would do nothing to break down \nthe geographic barriers that dictate organ distribution,\n\n[[Page S519]]\n\nwhich was one of the pivotal tenets of both the Final Rule and the new \nOPTN contract.\n  Mr. President, I share the belief of many of my colleagues that \nGovernor Thompson is eminently qualified to meet the many and varied \npolicy challenges that will be incumbent on the next Health and Human \nServices Secretary, ranging from sustaining and expanding the successes \nto date of welfare reform, to assessing options on how best to put \nMedicare on sound financial and actuarial footing for the long-term. I \nhave confidence that Governor Thompson will approach the duties of his \noffice with probity and rectitude. I am hopeful that the Governor will \nwork with Congress to reauthorize NOTA and to support and ensure \ncompliance with the regulations put forth last year relating to the \noperation of the organ procurement and transplantation network in the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

MINETA TO BE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Norman \nMineta to be the next Secretary of Transportation. Throughout his very \nlengthy career in public service, Norman Mineta has demonstrated a true \ncommitment to improving the quality of life for all Americans and a \nstrong understanding of the elemental role that transportation plays in \nour national prosperity.\n  Mr. Mineta began his public career in 1967 as the Mayor of the San \nJose City Council in California. In 1971, he was elected Mayor of San \nJose. Most of us know Mr. Mineta, however, from his very distinguished \ncareer in the House of Representatives, where he served for 21 years \nrepresenting the Silicon Valley area. At the culmination of his career \nin the House, Mr. Mineta served as the Chairman of the Committee on \nPublic Works and Transportation--the committee we now know as the \nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure.\n  Once we succeed in confirming Norman Mineta today, we will usher in a \nSecretary with a very extensive grounding in both politics and \ntransportation policy. Many of Mr. Mineta's most significant \nlegislative accomplishments in the House were in the area of \ntransportation. During the drafting of the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Mr. Mineta served as Chairman of \nthe Public Works Subcommittee on Ground Transportation. He has also \nbeen very involved in aviation policy, both during and after his career \nin Congress. President Clinton asked him to chair the National Civil \nAviation Review Commission. This ``Mineta Commission'' made several \nsignificant recommendations for revamping the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. At the request of Secretary of Transportation Rodney \nSlater, Mr. Mineta also chaired an ad hoc advisory committee on truck \nsafety.\n  Much has been accomplished in these two areas, but so much more \nremains to be done. Aviation delays have reached an all-time high. \nSecretary Mineta was quite frank with the members of the Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee during his confirmation hearing \nin telling them that they should not expect to see these delays \ndiminish any time soon. Many of us have read some frightening \nrevelations regarding the inadequate enforcement efforts made by the \nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration in maintaining truck \nsafety. These are two areas where Secretary Mineta has committed \nhimself to moving out quickly to implement a comprehensive series of \nimprovements, and I support him in these efforts.\n  When President-elect Bush announced his selection of Norman Mineta to \nbe his Transportation Secretary, then-Commerce Secretary Mineta stated \n``Inadequate infrastructure is one of the chief threats to a thriving \neconomy.'' This is a point that I have sought to make on the floor of \nthe United States Senate numerous times, and Members can expect me to \ncontinue to make this case time and time again. I am glad that I will \nhave an ally in Secretary Mineta in convincing my colleagues that we \nneed to reverse the overall disinvestment in our nation's \ninfrastructure that we have experienced over the last two decades. We \nhave begun to make some progress by honoring the funding guarantees \nthat I and other Senators included in the Transportation Equity Act for \nthe 21st Century. However, much more needs to be done, and I look \nforward to working with Norman Mineta to see to it that we take a more \naggressive approach in investing in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Norman Y. \nMineta of California to be Secretary of Transportation?

Mr. President, Alan Cranston was here in the Senate \nwhen I first arrived in 1983. He was a staunch advocate not only for \nCalifornia but also for a host of progressive policies at the national \nlevel. He was dedicated to protecting the environment, to expanding \nvoter opportunities for all Americans, to closing the gap in our \nsociety between the rich and the poor. He was a champion of equal \nrights for all. He was a foe of bigotry in all its forms.\n  Perhaps his greatest passion during the years he served in the Senate \nwas reducing the threat of nuclear war. He led the fight for arms \ncontrol. Even after he left the Senate, he continued his work and spoke \nout for arms control and for the de-alerting of nuclear weapons.\n  I remember meeting with Alan last year at Ricky's Hyatt House in \nMountainview, CA. I was in the Bay area, and I called ahead to see if \nhe was available for breakfast. He said it was near his home and that \nhe would meet me there.\n  He was a little less vigorous during that breakfast than he had been \nin earlier visits, but his commitment to arms reduction was \nundiminished. I remember thinking at the time how impressive it was to \nsee someone who felt strongly enough about his views to find a way to \ncontinue advocacy of those views after leaving public office. It was \nclear that although he had left public office, he had not left public \nservice.\n  Alan Cranston lived a remarkable life, and we are all fortunate that \nhe devoted so much of that life to public service. I, for one, will \nmiss Alan's wise counsel and his passionate commitment to making the \nworld a better place.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a subject that \nbrings me great sorrow--the passing of my old friend and colleague, \nformer California Senator Alan Cranston.\n  Senator Cranston passed away suddenly last New Year's Eve, at the age \nof 86. His sudden death came as a shock to all of us who remember him \nfor his abundant energy and enthusiasm.\n  Alan was elected to this body for the first of four terms in 1968. He \nwas already a legend in the Senate when I arrived here for the first \ntime almost eighteen years after him, and I consider myself very \nfortunate to have had the opportunity to serve alongside him. I will \nalways remember him fondly, both for the kind of person he was, and the \nkind of Senator he was.\n  Alan was elected Democratic whip an unprecedented seven straight \ntimes, and served in that role in both the majority and minority. \nHaving now served as my party's whip for two years, I can say that \nnobody who holds that office can possibly ignore the long shadow that \nhe still casts over it.\n  Recently, the Senate approved an historic power-sharing agreement \nunder which both parties would have an equal number of seats in each \ncommittee. It remains to be seen how this arrangement will work in \npractice, and whether the split will create more cooperation, or more \ngridlock.\n  But I think that if we in the Senate are to make it work, we would do \nwell to follow the model set by Senator Cranston. Those of my \ncolleagues who did not know him personally, would do well to study the \nlessons of his life and his career.\n  The press called him ``Colorless Cranston,'' a nickname he wore with \npride, because it reflected his fundamental belief that legislative \naccomplishment was far more important than crafting sound bites or \nscoring political points. When you needed to find Alan, you didn't look \nin the press gallery or the recording studio--you looked for him in the \ncloakroom, where he was always busy negotiating a compromise or finding \nways to move legislation over obstacles.\n  Although he was known as one of the last true liberals, he never let \nhis ideology get in the way of getting things done. He regularly \nreached out across the aisle and his close friends included some of his \nmost vigorous and outspoken political opponents. He was a workhorse who \nlived by the maxim that a leader can accomplish great things if he \ndoesn't mind who gets the credit.\n  Some of his greatest accomplishments found him in alliances that left \noutsiders scratching their heads--for example, teaming with Strom \nThurmond to improve veterans' programs, with Alfonse D'Amato on public \nhousing measures, with Barry Goldwater to protect first amendment press \nfreedoms. Outsiders wondered whether he had sold out his old liberal \nbeliefs, but the truth was that he was just finding ways to get things \ndone with as little fuss as possible.\n  During his 24 years in the Senate, no legislation that touched on his \npassions--veterans' benefits, disarmament, environmental protection, \nhuman rights, or civil rights--passed this body without his \nfingerprints on it, although more often than not, only those closest to \nhim realized the extent of his contribution.\n  During his long and colorful career, he crossed paths with some of \nthe most famous men in history and was present many times while history \nwas being made. He was a track star at Stanford and member of a record-\nsetting relay sprint team. As a young journalist, he reported on the \nrise of Nazism in Germany, and was sued by Adolph Hitler for publishing \nan unsanitized version of ``Mein Kampf'' and revealing Hitler's true \nambitions to the world. His lifelong commitment to halting the use of \nnuclear weapons began after he was introduced to Albert Einstein in \n1946. After retiring from the Senate, he established a think tank with \nMikhail Gorbachev to promote world peace, where he worked until his \ndeath. He counted Groucho Marx among his supporters.\n  Yet despite these brushes with fame and the long list of bills that \nbear his name, he will always be best remembered in this body for the \nthings that newspapers don't report--for his grace, his humility, his \nleadership, and his devotion to his son Kim and his granddaughter. He \nwill be missed.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nhonoring our friend and former colleague, Senator Alan Cranston, who \ndied on December 31, 2000 at the age of 86 in his native California.\n  While Alan Cranston was elected to the United States Senate in 1968, \nhis public service began years before when he served in the Executive \nOffices of the President in 1942 as Chief of the Foreign Language \nDivision of the Office of War Information. Declining a deferment, he \nenlisted as a private in the United States Army in 1944. First assigned \nto an infantry unit, he became editor of ``Army Talk'' and was a \nSergeant by V-J Day. He went on to serve two terms as State Controller \nof California before being elected to the United States Senate.\n  Alan Cranston served the people of California with distinction in the \nU.S. Senate for 24 years. He chaired the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, providing invaluable assistance to our Nation's servicemen and \nwomen. He was in the forefront in the U.S. Senate on numerous issues of \nnational importance, including mass transit, civil rights, the \nenvironment, women's rights, housing and education.\n  I was privileged to serve with Senator Cranston on the Foreign \nRelations Committee where he played an important role during Senate \nconsideration of the SALT II and START treaties, helped pave the way \nfor ratification of the Panama Canal Treaty, and was active in efforts \nto promote peace in the Middle East. Senator Cranston was a tireless \nadvocate for world peace and the defense of democratic institutions.\n  Throughout his Senate service, Alan Cranston worked diligently to \npromote the reduction and, ultimately, the elimination of nuclear \nweapons. After retiring in 1993, he continued his extraordinary \ncommitment and devotion to these critical efforts. He chaired the State \nof the World Forum, a widely respected organization for the discussion \nof global problems based in San Francisco. He was also founder and \nPresident of the Global Security Institute, concentrating on a world-\nwide effort to reduce, marginalize and eliminate nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, Alan Cranston was a leader in the U.S. Senate, a well-\nrespected member of this body. He had a unique ability to achieve \nconsensus under difficult circumstances and his wise counsel will be \nmissed by every member with whom he served. I would like to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to him and to extend my deepest sympathies \nto his family.\n\n[[Page S521]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for as \nmuch time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Alan Cranston was a Senator in this \nChamber for some long while. In fact, in recent months he visited this \nChamber, and I had an opportunity to say a few words to him. He was \nsomeone who left a significant mark, especially in the area of fighting \nfor a policy in this country that would put this country in a \nleadership position to reduce the threat of nuclear war.\n  Mr. Cranston worked diligently on that issue here in Congress, but \nafter he left his service in the Senate, he especially was interested, \nand active all around this country, in trying to mobilize the energy \nand interest for this country to lead in a range of areas dealing with \nstopping the spread of nuclear weapons. I recall, perhaps 6 months ago, \ndriving down a rural highway in North Dakota and receiving a call on my \ncell phone. The call was from former Senator Alan Cranston, and he was \ncalling from California. What he was calling about was what he always \ntalked about in recent years. He was trying to find ways to continue \nour country's obligation to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons and \nthe threat of nuclear war.\n  He felt passionately about the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty \nand was disappointed when the treaty was voted down in the Senate last \nyear or a year and a half ago. But he never stopped working. He always \nbelieved that our country, as strong and as big as it is, had a \nleadership responsibility in the world to mobilize its energy and \ncommitment to find ways to stop the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  So today we pay honor to his memory. We should be thankful that there \nwas an Alan Cranston involved in public service. I say to his family \nthat our sympathies go to them. We will all miss his commitment in \ndealing with this issue of nuclear arms reduction.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the introduction of S. 165 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan and Mr. Baucus pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 171 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, I listened attentively to President Bush \non Saturday when he called on all Americans to unite in a spirit of \ncivility and common purpose. Those are sentiments we all share. I, for \none, intend to make every effort, guided by conscience and my \nconstituents, to work with the new administration for the good of the \ncountry.\n  I was also impressed by some of the things he said yesterday to his \nstaff about treating every person with decency and respect and never \ntaking the White House for granted. Those are important messages, and I \ncommend the President for setting a tone of civility.\n  I also take the President at his word when he speaks of ``working \ntogether to unite the country.'' I assume he means that on issues that \nhave long divided us, he and his administration will make a sincere \neffort to bring people together.\n  But that doesn't happen simply by making a speech. Actions speak \nlouder than words. On his first day in office, President Bush, by \nexecutive order, with no prior consultation with Congress, reinstated \nthe controversial Mexico City policy on international family planning. \nThe President explained his decision with these words:\n\n       It is my conviction that taxpayer funds should not be used \n     to pay for abortions or advocate or actively promote \n     abortion, either here or abroad. It is therefore my belief \n     that the Mexico City policy should be restored.\n\n  Madam President, if current law did, in fact, permit taxpayer funds \nto be used to pay for or promote abortions overseas, then the President \nmight have a point. But our law does not allow that. Our law explicitly \nprohibits any U.S. funds from being used for abortion or to promote \nabortion.\n  That is the settled law of the United States. It was passed by the \nCongress and signed into law by President Clinton. It is something we \nhave all supported. In fact, it has been the law for as long as I can \nremember, even during past administrations. It is already against the \nlaw to use taxpayer funds for purposes related to abortion. Somebody \nshould have told that to the new President.\n  In fact, the Mexico City policy, which he has reinstated, goes much, \nmuch further. Many have called it a ``global gag rule.'' It prohibits \ntaxpayer funds from being used to support private family planning \norganizations like the International Planned Parenthood Federation. \nThese organizations use a small portion of their own private funds--not \ntaxpayer funds, but private funds--to provide advice, counseling, and \ninformation about abortions, and to advocate for safe abortion \npractices in countries where tens of thousands of women suffer injuries \nor die from complications from unsafe abortions.\n  If we tried to impose the Mexico City policy on any family planning \norganization within our borders, it would clearly violate the First \nAmendment. It would be illegal. But we impose it on those same \norganizations when they work overseas beyond the reach of our \nConstitution.\n  Proponents of the Mexico City policy maintain that it will reduce the \nnumber of abortions. The reality is the opposite. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer knows this very well. The International Planned \nParenthood Federation, which is now going to be cut off from U.S. \nGovernment support, has used every tax dollar it received in the past \nto provide voluntary family planning services, like contraceptives, to \ncouples who lack them. By providing for the first time modern birth \ncontrol methods to people in countries where abortion was the primary \nmethod of birth control, the number of abortions goes down.\n  Now, taxpayer funds to the International Planned Parenthood \nFederation, which is comprised of dozens of family planning \norganizations around the world, are cut off.\n  I remember the distinguished senior Senator from Oregon, former \nSenator Mark Hatfield, a dear friend of mine, one of the most revered \nMembers of this body, who became chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. Senator Hatfield was fervently pro-life, opposed to \nabortion, very strong in his beliefs. I remember a debate on the Mexico \nCity policy when he stood here--and he probably said it best. I will \nquote what he said:\n\n       It is a proven fact that when contraceptive services are \n     not available to women throughout the world, abortion rates \n     increase. The Mexico City policy is unacceptable to me as \n     someone who is strongly opposed to abortion.\n\n  President Bush's decision was not unexpected, based on what he said \nduring the campaign. But I am disappointed because one would have hoped \nthat after pledging to change the way we do business in Washington, \nafter years of successive Congresses and administrations tying \nthemselves in knots over this issue, his advisers would have taken the \ntime to consult with the Congress about how to avoid the quagmire the \nMexico City policy has produced in the past.\n  Now, had they done that, would an agreement have been possible? Who \nknows? There are strong passions on both sides of this issue, but they \nshould\n\n[[Page S522]]\n\nat least have asked whether maybe, before unilaterally turning back the \nclock, there is a way to find common ground.\n  President Bush has made much of his abilities as a consensus \nbuilder. Frankly, I think had he bothered to ask, he would have found a \nwillingness to compromise, because contrary to the President's \nstatement and contrary to a lot of the press reports, this issue is \nabout far more than abortion.\n\n  It is about protecting the health of women in desperately poor \ncountries where more than half a million women die each year from \ncomplications relating to pregnancy, and where women have little \ncontrol over their own bodies or their lives. We have the opportunity, \nat very little expense, to help. Instead--not to save money but to make \na political point--we cut off that help.\n  The Mexico City policy has been the subject of more political \nposturing, more press releases, more fund raising letters, more \ndebates, more votes, and more Presidential vetoes, than virtually any \nother issue I can think of.\n  I remember when President Clinton did the right thing by repealing \nthe Mexico City policy 8 years ago. When he did that, a Republican \nCongress responded by sharply cutting funding for voluntary family \nplanning--not funding for abortions but for voluntary family planning. \nThe predictable, tragic result of that misguided, politically motivated \nact was an increase in the number of abortions and of deaths of women \nfrom botched abortions.\n  Again, the evidence is indisputable that when family planning \nservices are available, the number of abortions goes down. But \napparently that didn't matter. Mexico City proponents cared more about \nscoring political points than preventing abortions or saving women's \nlives.\n  President Bush has made a decision. He has a right to do that. But I \nbelieve it was the wrong decision--wrong because the Mexico City policy \nis not about taxpayer dollars, wrong because he ignored the bipartisan \nmajority in the Senate that opposes the Mexico City policy, wrong \nbecause it will likely result in more abortions, not less, in poor \ncountries where abortions are often unsafe.\n  The irony is that if we had a vote a majority of Senators--\nRepublicans and Democrats--would vote the other way.\n  I do appreciate that the administration has said it will provide the \nfull $445 million the Congress appropriated for family planning this \nyear. That is critically important, and we should discuss how to \nsignificantly increase that amount in future years. But by reinstating \nthe Mexico City policy, by cutting off support for some of the most \neffective organizations involved in family planning and women's health, \nthe President has set us on a collision course. We can now expect \nextended debates that we have all heard countless times before, votes \nto repeal the policy, vetoes of appropriations bill, and on and on.\n  I hope this is not what the President meant when he spoke of working \ntogether. We can do better. We have to do better if we are going to \navoid the pitfalls that divided us in the past on this issue.\n  Madam President, we have moved foreign aid bills through this body in \nrecord time in the last few years. Senator McConnell of Kentucky and I \nhave been the floor leaders year after year. But it used to take many \ndays, and one of the reasons was that we got bogged down in debates on \nthe Mexico City policy.\n  The President could have waited until February 15 to make his \ndecision. There was time to consult with Republicans and Democrats. He \ncould have said: Look, I know this issue is divisive. Let us work \ntogether, come back and sit down again in a few days and work through \nthis--because one thing we can all agree on is that with the abysmal \nstate of women's health in so many parts of the world, we can make it \nbetter. That should not be a Republican or a Democrat or pro-choice or \nright-to-life issue. That is a human issue, a moral issue. This would \nbe a good year to forget the political point making, and solve this.\n  I have traveled to many parts of the world. My wife is a registered \nnurse. She has traveled with me. We have seen how bad the situation is. \nWe have seen how a little help can move women in many parts of the \nworld generations ahead of where they are today.\n  The distinguished occupant of the chair has visited some of those \nsame places, and many more. I know I preach to the converted.\n  We have enough other ways to make political points, on either side.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we do have an essential agreement here \nthat will allow us to move through three more nominations. I would like \nto go through this and then also give the Senators some further idea as \nto how we might proceed beyond this next week.\n  As in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. on \nMonday, the Senate proceed to the nomination of Gale Norton to be \nSecretary of Interior and that it be considered under the following \nagreement: 3 hours to be equally divided between the chairman and \nranking member of the Energy Committee, 60 minutes equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, and following the use or \nyielding back of the time, the nomination be laid aside.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of Gov. Christine Whitman to be Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, and the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration; that there be 30 minutes for debate to be \ndivided as follows: 10 minutes under the control of Senator Corzine, 10 \nminutes under the control of Senator Torricelli, 10 minutes equally \ndivided between the chairman and ranking member of the Environment \nCommittee.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following that debate, at 10:30 \na.m. on Tuesday, the nomination be temporarily laid aside and the \nSenate resume consideration of the Norton nomination under the \nfollowing agreement: 10 minutes under the control of Senator Feingold, \n15 minutes under the control of Senator Durbin, 15 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Wellstone, 10 minutes under the control of Senator \nStabenow, with 30 additional minutes for closing remarks under the \ncontrol of Senator Boxer and the final 30 minutes under the control of \nSenator Murkowski.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 on Tuesday the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Elaine Chao to be Secretary of Labor, \nand that there be 15 minutes for debate equally divided between the \nchairman and ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee, and 15 minutes under the control of Senator \nWellstone, to be followed by a vote on the confirmation of the \nSecretary of Labor, to be followed by a vote on the confirmation of \nGale Norton to be Secretary of Interior, and that be followed by a vote \non the confirmation of Governor Whitman to be the head of EPA.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the three back-to-back \nvotes, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and \nthe Senate resume legislative session.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that either leader may vitiate the \nagreement with respect to the Chao agreement prior to the vote and that \nin no case shall it proceed if the Senate has not yet received the \nnomination and the accompanying papers.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, as I \nunderstand what just transpired and will have transpired by next \nTuesday early in the afternoon, is that all of the President's nominees \nfor his Cabinet will have been approved with only one selection still \nto be debated. It is our intention, I say to the leader, to move this \nto a final vote without undue delay. I hope we can do that \nexpeditiously.\n\n[[Page S523]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Nevada. I \nalso note with regard to the last paragraph, we do not anticipate there \nwill be a need to vitiate the agreement with regard to the Chao \nagreement. It is just that we have not received all of the papers yet. \nWe do not expect there to be any problem, but because we do not have it \nall, it was necessary to put this in.\n  Also--and I appreciate Senator Reid's comments--it is our \nanticipation to proceed, after these three stacked votes Tuesday \nafternoon, on the debate with regard to the Attorney General \nnomination, and it is at least my hope, and I believe everybody's hope, \nthat we will be able to complete action on that nomination next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on several of the \nnominations on which we have voted in the last few days.\n  I am pleased the Senate is acting responsibly and quickly to put the \nPresident's cabinet in place. While I am sure I will not always agree \nwith everything proposed by the nominees we have confirmed, I stand \nready to work with them toward our common goal of the United State's \nbest interest.\n  I especially want to welcome Governor Tommy Thompson, of my State of \nWisconsin, to his new position as Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. I had the honor of presenting the Governor at his hearings \nbefore the Senate Finance and Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittees. As I said there, the Administration is truly fortunate to \nhave a man of his energy, creativity, and intelligence in this \nextremely important position.\n  I also want to comment on some of the other nominations on which the \nSenate has already acted.\n  I am pleased to lend my support to the nomination of General Colin L. \nPowell to be Secretary of State. There are many foreign policy \nchallenges facing the next Administration including the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction, our peacekeeping commitments abroad, \ninstability in the Middle East and in other hot spots, and the \ncontinued evolution of our relationships with Russia and China. I am \nconfident that General Powell brings a wealth of experience, a \nformidable intellect, and a level head to the challenges ahead. I look \nforward to working with Secretary Powell in forging a truly bipartisan \nforeign policy.\n  I am also pleased with President Bush's decision to appoint Donald \nRumsfeld as Secretary of Defense. He is an experienced voice on defense \nissues, and one that the Congress has come to rely on for outside \nanalysis. He recently addressed the threat of ballistic missiles in a \nspecial report to Congress that now shapes much of the debate on \nballistic missile defense. His years of public service and expertise \nwill give him the credibility inside the Pentagon to make the tough \nchoices that face the new administration, and they will face many. I \nfeel confident that Secretary Rumsfeld is qualified to help the \nPresident shape our armed forces to meet the evolving threats of the \nnew century.\n  And finally, I support the nomination of Rodney Paige to be the \nSecretary of Education. Dr. Paige has received overwhelming praise \nsince his nomination was announced, and in my opinion, there is good \nreason for that. He understands the need to change the system when the \nold programs aren't working like they should. He is willing to work \nwith all sides--from teachers to parents to principals to school board \nmembers. And he brings with him to Washington an important lesson from \nhis time in Houston: If you set high standards for students and \nteachers, and require them to meet them, they will strive to succeed.\n  Mr. President, there are many worthy nominees who deserve comment and \nsupport, but I will reserve further remarks until we engage later in \nthe year in what I hope will be bipartisan legislating.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Anthony Principi\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate unanimously approved \nthe nomination of Anthony Principi to be President Bush's Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs. In my judgment, Secretary Principi is supremely \nqualified to take on the challenges that will face the next Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs, and I fully supported his confirmation.\n  Secretary Principi will bring a wealth of experience in a broad-range \nof capacities pertaining to veterans and veterans health to his work at \nthe VA. A graduate of the United States Naval Academy and decorated \nveteran of the Vietnam War, Secretary Principi is personally aware of \nour veterans needs and concerns. He was appointed deputy secretary of \nVeterans Affairs by President George Bush in 1989 and served as Acting \nSecretary during 1992--providing him with a working knowledge of the \nVA's structure and an understanding of how to make the system work for \nour veterans. Most recently, Secretary Principi served as president of \na California-based health care contractor. Through a blend of public \nand private service, Secretary Principi has assembled an impressive \ntrack record and compiled the type of practical experience that will \nserve him well at the VA.\n  I was pleased to hear during Secretary Principi's nomination hearing \nthat he plans to focus on veterans benefits, among other concerns. I \nagree strongly with this priority. Through dedicated service and \nsacrifice, generations of veterans and their families have answered the \ncall to serve this nation in her darkest hours and most shining moments \nalike. They have kept the solemn covenant established by honored \npatriots past and have earned the gratitude of a grateful nation.\n  With 139 facilities serving 3.5 million veterans and survivors, \nhowever, the task at hand is a daunting one. While broadly speaking, \nthe VA provides high-quality health-care and services to our veteran \ncommunity, ensuring that such a standard is maintained requires \nconstant attention and a firm guiding hand. I am confident that \nSecretary Principi has the leadership and managerial skill, and perhaps \nmore importantly, the compassion, to serve well our veterans and their \nfamilies, as they have served our country.\n  I commend President Bush for putting forth such a quality and \nqualified nominee. Secretary Principi will be a credit to this \nAdministration. I am pleased that the Senate has moved emphatically to \nconfirm him as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. I look forward to working \nclosely with him on issues of mutual concern, and I wish him well.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to support the \nnomination of Anthony Principi to serve as Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs. Mr. Principi is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, and a \ncombat-decorated veteran who commanded a River Patrol Unit in the \nMekong Delta during the Vietnam War.\n  Since completing his service in the U.S. Navy, Mr. Principi has had a \ndistinguished career in public service serving as staff director of the \nSenate Committee on Armed Services and Deputy Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs for several years until he was appointed Acting Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs by President Bush in 1992. Now, as Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, Anthony Principi will have responsibility for a $48 \nbillion budget in the Federal Government's second largest department, \ncoordinating a nationwide system of health care services and benefits \nto serve America's more than 25 million veterans.\n  As we begin the 107th Congress, there are few challenges we face more \nimportant than ensuring that America's veterans receive the health care \nand benefits that they so justly deserve. The challenges include \nproviding adequate funding for veterans health care services, ensuring \naccess to VA health care for homeless veterans and veterans living in \nrural areas, providing timely access to specialized medical care, and \nresponding to the many concerns of Persian Gulf Veterans as well as \nveterans with service in the Balkans. Secretary Principi, as a combat \nveteran in\n\n[[Page S524]]\n\nVietnam, is well aware of these challenges. He has been a strong \nadvocate on behalf of veterans during his service in the Senate and as \nActing Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, I look forward to \nworking with Secretary Principi to ensure that the FY 2002 budget for \nveterans health care services and benefits are sufficient to meet the \ngrowing needs of our veterans population, particularly our aging \nveterans. We must also make certain that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs is equipped to meet the many new challenges that are emerging \nas a result of the activities of our military personnel in peacekeeping \noperations and more non-traditional assignments around the world. I \ncongratulate Secretary Principi on his appointment and commend him for \nhis commitment to serve our Nation's veterans. No individual has a more \nsolemn responsibility than the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/24/senate-section/article/S524-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RETIREMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL DRENNAN A. CLARK\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an outstanding \nindividual, patriot and friend, Major General Drennan A. ``Tony'' Clark \nfrom my home state of Nevada. Major General Clark is retiring from the \nNevada National Guard after more than 40 years of loyal and dedicated \nservice.\n  Major General Clark first joined the Nevada National Guard as a young \nphoto lab technician in 1960, and eventually rose to Adjutant General, \nthe highest position in the Nevada Guard--a position he held for 14 \nyears, a remarkably long time. It speaks volumes of the respect that \nGeneral Clark commands in Nevada that he was re-appointed to that \nposition four times, by Governors from both parties.\n  During his 14 years as Adjutant General, Tony Clark led the Guard \nthrough many upheavals, ranging from floods, to earthquakes, to civic \nemergencies, to the war on drugs. Units of the Nevada Guard fought in \nthe Persian Gulf War. Hundreds of Nevadans owe their lives to the \ntimely assistance of the Guard in all manner of emergencies.\n  The face of Nevada has changed dramatically since General Clark first \nassumed command--the state's population has nearly tripled in the last \ndecade alone, small towns have exploded into cities, and Las Vegas has \nbecome an attraction to the world--and the Guard's military role has \nalso shifted, from reconnaissance, to airlift, to Medevec, to tank-\nbusting--but through it all, Tony Clark kept the Guard constantly \nvigilant, ready and able to answer any call. General Clark has led the \nGuard so capably and for so long that it will be hard to imagine the \nNevada Guard without him in command.\n  General Clark grew up in Reno, Nevada and graduated from Bishop \nManogue High School in 1955. He studied political science at the \nUniversity of San Francisco, joined the Nevada Air National Guard \nshortly after graduation, and served in the Guard while attending law \nschool.\n  After receiving his law degree in 1964, he began a budding career as \na lawyer. But fate had something different in mind, and in 1968, young \nSecond Lieutenant Clark was called to active duty during the Pueblo \nCrisis and served as the Commander of the 6314th Supply Squadron at \nSuwon Air Base and Oson Air Base, Korea.\n  He was released from active duty in 1969, and returned to Nevada and \nhis career as a rising young lawyer. But a few years later, he \nsacrificed what in all probability would have been a distinguished and \nlucrative career in the legal profession to accept assignment as the \nNevada Guard's Staff Judge Advocate, where he handled the Guard's legal \nmatters, and a few years later was appointed the State Judge Advocate. \nAfter only a year as the State Judge Advocate, Tony Clark was appointed \nAssistant Adjutant General in 1984, and then became the acting Adjutant \nGeneral in 1986. In 1987, he was formally appointed Adjutant General \nand held that position until his retirement last week.\n  During his tenure as the Adjutant General for the state of Nevada, \nGeneral Clark was responsible for enhancing the National Guard \nnationally and within the state. General Clark was appointed by the \nSecretary of the Air Force to the Air Reserve Forces policy committee. \nAdditionally, he served on the Reserve Forces Policy Board, as chairman \nof the Advisory Board to Air National Guard Professional Military \nEducational Center, and chairman of the National Guard Bureau Executive \nEnvironmental Quality Board. In each of these critical and prestigious \nassignments, General Clark played a key role in enriching and \nhighlighting the National Guard.\n  General Clark's military awards and decorations include the \nDistinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal \nwith one bronze oak leaf cluster, Air Force Commendation Medal with two \nbronze oak leaf clusters, Army Commendation Medal, Air Force \nAchievement Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Air Force Outstanding Unit \nAward with one silver oak leaf cluster, Air Force Organizational \nExcellence Award with four bronze oak leaf clusters, Air Reserve \nMeritorious Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal with one \nbronze star, Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Humanitarian Service \nMedal, Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, Air Force Overseas \nRibbon, Air Force Longevity Service Award Ribbon with one silver and \nthree bronze oak leaf clusters, Armed Forces Reserve Medal with one \nsilver hourglass device, Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon with one \nbronze star, and many others.\n  Yet in spite of his long list of accomplishments and the many hours \nhe spent working to improve the Guard and ensure the safety of Nevada, \nTony Clark never lost sight of the things that are truly important in \nlife--his wife Andrea, his six children, and his many friends.\n  Many years ago, General Clark sacrificed a lucrative career as a \nlawyer to serve the people of his state and his country, and we are all \nbetter for his choice.

The issue of our \ncountry's pipeline safety came to the forefront after tragic explosions \nin Bellingham, Washington, and later, in my own state of New Mexico.\n  Just after midnight, August 19, 2000, an El Paso Natural Gas pipeline \nexploded on the Pecos River near Carlsbad, New Mexico. Twelve members \nof an extended family were camping near the explosion, which sent a 350 \nfoot high ball of flame into the air. Six of the campers died \ninstantly, and the remaining six later died from their horrific \ninjuries.\n  Pipelines carry nearly all of the natural gas and about 65 percent of \nthe crude oil and refined oil products. Three primary types of \npipelines form a network of nearly 2.2 million miles, 7,000 miles of \nwhich lie throughout New Mexico.\n  Last Congress, the Senate unanimously passed similar legislation. Our \ncolleagues in the other Chamber voiced serious concerns regarding that \nbill. Many of their criticisms related to the Office of Pipeline \nSafety, the Office within the Department of Transportation charged with \nkeeping our Nation's pipelines safe. Unfortunately, the Office of \nPipeline Safety has had a poor history of regulation and enforcement. \nIt is true that the Office has traditionally been slow to act.\n  That said, we should not allow a former executive agency's failures \nto dictate our failure to act in accordance with our legislative \nmandate. In that regard, I intend to discuss the issue with our current \nSecretary of Transportation nominee, Mr. Mineta. I am confident that he \nwill address our concerns regarding the Office of Pipeline Safety's \nrecord of enforcement with the new Director of the Office when he or \nshe is nominated by our new President.\n\n[[Page S525]]\n\n  Mr. President, this bill; significantly increases States' role in \noversight, inspection, and investigation of pipelines; improves and \nexpands the public's right to know about pipeline hazards; dramatically \nincreases civil penalties for safety and reporting violations from \n$25,000 to $500,000, and increases the maximum civil penalty for a \nrelated series of violations to $1 million; increases reporting \nrequirements of releases of hazardous liquids from 50 barrels to five \ngallons; provides important whistle blower protections prohibiting \ndiscrimination by pipeline operators, contractors or subcontractors; \nfurthermore, the legislation would provide much needed funding for \nresearch and development in pipeline safety technologies. In fact, \ntechnology currently exists that might have detected weaknesses in \npipelines around Carlsbad. Unfortunately, due to insufficient funding \nfor their products to reach the market; La Sen Corporation in my own \nState of New Mexico has developed technology that can detect faulty \npipelines where current pipeline inspection technology is not useable. \nLa Sen's Electronic Mapping system can be very effective even in \npipelines where conventional pig devices cannot be used; pipeline \ninspection is costly and slow. Innovative new technologies could allow \nus to inspect all 2.2 million miles of pipeline each year in a cost \neffective manner. Today, pipeline inspection technology only covers 5-\n10 miles per day at a cost of $50 per mile. Again, La Sen's technology \ncan survey 500 miles per day at a cost of $32 per mile; ensuring the \nsafety and integrity of our nation's pipelines is important to all of \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/24/senate-section/article/S525-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 TRIBUTE TO COLONEL MARJORIE A.

Jackson, United \nStates Army Medical Service Corps, on her retirement after 26 years of \ndistinguished and dedicated service to the nation.\n  Colonel Jackson is a native of Louisiana. She graduated from Walter \nL. Cohen High School in New Orleans, earned her bachelor's degree from \nXavier University and earned her M.A. in Executive Development from \nBall State University. In 1974, she enlisted in the Army as a Pharmacy \nTechnician serving in Fort McPherson, Georgia. In 1975, she was \ncommissioned as a Second Lieutenant and went on to serve in a variety \nof key operational and staff positions including Assistant Inspector \nGeneral, U.S. Army Health Services Command and Clinical Pharmacist, \nHematology/Oncology Service at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The \nculmination of Colonel Jackson's career was assignment as Chief of \nStaff of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.\n  Colonel Jackson has been at the forefront of military medicine, \ncompleting a one-year residency in Hematology-Oncology Pharmacy at \nWalter Reed Army Medical Center and a one-year assignment as a Pharmacy \nConsultant to the 18th Medical Command in Seoul, South Korea. She has \nbeen honored with the Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation \nMedal, the Order of Military Medical Merit by the Army and was selected \nas the College of Pharmacy Alumnus of the Year in 1996 by Xavier \nUniversity for her achievements in the field.\n  Colonel Jackson has been a ground breaker her entire career. She was \nthe first woman to serve as Chief of Staff, Administrative Services at \nthe Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, the first African-American \nwoman promoted to the rank of Colonel in the U.S. Army Medical Service \nCorps, the first African-American female pharmacist in the history of \nthe U.S. Army Pharmacy Service and the first woman to direct an Army \nmajor medical center pharmacy.\n  For twenty-six years, seven months and eighteen days, Colonel Jackson \nhas served her country on the forefront of military medical care. Her \nexemplary military career is ending, but her contributions and \nachievements will continue to be felt throughout the Army and the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  Colonel Marjorie A. Jackson served her country with great ability, \nvalor, loyalty and integrity. On the occasion of her retirement from \nthe United States Army, I commend her for her outstanding service. She \nis one of Louisiana's finest, represents all that is special about our \nnation, and I wish her well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/24/senate-section/article/S525-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN HONOR OF DR. MICHAEL MULLIN, PHD AND DR. MIA JEAN TEGNER, PHD.\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to take the \nopportunity to recognize and honor two exceptional research scientists \nfrom one of the world's finest oceanographic research facilities who \nlost their lives in recent weeks. Both were two of the brightest stars \nat the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in La Jolla, California.\n  Michael Mullin, a research biologist at Scripps, and undergraduate \nprofessor at the University of California, San Diego, died December \n19th of complications following surgery. He was 63 years old.\n  His research over the past 36 years at Scripps has included the study \nof phytoplankton, zooplankton and larval fish in the marine food web.\n  He was the author of more than 70 scientific publications, including \nhis own book ``Webs and Scales.'' He also served as chief editor of the \nscientific journal ``Fisheries Oceanography.''\n  Dr. Mullin's personal sense of the social and moral obligations of \nscience made him a true leader in undergraduate programs at UCSD and at \nScripps Institution of Oceanography. He was as committed to the \neducation of young students as he was to the practice of science and he \nwill be greatly missed.\n  Mia Jean Tegner, a research marine biologist at Scripps Institution \nof Oceanography since 1969, died Sunday, January 7th in a scuba diving \naccident off the San Diego coast. She was 53 years old.\n  An experienced scuba diver, Dr. Tegner made more than 4,000 dives \nthroughout the world during her 31 years at Scripps. Her research \nfocused on the ecology of kelp forest communities and near shore marine \nresources. Her most recent research included studies of the effects of \nEl Nino and La Nina events on the coastal ecosystem.\n  Also socially active and committed to the marine environment, Mia \nTegner helped to guide the City of San Diego in developing public \npolicy based on science as it related to ocean pollution. Her work led \nthe way in focusing the nation's attention to the true impacts of human \ndevelopment on the health of our marine environment.\n  As we take the time to honor the work of Dr. Michael Mullin and Dr. \nMia Tegner we must also reflect on their commitment to providing us \nwith a better understanding of our world and our relationship with it.\n  I am pleased to recognize and salute these great scientists as two of \nour nation's outstanding citizens and noble public servants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/24/senate-section/article/S525-3", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                       executive message received\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/24/senate-section/article/S525-4", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S525-S527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-355.

A bill to establish the Violence Against Women Office within \nthe Department of Justice; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nmake the Violence Against Women Office a permanent office in the \nDepartment of Justice. After the passage of the Violence Against Women \nAct in 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice administratively created \nthe Violence Against Women Office. Over time, the office's duties and \nresponsibilities have included administering Violence Against Women Act \ngrant programs, providing technical assistance and training to improve \njustice system responses in communities across the country, and \nproviding leadership in developing the Administration's policies on \nviolence against women. Led by a Presidentially-appointed Director, the \nViolence Against Women Office has had an enormous impact on social \nattitudes in this country about the nature\n\n[[Page S528]]\n\nand effects of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. As a \nresult of the office's high profile work, the urgent issue of violence \nagainst women has come into much sharper public focus.\n  Making permanent the Violence Against Women Office in the Justice \nDepartment is necessary to extend VAWA's benefits to all corners of the \ncountry. The office has been the leader in promoting a multi-\ndisciplinary, community-coordinated system response to violence against \nwomen. Additionally, it has a specialized knowledge of the best \npractices in the field to ensure that the grant funds are well \nutilized. A statutory mandate would guarantee that the Violence Against \nWomen Office will continue this specialized work in future \nAdministrations, ensuring that Congress' goals regarding domestic \nviolence, sexual assault, and stalking will be carried out with the \nsame professional expertise that we have grown to appreciate over the \npast six years.\n  This office is needed now more than ever. Violence against women \ncontinues to ravage our society. In my own state, 40 women were \nmurdered by their partners in the year 2000 alone. This is more than in \nany other year on record. Nationally, a woman is battered every 15 \nseconds and 25 percent of women surveyed reported rape or physical \nabuse by a current or former spouse, partner or date.\n  The effects of these crimes extend far beyond the moment when they \noccur. One of the most compelling marks that violence against women \nleaves is on our children. It is estimated that between 3 and 10 \nmillion children witness violence in the home each year, and much of \nthis violence is persistent.\n  Studies indicate that children who witness their fathers beating \ntheir mothers suffer emotional problems, including slowed development \nand feelings of hopelessness, depression, and anxiety. Many of these \nchildren exhibit more aggressive, anti-social, and fearful behaviors. \nEven one episode of violence can produce post-traumatic stress disorder \nin children.\n  It is indisputable that even one incident of abuse inflicts a pain on \nour children that is unimaginable and often unending. It is also \nindisputable that domestic violence is devastating to the economic and \nphysical well-being of women and their families. For example, a study \nreported on in the St. Paul Pioneer Press found that 57 percent of the \nwomen surveyed said they had been threatened to the point that they \nwere afraid to go to school or work. Thirty percent were fired or left \na job because of abuse. 25 percent of homeless people on any given \nnight are women and children fleeing domestic abuse. 800,000 women per \nyear seek medical care as a result of injuries sustained in a sexual or \nphysical assault.\n  As this research indicates, violence against women permeates our \nsociety. It feeds on itself and it repeats itself generation after \ngeneration. People who try to keep family violence quiet and hidden \nbehind the walls of the home ignore its tragic echoes in our schools, \nin the workplace and on the streets. The Federal Government must always \nplay a role in combating this insidious epidemic. In the fight against \ndomestic violence, we are at the starting gate. Domestic Violence is \nnot going away and we as policy makers need to keep efforts to combat \nviolence against women at the forefront of our work.\n  With the Violence Against Women Office's leadership, we will continue \nto work together to bring justice to millions of women who suffer at \nthe hands of abusers everywhere. Through its work, we will ensure our \ncommitment to arrive at a day when many fewer women are threatened in \nour schools, in our businesses, on our streets and in our homes. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this critical office and the critical role we \nin the Federal Government can continue to play in the fight against \ndomestic violence, and I urge them to cosponsor this important measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 162. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na business credit against income for the purchase of fishing safety \nequipment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Commercial \nFishermen Safety Act of 2001, a bill to help fishermen purchase the \nlife-saving safety equipment they need to survive when disaster \nstrikes. I am very pleased to be joined by my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator John Kerry, in introducing this legislation. \nSenator Kerry is a true friend of fishermen and, as ranking member of \nthe Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee, a leader in the effort to \nsustain our fisheries and maintain the proud fishing tradition that \nexists in his State and in mine. The release last summer of the movie \n``The Perfect Storm'' provided millions of Americans with a glimpse of \nthe challenges and the dangers associated with earning a living in the \nfishing industry. Based on a true story, this movie, while very \ncompelling, merely scratches the surface of what it is like to be a \nmodern-day fisherman. Every day, members of our fishing community \nstruggle to cope with the pressures of running a small business, \ncomplying with extensive regulations, and maintaining their vessels and \nequipment. Added to these challenges are the dangers associated with \nfishing where disaster can strike in conditions that are far less \nextreme than those depicted by the movie.\n  Year in and year out, commercial fishing is among our Nation's most \ndangerous occupations. According to the data compiled by the Coast \nGuard and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 536 fishermen have lost their \nlives at sea since 1994. In fact, with an annual fatality rate of about \n140 deaths per 100,000 workers, fishing is 30 times more dangerous than \nthe average occupation.\n  The year 2000 will always be remembered in Maine's fishing \ncommunities as a year marked by tragedy. The year began with the loss \nof the trawler Two Friends, 12 miles off the coast of York, ME, on \nJanuary 25. Two of the three crew members died in icy waters after \ntheir vessel capsized in 16-foot seas. The year concluded with yet \nanother tragedy, the loss of the scallop dragger Little Raspy on \nDecember 14. Three fishermen died when the 30-foot vessel sank in \nChandler Bay near Jonesport, ME. All told, nine commercial fishermen \nlost their lives off the coast of Maine last year. That exceeded the \ncombined casualties of the 3 previous years.\n  The death of a 27-year-old fisherman just a few days ago in the Gulf \nof Maine adds to the grief endured by those in Maine's small, close-\nknit fishing communities still trying to cope with the tragedies of the \nlast year.\n  Yet as tragic as the year was, it could have been even worse. Heroic \nacts by the Coast Guard and other fishermen resulted in the rescue of \n13 commercial fishermen off the coast of Maine in the year 2000. In \nmost of these circumstances, the fishermen were returned to their loved \nones and families because they had access to safety equipment that made \nall the difference between life and death.\n  Shawn Rich, the surviving crew member of the vessel Two Friends, was \nfound wearing an immersion suit and clinging to the vessel's emergency \nposition indicating radio beacon, or EPIRB. That equipment is what made \nthe difference for him and allowed him to be rescued. The EPIRB strobe \nlight was spotted by a Coast Guard helicopter despite visibility that \nwas less than a quarter of a mile. His immersion suit, which can extend \nsurvival to as many as 6 hours in the icy waters of the North Atlantic, \nprotected the fisherman from water temperatures that would have \nresulted in death by hypothermia after less than 10 minutes of \nunprotected exposure.\n  Coast Guard regulations require all fishing vessels to carry safety \nequipment. These requirements vary depending on factors such as the \nsize of the vessel, the temperature of the water, and the distance the \nboat is traveling from shore to fish. Required equipment can include a \nliferaft that automatically inflates and floats free should the vessel \nsink; personal flotation devices, or immersion suits which can help \nprotect fishermen from exposure, as well as to increase buoyancy; \nEPIRBs, which relay a downed vessel's position to the Coast Guard \nsearch and rescue personnel; visual distress signals; and fire \nextinguishers.\n  This equipment is absolutely critical to surviving an emergency at \nsea. Maggie Raymond of South Berwick, ME, the owner of the fishing \nvessel Olympia, put it well when she said:\n\n\n[[Page S529]]\n\n\n       It is just not possible to overstate the importance of the \n     safety equipment. Along the coast of Maine, fishing \n     communities continue to mourn the nine fishermen lost last \n     year. At the same time, 13 fishermen were saved because they \n     were able to get into a survival suit on time or to get into \n     the liferaft, or because they were found literally clinging \n     to an EPIRB. Without this life-safety equipment, the casualty \n     toll would have been much higher.\n\n  When an emergency arises, safety equipment is priceless. At all other \ntimes, however, the cost of purchasing or maintaining liferafts, \nimmersion suits, and EPIRBs must compete with essential expenses such \nas loan payments, wages, fuel, maintenance, and insurance. Meeting all \nof these obligations is made much more difficult by a regulatory \nframework that limits the amount of time a fisherman can spend at sea \nand gear alterations that are used to manage our marine resources.\n  Most of the fishermen whom I know are more than willing to do their \npart to sustain our marine resources. But the reality is that when \nfishermen are required to limit their catch, they are also limited in \ntheir ability to generate sufficient income to meet the costs \nassociated with maintaining their vessels. The bill I am introducing \ntoday makes it clear that fishermen should not have to compromise their \nsafety in order to make a living in their chosen occupation.\n  The Commercial Fishermen Safety Act of 2001 lends fisherman a helping \nhand in preparing in case disaster strikes. My legislation provides a \ntax credit equal to 75 percent of the amount paid by fishermen to \npurchase or maintain required safety equipment. The tax credit would be \ncapped at $1,500. The items I have mentioned can literally cost \nthousands of dollars. The tax credit will make this life-saving \nequipment more affordable for more fishermen who currently face more \nlimited options under the Federal Tax Code.\n  Safety equipment saves lives in an occupation that has suffered far \ntoo many tragedies, far too many losses. By extending a tax credit for \nthe purchase of federally required safety equipment, Congress can help \nensure that fishermen have a better chance of returning home each and \nevery time they head out to sea.\n  I hope as part of our tax deliberations this year this important \nlegislation will be enacted and signed into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor the Commercial \nFishermen Safety Act of 2001. I would like to thank the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins, for asking me to introduce this bill with her. This \nlegislation would provide fishermen with a tax credit of up to $1,500 \nfor the purchase of safety equipment that will help save lives at sea \nsuch as life rafts, immersion suits and Emergency Position Indicating \nRadio Beacons (EPIRBS).\n  The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ranks \ncommercial fishing as the most dangerous occupation in America, with \napproximately 130 deaths a year per 100,000 employees. Nearly 90 \npercent of all fishing related deaths result from drowning--whether a \nfisherman falls overboard by slipping on a wet or icy deck, is washed \noff deck by a wave or is dragged under by a hook or line. In the cold \nwaters off New England and Alaska, a fisherman who goes overboard \nwithout an immersion suit has about 6 minutes to be rescued by his \nshipmates. But fishermen with fully functional immersion suits and life \nrafts are more than twice as likely to survive the sinking of their \nvessel.\n  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts knows all to well the dangers of \ncommercial fishing. Gloucester is but one example of the toll it has \ntaken on our coastal fishing communities. Since 1650 the sea has \nclaimed an estimated 10,000 Gloucester fishermen. During the 19th \nCentury, Gloucester would typically lose 200 fishermen annually--about \n4 percent of the city's population--to storms in the Gulf of Maine and \nthe Grand Banks. Today, even while the National Weather Service \nprovides timely and accurate forecasts so that we no longer have entire \nfleets caught on the fishing grounds during a major storm, the tragic \nstatistics continue to roll in.\n  The shocking loss of 11 fishermen in the Mid-Atlantic in two short \nmonths during 1998-1999 was unfortunately not an anomaly, but typical \nof historic trends, according to a Fishing Vessel Safety Task Force \nconvened to investigate the problem. The Task Force also determined the \ncommon conditions in these accidents were poor vessel or equipment \ncondition and inadequate preparation for emergencies--including basic \nequipment like life rafts, EPIRBs, and immersion suits. Confirming the \nTask Force's observations, last year the First Coast Guard District--\nwhose area of responsibility stretches from Maine to New Jersey --\nreported the death of 13 commercial fishermen. In addition, the \nDistrict reported saving 47 fishermen whose vessels had either sunk or \ncaught fire. The Coast Guard estimates that 23 of those fishermen are \nalive today because they had a life raft or immersion suit.\n  While safety is always a concern to our fishermen and their families, \nthe most immediate worry on their minds is declining profits from \ndwindling stocks and closed areas. In order to meet rebuilding plans \nfor our fish stocks regulators have been forced to implement trip \nlimits and closed areas to rebuild stocks. These measures are working \nand we are beginning to see some progress in New England. However a few \nfishermen, primarily in small boats, will travel far out to sea in \norder to fish outside the closed areas or in a place with a higher trip \nlimit. These fishermen often times cannot afford to replace or inspect \nold worn out life rafts and immersion suits and place themselves at \nextreme risk to meet their financial needs. This legislation will help \nthese fishermen put the equipment on their boats now not later and will \nsave lives.\n  It is important that we act on this legislation, so that we provide a \nfinancial incentive to fishermen who are facing financial hardship as \ntheir fisheries recover, to invest in the replacement and inspection of \ntheir survival gear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Torricelli):\n  S. 163. A bill to amend certain Federal civil rights statutes to \nprevent the involuntary application of arbitration to claims that arise \nfrom unlawful employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, \nsex, national origin, age, or disability, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Civil \nRights Procedures Protection Act of 2001. I am pleased that my \ncosponsors in the 106th Congress--Senators Leahy, Kennedy and \nTorricelli--have joined with me again in support of this legislation.\n  This bill addresses the rapidly growing and very troubling practice \nof employers conditioning employment or professional advancement upon \nthe employees' willingness to submit claims of discrimination or \nharassment to arbitration. In other words, employees who raise claims \nof harassment or discrimination must submit those claims to \narbitration, foregoing the right to go to court and any other remedies \nthat may exist under the laws of this nation. The right to seek redress \nin a court of law--including the right to a jury trial--is one of the \nmost basic rights accorded to employees in this nation. In the Civil \nRights Act of 1991, Congress expressly created this right to a jury \ntrial for employees when it voted overwhelmingly to amend Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964. But employers are undermining the intent \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and other civil rights and labor laws, \nsuch as the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, by requiring \nall employees to submit to mandatory, binding arbitration as a \ncondition of employment or advancement before a claim has arisen.\n  Increasingly, working men and women are faced with the choice of \naccepting a mandatory arbitration clause in their employment agreement \nor no employment at all. Despite the appearance of a freely negotiated \ncontract, the reality often amounts to a non-negotiable requirement \nthat prospective employees relinquish their rights to redress in a \ncourt of law. Mandatory arbitration allows employers to tell all \ncurrent and prospective employees in effect, ``If you want to work for \nus, you will have to check your rights at the door.'' These \nrequirements have been referred to as ``front door'' contracts: they \nrequire an employee to surrender\n\n[[Page S530]]\n\ncertain rights in order to ``get in the front door.'' As a nation which \nvalues work and deplores discrimination, we should not allow this \npractice to continue.\n  How then does the practice of mandatory, binding arbitration comport \nwith the purpose and spirit of our nation's civil rights and sexual \nharassment laws? The answer is simply that it does not. To address the \ngrowing incidents of compulsory arbitration, the Civil Rights \nProcedures Protection Act of 2001 amends seven civil rights statutes to \nguarantee that a federal civil rights or sexual harassment plaintiff \ncan still seek the protection of the U.S. courts rather than be forced \ninto mandatory, binding arbitration. Specifically, this legislation \naffects claims raised under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1965, \nSection 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, Section 1977 of the Revised Statutes, the Equal Pay \nAct, the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Federal Arbitration Act, \nFAA. By amending the Federal Arbitration Act, the protections of this \nlegislation are extended to claims of unlawful discrimination arising \nunder State or local law and other Federal laws that prohibit job \ndiscrimination.\n  This bill is not anti-arbitration, anti-mediation, or anti-\nalternative dispute resolution. I have long been and will remain a \nstrong supporter of voluntary, alternative methods of dispute \nresolution that allow the parties to choose whether to go to court. \nRather, this bill targets only mandatory, binding arbitration clauses \nin employment contracts entered into by the employer and employee \nbefore a dispute has even arisen.\n  The 107th Congress marks the fifth successive Congress in which I \nhave introduced this important legislation. In recent years, we have \nmade some advances in addressing the unfair use of mandatory, binding \narbitration clauses. As a result of a hearing in the Banking Committee \nin 1998 and a series of articles and editorials in prominent \nperiodicals, the National Association of Securities Dealers, NASD, \nagreed to remove the mandatory binding arbitration clause from its Form \nU-4, which all prospective securities dealers sign as a condition of \nemployment. The NASD's decision to remove the binding arbitration \nclause, however, does not prohibit its constituent organizations from \nincluding a mandatory, binding arbitration clause in their own \nemployment agreements, even if it is not mandated by the industry as a \nwhole. Last spring, the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative \nOversight and the Courts, chaired by my distinguished colleague from \nIowa, Senator Grassley, held a hearing on contractual mandatory, \nbinding arbitration and highlighted the problem in the employment area. \nThese are positive developments, but the trend toward the use of \nmandatory, binding arbitration clauses continues. A legislative fix is \nneeded.\n  The Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act restores the right of \nworking men and women to pursue their claims in the venue that they \nchoose, which, in turn, restores the spirit of our nation's civil \nrights and sexual harassment laws. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 163\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prepare tomorrows teachers to use technology \nthrough pre-service and in-service training, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill \nfor consideration in the context of the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. Earlier this week, I introduced \nmy accountability bill designed to ensure that the taxpayers' \ninvestment in education is adequately protected and that the finest \neducation is provided to our children by attaching performance-based \naccountability to the federal education programs encompassed in the \nESEA. I believe the issue of accountability for results will be at the \ncenter of our debate this year so I introduced and spoke about that \nbill separately. Nevertheless, I believe that our efforts to ensure \nthat schools are accountable for the education of our children requires \nthat we provide resources to schools so that they can make full use of \navailable teaching tools. Training teachers to use technology in their \nclassrooms is a high priority in this regard if we are to help our \nchildren become full and active members of the global community. The \nbill I am introducing today addresses that priority. I am pleased that \nmy colleagues Senator Cochran and Senator Rockefeller have joined me in \ncosponsoring this bill that I believe will generate bipartisan support.\n  Educational technology can enlarge the classroom environment in ways \nthat were unimaginable only a decade ago and can empower students to \ndevelop independent thinking and problem solving skills. The Technology \nfor Teachers Act is designed to address the need to provide teachers \nwith the skills to use this valuable resource in the classroom. Experts \nurge us to increase our investment in training teachers to use \ntechnology in the classroom and point out that at least 30 percent of \nour technology budget should be used for this purpose. Yet few of the \nnation's teachers have had more than one or two courses in educational \ntechnology, and those courses are usually designed as an add-on to \nother methods courses instead of being well-integrated into their \nteacher preparation program. The Training for Technology Act would \nprovide grants to consortia of higher education institutions and public \nschool districts so that they can integrate technology into their \nteacher training programs at the pre-service level. In addition, the \nbill requires recipients of Technology Literacy Challenge grants--an \nexisting program which I sponsored in the 1994 reauthorization of \nESEA--to demonstrate that they are using at lest 30% of their \ntechnology funding on in-service training in the use of technology.\n  In order to ensure that our children are well-prepared to meet the \nchallenges of an increasingly complex and challenging world, it is \ncritical to address improving our Nation's schools with a comprehensive \neffort. The bills I have introduced are designed to build on the \nprogress we have made in the past few years to raise standards and \nincrease accountability in America's schools. This bill seeks to \nprovide educators with the resources to meet these increased demands. I \nurge my colleagues to carefully consider supporting passage of this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the bill printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 164\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Agriculture Market Transition Act to \nincrease loan rates for marketing assistance loans for each of the 2001 \nand 2002 crops, to make nonrecourse marketing assistance loans and loan \ndeficiency payments available to producers of dry peas, lentils, \nchickpeas, and rye, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk \nabout farming. The pages of the calendar have now turned. It is a new \nyear, but our family farmers face the same struggle, and in fact, in \nmany ways, the struggle gets worse.\n  Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation titled the FARM \nEquity Act of 2001 that is designed to equalize the presently disparate \ncommodity Marketing Assistance Loan rates of the current farm bill, \ncommonly referred to as Freedom to Farm. The legislation would increase \nall commodity loan rates up to soybean and minor oilseed loan levels \nbased on historical price ratios amongst the commodities. The FARM \nEquity Act would also treat all commodities equally in that it would \nplace a price floor under all commodity loan rates, not just a select \nfew.\n  The FARM Equity Act will leave soybeans at the current loan level--\n$5.26 per bushel. This price is about 85 percent of the Olympic Average \nof soybean market prices from the years 1994 to 1998. All other crops \nwill be equalized up to this same price ratio related to each crops \nrespective Olympic Average during the same time period. Equalized loan \nrates for wheat would be $3.14 per bushel, for corn--$2.09 per bushel, \nfor rice--7.8 cents per pound and for cotton--52.6 cents per pound. All \nthese loan levels would become minimum loan levels.\n  When Freedom to Farm was passed, supporters intended that this new \nfarm legislation would remove all government interference or influences \nfrom planting decisions. ``Let farmers take their cues from the market \nplace'', was heard often during the debate. ``From now on, farmers will \nnot plant their crops with an eye towards Washington--they will plant \nwhat the market tells them to plant.''\n  I doubt anyone believes, let alone could debate the point with a \nstraight face, that this major premise of Freedom to Farm--the notion \nof market based planting decisions--has become a reality. To the \ncontrary, at the present time, the major influence on what type of seed \ngoes into the ground on our nation's farms is the level of Market \nAssistance Loan rates available for the various program crops.\n  There can be no dispute that soybeans, and the other minor oilseed \ncrops, have a much higher loan rate--when compared to historical price \nratios--than wheat, corn and the other minor feed grains, cotton and \nrice. Likewise, there can be no dispute that the unprecedented increase \nin soybeans and oilseeds acreage seen the last couple of years, is due \nin large part, to these arbitrarily set unequal loan rates. Farmers \nhave little choice but to plant more acres of oilseeds for the higher \nloan value, even thought the cash and future markets clearly signal for \nthem to do otherwise.\n  Does anyone remember ``Green Acres,'' the old TV show from the \nsixties that poked fun of the city slicker--and country folks, for that \nmatter--who moved out from New York City to start farming? One of the \nepisodes had to do with deciding what crop to plant. I can't remember \nthe exact order of events, but the gist of it was this. Oliver Wendell \nDouglas--played by Eddie Albert--listened to the market report while \nhaving breakfast the morning he was going to start spring planting. The \nprice of corn was up, while soybean prices were down, so Oliver \nfinished breakfast and away he went to the general store to buy some \ncorn seed from Sam Drucker. Oliver then headed out to his field to \nplant corn.\n  About noon, Oliver came home for dinner. Now I know to most this meal \nis lunch, but trust me, on the farm--it is called dinner; farmers also \nhave a meal called supper that takes place in the evening. But, let's \nget back to Oliver. While he was eating his dinner, the noon markets \ncame on, and wouldn't you know it, corn was down, and soybeans were up. \nWell, Oliver was all upset, since he had already planted some of the \ncorn.\n  Lisa, Oliver's wife, told him just exchange the seed for a different \nkind, ``I always return what I buy back to the stores; why can't you \njust exchange the corn for some soybeans, if that's what you want to \nplant now?''\n  Oliver agreed with his wife, and went out and dug up the corn seed, \nput it back in the sack, and headed back to the supply store to trade \nit in for soybeans. Sam Drucker thought he was nuts, of course, and \neveryone had a good laugh.\n  Preposterous of course, this parody of farmer indecision where seed \nis actually picked out of the ground, but I mention this episode only \nbecause today, Oliver Wendell Douglas wouldn't have his ear turned to \nthe market reports to decide what to plant. He would simply seed \nsoybeans because everyone knows the loan price is the only price that \nmatters these days.\n  In fact, one market advisor in the Midwest is promoting a ``Plan B'' \nthis year that encourages farmers to plant even more soybeans than last \nyears record acreage because of the high loan rates in hopes of \ndecreasing corn acres enough to increase those prices. Probably not a \nbad idea, given the present market prices and high nitrogen costs. But, \nit's a clear indication of how skewed the present loan levels actually \nare.\n  Just how much effect on U.S. crop acres are these unequal loan rates \nhaving? We need look no further than the annual acreage reports issued \nby USDA. In 1994, US farmers planted a little over 61.6 million acres \nof soybeans. This past year, a record 74.5 million acres were planted \nto soybeans, an increase of over 20 percent.\n  For all wheat, USDA tells us the complete opposite is taking place. \nThe acreage planted in the U.S. has declined over 12 percent during \nthis same period, from 70.3 million acres down to 62.5 acres. A few \nweeks ago, USDA reported that the winter wheat acreage seeded last fall \nis down 5 percent from the fall before. The 41.3 million acres planted \nfor harvest this coming summer is the smallest acreage devoted to \nwinter wheat since 1971.\n  To those who will say that we shouldn't change the components of the \npresent Farm Bill in mid-stream, I say, we have repeatedly changed it \neach of the last three years now. We have had three emergency spending \nbills due to the low commodity prices. We have changed payment limits \non the Loan Deficiency Payments. I might add, equalizing loan rates \nwill do more for medium sized family farms than uncapping LDP limits.\n\n[[Page S533]]\n\n  Former Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman also used his \nadministrative authority to keep the loan levels at current levels. \nJust last month, he froze commodity loans at 2000 levels for the 2001 \ncrop. Had he not, the loan for wheat would have fallen to $2.46, while \ncorn would have dropped to $1.76. Even soybeans would have fallen, \nalthough not to what the formula calls for. You see, soybeans have a \nprice floor at $4.92 a bushel. If not for this mandated floor specified \nin the law, the formula in Freedom to Farm would have called for a \nprice of $4.58 per bushel.\n  Now, I am pleased that the Secretary of Agriculture did this. I found \nit interesting that I received a few calls from angry farmers when the \nformer Agriculture Secretary froze loan rates for the coming year at \n2000 levels. They thought he should have raised them and had determined \nhis actions were vindictive and meant only to keep commodity loans at \nthese low levels. As I have stated, Secretary Glickman prevented \npresent law from dropping loan prices even further.\n  I don't want to see anymore reductions in loan levels for any of our \ncrops. I want all crops to be treated fairly, and equally. I want all \ncrops to have the same relative level of price protection. And if one \nor two crops have a loan floor that prevents further erosion in loan \nprotection, then all crops should enjoy such a loan floor. That's why I \nhave introduced this legislation.\n  This is not to say that the loan levels in this legislation are \nadequate. They are not. This is only the first step in many that we \nneed to take to fix broken farm policy. And this legislation will put \nall crops on equal footing as we enter the debate on what will \neventually replace Freedom to Farm. I would prefer that loan levels \nwould be higher, that they would reflect the cost of production. Maybe \nlater we can have some common sense farm policy that would do such a \nthing, but for now, I think this is the least that we should do, as far \nas loan rates are concerned.\n  Although it is not mentioned in this legislation, as part of this \ninterim step to preserve our farms, I believe we should restore the \nautomatic 20 percent reduction in Agricultural Market Transition \nPayments that will take place this year. It should be restored to the \n2000 levels for the remaining two years of Freedom to Farm, or until we \nreplace this legislation altogether. I know others are thinking this \nneeds to be done, and I want to go on record as supporting this \nrestoration of AMTA payments.\n  Before I close, I want to point out the steady erosion of the loan \nlevels for most crops over the years. This year, 2001, if this \nlegislation isn't enacted, the national loan for wheat will stand at \n$2.58 per bushel. In 1983, the wheat loan was $3.65 per bushel. For \ncorn, the present loan rate is $1.89, while in 1983 it was $2.65 per \nbushel. For rice, this year's loan is $6.50 per cwt. In 1983, the rice \nloan was $8.13 per cwt. Cotton's loan this year stands at 52.9 cents \nper lb. 1982 saw a cotton loan rate of a little over 57 cents per lb.\n  Now, I saved soybeans until last, for good reason. Of all the major \ncrops, soybeans stand alone in that it has a higher loan rate today, \nthan in the early 1980's. The soybean loan stood at $5.02 twenty years \nago, while today, the loan is $5.26. All the other crops dropped, some \nmore than others, percentage wise. All, except for soybeans.\n  I would also like to point out that the cost of production has \nskyrocketed for all crops the past twenty years. This year alone, \nfarmers are facing an astronomical increase in anhydrous ammonia \nprices--the major form of nitrogen fertilizer--due to the skyrocketing \nnatural gas prices. As you may know, natural gas comprises 78 percent \nof anhydrous' cost of production. Because of this, family farmers in \nNorth Dakota, and across the country, are facing a possible doubling of \ntheir nitrogen fertilizer costs, from the low $200's per ton last year \nto well over $400 per ton this year.\n  The cost of fertilizer is just one of many examples where farm costs \nhave skyrocketed. Others include their crop protection products, \ninsurance costs, machinery costs, etc. The list goes on. No other \nsegment of our economy has been asked to take less and less for their \nlabors.\n  As I have stated earlier, this legislation, the FARM Equity Act of \n2001, is only an interim step. It is not a new farm bill, nor is it the \nanswer to the problems. But I believe we should take action now to \nequalize the loan rates. Let's pass this legislation that would leave \nsoybeans and other oilseeds at their present loan level while raising \nother crops up to the same relative level, based on historical market \nprice relationships as soybeans. It is fair. It is equitable. It is the \nright thing to do.\n  Mr. President, we have families living all across this country out in \nthe country trying to make a go of it on a family farm: Plant some \nseeds, raise a crop, then harvest that crop, take it to the grain \nelevator, and try to raise enough money to keep going and pay the \nbills.\n  In addition to having collapsed prices for that which they produce, \nfarmers now see the cost of their inputs dramatically increasing. The \ncost of anhydrous ammonia, the most popular form of nitrogen \nfertilizer, is up dramatically because of the spike in natural gas \ncosts.\n  Farmers are beset in every direction: Monopolies in transportation, \nnear monopolies in the grain trade business, and a collapse of the \nprices for that which farmers produce. It is an awfully difficult time.\n  So what can be done about this? My first hope would be that this \nCongress would rewrite the current farm bill. I do not think it works \nvery well. I do not think we ought to get rid of all of it. The \nplanting flexibility makes sense. Let's keep it. But clearly the \ncurrent farm bill has not worked very well. Let's rewrite it and \nprovide a price support or a bridge across price valleys for family \nfarmers that give them some hope that if they do a good job, and work \nhard, they have a chance to survive out on the family farm.\n  But I am told that rewriting the farm bill is not going to happen \nthis year because it expires at the end of next year. I understand that \nthe chairman of the Agriculture Committee in the Senate does not want \nto hold hearings on trying to rewrite the farm bill this year. He \ncertainly has the capability of blocking that. I respect him, but I \nwould disagree with him about this issue. But it is likely we will not \nsee progress in rewriting the farm bill this year.\n  So then, what should we do? In my judgment, we ought to at least take \nan interim step that would restore some balance to the current price \nprotection that exists, as anemic as it is. We ought to provide some \nbalance and equality to that price protection with respect to those of \nus who come from the part of the country that produces mostly wheat and \nfeed grains.\n  We have a circumstance now where the current price support, which is, \nin my judgment, too low, nonetheless has an inequity about it that \noffers a price support substantially higher for oil seeds than it does \nfor wheat and feed grains. I am not here to suggest that we take the \nprice support for oil seeds down. I am suggesting that it is unfair to \nwheat and feed grains and we ought to bring their price support up to \nprovide some equity and fairness. And there is a way to do that.\n  I would like to show a couple charts of what has been happening. This \nchart shows crop acres. You can see, going back to 1994, that soybean \nacreage is increasing and wheat acreage is declining, both \nsubstantially.\n  What is happening this year is, a number of farmers are making \ndecisions about what to plant, and it has nothing to do with what the \nmarkets suggest they should plant. It has to do with what their lender \nwould calculate is best for them to plant given the farm program price \nsupport loan levels of the various crops. The loan deficiency payment \nfor oil seeds is much higher than for wheat and feed grains on a \ncomparable basis, because the loan levels that determine the loan \ndeficiency payments are likewise, much higher for oil seeds than the \nother crops. So the result is, they are making planting decisions, once \nagain, based on the farm bill rather than on the market. It is because \nwe have inequitable price support programs. You can see what has \nhappened with the loan rates over time. With soybeans, loan rates have \nincreased slightly over the last twenty years, while wheat, corn and \nother feed grain loan rates have declined substantially during the same \ntime period.\n  My point is this. We ought to be able to provide equity in these loan \nrates by\n\n[[Page S534]]\n\nbringing the loan rate for wheat and feed grains up to an equitable \nlevel relative to oilseed levels. Doing so would, likewise, provide an \nequitable loan deficiency payment for all crops and would stop this \ncalculation of, What should I plant relative to what the farm program \nthinks I should plant?\n  As Freedom to Farm passed, its supporters were saying: Let's have the \nmarket system send signals on what ought to be planted. That is not \nhappening at the moment. It is the farm program that is determining \nwhat is being planted because of the skewed loan support prices. It is \nthe farm program that is actually promoting that incentive to plant one \nthing versus another thing. I am not suggesting we fix it by reducing \nthe loan rate or the loan deficiency payment for oilseeds. We ought not \ndo that. We ought to bring the loan rate for the others up because \nthose levels are too low, when compared to oilseeds. It is unfair to \nthem.\n  Some will remember the old television program ``Green Acres'' from \nlong ago in the 1960s. Eddie Albert played a character named Oliver \nWendell Douglas, who had a pig named Arnold. He was a city slicker who \nmoved to the country. It was a television program that poked fun at \nboth the city slicker and maybe also at country folks. It was a comedy.\n  In one episode, Oliver is having breakfast one morning. He is trying \nto figure out what to plant. He hears the morning grain market report \non the radio, and the price of soybeans was going down and the price of \ncorn was going up. So he decided to go down to the general store and \nget himself some corn seed. All morning he planted corn.\n  At noon, Oliver came in for dinner. Back home they call it dinner in \nthe middle of the day; some people call it lunch, but we call it \ndinner. He came back for dinner and discovered on the radio that the \nprice of corn was down and the price of soybeans was up, according to \nthe noon market report. And he said to his wife: It is kind of hard to \nfigure out what to do here. I just planted corn because the radio said \ncorn was up. Now corn is down, soybeans are up.\n  His wife said: When I go to the store and get something that doesn't \nwork, I take it back.\n  So this old character on ``Green Acres'' went out to the field, \nwalked down the furrows and pulled out all of his corn seeds and went \nback to the store to trade them in for soybean seed. Of course, the old \nboy who ran the store that sold him the seed thought he was pretty \ngoofy.\n  My point about this story is, Oliver Douglas wouldn't have to listen, \nunder today's circumstances, to the radio market reports to evaluate \nwhat he ought to plant, to find out what is down or what is up. In \ntoday's circumstances, when you take a look at the farm program, what \nis up is a better loan rate for oilseeds, and what is down is an anemic \nloan rate for wheat and feed grains.\n  What can be done about that? Bring wheat and feed grain loan rates up \nto where they ought to be. That only brings wheat to $3.14 a bushel, \nbut it is a far sight better than where it is today, at $2.58.\n  So today, I am introducing a piece of legislation that equalizes loan \nrates. It will not penalize oilseeds. It will leave them where they \nare. Good for them; I want that. I support that and will fight for \nthat. But it will take the loan rate for other program crops, including \nwheat, corn, and rice, cotton, and put those loan rates where they \nought to be relative to some equity vis-a-vis oilseeds.\n  I am going to include in the Record a list of all the program crops \nand where I propose we establish their loan rates. The loan rates for \nthe various crops were determined by fixing them at the same percentage \nof their 1994-1998 5-year Olympic Average of market prices as the \nsoybean loan rate is with respect to its 1994-1998 5-year Olympic \nAverage of market prices.\n  This is only an interim step. We must do much more, and I have other \nideas on what we ought to do. But for now, at least as a first step, \nlet's provide some fairness for those who are producing wheat and feed \ngrains.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the \nOlympic Average price data to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Family Agriculture Recovery & Market (Farm) Equity Act of 2001\n\n       For the 2001 & 2002 Crop Year, The ``FARM Equity'' Act \n     would:\n       Equalize the Marketing Loan rate for commodities relative \n     to the current soybean rates. Wheat--$3.14; corn--$2.09; \n     soybeans (unchanged)--$5.26; cotton--$58.26/cwt.; rice--\n     $7.81/cwt.; base other feed grain loan rates on their own \n     price history rather than based off the corn rate. Barley--\n     $2.01; oats--$1.27; grain sorghum--$1.89; base other oil seed \n     rates off their own price history rather than the soybean \n     loan rate. Oil sunflower--$.0930/lb.; confection sunflower--\n     $.1176/lb.; canola--$.0945/lb.; safflower--$.1259/lb.\n       Place a floor under all commodity loan rates, not just \n     soybean, cotton and rice loan rates.\n       Remove the cap on all commodity loan rates and allow them \n     to increase if the most recent five year Olympic Average of \n     prices of a commodity increases to a level that warrants such \n     an increase.\n       Remove the incentive to continue the obvious current \n     prevalent practice of planting for the commodity loan rate, \n     and thus the overproduction of commodities (oilseeds) that \n     have significantly higher loan rates relative to the actual \n     historical market price ratios.\n       Keep AMTA payments in place, along with all present payment \n     limitations.\n       Enable farmers to practice agronomically sound rotations \n     rather than planting for the government loan.\n       Place all commodities on a level playing field with regards \n     to loan rates prior to the debate about the next farm bill.\n       Add dry peas, lentils, chickpeas and rye to the list of \n     crops eligible for Marketing Assistance Loans, increasing the \n     rotational choices for farmers in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\n                How Were The New Loan Prices Arrived At?\n\n       The 1994-1998 Olympic Average price for a bushel of \n     soybeans is $6.22, as determined by USDA. The present Freedom \n     To Farm loan level for soybeans is $5.26. This is 84.5 \n     percent of the 94-98 Oly price average.\n       The loan prices for the other crops listed in the FARM \n     Equity Act were derived by taking the soybean factor--\n     84.57%--against the other crops' 94-98 Olympic Price \n     averages.\n       Oil Sunflowers and Flaxseed were left at the present $.0930 \n     per lb. since applying the factor against their Olympic Price \n     averages would have lowered their loan rate--an occurrence \n     that no farm advocate wants for any crop during these hard \n     times down on the farm.\n       The ``94-98'' time frame was used, since the seeding \n     distortions and subsequent price distortions caused by \n     Freedom to Farm's disparate loan rates had not yet infected \n     the moving 5 yr. average.\n       Find below the loan levels: Marketing Loan Rates were \n     determined by their price history during the years 1994 \n     through 1998\n\n \n                                                    ``94-98''\n                                          F2F loan   Olympic   Equalized\n                  Crop                      rates     price      loans\n                                                     average\n \nWheat...................................     $2.58      $3.71      $3.14\nCorn (bus)..............................      1.89       2.47       2.90\nGrain Sorghum (bus).....................      1.71       2.23       1.89\nBarley (bus)............................      1.61       2.38       2.01\nOats (bus)..............................      1.16       1.50       1.27\nUpland Cotton (lb)......................    0.5192     0.6883     0.5826\nEL Staple Cotton (lb)...................    0.7965     1.0360     0.8761\nRice (cwt)..............................      6.50       9.23       7.81\nSoybeans (bus)..........................      5.26       6.22       5.26\nOil Sunflower (lb)......................    0.0930     0.1060     0.0930\nNonoil Sunflower (lb)...................    0.0930     0.1390     0.1176\nCanola (lb).............................    0.0930     0.1117     0.0945\nRapeseed (lb)...........................    0.0930     0.1183     0.1001\nSafflower (lb)..........................    0.0930     0.1487     0.1259\nMustard Seed (lb).......................    0.0930     0.1390     0.1176\nFlaxseed (lb)...........................    0.0930     0.0963     0.0930\nRye (bus)...............................

Under the current \nprogram, even though all of the support prices are too low, wheat and \nfeed grains are being treated unfairly and ought to be brought up to \nwhere they should be and we would have a right to expect them to be. I \nhave included all of the significant numbers and support price \nproposals in the Record. I hope my colleagues will join me in seeing if \nwe can at least take an interim step and pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 165\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to limit access to body armor by violent felons and to \nfacilitate the donation of Federal surplus body armor to State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today, along with Senator \nSessions of Alabama, to reintroduce the James Guelff Body Armor Act for \nthe fourth consecutive Congress.\n  This bill closes a glaring gap in our criminal law that permits \nindividuals with even the grimmest history of criminal violence to use \nbody armor. It is unquestionable that criminals with violent intentions \nare more dangerous when they are wearing body armor, and are more \ndifficult for police to disarm and disable.\n  This bill is named in memory of San Francisco Police Officer James \nGuelff. On November 13, 1994, Officer Guelff was shot to death in a \nfire-fight by a\n\n[[Page S536]]\n\nheavily armed gunman wearing a bullet-proof vest and kevlar helmet on a \nmajor street corner in San Francisco. Because of his protective gear, \nthe assailant was subsequently able to hold off over a hundred police \nofficers.\n  California is not the only state where heavily armored criminals have \nassaulted police officers and the community.\n  In 1999, Officer James Snedigar of the Chandler, Arizona Police \ndepartment was shot and killed by a gunman firing an AK-47 who was also \nprotected by a kevlar vest.\n  In March of 2000, Deputy Ricky Kinchen of Atlanta, Georgia, was \nkilled in a shootout with a gunman who wore a bulletproof vest.\n  On July 15, 2000, Sergeant Todd Stamper of the Crandon, Wisconsin \npolice department, was killed in a gun fight by a heavily armed man \nwearing a kevlar helmet and body armor.\n  Lee Guelff, James Guelff's brother, wrote to me about the need to \nrevise the laws relating to body armor. His words eloquently explain \nthe need for the legislation:\n\n       It's bad enough when officers have to face gunmen in \n     possession of superior firepower. * * * But to have to \n     confront suspects shielded by equal or better defensive \n     protection as well goes beyond the bounds of acceptable risk \n     for officers and citizens alike. No officer should have to \n     face the same set of deadly circumstances again.\n\n  Our laws need to recognize that body armor in the possession of a \ncriminal is an offensive weapon. Police officers serving on the streets \nshould have ready access to body armor, and hardened-criminals need to \nbe deterred from using it.\n  The James Guelff Body Armor Act of 2001 has three key provisions. \nFirst, it directs the United States Sentencing Commission to develop a \npenalty enhancement for criminals who commit violent crimes while \nwearing body armor. Second, it prohibits violent felons from \npurchasing, using, or possessing body armor. Third, this bill enables \nFederal law enforcement agencies to directly donate surplus body armor \nto local police. I will address each of these three provisions.\n  I. Enhanced criminal penalties for wearing body armor during violent \ncrimes.--Criminals who wear body armor while engaged in violent crimes \ndeserve enhanced penalties because they pose an enhanced threat to \npolice and civilians alike. Assailants shielded by body armor can shoot \nat the police and civilians with less fear than individuals not so well \nprotected.\n  The James Guelff Body Armor Act directs the United States Sentencing \nCommission to develop an appropriate sentence enhancement for wearing \nbody armor during a violent crime. The bill also expresses the Sense of \nthe Senate that any enhancement should be at least two levels.\n  II. Prohibiting violent felons from wearing body armor.--This section \nmakes it a crime (up to three years in jail) for individuals with a \nviolent criminal record to wear, possess, or own body armor. It is \nunconscionable that criminals can obtain and wear body armor without \nrestriction when so many of our police lack comparable protection.\n  To account for those rare circumstances when a felon may need body \narmor as part of a lawful occupation, the section provides an \naffirmative defense against prosecution if the felon wore armor after \nobtaining permission from employer, and possession of armor was \nnecessary for safe performance of lawful business activity.\n  III. Direct donation of body armor.--The James Guelff Body Armor Act \nof 2001 also empowers Federal agencies to expedite the donation of body \narmor to local police departments.\n  Far too many local police officers do not have access to bullet-proof \nvests. The United States Department of Justice estimates that 25% of \nState, local, and tribal law enforcement officers, approximately \n150,000 officers, are not issued body armor.\n  Supplying local police officers with more body armor will save lives. \nAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, greater than 30% of \nthe approximately 1,300 officers killed by guns in the line of duty \nsince 1980 could have been saved by body armor, and the risk of dying \nfrom gunfire is 14 times higher for an officer without a bulletproof \nvest. Body armor saves an estimated 150 police officers' lives each \nyear.\n  The James Guelff Body Armor Act is backed by law enforcement officers \nall across America. Organizations representing over 500,000 police \nofficers have endorsed the legislation. These organizations include the \nFraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriff's Association, the \nNational Association of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the National \nTroopers Coalition, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Police Executive \nResearch Forum, the National Association of Police Organizations, and \nthe International Association of Police Chiefs.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, in sponsoring the James Guelff Body \nArmor Act of 2001.\n  This legislation is intended to deter criminals from wearing body \narmor and to empower Federal law enforcement agencies to donate surplus \nbody armor to State and local police departments.\n  This bipartisan legislation is named in honor of James Guelff, a \nCalifornia police officer who was murdered in the line of duty by an \nassailant wearing body armor and a bulletproof helmet.\n  As a Federal prosecutor for fifteen years, I developed a deep \nappreciation for the threats that our law enforcement officers face day \nto day as they wage the war on crime. In my home State of Alabama, \nEtowah County Officer Chris McCurley was murdered and Officer Gary \nEntrekin was critically injured in 1997 during a shootout with two \ncriminals shielded by body armor. This bill will make criminals like \nthese pay an extra price for using body armor while harming innocent, \nlaw-abiding people.\n  The James Guelff Body Armor Act addresses the abuse of body armor in \nthree ways:\n  First, the bill directs the United States Sentencing Commission to \namend the Sentencing Guidelines to include an enhancement for the use \nof body armor during a violent crime or a drug crime. Thus, criminals \nwho use body armor while attacking law enforcement officers or \ncivilians will spend longer terms in prison.\n  Second, the bill prohibits a person who has been convicted of a \nviolent felony from purchasing, owning, or possessing body armor. Once \na criminal has shown a propensity to violent action, he should not be \nable to use body armor to commit another crime and perhaps evade \ncapture by the police.\n  Third, the bill enables Federal law enforcement agencies to donate \nsurplus body armor, currently totaling approximately 10,000 vests, \ndirectly to State and local law enforcement agencies. By protecting our \npolice officers, sheriffs' deputies, and other State and local law \nenforcement officers with body armor, we can help ensure that more cops \ncome home to their families at the end of their day.\n  It is indisputable that getting our law enforcement officers more \nbody armor will save lives. According to the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, more than 30 percent of the officers killed by firearms \nin the line of duty since 1980 could have survived had they been \nwearing body armor.\n  In a survey of American voters in 1999 by the National Association of \nPolice Organizations, 83 percent supported passing laws to keep felons \nfrom wearing body armor during the commission of crimes. This is why a \nbroad bipartisan group of law enforcement organizations support this \nbill including: the Fraternal Order of Police, the National \nOrganization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation, the National Association of Police Organizations, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers, and the National Sheriffs \nAssociation.\n  Last year, a very similar bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee \nunanimously. It passed the entire Senate unanimously. It is time for \nCongress to act and to protect our law enforcement officers.\n  I call on my colleagues in the Senate, including Senator Feinstein, \nto join me, and the law enforcement community in supporting this \nimportant legislation that will save lives and provide\n\n[[Page S537]]\n\nlaw enforcement officers with more protection in their fight against \nthe most violent criminals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Allard, Mr. Brownback, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Craig, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Helms, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Lott, and Mr. \n        Sessions):\n  S. 167. A bill to allow a State to combine certain funds to improve \nthe academic achievement of all its students; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Academic \nAchievement for All Act. I am honored to introduce this legislation.\n  We begin this 107th Congress with the great opportunity to \ndramatically shape and change the federal government's role in \neducation. Never before have the American people been so focused on the \neducation system. With that focus comes great expectations. As a \nCongress, we must seize this opportunity and work together to \ncreatively improve how the federal government addresses education \nwithin our country.\n  We must continue the push to cut red tape and remove overly-\nprescriptive federal mandates on federal education funding. At the same \ntime, we must hold states and local schools accountable for increasing \nstudent achievement. Flexibility combined with accountability, must be \nour objective. The end result of our reform effort must spark \ninnovation--innovation designed to provide all students a world-class \neducation.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Task Force on \nEducation, I heard from almost every witness, both Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, how the sprawling, duplicative and unfocused \nbehemoth that is the current federal education establishment ties the \nhands of state and local school administrators, teachers and principals \nwith its burdensome regulations and rigidity. As a result, the very \nfirst recommendation of the Education Task Force Interim Report was to \nconsolidate federal education programs.\n  The number one recommendation read as follows:\n\n       In light of the continuing proliferation of federal \n     categorical programs, the Task Force recommends that federal \n     education programs be consolidated . . . The Task Force \n     particularly favors providing states flexibility to \n     consolidate all federal funds into an integrated state \n     strategic plan to achieve national educational objectives for \n     which the state would be held accountable.\n\n  In hopes of improving federal regulation of education as we currently \nknow it, Senators Gorton, Gregg, Hutchinson, Sessions and I worked last \nyear to create this bill. We decided to combine all of our good ideas \ninto Straight A's. Straight A's permits states to have the option of \nsubmitting a performance agreement, setting specific and measurable \nperformance goals that could be reached at the end of five years, in \nexchange for flexibility.\n  Straight A's is an optional program. States would still be free to \nadminister federal education programs under the current system if they \nso desired. If states choose to participate in the program, they would \nbe allowed to combine Federal K-12 funds in exchange for flexibility \nupon approval of their performance agreement. States can focus more \nfunds on disadvantaged students, teacher professional development, \nreducing class size, technology, or improved school facilities. At the \nend of five years, however, the state's efforts must increase the \nachievement of all students, including the lowest performing students.\n  If states do not substantially meet those goals, they would lose \ntheir Straight A's status, and they would have to return to the less \nflexible regulated approach available under current law. If states do \nwell and significantly reduce achievement gaps between high and low \nperforming students, they will be rewarded with additional funds. \nAdditionally, school districts would not lose any Title I funding. If \nTitle I is included by a state, each school district in the state would \nbe assured of receiving at least as much money as they received in the \npreceding fiscal year.\n  States and local school districts are innovative. Without question, \nit is states and localities that today are serving as the engines for \nchange in education. The groundwork for success is already in place at \nthe local level--teachers, parents, principals, and communities \ndemonstrate on a daily basis the enthusiasm and desire to succeed. \nHowever, flexibility at the state and local level is critical to the \nsuccess of our schools.\n  Although the federal government is prepared to assist in improving \nAmerica's schools, it is worth remembering the limitations of the \nfederal role in education. The federal government provides just 7 \npercent of education funding. But despite its limitations, the federal \ngovernment does have a role to play in revitalizing education. The \nfederal government can provide the focus and leadership to identify \nthose problems worthy of the collective energy of all Americans, and it \ncan commit resources to the states to supplement their efforts.\n  But along with the resources, the federal government must also give \nstates and localities the freedom to pursue their own strategies for \nimplementation. With respect to education, tactics and implementation \nprocedures are virtually dictated by the federal government. The \nrationale for expanding an already overly large and burdensome federal \neducation establishment is simply not discernible. Instead, the states \nshould have the flexibility to put together state strategic plans. \nUnder such a plan, the states would establish concrete educational \ngoals and timetables for achievement. In return, they would be allowed \nto pool federal funds from categorical programs and spend these \nconsolidated resources on state established priorities.\n  But, along with flexibility comes accountability. When we give states \nand local education agencies the freedom to use funds in the way that \nbest meets the needs of their students, we must expect from them \nincreased student performance. For too long accountability has been \nmeasured by quantitative measures rather than qualitative ones. We know \nthat we are spending $8 billion on Title I--the nation's largest \nfederal education program--to help disadvantaged children. But we do \nnot know if all that money is helping those students to learn. This \nmust change.\n  Our current system simply requires that you send the money to poor \nschools. I believe that there is no better catalyst for reform, no \nbetter way to ensure that poor children receive the same quality of \neducation as their wealthier counterparts--than requiring that states \ndemonstrate that their poor children are achieving.\n  The flexibility is needed to allow states to use whatever means \nnecessary to increase poor students' achievement. Unfortunately, after \n34 years and $120 billion spent on Title I, 70 percent of children in \nhigh poverty schools score below even the most basic level of reading. \nIn math, 4th graders in high poverty schools remain 2 grade levels \nbehind their peers in low poverty schools. In reading, they remain 3 to \n4 grade levels behind.\n  As a scientist, I know the value of looking for new way to solve \nproblems, and America has long had a proud tradition of innovation. \nThis bill will create a whole new generation of inventors in the field \nof education--in particular, Governors, local school boards, teachers, \nand parents will be better able to put good ideas into practice.\n  I strongly urge passage of this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 167\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Academic Achievement for All \n     Act'' or ``Straight A's Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to create options for States and \n     communities--\n       (1) to improve the academic achievement of all students, \n     and to focus the resources of the Federal Government upon \n     such achievement;\n       (2) to improve teacher quality and subject matter mastery, \n     especially in mathematics, reading, and science;\n       (3) to empower parents and schools to effectively address \n     the needs of their children and students;\n       (4) to give States and communities maximum freedom in \n     determining how to boost\n\n[[Page S538]]\n\n     academic achievement and implement education reforms;\n       (5) to eliminate Federal barriers to implementing effective \n     State and local education programs;\n       (6) to hold States and communities accountable for boosting \n     the academic achievement of all students, especially \n     disadvantaged children; and\n       (7) to narrow achievement gaps between the lowest and \n     highest performing groups of students so that no child is \n     left behind.\n\n     SEC. 3. PERFORMANCE AGREEMENT.\n\n       (a) Program Authorized.--States may, at their option, \n     execute a performance agreement with the Secretary under \n     which the provisions of law described in section 4(a) shall \n     not apply to such State except as otherwise provided in this \n     Act. The Secretary shall execute performance agreements with \n     States that submit approvable performance agreements under \n     this section.\n       (b) Local Input.--States shall provide parents, teachers, \n     and local schools and school districts notice and opportunity \n     to comment on any proposed performance agreement prior to \n     submission to the Secretary as provided under general State \n     law notice and comment provisions.\n       (c) Approval of Performance Agreement.--A performance \n     agreement submitted to the Secretary under this section shall \n     be considered as approved by the Secretary within 60 days \n     after receipt of the performance agreement unless the \n     Secretary, before the expiration of the 60-day period, \n     provides a written determination to the State that the \n     performance agreement fails to satisfy the requirements of \n     this Act.\n       (d) Terms of Performance Agreement.--Each performance \n     agreement executed pursuant to this Act shall comply with the \n     following provisions:\n       (1) Term.--The performance agreement shall contain a \n     statement that the term of the performance agreement shall be \n     5 years.\n       (2) Application of program requirements.--The performance \n     agreement shall contain a statement that no program \n     requirements of any program included by the State in the \n     performance agreement shall apply, except as otherwise \n     provided in this Act.\n       (3) List of programs.--The performance agreement shall \n     provide a list of the programs that the State wishes to \n     include in the performance agreement.\n       (4) Use of funds to improve student achievement.-- The \n     performance agreement shall contain a 5-year plan describing \n     how the State intends to combine and use the funds from \n     programs included in the performance agreement to advance the \n     education priorities of the State, improve student \n     achievement, and narrow achievement gaps between students.\n       (5) Accountability system requirements.--If the State \n     includes any of title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) in the State's \n     performance agreement, the performance agreement shall \n     include a certification that the State has--\n       (A)(i) developed and implemented the challenging State \n     content standards, challenging State student performance \n     standards, and aligned assessments described in section \n     1111(b) of such Act (20 U.S.C. 6311(b));

Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my \ndistinguished colleague from Tennessee, Senator Frist, in introducing \nthe Academic Achievement for All Act known as Straight A's.\n  Our education system is in need of serious reform. Thirty-five years \nago, Congress enacted the first Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nToday, over $120 billion has been spent on Title I--the program that is \nthe cornerstone of the federal investment in K through 12 education for \ndisadvantaged children. However, only 13 percent of low-income 4th \ngraders score at or above the ``proficient'' level on national reading \ntests, and one-third of all incoming college freshman must enroll in \nremedial reading, writing, or mathematics classes before taking regular \ncourses. Even worse, no progress has been made in achieving the \nprogram's fundamental goal, narrowing the achievement gap between low-\nincome and upper-income students.\n  More fundamentally, the Federal role in education has been at best \nirrelevant in some states, and a serious barrier to reform in States \nthat are far ahead of the curve in implementing serious reforms. It is \ntime that parents, teachers, principals, and school board members \ndecide what is best for our children. It is important that we return to \nour States and local communities the right to set priorities that \nreflect the unique needs of their students. The Straight A's Act offers \nsuch an option. It leaves the basic construct of Federal education \nprograms intact, but offers some states the opportunity to experiment. \nStraight A's would allow states or school districts to spend their \nshare of Federal dollars on reforms of their choice in exchange for \nagreed upon academic results. It is the first Federal education program \nto shift Federal dollars from one size fits all programs to a program \nthat demands academic outcomes.\n  I believe that choice and flexibility are the two most important \naspects of education reform. The Straight A's Act offers both. The time \nhas come to move forward with education reform, and I think Straight \nA's is moving in the right direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Domenici, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Bingaman, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 169. A bill to provide Federal reimbursement for indirect costs \nrelating to the incarceration of illegal criminal aliens and for \nemergency health services furnished to undocumented aliens; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the State \nCriminal Alien Assistance Program II and Local Medical Emergency \nReimbursement Act. Senators McCain, Hutchison, Gramm, Domenici, \nBingaman, Feinstein, and Boxer join me. This bill, which is identical \nto the bill I introduced in the 106th Congress, will be of great \nimportance to Arizona's future fiscal soundness and that of the other \nsouthwest border states.\n  The bill will reimburse states and localities for the costs they \nincur to process criminal illegal aliens through their criminal justice \nsystems. It will also provide reimbursement for the uncompensated care \nthat states, localities, and hospitals provide, as required by federal \nlaw, to undocumented aliens for medical emergencies.\n  It is unclear what the true expense for providing these services is, \nbut it is believed to be even greater than the level of reimbursement \nprovided for in the bill we introduce today. Title I of our bill will \nprovide $200 million each year for four years for the criminal justice \ncosts associated with processing criminal illegal aliens. Title II will \nprovide $200 million each year for four years for the costs that \nstates, localities, and hospitals incur to provide emergency medical \ntreatment to undocumented aliens.\n  We will soon have a better idea of what these overwhelming costs are \nto those jurisdictions clearly affected, the local border communities \nin Arizona, Texas, California, and New Mexico. Last year I successfully \nsecured funding for a study which should be completed this week and \nwill detail the expenses that border communities in all four southwest \nstates incur to process criminal aliens. The Arizona portion is already \ncomplete. In the four border counties of Arizona, $18 million in \nunreimbursed costs are incurred to process criminal illegal aliens.\n  Preventing illegal immigration is the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment. When it fails to protect our borders from illegal \nimmigration, it has a responsibility to reimburse jurisdictions that \nprovide federally-mandated services that (1) protect citizens and legal \nresidents from criminal illegal aliens, or (2) provide emergency \nmedical attention to undocumented immigrants. These two services have a \ntremendous effect on the budgets of these relatively small \njurisdictions. When illegal immigrants commit crimes and are then \ncaught, they drain the budgets of a locality's sheriff, detention \nfacilities, justice court, county attorney, clerk of the court, \nsuperior and juvenile court, and juvenile detention departments, as \nwell as the county's indigent defense budget. States and local \njurisdictions all along the southwestern border have incurred 100 \npercent of these processing-related costs to date. Our bill will change \nthat.\n  Another study I was able to secure funding for in the 106th Congress \nwill soon begin. That study will detail the overwhelming, and again \nunreimbursed, costs that certain localities\n\n[[Page S541]]\n\nand hospitals are incurring to treat illegal immigrants for medical \nemergencies. The federal government is obligated to fully reimburse \nstates, localities, and hospitals for the emergency medical treatment \nof illegal immigrants.\n  According to a preliminary Congressional Budget Office estimate \nprovided two years ago, the total annual cost to treat illegal \nimmigrants for medical emergencies is roughly $2.8 billion a year. It \nis roughly estimated that the federal government reimburses states for \napproximately half of that amount. That means states must pay the \nremaining $1.4 billion. The state of Arizona estimates that it incurs \nunreimbursed costs of $30 million annually to treat undocumented \nimmigrants on an emergency basis.\n  The bill we introduce today will provide states, localities, and \nhospitals an additional $200 million per year to help absorb the costs \nof adhering to Federal law, which mandates that all individuals, \nregardless of immigration status or ability to pay, must be provided \nwith medical treatment in a medical emergency.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can address these very pressing issues in \nthe coming months, and that Members will consider joining my cosponsors \nand me in support of this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \nSenator Kyl and I are introducing with a number of our border-state \ncolleagues to provide appropriate Federal reimbursement to states and \nlocalities whose budgets are disproportionately affected by the costs \nassociated with illegal immigration. The premise of our bill, and of \ncurrent law governing this type of federal reimbursement to the states, \nis that controlling illegal immigration is principally the \nresponsibility of the Federal government, not the states.\n  Our legislation would expand the amount and scope of federal funding \nto the states for incarceration and medical costs that arise from the \ndetention or treatment of illegal immigrants. Such funding currently \nflows to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and several U.S. \nterritories. In Fiscal Year 2000, approximately 360 local jurisdictions \nacross the United States applied for these Federal monies. Although our \nbill gives special consideration to border States and States with \nunusually high concentrations of illegal aliens in residence, it would \nbenefit communities across the nation. It deserves the Senate's prompt \nconsideration and approval.\n  Many of my colleagues are probably not aware that the Federal \nGovernment, under the existing State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, \nSCAAP, reimburses states and counties burdened by illegal immigration \nfor less than 40 percent of eligible alien incarceration costs. Many \nborder counties estimate that between one-quarter and one-third of \ntheir criminal justice budgets are spent processing criminal aliens. In \nmy State of Arizona, Santa Cruz County spent 33 percent of its total \ncriminal justice budget in Fiscal Year 1999 to process criminal illegal \naliens, of which over half was not reimbursed by the Federal \nGovernment. Arizona's Cochise County spent roughly 32 percent of its \ntotal law enforcement and criminal justice budget to apprehend and \nprocess criminal illegal aliens but received Federal payments to cover \nfewer than half of these costs. Similar shortfalls in Federal funding \nplague states and counties all along our border with Mexico.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would actually expand the \nState Criminal Alien Assistance Program by authorizing funding for \nstate and local needs that currently go unmet. Although states receive \nFederal reimbursement for part of the cost of incarcerating illegal \nadult aliens, the Federal Government does not reimburse states or units \nof local government for expenditures for illegal juvenile aliens. Nor \ndoes it reimburse states and localities for costs associated with \nprocessing criminal illegal aliens, including court costs, county \nattorney costs, costs for criminal proceedings that do not involve \ngoing to trial, indigent defense costs, and unsupervised probation \ncosts. Our legislation would authorize the Federal Government to \nreimburse such costs to States and localities that suffer a \nsubstantially disproportionate share of the impact of criminal illegal \naliens on their law enforcement and criminal justice systems. It would \nalso authorize additional Federal reimbursement for emergency health \nservices furnished by states and localities to undocumented aliens.\n  Reimbursement to States and localities for criminal alien \nincarceration is woefully underfunded according to the existing limited \ncriteria for SCAAP, which do not take into account the full detention \nand processing costs for illegal aliens. Nor does the existing SCAAP \nprovide necessary support to local communities for the cost of \nemergency care for illegal immigrants, a growing problem in the \nSouthwest, and one exacerbated by the increasingly desperate measures \ntaken by undocumented aliens to cross our border with Mexico. Our \nlegislation thus authorizes the expansion of SCAAP to cover costs \nwrongly borne by local communities under current law--costs which are a \nFederal responsibility and should not be shirked by those in \nWashington.\n  As my colleagues know, illegal immigrants who successfully transit \nour Southwest border rapidly disperse throughout the United States. \nThat SCAAP funds flow to all 50 States reflects the pressures such \naliens place on public services around the country. I hope the Senate \nwill act expeditiously on this important legislation to alleviate those \npressures by compensating state and local units for the costs they \nincur as unwitting hosts to undocumented aliens, even as we continue to \nfund border enforcement measures to reduce the flow of illegal \nimmigrants into this country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Dorgan, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Johnson, Mr. McCain, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Shelby, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 170. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \nretired members of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected \ndisability to receive both military retired pay by reason of their \nyears of military service and disability compensation from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for their disability; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last Congress I, along with Senator Inouye, \nintroduced S. 2357, ``The Armed Forces Concurrent Retirement and \nDisability Payment Act of 2000.'' Our bill addressed a 110 year old \ninjustice that requires some of the bravest men and women in our \nnation--retired, career veterans, to essentially forgo receipt of a \nportion of their retired pay if they received a disability injury in \nthe line of service. I am extremely disappointed that we did not take \nthe opportunity to correct this long-standing inequity in the 106th \nCongress.\n  I rise today, to again introduce a bill along with my colleagues \nSenators Hutchinson, Landrieu, Dorgan, Conrad, Johnson, McCain, \nBingaman, Inouye, Shelby, Snowe and Daschle, that will correct this \ninequity for veterans who have retired from our Armed Forces with a \nservice-connected disability.\n  Our bill will permit retired members of the Armed Forces who have a \nservice connected disability to receive military retired pay \nconcurrently with veterans' disability compensation.\n  This inequitable law originated in the 19th century, when Congress \napproved legislation to prohibit the concurrent receipt of military \nretired pay and VA disability compensation. It was enacted shortly \nafter the Civil War, when the standing army of the United States was \nextremely limited. At that time, only a small portion of our armed \nforces consisted of career soldiers.\n  Today, nearly one and a half million Americans dedicate their lives \nto the defense of our nation. The United States' military force is \nunmatched in terms of power, training and ability and our nation is \nrecognized as the world's only superpower, a status which is largely \ndue to the sacrifices our veterans made during the last century. Rather \nthan honoring their commitment and bravery by fulfilling our \nobligations, the federal government has chosen instead to perpetuate a \n110-year-old injustice. Quite simply, this is disgraceful.\n  Military retirement pay and disability compensation were earned and \nawarded for entirely different purposes.\n\n[[Page S542]]\n\nCurrent law ignores the distinction between these two entitlements. \nMembers of our Armed Forces have normally dedicated 20 or more years to \nour country's defense earning their retirement for service. Whereas, \ndisability compensation is awarded to a veteran for injury incurred in \nthe line of duty.\n  Career military retired veterans are the only group of federal \nretirees who are required to waive their retirement pay in order to \nreceive VA disability. All other federal employees receive both their \ncivil service retirement and VA disability with no offset. Simply put, \nthe law discriminates against career military men and women.\n  This inequity is absurd. How do we explain it to the men and women \nwho sacrificed their own safety to protect this great nation? How do we \nexplain this inequity to Edward Lynk from Virginia who answered the \ncall of duty to defend our nation? Mr. Lynk served for over 30 years in \nthe Marine Corps and participated in three wars, where he was severely \ninjured during combat in two of them.\n  Or George Blahun from Connecticut, who entered the military in 1940 \nto serve his country because of the impending war. He served over 35 \nyears during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. He is \n100 percent disabled because of injuries incurred while performing \nmilitary service.\n  Our nation is experiencing a prosperity unparalleled in human history \nand yet we continue to tell these brave soldiers that we cannot afford \nto make good on payments they are owed. Mr. Blahun has hit the \nproverbial nail on the head when he labels our excuses ``arbitrary \nbureaucratic rhetorical nonsense.'' We must demonstrate to these \nveterans that we are thankful for their dedicated service. As such, we \nmust fight for the amendment in the Senate version of the National \nDefense Authorization bill for FY 2001.\n  We are currently losing over one thousand WWII veterans each day. \nEvery day we delay acting on this legislation means that we have denied \nfundamental fairness to thousands of men and women. They will never \nhave the ability to enjoy their two well-deserved entitlements.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents an honest attempt to correct an \ninjustice that has existed for far too long. Allowing disabled veterans \nto receive military retired pay and veterans disability compensation \nconcurrently will restore fairness to Federal retirement policy.\n  This legislation is supported by numerous veterans' service \norganizations, including the Military Coalition, the National Military/\nVeterans Alliance, the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of America and the \nUniformed Services Disabled Retirees.\n  Mr. President, passing ``The Retired Pay Restoration Act of 2001'' \nwill finally eliminate a gross inequitable 19th century law and ensure \nfairness within the Federal retirement policy. Our veterans have heard \nenough excuses. Now it is time for them to hear our gratitude. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to finally end \nthis disservice to our retired military men and women.\n  Our veterans have earned this and now is our chance to honor their \nservice to our Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Retired Pay Restoration \nAct of 2001 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 170\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished \ncolleague from across the aisle, Senator Reid, in introducing the \nMilitary Retirement Equity Act of 2001. With the swift passage of this \nact, we hope to put an end to a grossly unfair practice, to reform a \nsystem that, as it stands today, ends up hurting those veterans we owe \nour greatest debt of gratitude.\n  Today, our armed forces are struggling to meet even modest recruiting \ngoals and are having even more difficulty retaining qualified men and \nwomen. Serving in the military is less likely to be seen as an \nattractive career. The Federal Government should do its part to help, \nnot to hinder, the viability of the idea of a career in uniform.\n  Unfortunately, an outdated law passed in 1891 punishes those who have \nserved this Nation in uniform for more than twenty years, in the \nprocess earning a longevity retirement. How? By forcing them to waive \nthe amount of their retired pay equal to the amount of any VA \ndisability compensation they may be eligible to receive. That is \npatently unfair. Military retirement pay based on longevity and VA \ndisability compensation are awarded for two distinct, different \nreasons--one should not count against the other. One is awarded for \nmaking a career of public service, the other is to redress \ndebilitating, enduring injuries caused by the rigors of life in the \nmilitary.\n  Military retirees are the only group of federal retirees who must \nwaive a portion of their retirement pay in order to receive VA \ndisability compensation. If a veteran refuses to give up his retired \npay, he will lose his VA benefits.\n  Let's take the fictional example of two G.I.'s named Joe and Sam. Joe \nand Sam joined the Army together and were wounded in the same battle. \nJoe left the Army after a four-year tour and joined the federal \ngovernment as a civilian employee. Sam continued on and made the \nmilitary his career.\n  Thirty years later, both men are receiving federal retirement pay and \nboth are eligible for VA disability compensation as a result of the \ninjuries they sustained while in the service. The difference between \nJoe and Sam is that in order to get disability compensation, Sam must \nforfeit an equal amount of his retired pay, while Joe collects the full \namount of both benefits without any deduction in either.\n\n[[Page S543]]\n\n  Fairness is the issue here. We should be rewarding, not penalizing \npeople for choosing a career in the military. Military retirees with \nservice-connected disabilities should be allowed to receive \ncompensation for their injuries above their retired military pay. The \n107th Congress must act to bring equity to those who were disabled \nduring a career of dedicated service to our nation, and the Reid-\nHutchinson bill is the proper vehicle. By eliminating the offset, we \ncan end this unfair practice that hurts those who need our help.\n  The Military Retirement Equity Act of 2001 has the strong support of \nmany military and nonmilitary veterans service organizations. In \naddition, Congressman Michael Bilirakis has introduced companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to join us in this fight by signing on as cosponsors.\n  While I know it will be an uphill battle to get this legislation \npassed, it is one of my highest priorities. It's only right that the \nCongress make this much-needed change and reward--rather than \npenalize--those who have selflessly served to protect our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon:\n  S. 172. A bill to benefit electricity consumers by promoting the \nreliability of the bulk-power system; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I stand before you and the Senate today. As I do \nthis, our Nation is relearning a fundamental lesson--that electricity \ndoes not come from hitting a light switch. Our urban areas are getting \na painful lesson that the quality of life that we and they enjoy in \nthis Nation is a direct result of resource production.\n  California is scrambling as we speak to keep the lights on from day \nto day and has had 2 days recently of rolling blackouts. The west coast \nenergy crisis shows no sign of abating and could actually intensify in \ncoming weeks if the region, which is heavily dependent on hydroelectric \npower, continues to face below average precipitation. The reservoir \nbehind the Grand Coulee Dam, by far the largest of the Federal dams in \nthe Northwest, is at its lowest level in 25 years. The Grand Coulee Dam \nis also upstream of 10 other dams on the mainstem Columbia River. So \ndownstream powerhouses cannot generate electricity either.\n  Much of the media attention in recent weeks has focused on efforts to \nkeep the lights on in California and to keep the State's two largest \nutilities from going bankrupt. The west coast energy market extends to \n11 other Western States, including Oregon, that are all interconnected \nby the high-voltage transmission system.\n  I believe there is more that California can and must do immediately \nto address this situation. First and foremost, it must approve further \nelectric rate increases. I don't normally advocate increases, but this \nis necessary to send the right signal to Californians that they have to \nconserve energy.\n  Further, price increases are necessary to help California's investor-\nowned utilities, which have recently been reduced to junk bond status, \nfrom going bankrupt. Avoiding bankruptcy for these utilities is \nimportant for Oregon and for other Western States. Since the middle of \nDecember, Northwest utilities have been forced, by Federal order, to \nsell their surplus power into California, with no guarantee of being \npaid. If the California utilities subsequently seek bankruptcy \nprotection, it will be Oregonians who are stuck with the bill for \nCalifornia's failed restructuring effort.\n  We should not confuse this with deregulation. This is a failed effort \nat restructuring that incredibly took off, went to a free market in the \nwholesale, went to a price cap at retail, and then overregulated at \nproduction levels.\n  I tell you, when you do that with an expanding economy, you have \ncreated a catastrophe. That is what California has created, and its \nneighbors are now beginning to help shoulder the burden.\n  California must also operate its native generation, including its \nfossil fuel plants, at full capacity during this crisis. It can also \nfind additional temporary generation.\n  I recently came across a news story from last August about one \nCalifornia utility that was abandoning its efforts to moor a floating \npower plant in San Francisco Bay as protection against future power \nshortages.\n  That 95-megawatt emergency powerplant could have provided enough \npower for 95,000 homes in the area.\n  However, according to this news clip, the company abandoned its \nefforts because it was ``under fire from environmentalists and \nskeptical of winning regulatory approval. . . . ''\n  The article also quoted the executive director of the San Francisco \nBay Conservation and Development Commission as saying, ``The commission \nwas skeptical as to whether the emergency really existed.''\n  What a difference a few months makes. I wonder if anyone in San \nFrancisco thinks there isn't an emergency now.\n  In response to these tight margins between supply and demand, today I \nam reintroducing legislation that passed the Senate last Congress that \nwill enhance the reliability of the wholesale transmission system. It \nis imperative that the transmission grid be operated as efficiently and \nreliably as possible during times when the margin between supply and \ndemand is so tight.\n  Yesterday, I sent a letter to the President urging him to issue an \nExecutive order directing electricity conservation at all federal \nfacilities throughout the twelve western states. Between federal office \nbuildings, post offices, military bases, prisons, and other facilities, \nthe federal government is among the largest consumers of electricity in \nthe West.\n  The Governors of Oregon and Washington are seeking 10 percent \nreductions in energy use at state facilities, and I believe this would \nbe an appropriate goal for federal facilities as well.\n  The federal government is also a major producer of electricity in the \nWestern United States. Much of that generation is from hydroelectric \nfacilities.\n  I have expressed concern over the last several weeks that the \nColumbia and Snake River hydropower facilities not be operated in a \nmanner that jeopardizes salmon recovery efforts in what is shaping up \nto be a poor water year in the Basin.\n  However, there are many other federal generation facilities \nthroughout the 12 western states that are interconnected by the high-\nvoltage transmission system.\n  Therefore, I asked that the Energy Department be directed to \nundertake an immediate review of all of these facilities to ensure they \nare providing as much power as possible during this crisis.\n  It is not just California that needs additional generation, however. \nAccording to a recent study by the Northwest Power Planning Council, \nthe Pacific Northwest faces a 25 percent chance of power shortages \nduring this and coming winters.\n  To reduce this probability to a more acceptable level of five \npercent, the Northwest needs nearly 3,000 megawatts of new generating \nresources, conservation, or short-term demand management.\n  This report, however, assumed that all the other generation remained \nequal. Yet in recent years there have been calls to close the nuclear \nplant WNP2, with a capacity of 1,250 megawatts.\n  Breaching the four lower Snake River dams, which I oppose, would \nreduce capacity by another 1,200 megawatts, enough power for Seattle.\n  In addition, almost 12,000 megawatts of non-federal hydroelectric \npower in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and California, is up for \nrelicensing between now and 2010. More stringent operating criteria \ncould reduce the total amount of power available.\n  New licenses will probably also reduce the operational flexibility of \nthese facilities that makes hydropower so valuable in meeting daily \npeaks in energy demand.\n  In the face of the numbers I just quoted, I believe it is the height \nof irresponsibility to even be discussing breaching the four lower \nSnake River dams. The Endangered Species Act was never intended to \nforce us, as Americans, to dismantle the infrastructure that our \nparents and grandparents worked so hard to build.\n  The Bush administration is going to have to clean up a huge mess that \nis not of their making. The assault on domestic energy production and \nthe lack of a national energy strategy over the last eight years are \nfinally coming\n\n[[Page S544]]\n\nhome to roost. This nation is more dependent on foreign oil than at any \ntime in its history, and crude oil prices are rising as foreign nations \nare reducing production. Natural gas prices have doubled in recent \nmonths. Electricity prices on the West Coast have skyrocketed, and they \nremain high in the Northeast.\n  The previous administration started out wanting to tax energy \nproduction through a BTU tax, as a way to force Americans to conserve. \nWhen that wasn't enacted, the past administration went about a \nsystematic assault on energy production. They went after coal-fired \nplants, nuclear plants, and hydroelectric plants.\n  They opposed the siting of new natural gas pipelines and the \nexpansion of oil refining capacity. They put millions of acres of land \noff-limits to oil, gas, and coal exploration. The economy, particularly \non the west coast, is just beginning to feel the cumulative effects of \nthese actions.\n  The U.S. economy needs energy. It needs abundant, reasonably priced \noil, gas and electricity if our economic prosperity is to continue.\n  I want to thank the leadership of the Senate for efforts to craft an \nenergy bill. I know that the Bush administration will work with the \nCongress to achieve more energy production and more conservation.\n  But I say to my fellow Oregonians and Americans everywhere who care \nabout this issue that we must reconnect the reality dots between the \nlives we live and the natural resources we demand.\n  At the end of the day, power is not created by hitting a light \nswitch. Food does not come from Safeway. Gasoline does not come from a \nfilling station. These are all things we need, and we must be good \nstewards of the environment but also remember that using the land does \nnot have to equal abusing the land. But those who advocate that all \nmust be shut down are simply the ones who would visit this trauma that \nwe are now seeing in California on the rest of us as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 172\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a \nwindfall profits adjustment on the production of domestic electricity \nand to use the resulting revenues to fund rebates for individual and \nbusiness electricity consumers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, earlier this week I introduced a bill to \nrequire the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to establish a Western \nRegional Rate Cap for the sale of electricity. This is a key component \nto bringing stability to the electricity market and an important step \nin solving California's electricity problems.\n  Today, I am introducing the second in a series of bills to deal with \nthis matter. The Consumer Utilities Turnback, CUT, Trust Fund Act would \nimpose a windfall profits tax on electricity generators, with the \nrevenues from the tax going into a Trust Fund to provide rebates to \nconsumers.\n  Between the second quarter of 1999 and the second quarter of 2000, \nthe overall net income for electricity producers based outside of \nCalifornia who sell to California increased 333 percent. Let me also \nmention a couple of specific companies. These figures compare the net \nincome of the first three quarters of 1999 with the net income of the \nfirst three quarters of 2000. For NRG Energy Inc., it was a 386 percent \nincrease. For the AES Corporation, it was a 262 percent increase. And \nfor Dynegy Inc., the increase was 269 percent.\n  While profits for producers are reaching record levels, consumers are \nbeing hit with higher prices. Recent action by the state's Public \nUtility Commission has resulted in increases in consumer electricity \nbills from 7 to 15 percent. While this action was done to help the \nstate's utility companies in meeting the wholesale electricity costs, \nit means that consumers and businesses are shouldering the burden of \nthe windfall profits being made by the generating companies.\n  As I mentioned, the CUT Act would impose a windfall profits tax on \nelectricity generators. Each year, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, FERC, would calculate the average level of ``reasonable \nprofit'' determined by state Public Utility Commissions in states in \nwhich such a determination is made. Any profit above this average level \nwould be windfall profit and would be subject to a 100 percent windfall \nprofits tax.\n  The monies raised from the tax would be placed in the CUT Trust Fund \nin order to provide rebates to consumers. Governors could request that \nFERC provide rebates for consumers and businesses because of high \nelectricity costs. FERC would then be charged with distributing the \nrebates and would be required to provide refunds to consumers each year \nin an amount equal to the revenues of the windfall profits tax.\n  Mr. President, this legislation highlights the dramatic difference \nbetween the burden California consumers are facing and the bountiful \nharvest being reaped by electricity generating companies. In dealing \nwith the electricity situation in California, we must always keep this \nin mind.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Bond, Mr. Wellstone, \n        Mr. Cleland, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 174. A bill to amend the Small Business Act with respect to the \nmicroloan program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Snowe and I are introducing a \nbill to improve the Small Business Administration's Microloan Program, \na program which makes a very big difference through very small loans of \nup to $35,000. We are very pleased that Senators Bond, Wellstone, \nCleland, Landrieu, Harkin, Levin, Lieberman, Bingaman, Enzi, and Kohl \nare joining us and cosponsoring this bill.\n  Senator Snowe and I have worked together many times on this program, \npushing to make sure our country's smallest businesses have access to \ncapital and business assistance. The changes we are introducing today \nare not controversial, and they are not new. In fact, they should sound \nfamiliar to all but our newest colleagues. First, they were part of the \nmicroloan provisions in the Senate version of last year's SBA \nReauthorization bill. Second, our Committee and the full Senate voted \nunanimously to pass them. Further, they were drafted in cooperation \nwith the Administration and with the folks who make the loans and \nprovide the business training. The National Association of SBA \nMicroloan Intermediaries (NASMI) and its members were full partners in \nshaping this legislation in the 106th Congress.\n  These provisions were not included in the conference agreement on \nSBA's Reauthorization bill because the House Committee on Small \nBusiness wanted to postpone consideration of these changes until they \ncould hold a hearing and their members could have a chance to weigh in \non the program. I thank former House Small Business Committee Chairman \nTalent, and returning Ranking Member Nydia Velazquez, for working with \nus on the microloan changes.\n  These changes we are re-introducing today will make the SBA Microloan \nProgram more flexible to meet credit needs, more accessible to \nmicroentrepreneurs across the nation, and more streamlined for lenders \nto make loans and provide management assistance. They complement the \nprogram and technical changes we made last year.\n  The Microloan Program Improvement Act of 2001 does the following:\n  It allows microintermediaries to offer revolving lines of credit. \nCurrently, microloans are short-term loans. Eliminating this \nrequirement will allow intermediaries greater latitude in developing \nmicroloan products that best meet their community's needs by offering \nborrowers revolving lines of credit, such as for seasonal contract \nneeds. Congress does not intend for this flexibility to be used to make \nloans with long terms, such as 15 and 30 years.\n  It broadens the eligibility criteria for potential \nmicrointermediaries. Instead of requiring intermediaries to have one \nyear of experience in making microloans to startup, newly established, \nor growing small businesses and providing technical assistance to its \nborrowers, this legislation would deem a prospective intermediary \neligible if it has equivalent experience.\n  It expands flexibility to intermediaries to subcontract out technical \nassistance. Currently, intermediaries are limited to using 25 percent \nof their funds to assist prospective borrowers. This change allows an \nintermediary to allocate as much technical assistance as appropriate. \nThis subsection also increases the percentage of technical assistance \ngrant funds that an intermediary can use to subcontract out technical \nassistance. Currently, intermediaries can only subcontract 25 percent, \nand this legislation would raise it to 35 percent.\n  It establishes a peer-to-peer mentoring program to help new \nintermediaries provide the best possible service to microentrepreneurs. \nSpecifically, SBA would be allowed to use up to $1 million of annual \nappropriations for technical assistance grants to provide peer-to-peer \nmentoring by subcontracting with one or more national trade \nassociations of SBA microlending intermediaries, or subcontracting with \nentities knowledgeable of and experienced in microlending and related \ntechnical assistance. As Congress increases the number of lending \nintermediaries around the country to reach more people, we want to make \nsure that new intermediaries have the benefits of lessons learned by \nother more\n\n[[Page S549]]\n\nexperienced lending intermediaries. Because the microlending industry \nis still very young, there are few sources of conventional training \navailable to prospective and new intermediaries. According to the \nNational Association of SBA Microloan Intermediaries, experienced SBA \nmicrolenders are called upon frequently to assist new intermediaries in \naddressing issues with their loan fund, from financial management and \nmarketing to targeting loan funds effectively to a population or \nbusiness sector. While these experienced intermediaries do their best \nto respond to the needs of their colleagues, they currently lack the \nresources to respond effectively and efficiently to the growing needs \nof the field.\n  Before I wrap up my statement, I would like to quickly run through \nthe changes we made and that President Clinton signed into law on \nDecember 21.\n  Increases the maximum loan amount from $25,000 to $35,000;\n  Increases the average loan size for each intermediary's portfolio \nfrom $10,000 to $15,000 and increases the average loan size for \nspecialty lenders from $7,500 to $10,000;\n  Raises the threshold for the comparable credit test from $15,000 to \n$20,000;\n  Increases the number of non-lending technical assistance (TA) \nproviders from 25 to 55 and raises the maximum grant amount to each TA \nprovider from $125,000 to $200,000; and,\n  Increases the number of intermediaries SBA is authorized to fund from \n200 to 300.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 174\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring the attention of \nthe Senate to legislation vitally important to the success of the \nMicroloan Program of the Small Business Administration. Congress \ncreated the Microloan Program to reach small businesses not being \nserved by traditional lenders or other credit programs within the SBA. \nThis program has successfully helped micro entrepreneurs, many of whom \nare minorities, women and low-income individuals, who otherwise would \nhave been unable to achieve their goal of owning their own business. \nDue to weak or, merely, non-existent credit histories and limited \nborrowing experience, they were often labeled as unreliable or risky \nborrowers by traditional credit markets and, hence, unable to obtain \nloans to start businesses.\n  To address this need and to fill the gap in micro enterprise lending, \nthe Microloan Program was created to provide loans to non-profit \nintermediary lenders who, in turn, provide loans under $35,000 to very \nsmall businesses. In addition to financial resources, intermediary \nlenders provide technical assistance to these business owners, teaching \nthem how to manage and run a successful business. Industry experts and \nmicro borrowers have testified that supplementing financing with \ntechnical assistance is critical to the success of the micro enterprise \nand the likelihood of loan repayment.\n  Not only crucial to the development of the business of the micro \nborrower, micro loans also serve to strengthen and build communities, \nboth growing and those in need of resurgence. To date, lending \nintermediaries have made 10,230 loans, worth in the range of $105 \nmillion. This money and business activity is stimulating many \ncommunities. As importantly, loans made by this Program have created \nnew jobs. The Small Business Administration reports that for every loan \nmade, 1.7 jobs have been created. Given the number of loans, this \ncalculates to approximately 17,391 new jobs to strengthen the vitality \nof our communities.\n  The legislation I am cosponsoring today makes programmatic and \ntechnical changes to the Small Business Administration's Microloan \nProgram, making it more flexible. This flexibility will help the \nProgram meet more credit needs, be more accessible to micro \nentrepreneurs across the country, and streamline procedures which \nincrease lenders' ability to make loans and provide technical \nassistance to micro entrepreneurs.\n  The Microloan Program has had substantial achievements. In South \nCarolina, a small retail establishment's owner wished to sell his \noutlet to an employee, but traditional lenders balked. The Microloan \nProgram gave the employee the helping hand he needed with a micro loan. \nHe paid that initial loan back early, and a second micro loan, as well. \nThe banks now knock on his door. In Virginia, a woman, whose husband \nbecame disabled and unable to support the family, used a micro loan to \nstart a used car dealership. That business has succeeded. So much so \nthat she has established a program in her community that helps other \nwomen get off welfare by providing the automobile transportation to get \nto and from work. I want to be able to cite similar examples in my own \nState of Louisiana. In Louisiana, currently, we do not have any micro \nlenders enrolled in the Program. However, I have fought for increased \nfunding to make sure the Program is adequately funded so that \nnationwide we can provide more micro loans and technical assistance. In \nthe last Congress, I voted for legislation that increased the number of \nintermediaries authorized from 200 to 300 so that we can reach more \nmicro entrepreneurs across the country.\n  And today, the proposed legislation will make the necessary changes \nto increase the attractiveness of the Program to prospective micro \nlenders in Louisiana and elsewhere around the country. The legislation \nbeing introduced today would broaden the eligibility criteria for \nintermediaries in an effort to bring lenders into the Program. This \nlegislation would allow for intermediaries to have equivalent lending \nexperience, rather than requiring exact micro lending experience. In \naddition, this legislation increases the amounts intermediaries can use \nto subcontract technical assistance, thus easing the burden on lenders \nin providing technical assistance. This legislation should encourage \nintermediaries to get involved in the SBA's Microloan Program in \nLouisiana. I urge lenders in my State to take note of the need for \ntheir future involvement in this Program. They could make big \ndifferences in their communities by making very small loans.\n  I have consistently supported this Program since joining the \nCommittee on Small Business, and will continue to do so because of the \nmany benefits that the Microloan Program can provide to micro \nentrepreneurs and our communities. Passage of this legislation can \ncontinue the successes of the Microloan Program and extend its reach \ninto many other communities, such as those in Louisiana. I thank \nSenator Kerry and Senator Snowe for their leadership on this \nlegislation and encourage the Committee to act on this bill as soon as \npracticable.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n\n[[Page S550]]\n\n  S. 175. A bill to establish a national uniform poll closing time and \nuniform treatment of absentee ballots in Presidential general \nelections; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  S. 176. A bill to reform the financing of Federal elections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nthat will make much needed changes to our Presidential election system.\n  If there was one message to come from the thirty-six day ordeal over \ncounting the votes in this Presidential election--it was that reforms \nare needed in the manner of national elections.\n  My bill would first establish a uniform poll closing time for the \nnation. I believe that 9 p.m. central standard time is the most \nappropriate time we can choose. The polls in California would close at \nseven. The polls in the east would close at ten. A uniform poll closing \ntime is preferable to any kind of news blackout over election results. \nWe live in a free society--we cannot withhold election results.\n  But, in this time of instant communication, we cannot let news \nreporting affect our voting patterns. We all recall the 1980 election, \nwhen President Carter's early concession demoralized West Coast voters \nwho thought their vote no longer counted. In this last election, we \nwatched the state of Florida get called, when a significant part of the \nstate had not even closed its polls. A uniform poll closing time, in my \nview, is the only way to avoid a repeat of this problem.\n  A second difficulty that surfaced during this election cycle is the \ncounting of absentee ballots and mail-in ballots. Some states have \nmoved to vote by mail. But I don't believe that in a national election, \nwe can wait on the outcome of an election through such means. A major \nindustrial nation, in the twenty-first century, shouldn't have to wait \ndays or weeks to determine who won an election. Literally, the fate of \nthe Presidency and the Senate depended on the counting of absentee and \nmail-in ballots days after the election was held. My legislation would \nrequire that, for Presidential elections, all ballots would have to be \nprocessed and recorded by election day. States can reserve the right to \nhave mail-in voting. But it must be done in a manner that is respectful \nof the nation's right to know who the next President will be.\n  Finally, and most importantly, I want to improve the treatment that \noverseas military absentee ballots are granted. We ask a lot of our men \nand women serving overseas. They put their lives on the line to protect \nour democratic values. And I was stunned to see their ballots cast \naside like rubbish, purely for political opportunism, and secondly, \nbecause of so called ``technicalities.'' It was an insult to our armed \nforces. Never again should this happen. I will make sure that the 107th \nCongress acts to make sure it never happens again.\n  In the past Congress has worked on this problem, but apparently we \ndid not go far enough. We created a uniform absentee ballot for our \nmilitary, if they couldn't get a ballot from their home state in a \ntimely manner. We directed the Secretary of Defense to serve as the \nprimary executive branch official charged with enforcing this Federal \nlaw.\n  My legislation would broaden the Secretary's authority--and give him \nthe power to develop, in consultation with the states, a standard, \nuniform method of treating ballots in Federal elections that come from \nour military serving overseas. This way, no soldier or sailor or airman \nserving overseas will have his or her vote disenfranchised because of a \npatchwork of fifty state laws with respect to absentee ballots. They \nprotect our democracy. We have to protect their right to participate in \nit.\n  Election reform will be an important issue for this Congress. There \nwill be many proposals. I know that Senator McConnell, Chairman of the \nRules Committee, will have a proposal to modernize voting procedures \nand machinery across our nation. I am certain that some of the reforms \nI am offering today will become part of the debate.\n  Today, I am also introducing the Campaign Finance and Disclosure Act \nof 2001, legislation that I believe addresses the most significant \nproblems in our present system of Federal campaign finance laws.\n  The bill will help level the playing field between challengers and \nincumbents and will target those areas of the law that have been \nsubject to abuse and excess, without imposing a new, untested system of \ntaxpayer funded campaign subsidies and regulations.\n  I am today proposing a set of relatively simple and workable reforms \nthat will curb the abuses undermining public confidence in the present \nsystem, that will make congressional races more competitive, and that \nwill help return control of federal campaigns and elections to their \nrightful owners--the individual voters in our respective states.\n  First, the bill requires that at least 60 percent of a Senate or \nHouse candidate's campaign funds come from individual residents of his \nor her state or congressional district. This will put the emphasis of \nfund-raising back home where it belongs, and will assist challengers, \nwho rely more heavily on individual contributors.\n  In addition, the bill will end the powerful incumbent advantage of \nthe mass mail franking privilege for Senators during the year in which \nthey are seeking re-election.\n  Next, the bill increases the individual contribution limit from $1000 \nto $3000, per candidate, per election, while addressing the precipitous \nrise in the role of PACs in our existing system.\n  PAC contributions to congressional candidates grew from $12.5 million \nin 1974 to almost $200 million in 1996, a constant dollar increase of \nover 400 percent. Moreover, almost 70 percent of that $200 million went \nto incumbents, further serving to tilt the system against challengers. \nWhile PACs can and should continue to provide a vehicle for groups of \nlike minded individuals to leverage their support of particular \ncandidates, this should not be allowed to undermine the candidate/voter \nrelationship. The bill will help control this growing PAC influence by \nalso limiting PAC contributions to $3000, the same limit as individuals \nunder my bill.\n  To help encourage candidates of average means to run for office \nagainst their wealthier opponents, the bill limits to $250,000 the \namount a Senate campaign may reimburse a candidate, including immediate \nfamily, for loans the candidate makes to the campaign.\n  The Campaign Finance and Disclosure Act of 2001 will also prohibit, \nonce and for all, several abuses of the law that now plague our system: \ncampaign contributions by non-citizens will be banned; the use of \ncampaign funds for purposes that are inherently personal in nature will \nbe denied; political parties will be prohibited from accepting \ncontributions earmarked for specific candidates; and union members will \nbe entitled to be made aware of, and to decline to contribute to, the \nrapidly growing political activities of their unions.\n  Finally, the bill will encourage, not restrict, the volunteer-staffed \npolitical party building, ``get-out-the-vote,'' and other candidate \nsupport activities of state and local political parties that constitute \nthe core of grassroots politics in America. These critical activities \nwill be given greater latitude under the law by excluding them from the \ndefinition of campaign contributions.\n  I realize that campaign finance reform is a contentious issue. \nHowever, if we are to restore the American people's confidence in the \npolitical process and make it more responsive to voters and accessible \nto candidates, we must take a hard look at those rules and attempt to \nfix what is broken. The Campaign Finance Reform and Disclosure Act does \njust that, and in a way that I believe can garner the support of a \ndecisive majority of Congress.\n  Mr. President, both of these bills address issues that were raised \nduring the campaign. I wanted to put these ideas forward today so that \nthey can become part of the debate when we consider these issues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S. 171. A bill to repeal certain travel provisions with respect to \nCuba and certain trade sanctions with respect to Cuba, Iran, Libya, \nNorth Korea, and Sudan, and for other purposes, to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. DORGAN. On behalf of myself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Baucus, and Mr.\n\n[[Page S551]]\n\nDurbin, I introduce a piece of legislation today that deals with the \nrepeal of certain travel provisions or restrictions and certain trade \nsanctions with respect to Cuba.\n  Last year, in the Senate Appropriations Committee, I offered \nlegislation dealing with removing the embargo that exists on the \nshipment of agriculture commodities around the world.\n  The fact is, we have some people around the world we don't like. We \nsay: We are going to punish you.\n  We don't like Saddam Hussein. We say: The way to punish you is, we \nare going to slap an embargo on your country, and in that embargo we \nare going to include food and medicine. We say the same to the leaders \nof Libya, Cuba and North Korea.\n  It has been my strong feeling that we ought never have an embargo on \nthe shipment of food and medicine to anywhere in the world. With those \nembargoes, we shoot ourselves in the foot. When we don't sell food to \nthose countries, other countries will sell food to them. Why on Earth \nwould we ever want to use food as a weapon? I thought we put that \nbehind us 20 years ago. Yet we continue to do it with respect to \ncertain undesirable countries.\n  I offered legislation in the appropriations bill last year. It came \nto the floor of the Senate, and we moved through the Senate into \nconference. We had a lot of discussion about it. The fact is, we made \nsome progress, essentially lifting sanctions and embargoes on the \nshipment of food and medicine to Iran, Libya, Sudan and North Korea. \nBut there is more yet to do. In conference we got stiffed by some \ninterests who decided at they wanted to even take a step backward with \nrespect to the ban on travel to Cuba. They took the legislation we \nenacted and added to it a further restriction by codifying all the \nrestrictions that now exist on travel to Cuba and preventing a \nPresident from loosening the travel restrictions. They have written \nthese restrictions into law, which makes them tighter. That made no \nsense. They also added provisions that ban all American financing, even \nprivate financing, for agricultural sales to Cuba. That is a step \nbackward, not forward.\n  Let me read what two Members of the House who represent south Florida \nsaid when this was passed:\n\n       The prohibition will make it as difficult as is possible to \n     make agricultural sales to Cuba.\n       Closing off Clinton's tourism option for Castro is our most \n     important achievement in years. We are extremely pleased.\n\n  I understand why they are pleased. I am not. What was done by this \nCongress and just by a few people was wrong. We ought not make it \ndifficult to sell food or move food or medicine to Cuba or anywhere \nelse in the world for that matter. It is not in our interest, and it is \nnot in the interest of others around the world for us to behave in that \nmanner.\n  Does anyone think, as I have asked repeatedly, that Fidel Castro or \nSaddam Hussein or others miss a meal because we have decided that we \nwill not ship agricultural products or food to Iraq, Cuba? Does anybody \nthink they have missed a meal? All these policies do is punish poor \npeople and hungry people and sick people. This country is better than \nthat. We ought to start acting like it. This Congress ought to provide \npolicies that say when 40 years of embargo to Cuba do not work, it is \ntime to change the policy.\n  I happen to support lifting the embargo completely. But now we are \njust talking about the first piece: allowing the shipment of food and \nmedicine to Cuba.\n  Then there is the issue of travel to Cuba. How on Earth can one make \nthe claim that travel and exchange and movement between the United \nStates and Cuba somehow undermines our interests? It does not. In my \njudgment, the more contact, the more travel, the more movement there is \nbetween the United States and Cuba, the more we will undermine the \ninterest of the Communist Government of Cuba. That, after all, ought to \nbe our objective.\n  Our objective ought to be to find ways to see if we can't create a \nnew circumstance by which we persuade the Cuban Government to be open, \ndemocratic, and give the people of Cuba an opportunity for the freedoms \nthey deserve. We have had an embargo for Cuba for 40 years. It has not \nworked.\n  There comes a time when you say something that hasn't worked for 40 \nyears ought to be changed. This is a baby step in making the change \nthat is needed. Even at that, we faced significant problems last year.\n  There are a number of people in the Senate who have worked on these \nissues for a long while. Senator Roberts, Senator Dodd, former Senator \nAshcroft, myself, and others have worked on these issues dealing with \nagriculture and travel and other issues for a long while. Senator \nRoberts is on the floor. I know he visited Cuba some months ago. I also \nhave visited Cuba. I found it unthinkable, standing in a hospital in an \nintensive care room one day with a little boy who was in a coma, he had \nbeen in an accident, hit his head, was in a coma. He was in an \nintensive care room. There were no machines. I have been in intensive \ncare rooms and have heard the rhythm of machinery pumping life into \npatients. Not in that room because they don't have the equipment. This \nlittle boy had his mother by his bedside holding his hand. They told me \nat that hospital they were out of 240 different kinds of medicines--240 \ndifferent medicines they didn't have. They were out of it.\n\n  I am sitting there thinking, how could it serve any interest, any \npublic policy purpose, to believe that our withholding the shipment of \nprescription drugs to Cuba is somehow advancing anybody's interest? It \nis simply unthinkable. The same holds true with food. Our farmers toil \nin the fields of this country and they produce a product that is needed \naround the world. We are told that half of the world goes to bed with \nan ache in their belly because it hurts to be hungry. A quarter of the \nworld is on a diet. Then we have farmers here in America struggling to \nfind gas to put in a tractor to plow the ground, to plant a seed, to \nraise a crop, only to go to the elevator in the fall and be told the \ncrop has no value because there is an oversupply of crops.\n  The farmer hears the debate over the embargoes and sanctions we have \nagainst countries because we don't like their leaders. We won't ship \nfood and the farmer get hurt. You talk about a policy that is grounded \nin foolishness--this is it. More than foolishness, it is cruel. It is \nnot what represents the best of this country. This country is a world \nleader. This country produces food in prodigious quantity. It is \nsomething the rest of the world desperately needs. To withhold it \nanywhere in the world is unbecoming of this country.\n  On a moral basis, this country has a responsibility to always, always \ndecide that the shipment of food and medicine is going to be available \nanywhere in the world and that we are not going to have embargoes that \ninclude the withholding of medicines anywhere in the world. Dictators \nwill always get something to eat and medicines to treat their diseases. \nOur policy punishes the sick, hungry, and poor people. It ought to \nstop.\n  The bill I introduce today for myself, Senators Roberts, Baucus, and \nDurbin simply rescinds those provisions of the FY 2001 Agriculture \nAppropriations Act that tightened sanctions on Cuba.\n  I know I have been on the floor a lot talking about these issues, but \nI feel strongly about them. We have the opportunity in this Congress to \nundo what we did last year--undo the bad parts. We did make some \nprogress last year. Yes, we made some progress, but not enough. I want \nour policy to be unequivocal and plain, that nowhere in this world, \nanywhere, in our relationships in the world, will we use food or \nprescription drugs, or medicine, as a weapon. That would represent the \nbest of this country's instincts.\n  In my judgment, it will be accomplished when we have the opportunity \nto vote on it. The fact is, there are 70 or 80 votes in the Senate by \npeople who believe in that position. We have just a few hard-core folks \nthat are still living in the fifties. They drive up here in new cars, \nwear new suits, but they are living in the fifties, serving in the \nCongress in 2001, still pushing policies that don't work. A few people, \na small cabal of people in this Congress, have prevented us from doing \nwhat we all know we should do, eliminate these kinds of sanctions and \nembargoes anywhere in the world.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to have introduced this today. I hope \ncolleagues will carefully consider it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S552]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 171\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF CERTAIN TRADE SANCTIONS AND TRAVEL \n                   PROVISIONS.\n\n       (a) Repeals.--Sections 908 and 910 of the Trade Sanctions \n     Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (as enacted by \n     section 1(a) of Public Law 106-387) are hereby repealed.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 906(a)(1) of the Trade \n     Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 (as \n     enacted by section 1(a) of Public Law 106-387) is amended by \n     striking ``to Cuba or''.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from North \nDakota to introduce legislation to remove several trade limiting \nprovisions from the FY 2001 Agriculture Appropriations Bill. Although \nthe intent may have been otherwise, the overall effect was to tighten \nexisting prohibitions on trade with and tourist travel to Cuba.\n  Specifically, the purpose of the Dorgan-Roberts bill is to make \nchanges to Title 9 of the FY 2001 Agriculture Appropriations Bill, \nrepealing sections 908 & 910 and making a small change to section 906.\n  Title 9, as you recall, is also known as the Trade Sanctions Reform & \nExport Enhancement Act. It made a number of important strides toward \nending the misguided policy of using unilateral food and medicine \nsanctions as a foreign policy tool. Title 9, for example, terminates \ncurrent unilateral agricultural and medical sanctions and requires \ncongressional approval for any new unilateral sanctions that Presidents \nmay consider in the future. That is the good news about last year's \neffort.\n  The bad news is that sections 908 effectively cancels U.S. \nagricultural trade with Cuba as it prohibits any U.S.-based private \nfinancing or the application of any U.S. Government agricultural export \npromotion program. The de facto effect of this provision is to keep the \nCuban market cut-off from America's farmers. This is unacceptable to \nme.\n  Also, section 906 permits the issuance of only one-year licenses for \ncontracts to sell agricultural commodities and medicine to Cuba but \nplaces no such restriction on Syria and North Korea. What's the policy? \nWhat kind of confused message is this? We are either going to permit \nthe sale of food and medicine to all nations despite the presence of \nsome on the State Department terrorist list or we are not going to \nencourage the sale of food and medicine to all Nations. Let us be \nconsistent in these matters.\n  Finally, we seek to rescind section 910 which codified prohibitions \nagainst tourist travel or tourist visits to Cuba. This travel ban \nstifles the most powerful influence on Cuban society: American culture \nand perspective, both economic and political.\n  When Americans travel, they transmit our nation's ideas and values. \nThat is one reason why travel was permitted to the Soviet Union and is \npermitted to the People's Republic of China. A tourist travel ban is \nsimply counterproductive.\n  Trade with Cuba is a very sensitive issue with reasonable, well-\nintentioned people on both sides. But it is an issue which must be \naddressed as globalization and the aggressive posture of America's \ntrade competitors increases. We can no longer sacrifice the American \nfarmer on the altar of the cold war paradigm.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor \nof Senator Dorgan's bill that repeals the restrictions on food and \nmedicine exports to Cuba and removes the legal stranglehold that has \nbeen put on liberalizing travel to Cuba.\n  In July of last year, I led a Senate delegation to Havana. It was a \nbrief trip, but we had the opportunity to meet with a wide range of \npeople and to assess the situation first-hand. We met with Fidel \nCastro. We spent three hours with a group of heroic dissidents who \nspent years in prison, yet have chosen to remain in Cuba and continue \ntheir dissent. We also met with foreign ambassadors, cabinet ministers, \nand the leader of Cuba's largest independent NGO.\n  I left Cuba more convinced than ever that we must end our outdated \nCuba policy. Last year, I introduced legislation to end the embargo and \nbegin the process of normalization of our relations with Cuba. I will \nreintroduce similar legislation this year.\n  The trade embargo of Cuba is a unilateral sanctions policy. Not even \nour closest allies support it. I have long opposed unilateral economic \nsanctions, unless our national security is at stake, and the Defense \nDepartment has concluded that Cuba represents no security threat to our \nnation.\n  Unilateral sanctions don't work. They don't change the behavior of \nthe targeted country. But they do hurt our farmers and business people \nby preventing them from exporting, and then allowing our Japanese, \nEuropean, and Canadian competitors happily to rush in to fill the gap.\n  Ironically, the U.S. embargo actually helps Castro. His economy is in \nshambles. The people's rights are repressed. These are the direct \nresults of Castro's totally misguided economic, political, and social \npolicies. Yet Fidel Castro is able to use the embargo as the scapegoat \nfor Cuba's misery. Absurd, but true.\n  We should lift the embargo. We should engage Cuba economically. The \nbill we are introducing today is a good first step. We tried to remove \nrestrictions on food and medicine exports last year, but a small \nminority in the Congress prevented the will of the majority. And they \ncompounded the damage by codifying restrictions on travel, that is, \nremoving Presidential discretion to allow increased travel and promote \npeople-to-people contact between Americans and Cuban citizens.\n  Removing the food and medicine restrictions won't lead to a huge \nsurge of American products into Cuba. But, today, Cuba's imports come \nprimarily from Europe and Asia. With this liberalization, U.S. products \nwill replace some of those sales. Our agriculture producers will have \nthe advantage of lower transportation costs and easier logistics. It \nwill be a start.\n  Allowing for the expansion of travel will increase the exposure of \nthe Cuban people to the United States. It will result in more travel by \ntourists, business people, students, artists, and scholars. It will \nbring us into closer contact with those who will be part of the \nleadership in post-Castro Cuba. It will spur more business, helping, \neven if only a little, the development of the private sector. Moreover, \nwe need to restore the inherent right of Americans to travel anywhere.\n  The world has changed since the United States initiated this embargo \nforty years ago. I am not suggesting that we embrace Fidel Castro. But \nif we wait until he is completely gone from the scene before we start \nto develop normal relations with leaders and people in Cuba, the \ntransition will be much harder on the Cuban people. Events in Cuba \ncould easily escalate out of control and become a real danger to the \nUnited States.\n  I need to stress that a majority of members of Congress, in both the \nSenate and the House, supported these initial steps to end the embargo. \nBy overwhelming votes in both Houses last year, we approved an end to \nunilateral sanctions on food and medicine exports to Cuba. But the will \nof the majority was stopped by a few members of Congress. This \nlegislation will correct that.\n  I hope to see the day when American policy toward Cuba is no longer \ncontrolled by a small coterie of leaders in the Congress along with a \nfew private groups, and, instead, our policy will serve the national \ninterest. Today's bill is a good first step.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/24/senate-section/article/S552-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S552-S553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 7\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Florida \n(Mr. Nelson) was added as a cosponsor of S. 7, a bill to improve public \neducation for all children and support lifelong learning.\n\n\n                                  S. 9\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Michigan \n(Mr. Levin) was added as a cosponsor of S. 9, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax relief, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 11\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the name of the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Fitzgerald) was added as a cosponsor\n\n[[Page S553]]\n\nof S. 11, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the marriage penalty by providing that the income tax rate \nbracket amounts, and the amount of the standard deduction, for joint \nreturns shall be twice the amounts applicable to unmarried individuals, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 23\n\n  At the request of Mr. Specter, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n(Mr. Durbin) was added as a cosponsor of S. 23, a bill to promote a new \nurban agenda, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 27\n\n  At the request of Mr. Feingold, the names of the Senator from \nMaryland (Ms. Mikulski), the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper), and \nthe Senator from California (Mrs. Feinstein) were added as cosponsors \nof S. 27, a bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nprovide bipartisan campaign reform.\n\n\n                                 S. 28\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gramm, the name of the Senator from South \nDakota (Mr. Daschle) was added as a cosponsor of S. 28, a bill to \nguarantee the right of all active duty military personnel, merchant \nmariners, and their dependents to vote in Federal, State, and local \nelections.\n\n\n                                 S. 88\n\n  At the request of Mr. Rockefeller, the names of the Senator from \nOklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 88, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986 to provide an incentive to ensure that all Americans gain \ntimely and equitable access to the Internet over current and future \ngenerations of broadband capability.\n\n\n                                 S. 104\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from Oregon (Mr. \nSmith) was added as a cosponsor of S. 104, a bill to require equitable \ncoverage of prescription contraceptive drugs and devices, and \ncontraceptive services under health plans.\n\n\n                                 S. 126\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cleland, the name of the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman) was added as a cosponsor of S. 126, a bill \nto authorize the President to present a gold medal on behalf of \nCongress to former President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn Carter \nin recognition of their service to the Nation.\n\n\n                                 S. 132\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnson, the name of the Senator from Maryland \n(Mr. Sarbanes) was added as a cosponsor of S. 132, a bill to amend the \nInternational Revenue Code of 1986 to provide that housing assistance \nprovided under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-\nDetermination Act of 1996 be treated for purposes of the low-income \nhousing credit in the same manner as comparable assistance.\n\n\n                                 S. 135\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Feinstein, the name of the Senator from \nGeorgia (Mr. Cleland) was added as a cosponsor of S. 135, a bill to \namend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to improve payments for \ndirect graduate medical education under the medicare program.\n\n\n                              S.J.

Wisconsin \n     and all those who served aboard her; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such a postage stamp be \n     issued.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, I have the distinct honor of \nintroducing a resolution that commemorates one of the greatest ships of \nthe United States Navy and her crew members. I am joined by the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, and 15 of my other colleagues.\n  The U.S.S. Wisconsin is the largest of the four magnificent \nbattleships ever built by the United States Navy. These four vessels, \nthe Wisconsin, the Iowa, the New Jersey, and the Missouri, comprise the \nrevered Iowa-class battleships. Each of these ships served gallantly in \nevery significant United States conflict from World War II to the \nPersian Gulf War.\n  At 887 feet, the Wisconsin carries a 108-foot, three-inch beam with a \ndisplacement of 45,000 tons. Her armor--as much as 17\\1/2\\ inches in \nsome points--includes nine 16-inch guns, 20 five-inch guns, 80 40-\nmillimeter guns, and 49 20-millimeter guns. The 16-inch guns are able \nto hurl shells roughly the weight of a VW Beetle to distances of up to \n23 nautical miles. Due to the recoil of these massive guns, the deck \nhad to be built of teak wood because steel plating would have buckled \nfrom the stress. While she was designed for a crew of 1,921 sailors, \nshe ended up carrying almost 1,000 additional sailors at points during \nWorld War II and the Korean War.\n  The U.S.S. Wisconsin was built in Philadelphia, and commissioned on 7 \nDecember 1943, exactly two years after the surprise attack on Pearl \nHarbor. From the time President Roosevelt chose to name the vessel the \nWisconsin, citizens from our state took an immediate interest. School \nchildren volunteered to christen the battleship. Some Wisconsinites \neven recommended christening the Wisconsin with water taken straight \nfrom the Wisconsin River, which runs through the heart of our state, \ninstead of champagne. In fact, the Wisconsin's first commander, Captain \nEarl E. Stone, was born in Milwaukee and attended the city's public \nschools and the state university before his appointment to the Naval \nAcademy.\n  In 1944, she underwent sea trials and training in the Chesapeake Bay. \nAfter\n\n[[Page S554]]\n\nthe trials she was at last ready for duty. On 7 July, the Wisconsin \ndeparted Norfolk, Virginia, on her way to war with the legendary \nAdmiral William F. ``Bull'' Halsey and his 3rd Fleet. She came to the \naid of U.S. Marines and infantry as they began their island-hopping \nstrategy toward Japan by sending her shells with deadly accuracy into \nthe Philippines.\n  Following that action, the Wisconsin joined the 5th Fleet under \nanother legendary commander, Admiral Raymond Spruance, and helped \neliminate the Japanese resistance on Iwo Jima and Okinawa, then joining \nin the Battle of Leyte Gulf. After that, the U.S.S. Wisconsin became \npart of Fast Carrier Task Force 38; joining in the attacks on the \nPhilippine Islands, Saigon, Camranh Bay, Hong Kong, Canton, Hainan, and \nfinally the Japanese home islands.\n  Following Japan's surrender, the Wisconsin headed home with five \nbattle stars to her credit. Additionally, after nearly two years of \nservice in the Pacific theater during World War II, the Wisconsin \ndidn't lose one crewman or get hit. This is truly an amazing fact.\n  After her service in World War II, she spent the summer at the \nNorfolk Naval Shipyard where she underwent an extensive overhaul. On 1 \nJuly 1948, she was taken out of commission, in reserve, and assigned to \nthe Norfolk Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.\n  However, her rest was short as the Korean War reawakened the \nWisconsin and her sister battleships. She departed Norfolk on 25 \nOctober 1951, bound for the Pacific where she became the flagship of \nthe 7th Fleet. When the Korean War broke out, future Admiral Elmo \nZumwalt, Jr., served as the Wisconsin's navigator and extolled her \n``versatility, maneuverability, strength, and power.'' During the \nconflict, she covered troop landings; fired upon enemy troops, trains, \ntrucks, and bridges all along the Korean coastline; and attacked \nimportant North Korean ports in Hungnam, Wonsan, and Songjin. In April \n1952, she headed to Long Beach, CA, with yet another battle star.\n  After departing Long Beach and arriving in Norfolk, the Wisconsin \nreceived her second overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Following a \nnumber of peacetime and diplomatic voyages showing the flag, she \nreturned to Norfolk on 11 June 1954 for a brief overhaul before taking \non her role as a training ship.\n  Surprisingly, it was during her service as a training ship that the \nWisconsin received the greatest damage. On 6 May 1956, as she was \ncruising off the Virginia Capes in heavy fog, she collided with the \ndestroyer U.S.S. Eaton. The Wisconsin returned to Norfolk with \nextensive damage to the bow, and a week later found herself back in the \nNorfolk Naval Shipyard. Shipyard workers fitted a 120-ton, 68-foot bow \nsection from the unfinished Iowa-class battleship Kentucky. Working \nround-the-clock, Wisconsin's ship force and shipyard personnel \ncompleted the operation in just 16 days.\n  On 28 June 1956, the ship was once again ready for service. Over the \nnext two years she steamed from Norfolk five more times before heading \nfor Philadelphia and deactivation. For the next 28 years she remained \non inactive status until 1986, when she was towed to Ingalls \nShipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. In 1988, the U.S.S. Wisconsin \nwas re-commissioned for a third time.\n  In 1991, she led the Navy's surface attack on Iraq during the Gulf \nWar and on 17 January fired her first tomahawk missile in the Persian \nGulf War. Following her service, she was honored by leading the \n``Parade of Ships'' for the Fleet Week celebration in New York Harbor.\n  On 7 December 2000, 57 years to the day after she was commissioned, \nthe U.S.S. Wisconsin arrived at Nauticus, the National Maritime Center \nin Norfolk, Virginia, and was given a deserved salute featuring a \nflyover with F-14s and a 21-gun salute. At Nauticus, she serves as a \nfloating monument and, in April of this year, will once again serve the \npublic when she opens her deck as an educational museum. I wish she had \nfound her final port in the great state of Wisconsin, but getting her \nthere simply isn't possible--she's just too big.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will help me and the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin honor this great ship with a commemorative \nstamp.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/24/senate-section/article/S553-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S553-S554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 3--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT \n A COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP SHOULD BE ISSUED IN HONOR OF THE U.S.S. \n           ``WISCONSIN'' AND ALL THOSE WHO SERVED ABOARD HER\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bingaman, \n        Mr. Conrad, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Mr. McCain, Mr. Miller, Mr. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Warner) submitted \n        the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the \n        Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n                             S.

I wish she had \nfound her final port in the great state of Wisconsin, but getting her \nthere simply isn't possible--she's just too big.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will help me and the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin honor this great ship with a commemorative \nstamp.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/24/senate-section/article/S554-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.
