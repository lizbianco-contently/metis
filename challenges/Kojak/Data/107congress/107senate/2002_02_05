Mr. President, I think it is important to note, with the \nPresident having submitted to us his budget, that we have had a $5 \ntrillion surplus disappear in the last 8 months.\n  Earlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office confirmed that \nsince passage of the tax cut in May, the surplus projected for the \nperiod of 2002 to 2011 declined by $4 trillion. The President's new \ntax-and-spend proposals would consume another $1.3 trillion or more \nover this period.\n  I acknowledge that some of this is as a result of the war being \nconducted, but that is just some of it. As all political scientists and \neconomists have reported in the last few months, the majority of the \nproblem is other economic problems that have developed since this \nadministration took office. It is clear that the Republican fiscal \nmanagement forces a $1.5 trillion raid of the Social Security trust \nfunds. There is also a raid on the Medicare trust funds of some $300 \nbillion.\n  So I think we must acknowledge we have some serious problems that are \ngoing to have to be talked about in the next month or so as we get \nready to do a budget for this Congress.\n  We have what should be called deceptive bookkeeping. We have broken \nthe bipartisan commitment to save Social Security trust fund surpluses. \nThe administration has submitted to us an unbalanced budget. Clearly it \nis unbalanced. And they have used the Social Security surpluses to mask \nthe unprecedented fiscal reversal seen in the last 8 months and to pay \nfor exploding tax cuts that primarily benefit a wealthy few while \njeopardizing retirement security for all Americans.\n  In addition to this deceptive accounting practice, the \nadministration's budget breaks with a decade-long tradition by only \nproviding details for the next 5 years, even as the administration \noffers new tax-and-spend proposals with enormous costs that are not \nfelt until later years. The reason they are not doing the 10-year \nforecast is that the deficits explode in those outyears. This gimmick \nhides the full budgetary impact and irresponsibility of the \nadministration's fiscal proposals.\n\n  The budget also resorts to other--for lack of a better description--\ngimmicks. Examples include unrealistic restraints on future nondefense \ndiscretionary spending, unspecified future Medicare cuts, and proposing \nbudget cuts that have been repeatedly rejected.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the majority's time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to make some comments in \nrelation to the remarks the Senator from Nevada just made--not in \ndisagreement with anything he said, but to supplement them and to put \nthem in proper perspective.\n  In regard to tax cuts and the war on terrorism and their impact on \nthe deficit, even after the tax cuts of last year, we are still going \nto have a level of taxation that is as high as we had in World War II. \nThe war on terrorism is taking our resources because, obviously, we \nhave to put every resource we can into winning the war or it might not \nbe won. And we are still going to have a level of taxation that was \nsimilar to the times of other wars. The benchmark we use is World War \nII, when taxes were at about 20.6 percent of gross national product.\n  I ought to correct myself. At the end of 10 years, we would probably \nstill have taxes a bit less than they were in World War II. But right \nnow, they are at that level, even considering the tax cuts we passed.\n  The war on terrorism has been one of the reasons we are in deficit. \nAlso, the tax cuts are a reason there will be deficits. There are \ndeficits because of the recession we are in right now, most of which \nwas caused by the war acts of September 11, but also remember that the \ndownturn in the economy, as far as manufacturing is concerned, started \n19 months ago, in March of the last year of President Clinton's \nadministration. Also remember that 50 percent of the loss of the Nasdaq \ntook place in the last year of the Clinton administration. As far as \nthe economy is concerned, the downturn started before President Bush \never took office, before we ever knew that the dastardly acts which \noccurred on September 11 would ever happen to us.\n  I want to comment on a fact that is true, that this does affect \nSocial Security. In a unified budget, Social Security is considered \npart of the deficit or part of the surplus, but it is wrong to refer to \na situation for Social Security different now than a year ago when we \nanticipated a $5.8 trillion surplus.\n  This is a historical fact about Social Security that has never \nchanged since 1936: Whether we have a unified budget, which we have had \nsince 1967 when President Johnson instituted it, or whether we have \nseparate pots of money--some for Social Security, some for Medicare, \nsome for disability, some for highways, some for airports--our \ndifferent trust funds, the way Social Security has been accounted for \nhas not changed since 1936. It is this simple: Since 1936, the Social \nSecurity payroll money has been paid into a trust fund. That trust fund \nhas had some sort of a surplus since 1936 except for the years 1982 and \n1983. My colleagues will remember, at that particular time when we did \nnot have a surplus, we borrowed money from Medicare to keep Social \nSecurity checks going until we bailed it out.\n  Since 1936, Social Security moneys have always been handled the same \nway. They have been put in the Social Security trust fund and the \nsurplus has been invested in non-marketable Government securities. That \nhas not changed since 1936, whether we have had unified accounting or \nwhatever the situation has been.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, has the time for morning business expired?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under morning business, the time \nfor the minority has expired.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

MARTINEZ TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will now proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nomination, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Philip R. \nMartinez, of Texas, to be United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Texas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 15 minutes evenly divided between the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am sure the distinguished chairman \nof the committee will be here shortly. I am very pleased that I am the \nfirst person to speak on behalf of Judge Phil Martinez to be a United \nStates District Judge for the Western District of Texas.\n  Of all the courts in the country that are desperate for judges, those \non the United States-Mexico border have the most critical need. \nAccording to statistics from 2000, the Western District of Texas \nhandles the most criminal cases in the country, 4,434 per year, while \nthe Southern District of Texas, for which Randy Crane awaits \nconfirmation, has the third highest level after California's Southern \nDistrict.\n  Currently, the Western District of Texas is facing a criminal \ncaseload of 1,983 pending cases and 2,758 defendants waiting for trial \nbecause we do not have these judgeships filled.\n  In El Paso, 884 cases are pending overall, more than any other region \nin the district. Each day, more cases are added, overwhelming an \nalready overburdened Western District. Relief is needed.\n  Our war against terrorism is heating up as well as our war on drugs. \nTherefore, it is more crucial that we have highly qualified judges and \nlaw enforcement officials in charge of our justice system along the \nUnited States-Mexico border. This is a decisive time for our Nation and \nour borders.\n  Senator Dianne Feinstein and I have introduced a bill to expand the \nnumber of Federal courts along the border. While I encourage Senators \nto support\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\nthat bill, I also urge my colleagues to expedite the confirmation of \nborder prosecutors and other judges such as Judge Martinez and Randy \nCrane.\n  At the same time, certainly we must be very careful with the \nselection of U.S. district judges because, as we all know, they have \nlifetime appointments. That is why I am very pleased to recommend Judge \nMartinez.\n  Judge Martinez has presided over a State district court in El Paso \nsince 1991. Previously, he was a judge of a county court at law, having \nbeen elected by the people of El Paso. He has also been a practicing \nlawyer with the firm of Kemp, Smith, an excellent firm in El Paso. He \nhas more than 10 years of experience at the trial court level, \npresiding over felony, juvenile, and civil cases. In 1979, Judge \nMartinez graduated from the University of Texas-El Paso with highest \nhonors, receiving his law degree in 1982 from Harvard University.\n  In addition, he has been a director of the El Paso Legal Assistance \nSociety, the El Paso Holocaust Museum, the El Paso Cancer Treatment \nCenter, and the Hispanic Leadership Institute. He was named the 1991-\n1992 El Paso Young Lawyers Association's ``Outstanding Young Lawyer'' \nafter winning its 1990 Outstanding Achievement Award.\n  Judge Martinez is known in El Paso as a brilliant thinker and an \neffective and hard worker. He is known to make fair and thoughtful \njudgment based on principle. I cannot think of anyone to better fill \nthe pending judicial vacancy in El Paso at a pivotal time for this \ncourt.\n  I am very pleased to recommend to my colleagues Judge Phil Martinez \nto be a United States district judge for the Western District in El \nPaso.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I join in the remarks of the distinguished \nSenator from Texas, and I rise also to express my enthusiastic support \nfor Philip R. Martinez who has been nominated to be a U.S. District \nCourt judge for the Western District of Texas.\n  Judge Martinez is an extremely well-qualified nominee who has \ndistinguished himself with hard work, and he has a fine intellect. He \nwill do great service for the citizens of our country.\n  Judge Martinez graduated from Harvard Law School in 1982 and \nthereafter developed a commercial litigation practice involving \nantitrust, securities fraud, deceptive trade practices, contract, and, \nof course, banking issues. He was elected to serve as a judge in El \nPaso County Court of Law No. 1 for a 4-year term beginning in January \n1991, and he resigned this position in October 1991 to accept \nappointment by the Governor to the 327th Judicial District Court. He \nwas subsequently elected to this position for a 2-year term beginning \nin January 1993 and reelected for consecutive terms thereafter. \nClearly, he has the experience and temperament required for this \nposition.\n  While I am speaking about Judge Martinez's qualifications, I would be \nremiss not to make an observation or two about how judge Martinez's \nnomination fits into the bigger picture of how the Senate is treating \njudicial nominees this year. As I mentioned 10 days ago, I think we \nstarted off the session with appropriate diligence. Chairman Leahy \nscheduled a hearing the first week we were in session on one circuit \ncourt nominee and five district court nominees. That same week we voted \non two district court nominees that had been held over from the end of \nthe last session.\n  Yesterday we had a vote on Callie V. Granade, and after today there \nwill be no more holdovers from last year. So I commend the chairman and \nthe Democratic leader for getting off to a good start.\n  Judge Martinez's nomination also provides a useful example of how, \ncontrary to some unsupported insinuations, the White House has worked \nwith us, consulted appropriately, and reached across the aisle to find \ngood bipartisan nominees. Judge Martinez, who belongs to the El Paso \nCounty Democratic Party, received strong support from both of his home \nState Senators. He is a highly qualified Hispanic of Mexican descent \nwho will add an important point of view to the bench.\n  I sincerely hope that our record so far this year is not a false \nstart. The Judiciary Committee in the Senate should continue to step up \nthe pace of hearings and votes on judicial nominees. No one can dispute \nthat we have plenty of work to do.\n\n  Taking account of today's vote, there are 98 vacancies on the Federal \njudiciary. We have received 24 new nominations already this year. Added \nto the 34 nominees after today who saw no committee action last \nsession, we will now have a total of 59 nominees pending in the Senate. \nI am optimistic that we will confirm all of these and then some. Our \nyardstick for 2002, President Bush's second year in office, is 1994, \nthe second year of President Clinton's first term. That year the Senate \nconfirmed 100 judicial nominees. I am confident the Republicans and \nDemocrats can work together to achieve and perhaps even hopefully \nexceed 100 confirmations in 2002.\n  So I look forward to working together with Chairman Leahy and my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the \ncommittee to accomplish this goal. I appreciate the work of my \ncolleagues on the other side in doing this work, because the Federal \njudiciary is in a crisis and we have to do something about it. The best \nwe can do is take these nominees up and vote on them and hopefully get \nthem confirmed so they can get on the bench and help us during this \ntime of crisis where we do have an awful lot of pressure on the Federal \njudiciary.\n  I appreciate, Mr. President, that you are a member of Judiciary \nCommittee, and I just want to remark on your fine work on the committee \nthrough the years.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask we move forward with the vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time having expired, the \nquestion is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of \nPhilip R. Martinez, to be a U.S. District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Texas?

Mr. President, as ranking member of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, I bring to the attention of my colleagues \na situation which I think bears some light.\n  We have a unique set of circumstances surrounding the manner in which \nthe energy bill is likely to come up before the Senate. I understand \nthat unofficially a date has been set for February 11.\n  What we have before us is a bill that has been proposed by the \nmajority leader with the assistance of the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Bingaman. The problem with the process is that bill has not \nbeen referred to the committee of jurisdiction; that is, the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee.\n  The question is, Why in the normal course of events would a bill \nunder the jurisdiction of the committee not be referred to that \ncommittee? To suggest that there is an effort to obstruct the process \nby giving Members input on the bill through the normal process of \namendments is a travesty of the process associated with the traditions \nof the Senate.\n  Let me outline where the inconsistencies are.\n  The Commerce Committee is holding markups on aspects of the energy \nbill concerning CAFE standards, as they should. Senator Hollings, \nchairman of that committee, insisted that prior to any developed input \non an energy bill CAFE standards be addressed in the committee of \njurisdiction; namely, Commerce. I have no objection to that. That is \nquite appropriate. But it brings me back to the reality that the \ncommittee of jurisdiction on the underlying bill has not been given the \nopportunity. In fact, the majority leader has indicated to the chairman \nof the Energy Committee that the matter not be taken up before the \nEnergy Committee. One can only wonder why.\n\n  Obviously, there are portions of the energy bill with which the \nmajority leader disagrees. I can understand that. But to circumvent the \ncommittee process is what I find unacceptable.\n  Let me give you another example of an inconsistency associated with \nthe energy bill; that is, certain tax incentives that are proposed to \nexpand our energy production, particularly in the area of renewables \nand new technology.\n  The Finance Committee, which Senator Baucus chairs, is in the process \nof holding markups, in detail, on portions of energy-related tax \nmatters. So here we have two committees, neither of which have the \nunderlying jurisdiction associated with the energy bill, and their \nchairmen are proceeding with hearings on their portions of the energy \nbill; namely, those associated with tax provisions in the Finance \nCommittee and those associated with CAFE standards in the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  So I would ask the majority leader why he refuses to allow the \ncommittee of jurisdiction to hold markups to encourage the \nparticipation of members of the committee to review, if you will, or \nhave any input in the bill that is before the Senate as submitted by \nthe majority leader.\n  This bill has had no referrals to the Energy Committee. It has had \nabsolutely no input from the minority side--Republican members--of that \ncommittee. I fail to understand the rationale of the majority leader in \nrefusing to allow the committee of jurisdiction to hold a markup. \nPerhaps there is a concern the majority leader has relative to how any \nvotes would go outside of the parameters of the legislation which he \nand Senator Bingaman have introduced.\n  I think it is also a reflection on myself, as the ranking member, and \nSenator Bingaman, as the chairman of the committee, to have our \ncommittee circumvented by the dictate of the majority leader. Yet at \nthe same time the majority leader, I assume, is knowledgeable and \nallows the Committee of Commerce and the Committee of Finance to \naddress their portions of legislation that would be included in the \nunderlying bill.\n  I bring this matter to the attention of other Members because I think \nit suggests that clearly the majority leader is attempting to obstruct \nthe legislative process. This bill belongs in the Energy Committee. The \nEnergy Committee has every right to proceed to discuss and consider \naspects of this very important legislation. After all, this is one of \nthe President's underlying priorities, along with trade legislation and \nstimulus. And now that the majority leader has given us an opportunity \nto have a date to take up energy--namely, the date of February 11 --we \nfind ourselves in the position where we have had absolutely no input in \nthis legislation.\n  We have had a bill in since over a year ago, a comprehensive energy \nbill. We can look forward to the debate and proceed with amendments to \nthe majority leader's bill. We can consider substitutions. But I want \nmy colleagues to know that the committee of jurisdiction has been \ncircumvented, with no reasonable explanation. Yet the other committees \nhave been allowed to proceed.\n  I do not know whether to pursue this further, in the sense of asking \nmy colleagues, collectively, if this is the way they believe the Senate \nshould be run or whether we should proceed with a sense of the Senate \nrelative to one committee, for all practical purposes, ostracized by \nthe majority leader by not allowing the committee of jurisdiction to \ntake up this matter. But I communicate to my colleagues that I believe \nthis is a grave injustice. It is a reflection on myself and it is a \nreflection on the committee chairman, inasmuch as our responsibility \nhas been circumvented. The majority leader has simply decided, without \nthe input of the committee of jurisdiction, to proceed with this \nlegislation coming up on the floor.\n  I encourage my colleagues to reflect on what is happening. I think it \nis a retreat from tradition. I find it very objectionable, and I cannot \nunderstand why the majority leader would obstruct the process \nassociated with the responsibility of a committee of jurisdiction.\n  Mr. President, I am going to have more to say about this matter as \ntime goes on, but I do appreciate the opportunity, in morning business, \nto bring this matter to the attention of my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Those discussions are \nongoing.\n  I think the discussions have been conducted in good faith. We have \nspent a lot of time on this economic stimulus\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\nbill, and not being in the Chamber debating and offering amendments I \ndo not think is going to take away from our ability to do the bill or \nnot do the bill.

Mr. President, at this time, I tell my friend and \ncolleague, I will not object because I have a great deal of respect for \nhim. We are ready to proceed with a lot of amendments on the stimulus \nbill. My colleague from Arizona has an amendment to make the estate tax \nelimination permanent. As people know, it is effective for 1 year and \ngoes off the books; it sunsets. It should be made permanent. We have \nother amendments dealing with net offset carryback for 5 years. We \nwould like to have a vote on that amendment. We have amendments that we \nbelieve will help stimulate the economy. We would like to have votes on \nthem.\n  I guess we can go into a period for morning business, have the \ncaucuses, and people can strategize. Democrats and Republicans do have \nseveral amendments pending. Frankly, a lot of us would like to vote on \nthose amendments to improve the package the majority leader introduced, \nwhich we believe comes up a little short.\n  I am not going to object to his request for a period for morning \nbusiness. My understanding is we can debate the stimulus package \nthrough that period. But I hope we will have a chance for Democrats and \nRepublicans to offer their amendments later today and tomorrow. So I \nmention to my colleague, who is my very good friend, that we want to \nhave some votes to improve this package today, but I shall not object \nto his request.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, given the fact we are in morning business, I \nwish to speak to the question of the repeal of the death tax to which \nthe Senator from Oklahoma just referred. As my colleagues will \nremember, of course, the repeal of the death tax was part of the tax \npackage that was passed earlier in the year, but because of the unique \nprocedures of the Senate and the rules under which we operate, we could \nonly look to a 10-year period, as a result of which, perversely, we \nphase down the death tax and end up repealing it in the ninth year, so \nit is only effective for 1 year before the whole thing sunsets and we \ngo right back to the current situation with respect to the application \nof the death tax.\n  I do not think most Americans realize that is what has happened, but \npeople who have to plan for their estates do realize it has happened. \nThis is why a permanent repeal of the death tax now would be so helpful \nas a stimulus to the economy because all of the estate tax planning, \nthe insurance, and all the other activities people have to do to \nprovide against the possibility of paying the death tax must continue, \nas it has in the last many years, with the uncertainty of knowing \nwhether or not, if ever, it is going to be permanently repealed and the \nexpenses of all that have to continue to be incurred, expenses that \ncould be put into investments so we could create jobs for our economy, \nprecisely what the President has talked about doing with his stimulus \npackage.\n  It is time for us to complete the job we began and see to it that the \nrepeal of the death tax is, in fact, permanent and, therefore, \nmeaningful.\n  Let me note some of the uncertainty that the lack of total repeal \ncauses our family businesses, our farms, and individuals.\n  As I said, the business owners are going to continue to have to do \nthe estate planning that is costly, cumbersome, and time consuming. If \nwe repeal permanently the death tax, then these resources can be \nreinvested directly into these businesses, thus creating new job \nopportunities and providing a much needed boost to local economies.\n  In June 2001, a bipartisan majority of Congress did, in fact, act \nresponsibly and provided this repeal of the death tax, much needed \nrelief to our American families, with that historic tax package. But if \nwe do not finish the job, we are going to be held in limbo with respect \nto the death tax because it comes right back into play after the end of \nthe 10-year period.\n  The amendment I have offered will not be voted on until perhaps this \nafternoon. It will repeal the death tax forever so that our children \nand grandchildren will not have to worry about it or plan to have to \npay for it.\n  Actually, last year's tax legislation has had the perverse result \nthat more planning is necessary to deal with the death tax than \ncurrently is the case. Accountants, lawyers, and insurance companies \nare having a field day, frankly, with the uncertainty that is \nencapsulated in the current state of the death tax legislation.\n  More planning is needed now because nobody knows for sure if and when \nit will ever be fully repealed.\n  The sunset provision adds to the complexity of future death tax \nplanning, increasing wasteful costs that are an unproductive drag on \nour economy. Until permanent repeal is certain, family businesses, \nfarms, and ranches must continue to pay the high cost of life insurance \npolicies, death tax planners, and tax attorneys. These expenses total \nmore than $12 billion a year according to CONSAD Research Corporation \nin a study, ``The Federal Estate Tax: An Analysis of Three Prominent \nIssues.'' That is money that could be saved, could be reinvested in \nthese businesses to create the kinds of job opportunities the President \nis talking about in urging us to move on with an economic stimulus and \njob creation package.\n  Clearly, burying the death tax will enable family businesses, farms, \nand ranches to begin investing those billions and start providing more \nstimulus. A more efficient utilization of these resources will result \nin an immediate stimulus for the economy. More workers will be hired, \nmore capital assets purchased, and more productive goods produced if we \neliminate the confusion over the death tax's repeal.\n  I think we all understand why we repealed the death tax in the first \ninstance. In addition to the fact that a huge amount of money is spent \non estate tax planning, studies indicate we spend about the same amount \neach year on the estate tax planning as is paid in estate taxes \naltogether. So it is really a double taxation. We are paying an amount \nof money to deal with the eventuality of paying an estate tax, and that \nis paid by a lot of people who do not end up paying the tax but end up \nhaving to pay the expenses of dealing with the existence of a death \ntax, and then an equal amount of money is spent in the estate tax \nitself.\n  In 2009, families, frankly, who are grieving their lost ones will be \nfaced with a potentially high 45-percent death tax rate. Fortunately, \nthey are going to be able to utilize a $3.5 million death tax exemption \nwhich was enacted into law last year, but in 2010 families grieving for \nlost ones will avoid the death tax entirely. They will only have a \ntotal of $5.6 million of stepped-up basis, but that will effectively \nexempt them from all future capital gains tax, a tax in any event of \nwhich they would control the timing.\n  Then in 2011, families grieving their lost ones will feel the wrath \nof a resurrected death tax returned to its 2001 rate potency. Rates \nwill be as high as 60 percent with a paltry $675,000 death tax \nexemption. That is the way our repeal, at midpoint of last year, \nworked. So it is a very unfair and arbitrary treatment for the death of \nfamily members, as well as, as I said before, creating perverse \neconomic incentives.\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\n  One can only imagine the extremes to which a family will go to keep \nfatally ill family members alive in 2009. Nobody wants to predict or \nargue for anyone to die in any particular year, and that is exactly the \nperverse nature of the code that we have created now. Unless one dies \nin the year 2010, they have a big problem. And for heaven's sake, do \nnot wait to die until the year 2011. Now what kind of tax policy is \nthat, where we say if one dies in the year 2010 they get full benefits \nof repeal but if they hang on to life and die a year later they are \nright back to where they were a year ago with a 60-percent tax rate and \nan exemption that does not cover most of the family farmers and \nbusinesses that we are talking about? That is horrible moral policy. It \nis horrible economic policy. It cannot be the policy of the U.S. \nGovernment and yet that is exactly what our repeal last year resulted \nin, the reinstitution of the tax in the year 2010. It is an outrage \nthat our Tax Code would incorporate such arbitrary and immoral \nincentives.\n\n  Of course that is not what we intended when we repealed the tax. It \nis not what we intended when a bipartisan majority voted on that repeal \nand passed it. We really wanted it to be forever, but again it was the \nrules of the Senate that limited us to a 10-year program. So the best \nsolution would be to finish the job and permanently repeal the death \ntax effective January 1, 2002. By making the tax repeal permanent in \n2010, Congress can keep the promise it made last year. I think this is \nthe only moral way we can respond to this very immoral tax.\n  I will have more to say when we actually debate the amendment, but I \nclose by asking my colleagues to allow us to present this amendment and \nhave an up-or-down vote on it without playing parliamentary games. It \nis possible that somebody could second degree this amendment. We could \nplay the game by second degreeing it. We could second degree somebody \nelse's amendment with this amendment. We can do all of those things, \nbut I think the American people would like for us not to be playing \ngames.\n  When I go home, that is what I hear all the time: Why do you guys go \nback to Washington and play all of these, as they say, partisan games?\n  The repeal of the death tax and the passage of the tax bill was a \nsuccessful bipartisan effort. So I think it is important the majority \nof us who approved that tax package, including the death tax \nprovisions, be given an opportunity to vote up-or-down on this \namendment, which finishes the job we started, and enable us to vote to \nrepeal the death tax permanently. If we cannot get that kind of a vote, \nthen all we are doing is hiding from the American people our views with \nrespect to this issue and allow a lot of people to say, oh, sure, yes, \nI voted for repealing the death tax knowing full well that it was not \nan effective appeal because it only existed for 1 year.\n  One better not wait to die the following year if they want to get the \nadvantage of what we did. That is a perverse policy. So I urge my \ncolleagues to allow this vote, up or down, on the death tax amendment. \nWe will be bringing it up this afternoon.\n  I am looking forward to a spirited debate on it. At the conclusion of \nthat debate, we need to stand up for what is right and true and vote \nyes or no. If my colleagues do not want to make it permanent, then \nstand up and say so and let everybody know exactly where they stand.\n  I think the majority of us are going to want to finish the job we \nstarted, make this tax cut permanent, allow the people who otherwise \nwould have to spend $12 billion a year or more on estate planning to \nput that money into more productive enterprises, to create jobs and \nhelp us get out of the economic doldrums our country is in today.\n  It is good policy for the economy but, more importantly, it is good \npolicy for small businesses, farms, and the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I refer to an article on page 6 of the \nWashington Post this morning where there is a quote from colleagues in \nthis body and in the other body about the President's budget. I refer \nto this comment from the ranking Democrat on the House Budget \nCommittee, Congressman Spratt:\n\n       When it comes to waging a war on terrorism, the President \n     has our total support, but national security and homeland \n     security need not come at the expense of Social Security.\n\n  Philosophically, that is a good argument. It is an accurate argument \nfor us to be using, but the inference is that with the President's new \nbudget there is some sort of a new game in town, that because we do not \nhave a general fund surplus, because we have to spend more money \nbecause of the war on terrorism, as well as the domestic aspect of the \nwar on terrorism, we are going to take Social Security money to finance \nthat because there is otherwise a debt. The implication is this is some \nnew policy.\n  The point I make is that this kind of talk is misleading because \nseniors become frightened that they might not receive their Social \nSecurity payments. Conservatives may feel as if there is not any fiscal \ndiscipline in Washington. Compared to the last 4 years, we have paid \ndown on the national debt in the last 4 years on a relative basis. But \nconservatives might be concerned that there is no concern about fiscal \ndiscipline when it comes to Social Security. But, in fact, there is no \nnew policy in town.\n  The point I make is since Social Security was started in 1936, except \nfor about 18 months in the years 1982 and 1983, it has had a positive \ncashflow, more money coming in from the Social Security payroll tax \nthan has been paid out in benefits. As we anticipate that for the \nfuture, that will be true for another 14 years, or so.\n\n  So for people who read this statement by Congressman Spratt--and I \nquote: When it comes to waging war on terrorism, the President has our \ntotal support, but national security and homeland security need not \ncome at the expense of Social Security--I say it is not coming at the \nexpense of Social Security. Nothing has changed on Social Security \nsince 1936. We have a positive cashflow today. We have had a positive \ncashflow every year except for 18 months in 1982 and 1983, and we will \nhave a positive cashflow in Social Security for at least another 13 or \n14 years. National security and homeland security are not coming at the \nexpense of Social Security, I say to the distinguished Congressman in \nthe other body.\n  Since we still have a positive cashflow in the year 2002, and we had \na positive cashflow starting when the tax was first implemented, except \nfor those 2 years, what happens with Social Security money? The \ndisposition of Social Security money is the same today, last year, and \nyears we have been running a surplus in the unified budget, and for a \nlong time back. The surplus is invested in Treasury bonds because those \nare considered the safest investment for retirees. They draw interest. \nThe interest accrues to the benefit of Social Security. That positive \ncashflow invested in Treasury bonds, plus the interest that is accrued, \nis going to be used to pay Social Security benefits when there is a \nnegative cashflow in some future year. That is the way Social Security \nwas set up. That is the way it has been operated since it was \nimplemented in 1936. That is the way I believe it will be for a long \ntime into the future.\n  National security and homeland security is not coming at the expense \nof Social Security. Let me give a parallel analysis. I will use the \nhighway trust fund. In my State, it is the road use tax fund. At the \nFederal level it is the highway trust fund. All of the gas tax money \ngoes into the highway trust fund. It is paid out of that highway trust \nfund for transportation, mostly for highways. It is not used for \nanything else. There are times, though, that the Federal Government \ndecided they did not want to spend all the highway trust fund money. It \nwas invested in Treasury bonds, as well. And it was not used to buy \nbombs and guns\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\nand pay military pay. Over a period of years a lot of money \naccumulated.\n  In the last highway bill, Congress decided we ought to spend down \nthat money that accumulated in the highway trust fund, and we spent it \ndown. Not entirely, but we are spending it down. Consequently, if you \ncan take that money that accumulated in the highway trust fund, that \nwas not spent on roads on a current basis, but later was and is being \nspent for highways, it is exactly the same for Social Security. Moneys \naccumulate, with interest accruing to the trust fund, to be spent when \nit is needed, in the same way that the gas money, when it was not spent \non highways, accumulated and later Congress decided we ought to spend \nmore money on highways and we spent more money on highways.\n  It is one of the facts of trust fund accounting. The problem comes \nwhen we put Social Security in the context of a unified budget that it \nsomehow gets lost in the public's mind. I assure the public that the \nimplication of the statement by the ranking Democrat on the House \nBudget Committee, Congressman Spratt, that the President's war on \nterrorism, the American people's war on terrorism could somehow be paid \nfor by Social Security. In fact, it is not being financed by Social \nSecurity money.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S317-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S317-S318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will comment also on the tax relief \nbill signed by the President of the United States on June 7, the tax \nbill that Senator Baucus and I wrote in a bipartisan way, to get passed \nlast year. I will concentrate on the stimulative impact on the tax bill \nof last year because now, being in a recession and being on another \nstimulus package, I don't think we ought to lose sight of the fact that \nthe tax bill of last year is having some economic good at a time most \nneeded, in a time of recession.\n  It does contain a significant number of tax reduction and tax relief \nprovisions that will go into effect and should help build consumer \nconfidence. Part of the economy may be uncertain, but the tax outlook \nis clear: Under the law we passed, Federal income taxes have declined \nand will continue to decline over the next 10 years. Taxpayers can take \nthat knowledge to the bank, regardless of Senator Kennedy's suggestion \nthat we not allow the remaining provisions of the tax bill to go into \neffect.\n  Obviously, I don't think Congress should stop here. Our huge economy \nneeds a shot in the arm. The tax bill of last year will help to provide \nthat shot in the arm. It contains a generous amount of relief for \nindividual taxpayers. Some of the measure's tax cuts went into effect \nlast year and many other provisions became effective January 1 of this \nyear. Those are the provisions I will address.\n  There is a new 10-percent rate bracket. The act created a new 10-\npercent regular income tax bracket for a part of taxable income that \nhad otherwise been taxed at a higher rate of 15 percent. The 10-percent \nbracket applies to the first $6,000 of taxable income for single \nindividuals; $10,000 of taxable income for heads of household; and \n$12,000 for married couples filing jointly. This is effective beginning \nafter December 31, 2000. That money is out there to stimulate the \neconomy right now, but it will continue this year and next year and \ninto the future.\n  We had a reduction in other individual tax rates, the regular income \ntax rates phased down over 6 years. So effective July 1 of last year \nthrough 2003, the 28-percent rate is cut to 27 percent. We hope in this \neconomic stimulus package to speed that one rate up, it be reduced to \n25 percent right now to help middle-income taxpayers and to stimulate \nthe economy at the same time. However, as written in last year's tax \nbill, the 31-percent rate is cut to 30 percent right now. The 36-\npercent rate is cut to 35 percent right now. The 39.6-percent rate is \ncut to 38.6 percent.\n  Eventually, all these separate rates, after this phase-in period is \ndone, will become 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent, and 35 percent, \nrespectively.\n  An increase and expansion of the child tax credit is surely going to \nhelp families, particularly middle-income families, particularly those \nin the $30,000-a-year income tax range, with their family needs, \nputting more money in their pockets. It is going to be a stimulus to \nthe economy. The child credit was expanded to $600 per child, \nimmediately through the year 2004; it goes up to $700 through the year \n2008; $800 through the year 2009; and finally, $1,000 in 2010. But, \nmore important, the child credit was made refundable to the extent of \n10 percent of the taxpayer's earned income in excess of $10,000 for the \nyears 2001 through 2004, and this is increased to 15 percent after the \nyear 2005.\n  I emphasize that because of all the people who say the Tax Relief Act \nof last year was for the wealthy. A refundable credit is helping people \nof the lower income tax bracket very much. For example, in the year \n2001, a single mother with two children, making $15,000, received a \ncredit of $500. This single mother likely now will receive a bigger tax \nrefund check when she files her 2001 tax return by April 15. This \nexpansion of the child credit will ensure that millions of low-income \nfamilies, not rich people, will now receive the benefit of this child \ncredit. For those people who spend so much of their income, maybe all \nof it in some cases, they are going to have more money to spend, and \nthat is going to stimulate the economy.\n  Then we have the extension and expansion of the adoption tax credit, \nnot so much as a stimulus to the economy but because stable families \nare very important to our society. Moving children out of foster care \ninto a home where they can actually have a mom and dad is very \nimportant social policy. So we move the tax credit from $5,000 to \n$10,000. Today, in the case of the special needs child, that tax credit \nis $6,000. This provision significantly eases the financial burden of \nadoption and encourages adoption. This is in effect for taxable income \nstarting this year.\n  We have a tax credit, then, for employers who provide child care for \ntheir employees. In my State of Iowa, 72 percent of the households have \nboth spouses working, the highest percentage of any State in the \nNation. For those families who have children, the need for dependable \nchild care is very important. Getting that from the employer is even \nbetter for those families. So this new tax credit provides an incentive \nfor employer-provided on-site daycare facilities. This is effective for \ntaxable years beginning right now.\n  We have marriage penalty relief, and it relates to the earned-income \ntax credit. That earned-income tax credit, which is available only to \nlow-income families, phases out for married couples. We increased that \nphaseout by $1,000 immediately and ultimately increase it to $3,000. So \nthose families who would otherwise have that earned-income tax credit \nphased out, not having the money, not being able to stimulate the \neconomy, now are going to have up to another $1,000 immediately \navailable. Again, being low-income families, that ought to help \nstimulate the economy starting right now for the year we are in.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Vermont. Is it possible for me \nto have another 5 minutes?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent if I may have 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I might then be recognized after the Senator?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I add that to my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  So, obviously, this is going to help stimulate the economy because \nthis $1,000 is going to go to low-income families who do not have very \nmuch discretionary income and can use it to improve their lot. But at \nthe same time it will stimulate the economy--whether it is spent or \nwhether they save it.\n  We have improvements in the education savings accounts, or what we \nmight call education individual retirement accounts, individual \neducation IRAs. The annual limit on contributions to the education \nsavings account increases from $500 to $2,000. The definition of \nqualified education expenses that may be paid tax free from the \neducation savings account is expanded to include elementary and \nsecondary school expenses. The phaseout ranges--for married taxpayers \nfiling joint returns, it is increased to become twice\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\nthe rate of single taxpayers, so more families can take advantage of \nthis. Corporations and other entities, including tax-exempt groups, are \npermitted to make contributions to education savings accounts. These \nchanges are effective right now, this taxable year.\n  Then we have expanded consideration of prepaid tuition programs. \nSeveral provisions will encourage participation in prepaid tuition \nprograms for higher education. Investment gains will be tax free, and \nprivate colleges and universities happen to be offering these plans. \nThis provision goes into effect now.\n  There is an exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance. \nThis extends the exclusion to graduate education and makes the \nexclusion for undergraduate and graduate education permanent, effective \nright now.\n  Then we have improvement in the student loan interest deduction. This \neliminates the 60-month limit on the deduction of interest from a \nstudent loan. The income phaseout ranges, for eligibility for the \nstudent loan interest deduction, increasing it from $50,000 to $65,000 \nfor individuals and from $100,000 to $130,000 for married taxpayers on \njoint returns. We repeal the restriction that voluntary payments of \ninterest are not deductible. These provisions are effective right now.\n  Then we have tax benefits for governmental bonds for public school \nconstruction. These benefits are effective for bonds issued starting \nthis year.\n  There is a deduction for college tuition, a provision allowing above-\nthe-line deduction for college tuition expenses. It is intended to help \nlow- and middle-income families pay for college.\n  In the years 2002 and 2003, individuals with adjusted gross incomes \nof $65,000 may deduct $3,000. In the years 2004 and 2005, for those \nsame individuals it would be $4,000. In the case of taxpayers with \nadjusted gross income that does not exceed $80,000, the deduction would \nbe $2,000.\n  I just read a lot of provisions that were taken from the tax bill. I \nstarted my remarks by talking about the stimulus impact of the tax bill \nwe passed 7 months ago, the impact it is going to have at a time of \nrecession. People might raise some question about the education \nprovisions to which I just referred, of their stimulative impact. In a \ntime of recession, obviously beyond the good that education does \ngenerally to help people in their lives in the future, we have a \nsituation where maybe in a recession, families would shy away from \ngoing to college--their kids going to college, or adults, independent \nadults going to college. As they look at the provisions of last year's \ntax bill and the benefits that come from it, they might see the \nadvantage of continuing their education, even at a time of recession.\n  Any of that money that is spent as a result of that would obviously \nhave some impact as stimulus in the economy. But for the long haul, it \nis a stimulus, too, because as people are better educated, they are \nmore productive; they earn more money. It helps the long-term recovery \nof our economy.\n  I want to make some reference to the estate and gift tax provisions. \nThese have a beneficial impact, but they are not entirely stimulative \nfor right now. Again, we have small business people who tend to be the \nmost harmed by not being able to pass on the family business to their \nnext generation. There is always a lot of anxiety during times of \nrecession and during times of economic downturn.\n  We ought to do whatever we can to relieve the anxiety of small \nbusiness people who are under very tough constraints because of the \nrecession. We ought to relieve that anxiety to the greatest extent \npossible.\n  It gives me a chance to say what Senator Kyl said just before I took \nthe floor; that is, that we have an opportunity on this economic \nstimulative package to make sure that the estate tax provisions of the \nbill the President signed last June be made permanent.\n  I am going to yield the floor at this point. I thank my colleagues \nfor their attention to some provisions of an old story--the tax bill of \nlast year, a tax bill that is going to have beneficial impacts well \ninto the future but, most importantly, has some impact right now as we \nare in a time of recession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton).

Madam President, I compliment the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, and her distinguished colleague, Senator Schumer, for not only \nthe State of New York but for the City of New York.\n  I had the privilege of attending the economic summit in New York City \nthis weekend. I saw the distinguished Presiding Officer on several \noccasions. In fact, I was beginning to think that somehow she had been \ncloned because she was attending and speaking and was involved in so \nmany different events.\n  I know the economic summit came to New York City as a gesture of \nsolidarity with the city after the terrible events of last fall. They \ncame there knowing that not only would they bring people from around \nthe world as well as from our own country, but they would bring the \npress from around the world to show the world that New York City is \nopen, and New York City is in a position to handle, as it always has, \nany group of any size for any purpose. I want to say that New York City \ndid.\n  I was extraordinarily impressed with the level of everything from \ncommunications, certainly to law enforcement--New York's finest was \nthere--to the continuing work at ground zero. My wife and I and our \ndaughter visited to see again the work that continues by these brave \nmen and women from the New York Fire Department, who are still working \nthere. The police department is still working there, and other agencies \nas well as volunteers.\n  I was gratified to see while we were there a number of foreign \nvisitors going to ground zero. Anybody has to be moved just reading the \nnotes that have been left there by family members. While we were there, \nforeign delegations were laying wreaths and paying homage.\n  The point, though, is that New York City reflects, really, what is \nbest in America. We have seen a major city of commerce, of education, \nof entertainment, and of history badly damaged that came right back, \nand was able to demonstrate that to the rest of the world.\n  As one coming from the State of Vermont, I sometimes hear regional \naccents at their best when I go to New York City. I am sure that New \nYorkers feel the same way when they come to Vermont. But the accent I \nheard was one of hope, of excitement, of all the best things that are \nreflected by that city.\n  I commend not only the two Senators, my two friends from New York, \nbut everybody--from the mayor to the Governor, and everyone who has \nworked so hard on this. New York City is open for business, as it was \nfor some members of the Leahy family. It was a pleasure to be there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S318-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S318-S320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ON THE CONFIRMATION OF JUDGE PHILIP MARTINEZ\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I commend the Majority Leader and our Assistant Majority \nLeader for bringing the confirmation of Judge Martinez of Texas to a \nsuccessful conclusion today. I also want to thank Senator Durbin for \nhaving chaired the hearing in December that laid the groundwork for the \nconfirmation of Judge Martinez and four other federal judges.\n  At the Committee meeting at which we considered the nomination of \nJudge Martinez, I inserted in the Record a letter I had recently \nreceived from Congressman Silvestre Reyes of Texas strongly endorsing \nhim. Congressman Reyes noted that the court to which Judge Martinez is \nnominated is facing a criminal caseload of over 2,000 cases with a \nsingle active judge in the El Paso region personally trying to manage \nover 1,100 criminal cases. I say to Congressman Reyes and Judge \nBriones, help should be on the way very soon in the person of Judge \nMartinez.\n  It was not so long ago, when the Senate was under Republican control, \nthat it took 943 days to confirm Judge Hilda Tagle to the United States \nDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas. She was first \nnominated in August 1995, but not confirmed until\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\nMarch 1998. When the final vote came, she was confirmed by unanimous \nconsent and without a single negative vote, after having been stalled \nfor almost three years.\n  I recall that the nomination of Michael Schattman to a vacancy on the \nNorthern District of Texas never got a hearing and was never acted \nupon, while his nomination languished for over two years. I recall just \ntwo years ago when Ricardo Morado, who had served as Mayor of San \nBenito, Texas, and was nominated for a vacancy in the Southern District \nof Texas, never got a hearing and was never acted upon.\n  These are district court nominations that could have helped solve \nproblems in the trial courts if acted upon by the Senate over the last \nseveral years. In addition to these nominees, the Republican-led Senate \nfailed to provide a hearing and failed to take action on the \nnominations of Jorge Rangel and Enrique Moreno to the same emergency \nvacancy on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals over the last four years.\n  In contrast, we are moving expeditiously to consider and confirm \nJudge Martinez, who was nominated in October, received his ABA peer \nreview in November, participated in a hearing in early December, was \nreported by the Committee on December 13 and is today being confirmed. \nIn addition, Randy Crane, a nominee to a vacancy on the Southern \nDistrict of Texas District Court will be having a confirmation hearing \nin the near future.\n  Just as we have worked hard since July and paid attention to the \nneeds of the district courts in Montana, Kentucky, Kansas and Alabama, \nwhose Chief Judges wrote asking for prompt attention to serious \nproblems, we are responding to the needs of our courts throughout the \ncountry.\n  The first two confirmations to the district courts last summer were \nJudge Cebull and Judge Haddon to the District Court in Montana. The \nChief Judge of that court had written to us asking for our immediate \nattention and help because he had no active associate judge in that \ndistrict. We responded. Working with Senator Baucus and Senator Burns, \na Democrat and a Republican, the two nominees were included in our very \nfirst hearing, which held the day after Committee members were \nassigned. They were both confirmed the following week, on July 20, \n2001.\n  Similarly, we heard from the Chief Judge of the District Court for \nthe Eastern District of Kentucky. We responded by holding hearings for \nthree judicial nominees to vacancies in that Court and proceeded to \nconfirm two so quickly that they had to delay being sworn in to wind \ndown their legal practices.\n  Likewise, when we heard from the Chief Judge of the District Court \nfor Kansas, we responded. We moved expeditiously to hold a hearing, \nreport and confirm Judge Robinson to alleviate the emergency situation \nthat the Chief Judge indicated existed in Topeka.\n  Yesterday, as the Senate confirmed the second district court judge \nfor courts in Alabama since November, we learned from Senator Sessions \nthat the Chief Judge of the Southern District of Alabama had written to \nhim to urge action in filling the vacancy in that court and noted that \nhe was the only active judge left.\n  Similarly, today we provide relief to the district courts in Texas.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation today.\n  With today's confirmation, the Senate has confirmed four additional \njudges since returning late last month. The Senate will have confirmed \n32 judges since the change in majority last summer. One-quarter of the \njudges confirmed have been for judicial emergency vacancies, eight so \nfar. Unfortunately, the White House has yet to work with home State \nSenators to send nominees for an additional 15 judicial emergency \nvacancies and 31 federal trial court vacancies.\n  Of course, I have yet to chair the Judiciary Committee for a full \nyear; it has been barely six months. But the confirmations we have \nachieved in those six months are already comparable to the year totals \nfor 1997, 1999 and 2000 and almost twice as many as a Republican \nmajority in the Senate allowed to be confirmed in 1996.\n  The 1996 session was the second year of the last Republican \nchairmanship. In that 1996 session, only 17 judges were confirmed all \nyear and none were confirmed to the Court of Appeals--none. I expect \nand intend to work hard on additional judicial nominations through this \nsession and to exceed the total from the 1996 session of only 17 \nconfirmations. In that 1996 session, the fourth judicial confirmation \ndid not occur until April. By contrast, we will have confirmed four \nadditional judges by the middle of the first full week in session this \nyear.\n  The Judiciary Committee held its first hearing of the session on our \nsecond day in session, January 24, for Judge Michael Melloy, a nominee \nto the 8th Circuit from Iowa, and district court nominees from Arizona, \nIowa, Texas, Louisiana and the District of Columbia, a total of six \njudicial nominations.\n  I have set another hearing on the nomination of Judge Charles \nPickering for the 5th Circuit for this Thursday, February 7, 2002.\n  I am working to hold another confirmation hearing for judicial \nnominations, as well, before the end of February, even though it is a \nshort month with a week's recess.\n  I noted on January 25 in my statement to the Senate that we inherited \na frayed process and are working hard to repair the damage of the last \nseveral years. I have already laid out a constructive program of \nsuggestions that would help in that effort and help return the \nconfirmation process to one that is a cooperative, bipartisan effort. I \nhave included suggestions for the White House, that it work with \nDemocrats as well as Republicans, that it encourage rather than \nforestall the use of bipartisan selection commissions, that it consider \ncarefully the views of home State Senators.\n  This past summer, by the time I became chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, federal court vacancies already topped 100 and were rising \nto 111. Since July, we have worked hard and the Senate has been \ndiligent in considering and confirming 32 judges, thereby beginning the \nprocess of lowering the vacancies on our federal courts. Since I became \nChairman, 26 additional vacancies have arisen. Still, we have been able \nto outpace this high level of attrition and lower the vacancies to \nunder 100.\n  During the last six and one-half years when a Republican majority \ncontrolled the process, the vacancies rose from 65 to over 100, an \nincrease of almost 60 percent. By contrast, we are now working to keep \nthese numbers moving in the right directions.\n  Our Majority Leader, with the help of the Assistant Majority Leader, \nis clearing the calendar of judicial nominations and the Senate has \nproceeded to vote on every one of them. This is one of the reforms that \nsignals a return to normalcy for the Senate, which had gotten away from \nsuch practices over the past six years. Since the change in majority, \njudicial nominees have not been held on the calendar for months and \nmonths or held over without action or returned to the President without \naction.\n  I have observed that to make real progress will take the cooperation \nof the White House. The most progress can be made most quickly if the \nWhite House would begin working with home State Senators to identify \nfair-minded, nonideological, consensus nominees to fill these court \nvacancies. One of the reasons that the Committee was able to work as \nquickly as it has and the Senate has been able to confirm 32 judges in \nthe last few months is because those nominations were strongly \nsupported as consensus nominees.\n  I have heard of too many situations in too many States involving too \nmany reasonable and moderate home State Senators in which the White \nHouse has demonstrated no willingness to work with home State Senators \nto fill judicial vacancies cooperatively. As we move forward, I urge \nthe White House to show greater inclusiveness and flexibility and to \nhelp make this a truly bipartisan enterprise. Logjams exist in a number \nof settings.\n  To make real progress, repair the damage that has been done over \nprevious years, and build bridges toward a more cooperative process, \nthere is much that the White House could do to work more cooperatively \nwith all home State Senators, including Democratic Senators.\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\n  Of course, more than two-thirds of the federal court vacancies \ncontinue to be on the district courts. The Administration has been slow \nto make nominations to the vacancies on the federal trial courts. In \nthe last five months of last year, the Senate confirmed a higher \npercentage of the President's trial court nominees, 22 out of 36, than \na Republican majority had allowed the Senate to confirm in the first \nsession of either of the last two Congresses with a Democratic \nPresident. Last year the President did not make nominations to almost \n80 percent of the current trial court vacancies. As we began this \nsession, 55 out of 69 vacancies were without a nominee.\n  In late January, the White House finally sent nominations for another \n24 of those trial court vacancies. After the Committee receives the \nindication that the nominees have the support of their home State \nSenators and after the Committee has received ABA peer reviews, these \nrecent nominations will then be eligible to be included in Committee \nhearings. Because the White House shifted the time at which the ABA \ndoes its evaluation of nominees to the post-nomination period, these 24 \nnominees are unlikely to have completed files ready for evaluation \nuntil after the Easter recess. Even then, over two and one-half dozen \nof the federal trial court vacancies, 31, may still be without eligible \nnominees.\n  We have accomplished more, and at a faster pace, than in years past. \nWe have worked harder and faster than previously on judicial \nnominations, despite the unprecedented difficulties being faced by the \nnation and the Senate. I am encouraged that this confirmation today was \nnot delayed by extended, unexplained, anonymous holds on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar, the type of hold that characterized so much of the \nprevious six and one-half years. Majority Leader Daschle has moved \nswiftly on judicial nominees reported to the calendar.\n  I thank all Senators who have helped in our efforts and assisted in \nthe hard work to review and consider the dozens of judicial nominations \nwe have reported and confirmed. I thank, in particular, the Senators \nwho serve on the Judiciary Committee for their helpful action since \nthis summer. As our action today demonstrates, again, we are moving \nahead to fill judicial vacancies with nominees who have strong \nbipartisan support.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to \ndiscuss, just for a few minutes, the action taken this morning in the \nSenate Commerce Committee. We voted unanimously to support a subpoena \nbeing delivered to Mr. Kenneth Lay, who is the former chairman and CEO \nof the Enron Corporation. I want to describe for my colleagues what \nbrought us to this point and why we believed we had to vote to \nauthorize a subpoena being issued.\n  About 4 to 6 weeks ago, Mr. Lay's attorneys told us that Mr. Lay \nwould be willing to appear before the Senate Commerce Committee. That \nwas in response to a request by us as we began to investigate what \nhappened with respect to the Enron Corporation. As you know, this is \nthe largest bankruptcy in American history. There is substantial \ninformation that has been available for some while now, prior to and \nsince the bankruptcy, about things that had happened inside the \ncorporation that cause a great deal of concern.\n  A memo by one of the vice presidents of Enron was presented to the \nCEO, Mr. Lay, in August of last year. That memo by Vice President \nWatkins talked about accounting hoaxes and irregularities of sorts, and \nwarned about what people would find if they dug into the partnerships \nthat were being created in this corporation.\n  Then, in November and December, that company's auditors, Arthur \nAndersen and Company, talked about possible illegal acts with respect \nto that corporation and the review of some documents.\n  Then, last Saturday, a report that was commissioned by the board of \ndirectors of the Enron Corporation, the Powers report, described a \nbroad range of very serious problems that went on inside that \ncorporation.\n\n  At any rate, during this period of time we had requested the \ntestimony before the subcommittee and the full committee of the \nCommerce Committee by Mr. Lay. His attorneys said he would be made \navailable on February 4 at 9:30 in the morning. They continued to say \nthat even through last Friday and Saturday.\n  On the Sunday evening before Mr. Lay's scheduled appearance, we were \ncalled his attorneys. They told us that Mr. Lay had changed his mind \nand he would no longer be available to testify and would therefore not \nappear on Monday morning.\n  Mr. Lay's attorneys wrote a letter saying the problem was that Mr. \nLay had heard comments about his company that concerned him. They felt \nit would probably be a prosecutorial kind of environment in the \ncommittee hearing on Monday, and therefore he did not want to appear.\n  The fact is, the comments that were made by a number of Members of \nthe Senate prior to Sunday were no different than the assertions made \nto the CEO of Enron by his own employee last August, by his accounting \nfirm in November and December, and especially by his own company's \nboard of directors on Saturday last.\n  Mr. Lay, in my judgment, following the report by the board of \ndirectors of this corporation, decided that he did not want to talk to \nanybody publicly and decided to lay it off on some Members of Congress, \nsaying that is the reason he did not want to come and testify.\n  Let me tell you what was in that report, just to give one small \nexample. This report says that in this corporation, one of the \ncorporate officers, Mr. Fastow, in creating one of the partnerships--\nincidentally, there were a lot of secret partnerships created here--Mr. \nFastow invested $25,000 of his own money in a partnership in a \ncorporation of which he was an officer. Sixty days later, that $25,000 \nwas $4.5 million to Mr. Fastow.\n  Does anybody in this room know of investments like that? Would you \nlike to make a $25,000 investment that, in 60 days, becomes $4.5 \nmillion? Where can you do that? The lottery, but that is not a sure \nthing.\n  No, this wasn't gambling inside the corporation. This was just people \nplaying fast and loose with the truth and with other people's money. \nWhen someone takes $25,000 and turns it into $4.5 million in 2 months, \nin my judgment, that is stealing. That is just stealing--yes, quote \nunquote, stealing--from investors who own the shares in that \ncorporation.\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\n  At the same time that you have an officer of the company taking \n$25,000 and in 60 days turning it into $4.5 million, at the same time \nthat is happening, one of my constituents in North Dakota is writing a \ntwo-page letter to me. That letter, an anguished cry from this family, \nasks the following question:\n\n       What on Earth has happened? I worked for this company's \n     subsidiary for many, many years and have put away $300,000 \n     into a retirement account. Do you know what my retirement \n     account is worth today?--$1,700; from $300,000 to $1,700.\n\n  He and his family have lost it all. But inside that corporation we \nhad people making millions.\n  Was that a corporate culture of corruption? You bet your life it was. \nAnd the reason Mr. Lay has decided not to come to the Congress to \ntestify was not because of anything anyone has said. It is because of \nwhat this Powers report has found that went on inside this company. I \nwill give another example.\n  This company decided to create a little partnership called Braveheart \nto accommodate some business they were going to do with the Blockbuster \nCorporation. They were actually going to have Blockbuster be the \nrepository of movies. They were going to stream these videos or movies \nto consumers around the country. It was going to be a big business. It \nwas announced in March of 2000. By February of the next year it was \ngone. But in the meantime they created a little partnership called \nBraveheart to take care of all this.\n\n  Do you know what Braveheart did? Braveheart borrowed roughly $112 \nmillion from a Canadian bank. Then it sold its assets to the Enron \nCorporation for slightly over $100 million. The Enron Corporation \nbooked it as a business profit, when in fact all it was a bank loan \nfrom a Canadian bank, run through a partnership that wasn't doing any \nbusiness at all--just a few test markets with a few customers. You tell \nme whether that is honest business.\n  It is not. Can someone come to the Congress and defend that? They \ncan't. That is why we have people who were at the head of this \ncorporation who were unwilling to talk.\n  I just wanted to make the point that the assertions by attorneys on \nbehalf of principals in this corporation are suggesting that they have \nbeen offended because they might find a prosecutorial approach at some \nof these hearings. No one suggested that a hearing before this Congress \nwould ever be a walk in the park, especially when you have a record \ninside this corporation of financial manipulation, of dishonest \naccounting, and of personal enrichment of officers and directors.\n  I wanted to make that point about what we had to do this morning. We \nissued a subpoena for Mr. Lay. It was issued on a unanimous vote by the \nSenate Commerce Committee. That is nearly unprecedented. We don't issue \nsubpoenas in the Commerce Committee. We have the power and authority to \ndo so, but we don't do it very often. But we did it because we felt we \nhad no choice.\n  Mr. President, I had asked permission to speak in morning business. I \nhave just a couple of other things to mention very briefly, and I want \nto do that in a separate section of morning business. How much time is \nremaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask if I can extend that by 2 minutes by consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will not object to that at this point. I know Senator \nTorricelli has some brief remarks. I know they both are very interested \nin these issues and it is time we talk about them, but we have a \nstimulus package on the floor and we want to get to that as soon as \npossible.\n  Is 5 minutes all right for Senator Torricelli?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor. \nIs there objection to his request?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I \nrequest at the conclusion of Senator Dorgan that I be recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have to object to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The Senator has 5 minutes. Mr. President, I hate to \nget into a bidding process, but I would like to have a reasonable \namount of time to be recognized after Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We have business on the floor, and I know people would \nlike to change the focus of our debate on the stimulus package, which \nis overdue in my view. I was willing to let the Senator have a few more \nminutes. I would not object to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I asked for 2 minutes in addition to the \nminute and a half remaining at that point. I expect I will have 3 and a \nhalf minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S321-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S321-S322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I'd like to talk a moment about several \nitems I think ought to be included in the economic recovery package.\n  One, I have filed an amendment that would provide for a 5-year \nextension of the wind energy production tax credit. We really must get \nthat done. Regrettably, this credit was allowed to expire at the end of \nlast year. As a result, many lenders have stopped providing financing \nfor new wind energy projects. Wind development projects underway have \ncome to a screeching halt.\n  Extending the wind energy production tax credit would provide an \nimmediate boost to the economy. We have a lot of projects on the books \nthat aren't moving because the credit expired. A long-term extension \nwill jump-start development activity, create jobs and help this country \nmeet its future energy needs. Each new wind turbine placed into service \ncreates about $1 million in economic activity.\n  I would like to make the wind energy production tax credit permanent. \nMy proposal today would extend it for 5 years. Clearly, a shorter term \nextension will not provide developers the certainty and stability they \nneed to plan and finance new wind energy projects. I think Congress \nmust act quickly to ensure the availability of the wind energy tax \ncredit over the long term. If we don't act now, many wind energy \ninitiatives will be scrapped at a time when this country can least \nafford it.\n  Second, I intend to offer and have filed an amendment to permit \ncompanies that have recently suffered net operating losses to carry \nback those losses for 5 years for federal income tax purposes. I will \nnot go into a lengthy description of why we ought to do that. But my \namendment should provide some needed financial help for those companies \nthat have been hurt most during the current economic downturn. It will \nincrease cash flow for many of these firms and help them make payroll, \navoid additional layoffs and, hopefully, encourage new hiring. It will \nalso help them to make investments in equipment and machinery they need \nto rebuild, grow and prosper.\n\n  There is bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives for net operating loss carry-back relief proposals. We \nought to include in a 5-year net operating loss carry-back provision in \nthe economic recovery package.\n  Finally, I've filed an amendment that would provide tax relief for \nmany S-corporations that sell ``built-in'' gain assets and reinvest the \nproceeds from those sales back into their companies. Today, there are \nhundreds of thousands of firms that operate as S corporations that \nwould have a huge tax impediment if they were to sell certain \nappreciated business assets. The taxes they would be required to pay on \nthat gain, even if they reinvest it, would be prohibitive. As a result, \nmany S-corporations are forced to keep these assets--even if they are \nno longer productive and could be converted into assets that generate \nnew growth and jobs.\n  The amendment I filed today would allow those who are involved in \nthese S-corporations to sell built-in gain assets without facing a \nmassive federal tax bill, provided they reinvest the proceeds into the \nbusiness within a two-year period. That, too, is stimulative.\n  Many of these companies are the job-producing companies in this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\nTo allow them to sell less productive assets and reinvest into more \nproductive assets will be very stimulative to this country's economy. \nIt will produce jobs and economic growth and opportunity. But they are \nlocked out of that at the present time by the Tax Code. My amendment \nproposes to change that result and I hope we will get an opportunity to \nconsider it during the debate on the economic stimulus package.\n  One final point: The Kyl amendment, of which I am supportive, dealing \nwith tourism is an amendment to which I want to offer a second-degree \namendment dealing with loan guarantees. It would cost $200 million or \n$300 million over the 10-year period. It deals with a subject about \nwhich I have spoken with Senator Kyl and Senator Reid.\n  Many of the businesses connected to the airports and the airlines \nthat were shut down post-September 11 are in desperate condition. A \nprogram of loan guarantees dealing with the most fragile of those \nbusinesses which were shut down through no fault of their own--through \nedict by the Federal Government--would be appropriate in those unusual \ncircumstances and would be guaranteed by an amendment attached to the \nKyl amendment.\n  I hope to be able to offer that as a second-degree amendment dealing \nwith travel agents, car rentals, and others attached to airports which \nsuffered just as much as the airlines did when the airlines were \nordered to be shut down and there was no travel anywhere in the country \nfor a specific period.\n  As I indicated, I noticed the previous amendments yesterday. I wanted \nto indicate that I would be prepared to offer a second-degree amendment \nto Senator Kyl's amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S322-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOICE OF INQUIRY\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the President of the United States has \nchallenged the Nation to commit an additional $120 billion in resources \nfor our Armed Forces. Indeed, when the Nation is attacked, that is as \nit should be. The President has asked us to commit $40 billion to deal \nwith internal security in our country. With the loss of life we have \nsuffered and all of our apprehension about terrorism, that is as it \nshould be. It is, however, an extraordinary request.\n  While our willingness to commit resources is endless to guarantee the \nsecurity of our country, our national curiosity about these \ncircumstances and how our country was so vulnerable seems to be very \nlimited indeed.\n  It has been 5 months since the lives of our people were taken in the \nmost devastating attack on America in history. There have been words of \nrage and revenge, vows to strengthen our security and to commit endless \nresources. There has been everything except a voice of inquiry.\n  On September 10, this Nation was not without resources, with a $320 \nbillion defense establishment larger than a dozen other industrial \nnations combined; a massive internal law enforcement apparatus; and, by \npress accounts, a $30 billion intelligence establishment.\n  The terrorist attack on September 11 apparently was waged with the \ncombined financial resources of $250,000. It was implemented by 19 \npeople. Why is it I believe that probably financial resources were not \ndeterminative in the success of this evil attack? Why is it that I \nsuspect it was probably not the numbers of personnel available? The \ncountry was not without resources on September 10. But something went \nterribly wrong. The allocation of resources, quality of leadership, \nstrategy--I don't know. The real point is neither does anybody else, \nincluding the President of the United States and Members of the Senate.\n  At some point, 260 million Americans, with all the rage they feel \nagainst our enemy, with all the anger they feel, and with all the \nsympathy they feel for the victims, are going to want to know what \nhappened and why.\n  There is no limit to the resources that I will vote to make available \nto the Commander in Chief to defend this Nation. But there is no limit \nto the efforts I will make to get accountability in this Government for \nour people.\n  In my State, there are hundreds--indeed, there are several \nthousands--of widows and orphans. As much as any American, as much as \nhistory itself, these people are going to demand answers in the course \nof their lives.\n  The President has suggested his preference is that we hold private \nhearings in the intelligence community. That is not how we conduct this \nGovernment. There was not an attack on the intelligence committee, nor \nis it their responsibility alone. Our accountability is to the people \nof the country. Yet the administration claims that such hearings or \ninquiries would be a distraction from the war on terrorism. That is not \nour history or how we conduct our Government.\n  Ten days after Pearl Harbor, with half of the American fleet in ruins \nand with fears of an attack on California by the Imperial Japanese \nNavy, FDR ordered an inquiry into how indeed we were so undefended. The \nChallenger lay in ruins with all of our ambitions for a space program, \nand Ronald Reagan did the same for NASA. This instance deserves no \nless. Accountability is at the core of any representative government.\n\n  On behalf of the people of my State and the victims--their wives, \nhusbands, parents, and children--I demand it now. This Nation needs a \nboard of inquiry to determine the events of September 11--how it \noccurred and why; where we succeeded and why we failed--not for the \nsake of revenge, not to cast blame, but to ensure that it never happens \nagain. Armed only with that knowledge--more than any funding or any new \nweapon--can we genuinely assure our people that those events will not \nbe repeated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Do we have a time agreement? How quickly will we be \nback on the Kyl amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Two minutes?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, Mr. President, that will be fine.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator from Nevada restate the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the Reid-Kyl amendment, which is two amendments down the \nline, and that Senator Dorgan offer a second-degree amendment, be \nallowed to speak for 2 minutes, and then we immediately return to the \nKyl second-degree amendment to the underlying Baucus amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to offer a second-degree amendment. \nI ask unanimous consent that we be on amendment No. 2764 which has been \nproposed by Senator Reid and Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. The point of the unanimous consent request of the Senator \nfrom Nevada was to allow the second-degree amendment to the Reid-Kyl \namendment and to allow the Senator from North Dakota to speak about \nthat amendment for 2 minutes and immediately return to the pending \nbusiness, which is the Baucus amendment with the second-degree \namendment, offered by the Senator from Alabama on behalf of myself, \npending; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Arizona is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The last request of the Senator from North \nDakota is consistent with the order of the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from North Dakota to \nrestate his request. I obviously misunderstood.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nproposed by Senator Reid and Senator Kyl, amendment No. 2764, which had \npreviously been offered but set aside, be brought back so I can offer a \nsecond-degree amendment to it. I ask that amendment No. 2764 be the \npending business.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, my concern is that has \nalready been taken care of by Senator Reid. It might confuse matters. I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2808 to Amendment No. 2764\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. This is \nan amendment I had filed. It is called the travel industry \nstabilization amendment. I offer it as a second-degree amendment to the \nReid-Kyl amendment that was offered previously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2808 to amendment No. 2764.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To preserve the continued viability of the United States \n                            Travel industry)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\n                TITLE ___--TRAVEL INDUSTRY STABILIZATION\n\n     SECTION _01.

Mr. President, I will not take 2 minutes because I will \nspeak on this at another time. I indicated previously I support the \nunderlying Reid-Kyl amendment which deals with travel and tourism-\nrelated issues. The amendment I have offered is an amendment that deals \nwith some loan guarantees to those businesses that have a connection to \nthe airports and the airlines that had been shut down by the Federal \nGovernment post-September 11. Many of them remain in very difficult \nstraits. They face some very difficult financial troubles.\n  The Federal Government did provide loan guarantees and grants to the \nairlines. I was supportive of that. But there were ancillary businesses \nthat are related to the airlines and related to the airports that \nsuffered substantial losses as a result of actions by the Federal \nGovernment to shut down air service.\n  This is legislation I have written to address that situation in the \nform of loan guarantees. I have spent time with my colleague from \nNevada, Senator Reid, and others of my colleagues who are supportive of \nthis approach.\n  I offer it as a second-degree amendment because I believe it is \nappropriately something that should be attached to the Reid-Kyl \namendment which I intend to support as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the spirit in which the Senator \nfrom North Dakota proposed the second-degree amendment. I am hopeful we \nwill be able to adopt the Reid-Kyl amendment at a later time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2807\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, what is pending before the Senate is my \nsecond-degree amendment to the Baucus amendment, which for those who \nare interpreting this means we are back on the question of whether we \ncan repeal permanently the estate tax or, as it is frequently called, \nthe death tax.\n  As we all will recall, last year when we passed the Tax Reform Act, \none of the provisions that was incorporated within that bill was a \ngradual reduction of the estate tax rates and enlargement of the \nexemption, and finally, in the ninth year, an actual repeal of the \nexisting death tax.\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\n  We were joined in a bipartisan coalition to support that. There were \nliterally scores and scores of organizations--and I am going to ask \nunanimous consent after a bit to print in the Record the list of \norganizations that supported the repeal of the death tax--and we even \ndefeated an amendment of Senator Conrad of North Dakota that would have \nput the Senate on record as saying we should not make it permanent.\n  Clearly, the intention was to make it permanent; the desire was to \nmake it permanent. I do not think anybody would have stood before the \nSenate and said we wanted to repeal the estate tax for 1 year. They \nwould have been laughed out of the body. Yet that is precisely what the \neffect of our action was.\n  There is a rule in the Senate that does not allow us to work in more \nthan a 10-year window without a 60-vote majority. There is a rule that \nrequired us to change the procedure, and by making the procedure for 10 \nyears, the effect is to sunset the repeal. That means we go right back \nto where it was last year with a 60-percent rate of the death tax and \nonly a $675,000 exemption.\n  If one wants to see how this works, in the year 2010 you do not have \nto pay any death tax if you die. It basically pays you to die in that \nyear, but do not try to live a day into the next year because you are \nthen going to have to pay the entire death tax as it existed in 2001.\n  We go way back, in other words, to a punitive, destructive death tax. \nClearly, we did not mean for this to be the way it was. Clearly, we \nwould like to make it permanent, and this is the time to do it because \nthere is significant evidence that making the death tax repeal \npermanent will significantly stimulate the economy and create jobs. \nThat is the reason for bringing it up at this time.\n  We are talking about the stimulus package. The President is talking \nabout creating jobs, and by repealing the death tax permanently we can \nachieve those objectives.\n  How is that so? In simple terms, people still have to plan for the \ndeath tax. They still have to buy the insurance. They still have to pay \nthe lawyers. They still have to pay the estate tax planners, the \naccountants, and all the rest of it unless they are absolutely sure \nthey are going to die during one of the 365 days of the 10th year. If \nthey cannot be sure they are going to die during that period of time, \nthen they need to plan because the tax is back in effect.\n  Who, after all, except someone who would be deliberately taking their \nlife, can predict when they are going to die? One sure does not want to \nbe lucky enough to live beyond the 10th year because then they are \ngoing to get stuck with the death tax with its punitive rates, just as \nit was last year. That is why there is a huge expense involved in the \nexisting law, and that expense every year, by farmers and small \nbusinessmen and other people in this country, is money that is spent on \nan unproductive enterprise that could be spent in creating jobs.\n  Let us get to a couple of specifics, and then I will ask some of my \ncolleagues to join in this debate. A December 1998 report by the Joint \nEconomic Committee concluded the existence of the death tax in this \ncentury has reduced the stock of capital in the economy by nearly half \na trillion dollars. By repealing the death tax and putting those \nresources to better use, i.e., investment, the Joint Committee \nestimates as many as 240,000 jobs could be created over the next 7 \nyears, and Americans would have an additional $24.4 billion in \ndisposable personal income. That is stimulus.\n  You want to stimulate the economy? You want to create jobs? You want \ninvestment in capital and other businesses? Permanently repealing the \ndeath tax will do that.\n  Last year, Dr. Wilbur Steger, a Ph.D. president of CONSAD Research \nCorporation, and an adjunct professor of policy science at the Heinz \nSchool of Carnegie Mellon University, testified before the Senate \nFinance Committee and disputed the death tax supporters' arguments that \nonly 2 percent of Americans are affected by the tax. Rather than \naffecting less than 500 family businesses in a typical year, he said \nthe total number of taxable estates that consist largely of family-\nowned businesses likely exceeds 10,000 families annually. He went on to \nstate an immediate death tax repeal would provide a $40 billion \nautomatic stimulus to the economy.\n  So what we could do best to stimulate the economy and create jobs is \nto ensure that the death tax repeal we voted for last year is in fact \nmade permanent.\n  I am going to provide some additional evidence that we can create \njobs and stimulate the economy with the permanent repeal of the death \ntax, but at this time I yield to my colleague from Oklahoma, who I know \nwanted to make a few remarks before he has to leave.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be made a \ncosponsor of Senator Kyl's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment is a very positive \namendment. The Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, introduced an \namendment that would add another $2.3 billion in emergency spending for \nagriculture. We debated that last week. We defeated it. We defeated it \non a budget point of order. I made that motion because we have had a \nlot of emergency spending for agriculture. As a matter of fact, the \nlast couple of years it has just ballooned. We averaged less than a \nbillion or two for decades, and then all of a sudden the last couple of \nyears we start doing $12 billion, $13 billion, $14 billion of emergency \nspending.\n  The Senator from Montana said we have more problems; let's add \nanother $2 billion or $3 billion--not in the context of the farm bill \nor the budget but just another couple billion dollars. Now that we are \nin deficits, I question that. My colleague from Arizona offered an \namendment that my farmers have been talking to me about for the last \n20-some years, and that is to repeal the death tax. Why in the world \nshould agriculture, or anybody who has a business, have to sell the \nbusiness because somebody happens to pass away? Somebody passes away \nand all of a sudden the Government says it wants 55 percent of their \nfarm, 55 percent of their business. I happen to think that is wrong.\n  In the tax bill we passed last year, we reduced the estate tax and we \nincreased the exemptions. We increased the exemption from $675,000 to a \nmillion dollars beginning January 1 of 2002. So that is a positive \nthing, a good thing. Over the course of the tax bill, over the next 10 \nyears, we eliminated the death tax, increased the exemption from $1 \nmillion to $2 million to $4 million, where in the year 2010 the death \ntax is repealed. That entire bill was sunsetted. People who do not \nfollow the Senate and do not know our rules ask why did we sunset it? \nWe sunsetted it because of the reconciliation bill. The reconciliation \nbill, by law, has to be within a 10-year timeframe. We could not make \npermanent tax law changes. We could change the law in 10 years. So that \nis exactly what we did.\n  The Senator from Arizona says in this particular case the sunset does \nnot work. When people are doing estate planning, they want to know what \ntheir tax liability is when they die and, if they have an estate, they \ncan plan accordingly. Maybe they can give their property to a son or a \ngrandson, a grandchild, a granddaughter, or maybe they want to give it \nto a trust or they want to give it to a charity or they want to break \nit up. Whatever they want to do, they should have those options. They \nshould not be faced with the current situation of well, OK, we are \ngoing to reduce the death tax for years, increase the exemption up to \n$4 million, in effect reducing the death tax, but in the year 2011 it \nreverts back and all of a sudden you are looking at an enormous tax \nrate, a tax rate that would be as high as 50 percent. That is wrong.\n  So the Senator from Arizona says: Let us fix it. Let us make it \npermanent. That was the intent of the bill that we passed last year. I \nbelieve that is where the votes are in the Senate. If they believe in \nfree enterprise, if they believe in agriculture, if they believe in \nfamily farms, if they do not want an enterprise, whether it be a farm \nor a business, if they do not want somebody to have to sell it because \nsomeone passes away, to give Government half\n\n[[Page S326]]\n\nof it, then support the amendment of Senator Kyl.\n\n  If my colleagues really want to do something, let us make this tax \nchange, which, because we were under reconciliation last year had to be \ntemporary, had to be sunsetted. We are not under reconciliation now so \nwe do not have those constrictions imposed upon us as Members of the \nSenate. We are not under those rules, so I encourage my colleagues to \nnot say, oh, yes, they supported elimination of the death tax, and in \nthe year 2011 it is reinstated at the previously higher rates. That \nwould be grossly unfair and grossly inequitable.\n  For people who are trying to do estate planning and trying to \nestimate what their tax liability would be for their kids or for their \ngrandkids, it is tremendously unfair. It might be great for the estate \nlawyers, for estate planners and others because the more Congress \nchanges this, the more they get to do in writing wills and rewriting \nestates and how planning should be done. So the way to solve this \nproblem is to pass the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. That is \nthe best thing we could do for agriculture, not another $2 billion, $3 \nbillion in emergency assistance.\n  Every Congressman and every Senator knows if we could go back and \ntell our agricultural community, the Farm Bureau, the farmers union, \nthe wheat growers, the cattlemen, and so on, that we repealed the death \ntax, we know we would get a standing ovation because of the very fact \nthat many of those farms are second and third generation. They are \nwealthy on paper but they are cash poor.\n  So if they pass away now, they know their survivors will have to sell \nthe operation to pay the death tax, to pay the tax that will be owed \nthe Federal Government. When the Government comes in and says they want \nhalf, they will have to sell it; they will have to break it up. In the \nprocess, it will cost a lot of jobs.\n  The amendment of Senator Kyl creates jobs. It will help maintain \nsmall businesses so they do not have to break up. It will help maintain \nfarms and ranches so they will not have to break them up into smaller \nunits or sell them for the taxman.\n  So I again compliment my colleague from Arizona. I think he has an \nexcellent amendment. He has added it to the amendment of Senator \nBaucus. I encourage people on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor \nof the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be named \nas a cosponsor of Senator Kyl's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, when I first came to the Senate and I \nmet with farm people in my State, this was their No. 1 issue--to \neliminate the death tax. It is savaging closely held enterprises all \nover America, particularly farms. It is something that touches people \nin a very real way. The way this elimination has occurred as part of \nthe budget reconciliation, as Senator Nickles so ably described, we \nwill have elimination of the death tax 1 year, and a reimposition of it \nthe next year, leaving estate planning problems for people trying to \nwrestle with that. It has human consequences.\n\n  I remember being on an airplane not too long ago with a professional \nwoman. She told me about her grandfather dying back in the 1980s. A tax \nchange in the death tax was passed during the Reagan years. It was to \ntake effect January 1. The family was home for Christmas. He was dying \nof cancer. He had terminal cancer. Each morning he asked what day it \nwas. He died 11 a.m., January 1--his last contribution to his family. \nThis is personal. It is real. It savages businesses.\n  Let me try to explain why I believe we have a particularly pernicious \nconsequence as a result of the death tax that has not been sufficiently \ndiscussed and is causing damages to our economy far greater than a lot \nof people thought. This is the reason. I thought about farmers in \nAlabama. Maybe they own a couple thousand acres, and maybe some of that \nland is near an airport or town and the value on paper is high but they \ndon't want to sell it. Compare that to an international paper company \nthat may own 600,000 acres of land, 200,000 or 100,000 acres of land. \nThey compete against one another. If they are timber producing, and \nboth grow timber, they compete against one another.\n  The big multinational corporation that does business all over the \nworld is never impacted adversely by the estate tax. People who own \nstock in it may be, but not that corporation. But the individual \ncompetitor, the competitor of the big international corporations, \nbuilds up a little capital, equity, and realizes some success, and they \ncan get savaged, each generation, by a 50-percent tax. This makes them \nuncompetitive. Is there any doubt why farmers getting to the end of \ntheir lives, small businessmen wanting to pass on their business to \ntheir family, have to sit down and discuss what they are going to do? \nThey have to sit down and decide if they can pay that generational tax \nand still operate the business. What if the business has a lot of \ninvestment, a lot of capital, hiring a lot of people, but they do not \nhave a lot of cash? How can each generation pay this huge death tax to \nthe Government? Yet the big business competitor, a broadly held \ninternational corporation, with which they compete, does not ever \nbecome impacted by the death tax.\n  That is happening in America. We need to encourage locally owned \ncorporations. We need to nurture them, not oppress them. We need more \ncompetition in the American economy.\n  It is troubling that virtually every bank in my home State of Alabama \nhas been sold and bought up by a bigger bank, and they get bought up by \nbigger banks. Why? One reason is families who used to routinely own \nbanks, that were tied to the community, supporting Boy Scouts, schools \nand the United Way, cannot compete. They are looking at the death tax \ncoming down on them. They figure they can protect themselves against it \nmore effectively by selling off their small business to a larger \ncorporation that does not have to pay that tax.\n  I thank Senator Kyl for his leadership. I believe we ought to \nconsider that the death tax is an anticompetitive activity that hurts \ncompetition by damaging small businesses and farms in a way that does \nnot occur to larger, wealthier international enterprises.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, let me give a sense of the businesses and \norganizations involved--everything from the American Council for \nCapital Formation, American Family Business Institute, Hotel & Lodging \nAssociation, the National Automobile Dealers Association, Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste, Citizens for a Sound Economy, a long list of \nagricultural organizations, Independent Insurance Agents of America, \nNational Association of Home Builders, National Association of \nManufacturers, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National Corn \nGrowers Association, National Taxpayers Union, Chamber of Commerce, and \non and on, a whole number of businesses and organizations. As we recall \nfrom the debate we had last year, a group of environmental \norganizations, as well, were involved because of the pro-environmental \nramifications of repealing the death tax permanently.\n  It is very important to focus for a moment on why we are proposing \nthis amendment on this bill at this time. President Bush's budget for \nthe next fiscal year incorporates a permanent repeal of the estate tax. \nThis is something the President knows will benefit our economy and \ncreate jobs. That is why it is included within his fiscal year 2003 \nbudget sent here yesterday. This is propitious timing. We have the \nopportunity to act on this now.\n  Earlier I indicated the reason this has such a stimulative effect is \nthat there is such a large amount of money being spent on lawyers and \nestate planning and insurance that could be more productively put into \ninvestment in companies for the creation of jobs.\n  To give an idea of the magnitude of the money we are talking about, I \nwill cite a study done for last year. Alicia Munnell, a member of \nPresident Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, estimates the cost of \ncomplying with death tax laws is roughly at the same magnitude as the \nrevenue raised by the tax itself.\n  In 1998, that was about $23 billion. In other words, for every dollar \nthe death tax raises for the Treasury, it almost costs Americans that \nsame amount of money to prepare to deal with the death tax when their \ntime comes. It is literally a double tax. Half of it is totally \nunproductive.\n  I am a lawyer. I don't mean to suggest that paying money to lawyers \nis a bad thing. But one can hardly argue that it creates new jobs. \nPerhaps one could say we need to have more lawyers. As long as we keep \nthis law on the books and we do not permanently repeal the death tax, \nwe can put a few more lawyers to work. It is a stretch to argue that \njustifies keeping this unfair law on the books.\n  No, the reality is that we can create a lot more jobs, 240,000 jobs \nover the next 7 years, by a repeal of the estate tax. We can provide \nanother almost $25 billion in disposable personal income, according to \nthe Joint Economic Committee. These numbers do not lie. We have an \nopportunity to do something positive for our economy, for job creation, \nfor investment. That is why the President has included this permanent \nrepeal in his budget for this year.\n  Let me show how this works and how unfair it is. Somebody dies in the \nyear 2009. None of us can predict when we will die. If you die in the \nyear 2009, those in your family who succeed you will be faced with a \npotentially high 45-percent death tax rate. The good news is they have \na $3.5 million exemption because that is the way we structured it under \nour tax bill last year. If you are lucky enough to die in the year \n2010, assuming that dying is a good thing--when I say ``if you are \nlucky enough,'' I don't mean it that way--if you can avoid dying in the \nyear 2009 and stretch your life into 2010, you will be able to have \nyour loved ones avoid the death tax entirely as a result of the bill we \npassed last year. However, if you are able, through good medicine and \nhealth care and the like, to extend your life to the following year, \nthe year 2011, your family is in a world of hurt. Because you lived a \nlittle bit longer, they are going to go back to the days when we had a \n60-percent death tax rate and an exemption of only $675,000.\n\n  What is a sensible small business person, farmer--whoever--going to \ndo, given the fact that it is pretty difficult to predict when you are \ngoing to die? And you clearly do not want to take the chance that the \nonly year that you are likely to die in is 2010. What you are going to \ndo is pay lawyers and accountants and estate planners and buy the \ninsurance that needs to be purchased to reduce that death tax liability \nto as little as possible. That is the expenditure we are talking about \nthat is unproductive. That is to say it does not create any new jobs, \nit doesn't stimulate the economy; all it does is continue the status \nquo of a death tax that is going to take effect when you die.\n  This is the reason it is not only unfair, but what we accomplished \nlast year is really, in some respects, a cruel hoax. I know a lot of \npeople I talk to back home believe we actually repealed the death tax. \nThere was some bragging about the tax bill last year. It was a great \nbill. The problem with it is, as the Senator from Oklahoma said, \nbecause it was done as part of a reconciliation package, it could not \nexceed a 10-year time span.\n  I have tried to go back home and explain to people what we did was \nreally good. We established the principle that we did not want the \ndeath tax anymore and we had a bipartisan coalition of\n\n[[Page S328]]\n\nSenators who voted overwhelmingly for that. But we now have to finish \nthe business we started. As the President is proposing in his budget, \nwe have to make that repeal permanent. Otherwise, we not only have a \nvery unfair situation, but we have a very inefficient and I would say \nuneconomical situation here.\n  We have the opportunity to put that money to work that otherwise \nwould simply go--again, I don't mean to denigrate lawyers--to pay those \nlawyers to figure out how to enable you to maximize the reduction in \nyour death tax when you die.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. First I want to express my personal appreciation to \nSenator Kyl for his leadership on this issue since I have been in the \nSenate. There is no one here who understands it more than he, or has \nfought more effectively to see it become more a reality, the \nelimination of the tax.\n  But, I say to Senator Kyl, what I was thinking about was the \ncircumstance of a small business seeing a death on the horizon and a \ndeath tax coming up. The fact that they know they have to make a \npayment of significance to Uncle Sam--would that not perhaps cause them \nto hesitate to invest in new equipment, to modernize or expand their \nbusiness, knowing that that might cause them to use up their cash or \neven borrow money, and in fact make the economy less vibrant than it \notherwise would be?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Alabama, that is \nanother entirely separate argument for eliminating the tax and making \nits repeal permanent. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  In addition to the wasteful money we spend trying to avoid the \nliability or reduce it as much as possible, rather than putting that \ninto productive assets, the Senator is pointing out that because of the \npossibility--it is almost like a black cloud hanging over your head--if \nyou think you are going to die, you are not going to make that new \ninvestment, you are not going to revitalize your plant and equipment or \nhire that other team that is going to produce a new product, or maybe \ngo out of your way to market the product--all of those things that will \nbe an investment in our economy. You are going to defer that because \nyou know you are going to need it for something else; namely, to pay \nthe grim reaper, because you know you are going to pass away.\n\n  I think of an example back home of a company that became very \nsuccessful. One entrepreneur moved to our State and over time built up \na wonderful business employing over 200 people. He was a great \ncontributor to the charities in our community. He was one of those \npillars of the community that you just like to think of but he died. \nHis family had a terrible time. The tax liability there was so great \nthat they ended up having to sell this business.\n  The idea of a death tax is to prevent an accumulation of wealth. That \nis the theory of it. What happened here? They had to sell to a big \ncompany, the kind of big corporation the Senator from Alabama was just \ntalking about. Instead of this small--I would say, with 200 employees, \nit is getting to be a medium-size business, but it was still a sole \nproprietorship basically. But instead of having the business in our \ntown, employing all those people from town, contributing to the \ncharities and the local economy, and so on, this big corporation came \nin. Are they still employing that number of people? No. Are they \ncontributing to the community as did our friend Jerry? No. These people \nare not making the kind of investment--and I don't denigrate them at \nall, but they are trying to run a business, and that is fine, but there \nis a difference here.\n  The small businessman who built up his business continued to plow \neverything he had back into the business, which is exactly the point \nthe Senator from Alabama is making here. You put it back into the \nbusiness so it can continue to grow because it is a family-owned \nbusiness. You do not have to take out all the money and send it \nsomeplace else. Because they did that, they were asset rich and cash \npoor. You do not want to find yourself in that position if you are \ngoing to die, because you cannot pay the taxes. That is why his family \nhad to end up selling the business.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to follow up on that. The company that \nbought them, bought your friend Jerry's business, presuming they were a \nbroadly held stock corporation, maybe of national size--that \ncorporation would never have to plan its economic future with the fear \nof having to pay an estate tax because corporations do not pay death \ntaxes; is that correct? Isn't that a factor, an economic incentive we \nhave created for small businesses to sell out to big businesses when \nreally they ought to be competing against them and keeping them honest?\n  Mr. KYL. I say the Senator from Alabama is exactly correct. It is an \nunfairness for the small business because the small businessmen are \ntaxed in this fashion. The big corporation--I am all for big \ncorporations, too, but they don't have to worry about this kind of \nthing. So there is, in effect, a perverse incentive working here, but \nit is one of the things that is not only bad for the economy but it \nmakes it unfair. It is not really an American way of looking at things, \nto my way of thinking.\n  If the Senator from Nevada would like to speak, we have had our \nchance here, so the Senator is welcome to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The deputy majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope people are beginning to see what \nSenator Daschle has put up with now for months on the stimulus \npackage--months. It is never quite right. There is always something \njust a little bit lacking.\n  Remember, there were rules set down for what a stimulus package \nshould be. I may not have it down exactly right, but it is supposed to \nbe fiscally responsible, supposed be short term, and would have no \neffect on the deficit. That is what we were supposed to do to get a \nstimulus package. And we have tried very hard.\n  But what are we working on today, now, to divert attention from what \nthe underlying Daschle bill does? We are now talking about something 10 \nyears from now. I don't know if any of the unemployed are watching. \nThere are probably some watching TV because they are not working, so \nmaybe some of them slipped onto C-SPAN. I hope the unemployed \nunderstand what is going on here. The minority is now focusing again on \nthe wealthy. We can have all the stories about the poor family farmers, \nand I understand that. I think the estate tax needs some revision, and \nwe were willing to do that, to work with the minority to do that.\n  Say what you want to say. This affects the top one-half percent of \nthe people in America as it relates to income. We were willing to \nchange it from the standard before. But no matter how you twist and \nturn it, this relates to people who have assets--a lot of assets.\n  How do the unemployed feel? We have given them nothing--zero. Since \nSeptember 11, we have taken care of the airlines. We have focused on \nthe insurance industry. We have done all kinds of things for corporate \nAmerica but very little for consuming America.\n  We talk about meeting the qualifications for having something \nstimulative. Studies have shown that every dollar invested in \nunemployment insurance produces $2.52 in gross domestic product. Those \nunemployed out there should understand that we want to help. We have \ntried to help.\n  Part of Senator Daschle's legislation deals with extended \nunemployment benefits. During the previous Bush administration, we \nextended unemployment benefits five times. We did it during the Reagan \nyears. But now we are not doing it. We are not messing around with \nsomething to help the unemployed.\n  In Nevada, over 100,000 jobs have been lost because of September 11. \nIndirectly, in the service industry--people who wait tables, waiters, \nwaitresses, park cars--over 30,000 jobs were lost. Those people are now \nwithout unemployment benefits. Their time has run out.\n  I think we should extend it. They did not do anything wrong. We have \ndone it in the past. It is not as if they are not willing to work. They \nare on the union lists. If something picks up, they will be rehired. In \nthe meantime, they need help.\n  I was a big supporter of Welfare to Work. I think we did good work \nduring\n\n[[Page S329]]\n\nthe Clinton years to get Welfare to Work. As you recall, President \nClinton didn't accept proposals that were sent to him. He kept vetoing \nthem until he got it just right. He improved it by his veto.\n  There are people in Nevada who are working in the service industry. \nSome of those 30,000 people are people who went into Welfare to Work. \nThese people may be dishwashers. They may be people who assist maids in \ncleaning up the hotel rooms in Las Vegas and Reno. They may be someone \nworking in some other rather low-paying job, but they get paid \ncertainly a lot better than being on welfare. Those people are out of \nwork and haven't been on the job long enough to qualify for \nunemployment benefits. We want to give them some help. But no, this \nisn't quite the right time to do this.\n  There was the Department of Labor study done in 1999. This is not \nsome new study to justify an unemployment insurance extension. This was \ndone in 1999. Every dollar invested in unemployment insurance extension \ngenerates $2.52 in gross domestic product.\n  Another study by the Department of Labor estimated that unemployment \ninsurance mitigates real loss in gross domestic product by 15 percent. \nIn the last five recessions, the average peak number of jobs saved was \n131,000.\n  Joseph Stiglitz, co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in economics last \nyear, stated that we should extend the duration and magnitude of the \nbenefits we provide to our unemployed. This is not only the fairest \nproposal but also the most effective. People who become unemployed cut \nback their expenditures. Giving them more money directly would increase \nexpenditures.\n  But here we are not doing what is called for by the President of the \nUnited States, saying that if we are going to do something on an \neconomic recovery plan, it should be short term, fiscally responsible, \nand it should do anything for the deficit. This amendment fails on all \nthree.\n  The Congressional Research Service concurs with Joseph Stiglitz. They \nsay that extending unemployment compensation is in fact likely to be a \nmore successful policy for stimulating aggregate demand than any other \ntax or transfer charge.\n  There is a time and place to debate whether or not the estate tax \nrepeal should be made permanent. I acknowledge that. There is a time \nand place to do it. But it is not on this legislation. This is another \neffort to allow the minority and the President of the United States and \nthe people around him to blame Senator Daschle and the Democrats, that \nwe didn't do anything to pass an economic stimulus package.\n  But the American people aren't that stupid. They know that we have \ndone it. It was laid out here yesterday in detail by Majority Leader \nDaschle. He has tried to get an economic stimulus package passed.\n  What did he ask for? What does the underlying bill call for? It calls \nfor extended unemployment benefits. It calls for tax rebates for those \npeople who didn't get tax rebates during the first round. Remember, the \nmost successful part of President Bush's tax cut program was our \nprogram that he stole from us. I was glad he did. But that was our \nprogram. We called for rebates. That was us. We asked for that because \nwe knew those people would spend that money quickly. They have.\n  Also, part of Senator Daschle's legislation was bonus depreciation. \nWhat is that? The bill would increase the bonus depreciation deduction \nfor the cost of any capital asset purchased between September 10, 2001, \nand September 11, 2002, and it would be certified by the end of 2002.\n  One of the amendments offered by the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, extended that. So Senator Daschle's 1-year \nproposal has been extended. The bonus depreciation up to 30 percent of \nthe cost of the asset would be in addition to the normal first year \ndepreciation. Leaseholds would qualify for the bonus depreciation \ndeduction. This would really help small business. It would help big \nbusiness, but it would really help small business. That is why the \nmajority leader included this in his legislation.\n  Finally, a provision in his legislation would provide temporary \nincreases for a Federal Medicaid matching rate, called FMAP. The \nFederal Government matches between 50 and 83 percent of the cost of \nMedicaid in each State depending on the State's per capita income. \nMedicaid matching rates for fiscal year 2002 are based on a State's per \ncapita income in 1997, 1998, and 1999, in which the economy was very \nstrong. The most recent economic trends do not reflect a new matching \nrate. Senator Daschle wanted to adjust that.\n  Why did he pick these four things: Extended unemployment benefits, \ntax rebates, bonus depreciation, and fiscal relief for the States? The \nreason he did it is people believed these things would be stimulative \nto the economy. But he narrowed it down to four things he had heard \nspeeches about given by the majority and the minority in the Senate \nsaying we think this should be done. There was general agreement on the \nfour things he put in this legislation. But, no, it is not quite the \nright time. No matter what happens, it really is not quite the right \ntime to do it.\n  Now we are in a debate about making the estate tax repeal permanent. \nLet us see. Does that stimulate the economy? No. Is it short term? No. \nIs it fiscally responsible? No. But again it deals with the rich \npeople. I am all for helping rich people. I think it is something we \nhave an obligation to do. I think helping rich people helps everybody. \nBut there is a limit.\n  I say to those unemployed watching C-SPAN today, keep in mind that we \nare trying to help. We have tried and tried and tried. This has been \ngoing on for months now. On this particular legislation, we tried again \nafter the Christmas break, starting January 23. This is the third week \nwe have been on this. It is never quite right. There just isn't \nanything we can quite do to get to finality.\n  Under the Senate rules, it is not like the House of Representatives. \nIf you have one more than a majority over there, you can ram anything \nthrough. It is like the British Parliament. When you are in the \nmajority in the British Parliament, you march down the road and get \nanything you want. But that is not the way it is in the Senate.\n\n  For 200-plus years, the Senate has had certain rules. They work well. \nBut it does not make things easy in passing legislation. And you \nusually have to have 60 votes.\n  Senator Daschle thought he had 60 votes for everything that was done \nhere. But, no, it is not quite the right time to do an economic \nstimulus package today. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe the next day.\n  But what we are faced with is a farm bill we would like to complete, \nwe have election reform we would like to complete, and we have energy \nlegislation we would like to work on prior to a week from this Friday. \nIt leaves the majority leader with very few alternatives because it is \nobvious this is a slow walk--this has been a slow walk since January \n23--because no matter what the leader does, it is not quite good \nenough.\n  So I respect the feelings, the passion that my friend from Arizona, \nMr. Kyl, has. He is very good at expressing how strongly he feels about \nthat. I understand the strength of his feelings. My counterpart, \nSenator Nickles, I understand the strength of his feelings in repealing \nthe death tax. The manager of the bill today, Senator Sessions from \nAlabama, makes a very good point on why he feels as strongly as he \ndoes. And I appreciate that.\n  But I say to my friends--and all three are my friends--it is so \nobvious what is happening here. This stimulus bill, which we have been \ntrying to pass since January 23, is going no place. Everyone can see \nthat. We are going to have a cloture vote on it tomorrow to try to get \n60 votes. It seems pretty clear to me the minority is not going to \nallow debate to stop on this legislation. That being the case, it is up \nto the majority leader how we will proceed. He is the only one who has \nthat decisionmaking power.\n  We have other things we have to get to, such as the farm bill. Nevada \nis not really a State that depends heavily on agriculture. We grow \ngarlic. We are the largest producer of white onions in America. We grow \na few potatoes. We have many cows. We have some large dairies to supply \nsome very thirsty people in Las Vegas. We even supply Carolina some \nmilk. But we are not a State dependent on agriculture as are so many \nStates.\n  But the farm bill is very important to many Senators. Of course, that \nis something we could not complete. We\n\n[[Page S330]]\n\ncould not stop the filibuster on that at year's end.\n  We thought we had a bipartisan agreement on election reform, and I \nthink we do. There has been tremendous work done by Senator Dodd, \nSenator Bond, and others--bipartisan legislation--so we don't have the \nproblems we had in the last Presidential election.\n  I am not necessarily picking on Florida. I think if a lot of States \nhad been looked at with a magnifying glass like Florida was looked at \nin the last election, we would all have problems. But this is a \nbipartisan effort to try to make that no longer the case--that we would \nhave certain standards for elections and that the Federal Government \nwould assist States in obtaining and then maintaining those standards. \nSo we need to do that.\n  Of course, energy legislation is something for which there has been a \nhue and cry from the minority, and rightfully so. We need to get to \nthat legislation. Senator Daschle, last year, made a commitment that we \nwould get there before the Presidents' Day recess. The Presidents' Day \nrecess starts next Friday, so that leaves very little time.\n  With all due respect to the fervency of the feelings of those who \nwant to repeal and make permanent the death tax, keep in mind that at \nthis stage it is only an effort to divert attention from what we are \nreally trying to do; that is, pass a bill that will stimulate the \neconomy, will be short term, will have no effect on the deficit, and be \nfiscally responsible--not legislation that, once again, has the \nunemployed getting zilch, zero, nothing, and the wealthy, again, \ngetting the largest amount that we throw to them. And even though they \ndeserve attention--and we have given them plenty--I think the time has \ncome to help those people who need help: the unemployed, the \nunderemployed, small business people, and helping States that are \nhaving difficult times because of the Medicaid matching funds.\n  Of course, as I have indicated earlier, we really need to do \nsomething to help small business. And in the process, we would be \nhelping big business with this bonus depreciation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his speech. I \nthink we all share some frustration--obviously, from different \nviewpoints--about the stimulus bill. I would just like to suggest there \nis a solution to the problem; and that is, we could have a unanimous \nconsent agreement where we would let our Democrat colleagues put \ntogether a stimulus package, we would put together a stimulus package, \nwe would have a unanimous consent agreement to vote on both of them, \nand if they both got over 50 votes, then the one that got the highest \nnumber of votes we would take to conference with the House. And we \nwould, therefore, be on our way to have a stimulus package.\n  Our Democrat colleagues are not going to accept that proposal because \nthe problem is, we have a majority vote for a bipartisan agreement that \nwas put together by Senator Snowe and Senator Breaux it has nice \nrhythm: Snowe and Breaux and it is supported by moderates on both sides \nof the aisle and has very strong support among Republicans in general.\n  I remind my colleagues the sad history of the stimulus package is \nthat the President met with Democrats and met with Republicans, took \nsome Democrat ideas, took some Republican ideas, and made a bipartisan \nproposal, which I believe the President earnestly thought, in the \naftermath of September 11, we would adopt.\n  What happened--almost immediately--is that our Democrat colleagues \nsaid: We will take the half of the bill that is ours, but not the half \nof the bill that came from the White House and from Republicans.\n  We can go back and forth and make our arguments. We have clever \npeople on both sides of the aisle. We can argue we don't see any \nstimulus in the Democrat package. Obviously, they can make the same \nargument. I don't know who would be convinced on either side.\n  But when that effort failed, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate \ngot together and put forth the only bipartisan proposal for a stimulus \npackage that has been put forward in the Senate. At that point, we \nclearly had more than 51 votes for a stimulus package. This was way \nback before Congress adjourned in December.\n  In an extraordinary action, the President said: Take that bipartisan \ncompromise. Let's agree on it. I will sign it into law. He asked the \nHouse of Representatives to take a bill written by the Senate, to \nintroduce the bill in the House, and pass it, and send it to the \nSenate.\n  At that point, as the session drew to a close last year, the majority \nleader, Senator Daschle, knew that the bill that had been passed by the \nHouse, and had come over here, and was waiting at the desk, that there \nwere a majority of the Members of the Senate--Democrats and \nRepublicans--who would vote for that bipartisan proposal if it were \nbrought to the floor of the Senate.\n  No one can dispute those facts.\n  What did the majority leader do? He refused to bring it to the floor \nof the Senate.\n  When we came back into session, the majority leader took three \nprovisions from the President's proposal--some in a slightly different \nform than the President had put in his proposal--because Democrats had \nproposed them, threw the rest of the package out, and then made up a \nfourth proposal that no one had seen, and brought that forward as a \nstimulus package.\n  He has every right to do that. He is the majority leader. But we have \na right to offer our amendments. We have offered amendments. Some have \nbeen adopted. Some have been rejected. We have had an orderly debate. \nWe have been willing to set time limits on votes. And now the Democrat \nfloor leader says that we are getting nowhere and that this is not a \nreal effort.\n  We ought to have an opportunity to vote on a bipartisan proposal. I \nbelieve it would pass. It looks as if we are not going to do that.\n  We want an opportunity to vote on some things we believe will \nstimulate the economy. I will, before I address the amendment before \nus, sum up the point I made earlier.\n  The majority leader has some choices. He can bring up his bill and \ngive us the right to try to improve it. That is what we are trying to \ndo. He says now he is going to pull down the bill because we are trying \nto improve it. He has the right to do that.\n  A second alternative is to bring up the bipartisan bill and give \nSenator Daschle a chance to amend it. I think we can work out an \nagreement to do that, but I do not believe Senator Daschle is going to \ndo that because the bipartisan bill will pass.\n  A final proposal, which I repeat in case anybody is interested in a \ncompromise, is let the Democrats sit down and write the best bill they \ncan write. We are going to take the bipartisan bill. It is not the best \nbill we can write, but it is a bill that has over 51 votes. It is not \nwonderful, but it would help the economy both in the short term and in \nthe long term. We are going to take that bill. Let the Democrats bring \nforward their proposal as to how we stimulate the economy, and let us \nbring ours forward. We will vote on both of them, and the so-called \n``king of the hill'' parliamentary procedure that we could put into \nplace by unanimous consent is the one that gets the most votes will be \ndeemed passed, and then we can go to conference with the House, and \nperhaps we might get a stimulus bill.\n  I do not see how anybody can say that is unfair. Senator Daschle \ncould get a vote on his stimulus package. We could get a vote on the \nbipartisan one, and majority would rule.\n  I do not think that is going to happen because the Daschle package \nwould get fewer votes. We all know it. The bipartisan bill would pass, \nand I believe that would be objected to.\n  What does this all boil down to? The one bill that can pass the \nSenate, the majority leader will not allow to be voted on.\n  You can say that is a good thing and you can say that is a bad thing, \nbut it is a fact, and that is the impasse in which we find ourselves.\n  We now have a bill that very few people are for, and we just want to \ntry to amend it.\n  We have an amendment before the Senate which is a very important \namendment. When we passed the tax cut last year, we faced a \nparliamentary problem that most people do not understand; that is, we \nwere operating under a process called reconciliation. That is a budget \nprocess. It means the things\n\n[[Page S331]]\n\nyou do under that process can extend no longer than the budget unless \nyou can waive a point of order and get 60 votes.\n  Some will sadly remember that the tax cut received 58 votes in the \nSenate. We did not have the votes to waive this process so the tax cut \ncould last only as long as the budget, and the budget was only 10 years \nlong.\n  It produced this incredible situation that stuns the American people \nwhen we tell them. The tax cuts that we passed--eliminating the \nmarriage penalty, eliminating the death tax, reducing tax rates \ndramatically--all of those provisions go away in 10 years.\n  Nothing is more destabilizing to the economy than having a temporary \ntax system. There is no doubt that we affect behavior when people do \nnot know what the system is going to be in the future. This is \nespecially true with regard to the so-called death tax.\n\n  As our dear colleague from Arizona has pointed out very clearly, we \nhave this incredible anomaly that if you die, depending on in what year \nyou die, between now and the 10th year of the tax cut, the taxes you \npay will vary. If you die in the 10th year, your family will inherit \nyour business or your farm or your assets tax free. If you die in the \n11th year, they are going to have to sell your business or sell your \nfarm, sell or mortgage your life's work to give the Government 55 \npercent of every dollar you accumulated worth of value on your farm, \nyour business, your assets in your lifetime.\n  Needless to say, that is an absurd circumstance. I, quite frankly, am \nconcerned that people who have some kind of serious illness might \nactually choose to end their lives in the 10th year. That is not beyond \nmy imagination.\n  We had a strong consensus on repealing the death tax. I know our dear \ncolleague talked about rich people, but, we had a consensus that if \nsomebody works their whole life, they pay taxes on every penny they \nearn and they skimp, they save, and they sacrifice and they build up a \nfamily farm, it is not right that their children have to sell the \nfamily farm to give Government a double taxation by paying 55 cents out \nof every dollar they accumulate in their life back to the Government.\n  The same is true for small business. The National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses, in surveying companies, found that the No. 1 \nreason small businesses do not survive into the second and third \ngeneration is death taxes.\n  I rejoice. I know some of my colleagues view the whole world as a \nclass struggle. They believe all of existence is a conflict between the \nrich and the poor. I always get confused about who is who because it \nchanges so often.\n  I liken the stimulus package to the coldest week of the year, it is \nsnowing, it is sleeting, it is freezing, and a breeze comes along and \nblows a roof off an apartment building. Logical people say: Why don't \nwe rebuild this roof?\n  We have colleagues who say: Wait, won't people make money rebuilding \nthis roof? There will be a profit, and don't rich people tend to live \non the higher floors of this apartment building? Won't they benefit \nmore by having a roof than the poor people who live in the basement and \non the first and second floors?\n  Really, wasn't that what the stimulus debate was all about? Honest to \nGod, what we do, remarkable as it sounds, is we end up buying a bunch \nof blankets, stockpiling penicillin, we hire a bunch of doctors and \nnurses, and we spend a whole winter treating people for exposure rather \nthan rebuilding the roof on the apartment building.\n  On the death tax--and I am sure my colleague from Arizona will \nconcur--I have never spoken on this subject in my State to any audience \nno matter what their background, what their education, no matter what \ntheir income, no matter what their wealth that did not believe that it \nwas fundamentally wrong to force a family to destroy their life's work \nin a business or a farm to pay taxes when somebody died. People \nfundamentally think it is wrong to tax death. You have to die anyway. \nThat is never a happy event. Why should we compound it by rushing in \nand collecting a tax at that moment?\n\n  I have found in watching audiences, when I have spoken on this \nsubject, it does not seem to matter whether it is a local banker or \nwhether it is a guy who works at the filling station. Nobody believes, \nat least in my State, that it is right when somebody has paid taxes \ntheir whole lives, has built up a farm or a business, to take it away \nfrom their children when they die.\n  We reached a bipartisan consensus on that principle, but because of \nthis fluke in the budget process the death tax comes back in 10 years. \nSo we have 1 year where it is repealed. The Senator from Arizona, in an \namendment I am proud to support, has proposed we make the repeal of the \ndeath tax permanent.\n  My guess is we are not going to get to vote on that this evening. I \nassume the Senator from Arizona would love to vote on it today. Our \nDemocrat leader, our dear friend, has said there is a stall underway.\n  We would like to vote on this amendment now. At some point, the \nSenator from Arizona might ask unanimous consent that we have an \nopportunity to vote on this amendment this afternoon. What I am fearful \nis going to happen is we are going to have a vote on cloture--and \nnobody knows what that means except people in the Senate, but that \nmeans no more amendments can be voted on, the Daschle proposal has to \nbe voted on by a yes or no. If that is defeated, as I believe, A, it \nshould be and, B, it will be, then in listening to Senator Reid it \nsounds to me as if the majority leader is saying he will pull down the \nbill and we will never get a chance on this bill to vote on making the \ndeath tax repeal permanent.\n  I think this is an important issue. I would like to vote on it. \nPerhaps if people want to get on with writing the bill, if we could \nmake the death tax repeal permanent, as bad as I believe the Daschle \nproposal is, I believe it does absolutely nothing for the economy, I \nwould have a hard time not voting for it if we were making the death \ntax repeal permanent.\n  Quite frankly, if Senator Daschle wanted to pass his bill he could \nprobably pick up at least two votes by supporting our amendment. So, A, \nI hope we can vote on this today. B, I hope we can vote on it someday. \nC, I believe when the American people understand we did not really \nrepeal the death tax unless you die 10 years from now and if you do not \ndie in that year it comes back, I think they are going to demand it be \nrepealed, and I believe it will be repealed. I do not have any doubt in \nmy mind we will repeal the death tax.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona. I urge him to talk to the majority \nleader about having a vote this afternoon. We would like to vote. Every \nSenator in the Chamber right now, except Senator Reid, is convinced, \nand the Presiding Officer, and we are ready to vote. We would like to \nhave a vote on this issue. Perhaps if we could adopt this amendment, we \nmight be moving toward a stimulus package that would be truly \nbipartisan.\n  I thank my colleague for his leadership, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DAYTON). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Texas very much for his great set \nof comments, and also for what he said personally. I agree, when the \nassistant majority leader says there is an attempt to slow walk this \nbill, that is simply not the case. In fact, I will not do it right now \nbecause he is preoccupied, but at some time when we have the Senator's \nfull attention--he has had a chance perhaps to talk with others on his \nside--I will propound a unanimous consent to vote as soon as we can, to \nvote this hour, to vote next hour, to vote sometime this evening, to \nvote sometime before the cloture vote, on this amendment. If we could \nvote before 4:30, we would be prepared to do that. Or if there is an \neffort to get a little bit more debate before the vote, that is fine, \ntoo, but there is no effort to draw this out. I am ready to vote right \nnow on this amendment and move on.\n  The Senator from Nevada made the point that this amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Arizona shows how hard it has been for the majority \nleader, what he has had to put up with for many months; that it does \nnot matter quite what he does, the bill is never quite right and \namendments are offered.\n  There are three responses to that. First, there have not been that \nmany amendments offered to this bill, certainly not that many which \nhave been debated and voted on, only a handful.\n\n[[Page S332]]\n\nSecondly, I think the Senator from Nevada must concur the bill is not \nquite right because he and I have an amendment which we both think is a \npretty darn good amendment that would make the underlying bill a lot \nbetter. Senator Reid himself proposed that amendment on our behalf. I \nbelieve it was yesterday. So, no, we do not think the bill is quite \nright either.\n  Of course, when Senators do not think it is quite right, then we have \nan opportunity to offer an amendment. Frankly, there are a lot of \nthings I do not like about it. I would love to propose a lot of \namendments, but I selected only two: this very important death tax \nrepeal because of the effect it will have in stimulating the economy, \nand the other is the amendment that Senator Reid and I sponsored, which \nalso would have a direct stimulative effect on the economy because it \nhelps the precise industry that was most dramatically affected, the air \ntravel industry. We can relate it to the travel industry generally \nafter September 11.\n  So, no, there is no effort to slow walk this bill or to prevent it \nfrom ever being considered or voted on. We are simply trying to do what \nSenator Reid himself has tried to do, and that is make it better.\n  I dare say the amendment I have offered would make the bill a whole \nlot better. As the Senator from Texas said, even though I am not much \nin favor of the underlying bill, if we were able to adopt this death \ntax repeal and make that permanent, I would be sorely tempted to vote \nfor the majority leader's bill.\n  The other point I wanted to make with respect to this business of \nslow walking is exactly what the Senator from Texas said. We could vote \non the Centrist Coalition proposal right now. I think everybody \nrecognizes that would pass. We could be out of here by 5 tonight by \nallowing the bipartisan Centrist Coalition bill, which President Bush \nhas endorsed, to come to the floor. It is, in fact, the only bill that \ncan pass this body.\n  So if we are talking about getting something passed and getting it to \nconference so we can actually have a stimulus package bill, we all know \nthe formula for that. It does not have to take but another few minutes \nand we could be done with it. We offered to do that. I offered to be \nsorely tempted to vote for the underlying bill if my death tax \namendment is adopted, and I probably would. We can get all this done \nvery quickly.\n  One other thing I wanted to respond to that my friend from Nevada \nargued, and it is the same old argument that was made when we \nconsidered the death tax repeal the first time around--it was wrong \nthen and it is wrong now--is that the death tax only applies to the top \n1  deg. percent and therefore it is a tax on the rich, and who would \ncare about the rich?\n  Well, there are really three responses to that. The first is that it \nis just not true. As I noted before in my earlier comments, Dr. Wilbur \nSteger, who is a Ph.D. and president of CONSAD Research Corporation, \nand a professor, has noted this argument that it only applies to the \ntop 1  deg. or 2 percent is wrong.\n  He says that, in fact, in a typical year, the total number of taxable \nestates that consist largely of family owned businesses likely exceeds \n10,000.\n  What does that number really mean? First of all, that is 10,000 \nbusinesses. Multiply by that the number of employees who work in each \nbusiness. Pick any number. One certainly has to say the people who work \nfor those businesses are directly affected. If the business goes out of \nbusiness because the death tax has to be paid, that directly affects \nevery employee in that business, times the number of family members \nwith each one of those employees, times the number of stores that they \nbuy things from and all the rest of it.\n  A lot more people are affected by the death tax than just the number \nof people who happen to die each year who end up paying the tax, in \naddition to which everybody who might have to pay the tax has to be \nworried every year about the estate planning. They, too, are directly \naffected.\n  As I pointed out before, they end up paying at least $23 billion a \nyear, and the lawyers, accountants, estate planners, insurance, and \nother expenses of estate planning that enable them to deal with this \nfuture contingency. They may not die this year, but they are having to \nshell out a lot of money this year in order to deal with their \npotential future estate liability.\n  It turns out a lot of people are affected by the existence of the \ndeath tax. What the Senator from Texas pointed out a while ago is the \nclincher. There is nothing more destabilizing to an economy than having \na temporary tax, especially one which no one can predict with any \ndegree of certainty is going to apply in the future. I refer \nspecifically to the estate tax. We phase it down a little bit over the \nnext 8 years. Then we repeal it altogether. Then it goes right back \ninto existence as it was last year with a 60-percent rate. How can I \nplan against that if I don't know when I am going to die? Do I plan for \nit in the eighth year, in the seventh year, or maybe in the year that \nit is repealed altogether? That would be great if I died that year; at \nleast my heirs would not be burdened. But if I live an extra year, they \nhave big problems. What about beyond that? Nobody knows.\n  As the Senator from Alabama argued earlier, you do not know whether \nto invest in the plant equipment or put the money away because you have \nto pay the estate tax with it. It is very destabilizing. In the \nmeantime, you keep shelling out that money to the estate planning folks \nrather than investing it in your business. That is why it belongs on \nthis bill.\n  We know it will create jobs, 240,000 jobs in 7 years. Americans would \nhave $25 billion in additional disposable personal income. This is from \na report of the Joint Economic Committee, not my numbers. We have other \nestimates that back up this point. As a matter of fact, Dr. Steger, who \nI quoted earlier, indicates an immediate death tax repeal would provide \na $40 billion automatic stimulus to the economy. That is because of the \npent-up capital that citizens do not deal with because of the potential \ntax liability that exists; a $40 billion automatic stimulus to the \neconomy at virtually no cost to the Treasury. Talk about getting the \nbang for the buck, I don't think there is anything we can do that would \nhave a greater immediate impact on our economy than the repeal of the \ndeath tax.\n  We talk about extending unemployment benefits for 13 weeks. Does that \nstimulate the economy in any way? No. Does that create any jobs? No. \nBut it is a central feature of the stimulus bill that is before the \nSenate.\n  We may want to extend unemployment benefits for the people currently \nout of work. But I don't think anyone can argue that stimulates the \neconomy. To anyone who says, Senator Kyl, how come you are offering the \ndeath tax repeal on the stimulus bill? I say, how come you are offering \nor supporting the unemployment extension? That does not create a single \njob. I know people would rather have a paycheck than an unemployment \ncheck. Let's do something that would stimulate the economy, create \njobs, provide that investment, take the $40 billion in pent-up capital, \nand get it into our economy, create the 240,000 jobs.\n  I have heard the arguments in response. I cannot imagine the Senate, \nwhich passed the death tax repeal before, would not want to finish the \njob of making that permanent, given the fact that it does not do a \nwhole lot of good, except if you die in the 10th year, to do the \npartial repeal, the temporary repeal, the confusing and destabilizing \nrepeal that we effected last year, without going into the final step \nand making it permanent. It seems to me to make so much sense.\n  The Senator from Texas made a comment; he thought maybe the effort \nwould be to deny a vote. I certainly hope that is not the case. I think \nthe American public deserves to know where their Senators stand on this \nissue. Do you believe in making the death tax repeal permanent or not? \nDo you believe it can help stimulate the economy and create jobs or \nnot?\n  There are those who are going to differ on this. That is what the \nSenate is all about. That is fine. Take the vote. Stand where you want \nto stand on the issue. But we can do that quickly. We can move on to \nthe next amendment. We can consider a whole number of amendments before \nwe have the vote on cloture sometime tomorrow. That would be my \nproposal.\n  As Senator Gramm said, perhaps what we should do, and I will wait \nuntil the assistant majority leader is\n\n[[Page S333]]\n\non the floor, perhaps we should ask unanimous consent, and I will \nindicate at the appropriate time when someone from the other side is \nhere to respond other than the Senator from Minnesota, who just walked \non the floor, we will ask unanimous consent to be able to vote for this \nat a time of their choosing prior to the cloture vote.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has arrived. If he wishes to speak to \nthis, I am happy to defer to him.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. I say to the Senator from \nArizona, I thank him for his graciousness.\n  I do not know what the dynamic is here. I know there is an amendment \nI want to do again with Senator Durbin and Senator Dayton. My \nunderstanding is we may not be able to do that so there may be some \nproblems in terms of what amendments we are able to vote on before \ncloture tomorrow.\n  However, I want to make it clear, and I assume this would make the \nSenator from Arizona feel better, I do want to go on record as to where \nI stand whether there is a vote or not. I am in very strong opposition \nto the amendment of the Senator from Arizona.\n  The good news is that in the short run, just a complete repeal of the \nestate tax would be over the first 10 years about $55 billion. The bad \nnews is, over the second 10 years, when many will be 65 years of age \nand over, and we will all be looking to see what is in the Social \nSecurity trust fund and what is in Medicare, this amendment will cost \n$800 billion.\n  I say to the presiding Chair, I had interesting discussions with \nbusiness people in Minnesota who say I am wrong. They need some help \nfor when we pass our business to our children. I said: How about up to \n$5 million? And they say that would be reasonable.\n  But that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about an \namendment that does away with all of the estate tax. I have a figure \nthat actually 636 Minnesotans paid the estate tax in 1999.\n  When we hear about small farmers and small businesspeople, we are \ntalking about the top, of the top, of the top, of the top of the \npopulation. For example, I don't pick on Bill Gates. I think he just \ndid a good thing, talking about where is the United States and other \ncountries in terms of our commitment to developing nations. But I don't \nthink the Gates family really needs any help. And I think it is a \nlittle outrageous to take $800 billion out of the Social Security trust \nfund at the very time that many of the baby boom generation are going \nto be turning 65 years of age and over. That is exactly what we got in \nthe President's budget.\n\n  I say to my colleague from Arizona, whether there is a vote or not, I \nam on record opposed to this, and pleased to be opposed to it. I find \nabsolutely incredible the situation now. We have a budget that comes \nout from the President. We find we are going to eliminate the \nempowerment zones in our city. In Minneapolis, they are extremely \nimportant. The budget will actually eliminate the grants to the \nempowerment zones. What is supposed to be for additional child care or \naffordable housing will not be there, and the budget will cut the 7(a) \nprogram in the State of Minnesota. Since 1996, we leveraged $1 billion \nto small businesses in the State of Minnesota. We will cut the 7(a) \nprogram in half. That is $1 billion of capital we have been able to \nleverage to small business. It will cut the 7(a) program by 50 percent.\n  I hear Secretary Paige say in order to figure out how to make up for \npotential cuts in the Pell Program, because we keep the maximum at \n$4,000 a year, we will take away from true north in Minnesota. It also \naffects telework, people trying to find jobs and develop businesses at \na time when our steelworkers are losing their jobs. Then we will go \nafter child care. Then we go after homeless votes. Then we will cut \ncounselors and there is no additional money for affordable child care, \nno additional money for Head Start. My gosh.\n  I hear this administration; they love the children. They are all for \nthe small children. I am sorry to be cynical, but in the words of \nFannie Lou Hamer, who once said, ``I am sick and tired of being sick \nand tired,'' I am sick and tired of this symbolism.\n\n  Then, I say to the Presiding Officer, we are still waiting. The \nSenate did a good job; Republicans did a good job--bipartisan. We were \ngoing to make the program for children, for special education, \nmandatory over 6 years, full funding. It would have helped our State \n$45 million this year, $2 billion, I say to Senator Dayton, over the \nnext 10 years. None of that is in the budget. But now what we have is a \nproposal that over the next 10 years--I mean the first 10 years, $55 \nbillion--is bad enough. The next 10 years, when we are not going to \nhave money because the administration has taken the money out of the \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds, put us into deficit, and then \nby the Kyl amendment, over the second 10 years, it is $800 billion. \nThis is simply unacceptable, and I want to make clear how strongly I am \nin opposition.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. REID. My good friend from the State of Arizona, Senator Kyl, said \nthat unemployment insurance extension does not create a single job to \nstimulate the economy.\n  Does the Senator from Minnesota, who has spent a lifetime dealing \nwith those who are not privileged, including the unemployed--would the \nSenator agree with that statement? Or would the Senator agree with the \nstatement from Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel Prize winner in economics, who \nsays:\n\n       . . . we should extend the duration and magnitude of the \n     benefits we provide to our unemployed. This is not only the \n     fairest proposal, but also the most effective. People who \n     become unemployed cut back on their expenditures. Giving them \n     money will directly increase expenditures.\n\n  Would the Senator agree with that statement or the one from our \nfriend from Arizona, Senator Kyl, who said unemployment extension does \nnot create a single job to stimulate the economy?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Nevada, the \ntruth is--first of all, even if I did think extending unemployment \ninsurance was not a stimulus to the economy, I would be for it because \nwe ought to help people who are flat on their backs through no fault of \ntheir own.\n  Second of all, Joseph Stiglitz, who was with the World Bank, a fine \neconomist, is exactly right. It is not just him, it is just about every \neconomist you talk with, much less people back in Minnesota, talking to \npeople in their homes and coffee shops, who all know, by definition, if \nyou are going to extend unemployment insurance to people and put some \nadditional dollars in their pockets, they have to go out and buy \nnecessities for their families. They are living month to month trying \nto pay their bills, so of course they are going to use that money to \nconsume, and of course it is going to stimulate the economy as opposed \nto--here is the interesting question, I say to my colleague--ending all \nof the estate tax, which, by the way, again, 636 Minnesotans pay; you \nhave to be super, super wealthy, rich. What we are going to do instead \nis end that for everyone--not target it, not $5 million or $6 million, \njust end it for Bill Gates, who is doing good work right now, again \ndealing with the developing world. We are going to give it to him, and \nthat is somehow going to stimulate the economy. But extending \nunemployment insurance for people who are out of work, that is not \ngoing to stimulate the economy? I think that argument is profoundly \nmistaken.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator respond to one more question? The minority \nall afternoon has said they want to vote on the package that came from \nthe House. They said it can get more than 50 votes.\n\n  Is the Senator from Minnesota aware that just in recent days we, over \nhere, many times have gotten more than 50 votes? On the farm bill, 53 \nto 45, 54 to 43, 54 to 43; unemployment insurance, we got 56 votes on \nthat; on the Social Security lockbox, we got 53; on the Durbin \nunemployment insurance amendment, we got 56 or 57 votes; on the Baucus \nfarm amendment, 57 votes.\n  The Senator from Minnesota and I have been in the Senate a number of \nyears. It is very frustrating to recognize you need 60 votes to pass \nthings here, but that is how much it takes, doesn't it, generally \nspeaking?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. If we used the logic of the minority, we would have passed \nseveral Democratic amendments by this point\n\n[[Page S334]]\n\nbecause they received 50 plus votes. I ask my friend, is the minority's \nargument sound, when we have had a tradition of more than 200 years \nthat you need more than 50 votes; in fact, you need 60 to get things \ngoing--is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. There are two points I would like to make for my \ncolleague. I don't know if he would agree with the second point, but we \ncould have a good colloquy about this.\n  First of all, the Senate is designed as a deliberative body. There is \ngoing to be debate. That is part of what makes the Senate unique. \nSometimes it can drive you crazy, but what makes the Senate unique is \nthe unlimited amendments and unlimited debate. So you have the 60-vote \nrequirement, quite often, on all pieces of legislation. That is the \nSenate. That is the way the Senate operates.\n  But my second point is a little bit different, which is, frankly, I \nhate to say this, however many votes you get in the Senate, sometimes \nthere is a disconnect between the Senate votes and the people we \nrepresent.\n  I have to tell you this. The House proposal that comes over here, \nthat House proposal is a proposal that repeals the alternative minimum \ntax. That House proposal is a proposal that gives away money, gives tax \nbreaks to companies such as Enron. It gives $1 billion General \nElectric, for this multinational corporation. By the way, that is in \nthe President's budget proposal: $13 billion of tax breaks for the \nEnrons of this world, yet we don't have the money for children in \neducation; we are cutting the Low Income Energy Assistance Program; we \ndon't have the money for affordable housing.\n  I say to my colleague again, if you talked to the vast majority of \npeople in the country, they would say: What in the world are you doing? \nIf you are going to have an economic recovery package, at least extend \nunemployment insurance, at least help the people who need the help, at \nleast get the money in the hands of people who will consume.\n  Yes, there is a 60-vote requirement, and then there is the substance. \nI am sorry to say this. I am well aware that up until very recently the \nEnrons of this world have had way too much influence here, and I am \nwell aware of the fact that some of these other big multinationals are \nbig givers, heavy hitters, investors, and have a lot of clout. But the \ntruth is, the vast majority of people in Minnesota and the rest of the \ncountry cannot understand this at all. They don't know what in the \nworld giving tax breaks and tax loopholes for these big multinational \ncorporations has to do with fairness, or has to do with economic \nrecovery, or has to do with helping people who are unemployed, or \nunderemployed, or subemployed, or among the ranks of the working poor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator indicate how many millions of people live \nin the State of Minnesota?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Close to 5.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Minnesota said that last year \napproximately 650 people paid estate tax?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. It was 636.\n  Mr. REID. So 636 people paid estate tax. How many people would you \nestimate are now unemployed in the State of Minnesota?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We are up to about--the percentage is about 4.5 or 5 \npercent, I think, unemployment in Minnesota right now.\n  Mr. REID. So it is tens of thousands of people?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Oh, yes.\n  I think it is about 5-percent unemployment, which is quite high for \nour State. That is the official definition of unemployment. That \ndoesn't include the people who quit looking for work because they are \ndiscouraged, or people who are working part time because they cannot \nfind a full-time job, or people working way under the wages they would \nnormally make in a better economy, or people who work but still have \npoverty wages.\n  There was a report last week indicating that almost a third of adult \nMinnesotans are working jobs at under $10 an hour.\n  Mr. REID. The last question I ask my friend is this: Doesn't it seem \nwe should be spending time on the tens of thousands of people in \nMinnesota who are out of work, or are no longer looking for work, or \nthose people who are underemployed? Wouldn't it be better if we were \nspending some time dealing with them rather than something that is \ngoing to happen 10 years from now for the wealthiest people in America?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Of course. The Senator's words are near and dear to my \nheart. The answer is yes. That is why I decided to come out on the \nfloor. I was thinking to myself: We are trying to have a simple \nextension of unemployment insurance; are we not down to 13 additional \nweeks?\n  In my State of Minnesota, we are focused on what is going on with \neducation, what is happening to our children, what is happening to our \nschools, and where the resources are. Why can't we get the money for \nspecial education? Why can't we do better making sure the kids come to \nkindergarten ready to learn? Why can't we do more with afterschool \nprograms?\n  Look at this budget from the administration. What you find from what \nthe President is proposing is all of these discussions about priorities \nand values. But we are not going to have the money for prescription \ndrug benefits. We are going to say in Minnesota if you are an \nindividual with an income of $13,000 or under, or a couple with an \nincome of $17,000 or under, you are eligible, but the rest of you \naren't. We have about over 600,000, and closer to 700,000, Medicare \nrecipients. The income profile is not high. Many of them have incomes \nover this, but they cannot afford prescription drug benefits. They are \nout.\n  The small business 7(a) program is cut in half. They are out. One \nwould eliminate homeless programs for veterans. That is out. One would \neliminate true north economic development work on the Iron Range in \nMinnesota. That is out. One would eliminate help in funding for \nchildcare in Minneapolis. That is out. They want to go after \nempowerment zones and enterprise zones in Minneapolis. That is now out. \nThey want to go after affordable housing. That is out. Help for school \ncounselors is out. Rural education is out--all for the sake of Robin-\nHood-in-reverse tax cuts giving away money to the wealthiest citizens \nin the country.\n  These are distorted priorities. This is a no-brainer. I think I am \ngoing to make this point over and over again. Let me frame the issue \ndifferently.\n  What we have out here is an amendment that says eliminate the estate \ntax for the wealthiest citizens in the country--I mean the very \nwealthy. It is not targeted. I would be for actually targeting this. I \nwouldn't mind at all doing something that would help our family farms \nand small businesses. We should do that. That is not what this \namendment does.\n  We have an amendment targeted to the wealthiest citizens in the \nUnited States of America which will deplete this economy over the next \n10 years at the very time baby boomers are 65 years of age and over. I \nam one of them. This amendment further depletes the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n\n  That is one of the issues that people have to understand. With the \nPresident's budget proposal, we are talking about over the next 10 \nyears taking close to $1 trillion out of the Social Security trust \nfund, and now another $855 billion over the next 20 years, all for the \nsake of tax breaks for the very wealthy, the very powerful, and the \nvery well connected.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't want to move \nforward with--I don't even know what you call it anymore--lifeline \nlegislation, some help for people who are out of work, some extension \nof unemployment benefits. They don't want to do that.\n  I would like to have included coverage for the working poor and part-\ntime workers. I would like to have increased benefits. I would \ncertainly like to have included some help for COBRA and health care \ncoverage. Most of that is not in here. It is just a simple extension of \nunemployment insurance. It is hardly anything else.\n  They oppose that but instead come out here with a $855 billion \nprogram over the next 20 years with all of it going to the wealthiest \nof Americans. That is basically the choice we have.\n  I would love to do a poll in coffee shops in Minnesota and across the \ncountry as to what people think about these choices.\n  Judge me by what I do. Judge me by my budget--not by my words.\n  When you start to look at the details of this budget, it is \nbreathtaking. I am\n\n[[Page S335]]\n\nfor homeland defense. I think we need to do a lot better. We need to do \na lot better with our northern border control. We need to get the \npublic health infrastructure out there. God forbid there is a terrorist \nattack. We need to be prepared. First of all, we need to try to prevent \nit. If it happens, we need to be prepared. I am for strong defense.\n  I hope Senators will carefully scrutinize this budget. We have before \nus--between the dramatic increase in the Pentagon budget and all of \nthese tax cuts with about 40 or 50 percent going to the top 1 percent \nof the population--I am now talking about tax cuts that have already \npassed. Now we have this estate tax. With this House proposal, they \nwant to repeal the alternative minimum tax. I don't think they want to \nreach back to the mid-1980s. That is too embarrassing. Ronald Reagan \nwas for it. The whole idea in 1986 was not to make these multinational \ncorporations pay any taxes when all the other people in the country \nwere.\n  You have $13 billion in tax breaks for multinational corporations. \nYou have Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax cuts with about 40 or 50 percent \ngoing to the top 1 percent of the population.\n  You have a $855 billion reckless proposal to do away with the estate \ntax for the richest and wealthiest Americans in the country while at \nthe same time cutting homeless vets programs; cuts in small business \nprograms; cuts in childcare; cuts in empowerment zone; cuts in economic \ndevelopment programs for the Iron Range; cuts in counselor programs; \nnot live up to your commitment and promise on special education, \nhelping our kids, helping our school districts, and helping our \nchildren; don't live up to your commitment on the Pell grant program; \ncuts in job training during a recession and during hard economic times \nwhen people in northeast Minnesota, or in greater Minnesota, or in \nmetro Minnesota, many of them are going back to school, or trying to go \ninto a job training program for skills development. They have been spit \nout of the economy. They are looking for training so they can get back \nto work--cut those programs.\n  My party needs to find its voice. Majority Leader Daschle has been \nout there and he has been vilified. I smile. I think sometimes it is an \neffort to make him out to be a Newt Gingrich of the left. It is \noutrageous. But this party, my party, the Democratic Party, is supposed \nto be the party of the people. If there ever were a time for us to find \nour voice and for us to speak out and for our country to have a real \ndebate about these values, it is now. In the words of Rabbi Hillel: If \nnot now, when?\n\n  Personally, I think the thing I feel worse about is the children in \nrelation to the education piece. I am going to be one of these people, \nin not too many years, who is going to be over 65 years old. Lord, we \nhave six grandchildren. I just took our granddaughter Cari to see \n``Fiddler on the Roof.'' There is that song: ``Sunrise, Sunset.'' I \ndon't know what has happened to the time.\n  I believe that ultimately the way we are judged is in relation to \nwhat we have done for our children, what we have done for our \ngrandchildren. Have we made this country better and this world better \nfor them? I think that is how we are judged. I think that is how we are \njudged as parents and I think that is how we are judged as adults. I \nthink that is how we are judged as Senators. I think that is how we are \njudged as Representatives. I think that is how we are judged as a \nnation.\n  How have we done for our children? We are not doing very well. In \nthis budget, we flat-lined affordable child care. I think only about 10 \npercent of low-income families are able to participate in affordable \nchild care right now because that is all the funding there is.\n  We say we love the little children and are concerned about the \ndevelopment of the brain and that we want children to read better, but \nwe have funded Early Head Start at about the 3- or 4-percent level.\n  We could be a real player for children prekindergarten. We could make \na real difference. We could do so much more for our schools. We could \nlive up to our commitment on special education. For title I--I am \nsorry, I have indignation--they make the claim we have added $1 billion \nand that this is great. In real dollar terms, there is no additional \nmoney because there are more children who are eligible for title I.\n  We are going to test these children, all in the name of rigor. So you \ngo to a Bancroft Elementary School and, big surprise, 80, 90 percent of \nthem are on a free or reduced school lunch program; 60 percent of them \nare in homes where English is the second language; and 20, 25 percent \nof them move several times during the year for lack of affordable \nhousing. There is a key education program, and there is no more funding \nfor that. In fact, they are cutting funding for affordable housing, and \nwe are surprised these children do not do as well? And we do not give \nthem any more help to do better.\n  I think this is a debate about values. Everybody wants to talk about \nfamily values. This is a family value. How are we doing for our \nchildren? How are we doing for our grandchildren? Are we making life \nbetter for them? Are we going to make it possible for them to be good \nleaders in the future?\n  I think we have some seriously distorted priorities out there. I hope \nmy party will directly challenge them.\n  A reporter said to me: The President is very popular. Does that make \nit hard for Democrats to be critical?\n  I said: Look, it is good for people to do well. The President is \ndoing well in terms of the polls. Fine. But the real issue is whether \nor not we are willing to speak up for what we think is right, for what \nwe believe in, for what we think is best for States and best for the \ncountry.\n  That is what people want us to do. It is important, as Democrats, \nthat we find our voice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the compromise \neconomic stimulus package we are now considering.\n  The slowdown of our Nation's economy has been a matter of increasing \nconcern following the terrorist attacks on September 11th. Millions of \nAmericans are dealing with the economic repercussions of the attacks on \nour Nation. Hundreds of thousands of workers have lost their jobs, and \nconsumer and business confidence has eroded during this time of \nuncertainty. The decrease in economic activity is affecting companies \nranging from small businesses to corporations, not to mention entire \nindustries such as the airlines and the travel and hospitality \nindustry.\n  The slowdown in our Nation's economy is reflected in the State of \nHawaii, where as of January 26, 2002, 56,313 people have filed \nunemployment claims since September 11th. This is almost double the \namount of claims filed for the same time period as last year. In\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\nthe weeks after the terrorist attacks most of those filing unemployment \nclaims worked in the visitor industry. However, state labor department \nofficials have advised me that claims are coming in from workers laid \noff from a wide range of industries and small businesses in Hawaii. In \n2001, our visitor industry experienced a $1 billion decline from the \nprevious year. After September 11th, domestic travel to Hawaii fell 30 \npercent and international travel dropped by 50 percent. The number of \nvisitors to Hawaii declined by 600,000. Our Governor and State \nLegislature are considering ways to deal with a $300 million budget \nshortfall.\n  The economic stimulus proposal that we are currently considering \nincludes important provisions such as extending unemployment insurance \nbenefits for an additional 13 weeks for those individuals who have \nexhausted their regular, state-funded benefits. With the Hawaii State \nDepartment of Business, Economic Development, and Tourism predicting \nthat a full recovery will not occur until the last half of 2003, it is \nimperative that we pass responsible economic stimulus legislation. \nHawaii's economy and working families cannot afford another long and \ndisastrous recovery, especially since the State was just beginning to \nrecover from a nine-year economic recession.\n  Temporarily extending unemployment insurance benefits will help the \nAmerican people and revitalize consumer confidence. As recent research \nhas shown, the Unemployment Insurance system is eight times as \neffective as the entire tax system in mitigating the impact of a \nrecession. In addition, the Unemployment Insurance system is able to \ntarget the very sector of society that needs the most economic \nstimulus. I would like to remind my colleagues that in every recession \nduring the past 30 years, including the 1990-1991 recession, \nUnemployment Insurance benefits were extended.\n\n  There is no doubt that extended unemployment insurance benefits and \nthe other elements that make up the core of this short-term economic \nstimulus package would help to boost Hawaii's and our Nation's weak \neconomy. There are faint signs of recovery and resilience nationwide \nwhich underscore that we may, I repeat may, have seen the worst from \nthe current recession. A well-defined, short-term stimulus package that \nis limited and specifically targeted for maximum effectiveness can play \nan important role in promoting economic recovery.\n  Clearly, there are contrasting views among Members of Congress as to \nwhat provisions should be included in a stimulus package to maximize \nthe stimulative effect on the economy. I believe that the economic \nstimulus package should encourage increased spending as soon as \npossible to rejuvenate the economy, assist people who are most \nvulnerable during the economic slowdown, and restore business and \nconsumer confidence. However, it is important that fiscal discipline \nover the long-term be maintained in order to ensure economic growth in \nthe future.\n  I commend the majority leader for his efforts to fashion a bipartisan \ncompromise and move this important legislation. In addition to extended \nunemployment benefits, the compromise package includes three components \nthat both parties included in their stimulus bills last year, including \ntax rebates, bonus depreciation, and fiscal relief for states through a \ntemporary increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, FMAP, \nrate.\n  Last month, I attended the opening of the Hawaii State Legislature \nand Governor Ben Cayetano's State of the State address. I am not \nexaggerating when I say that increased Federal Medicaid assistance to \nthe states is critical to my State and States across the Nation that \nare facing tremendous revenue shortfalls because of the recession, the \nrepercussions of September 11th, and Federal tax changes enacted last \nyear.\n  I strongly support the component of the stimulus package that would \ntemporarily increase the FMAP rate for States. Medicaid matching rates \nfor fiscal year 2002 are based on State per capita income data from \n1997, 1998, and 1999--years in which the national economy was strong. \nConsequently, matching rates are slated to be reduced for 29 States in \n2002. The reduction in FMAP rates has worsened an already bleak fiscal \noutlook for many States. In August 2001, the Congressional Budget \nOffice projected that Medicaid expenditures in 2002 would be 9 percent \nhigher in 2002 than in 2001, while States projected that their revenues \nwould rise just 2.4 percent.\n  Rising Medicaid expenditures have long been a serious concern to \nStates. The repercussions of the terrorist attacks on September 11 are \nleading most analysts to expect even higher State Medicaid costs \nbecause the economic downturn will make more people eligible for \nMedicaid and lower State revenues. It is during difficult financial \ntimes that the Medicaid program becomes a primary target of state \nbudget cuts. Yet, people need Medicaid during these times more than \never.\n  The Federal Government matches between 50 to 83 percent of the cost \nof Medicaid in each state. On average, the Federal Government pays 57 \npercent. The FMAP formula is based on the State's per capita income in \nthe 3 calendar years that are most recently available. For years, \nHawaii received the lowest Federal match--50 percent. Recognizing that \nincreasing the FMAP rates would ease States' financial constraints, I \nhave long worked to increase Hawaii's FMAP rate.\n  The temporary increase in the FMAP is an important component of our \nNation's economic stimulus policy. Medicaid is the largest Federal \ngrant-in-aid to States. Temporarily increasing the Federal matching \nrate could have broad positive ramifications for State budgets, the \nimpact of which would be rapid and would not require additional Federal \nor State bureaucracy. These changes would provide much needed health \ncare to people in need by providing States the resources to do so.\n  It is clear that an economic stimulus package is needed to support \nour economy during these uncertain times and to promote a rapid \nrecovery. We saw the Federal Reserve Board cut interest rates 11 times \nin a row last year with limited economic effect. Congress has also \ntaken actions to provide some of that stimulus through emergency \nspending for recovery efforts and to assist the airline industry. It is \ncritical that Congress promptly pass an economic stimulus package that \nwill rejuvenate our faltering economy while assisting households who \nhave been especially hard hit by the downturn in the economy. I hope \nthe Senate will complete action on this legislation this week so that \nthe Congress can send a measure to the President by the Presidents' Day \nholiday.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the stimulus \npackage, one that I firmly believe we should have as a nation. It is \nclear to me that while we may have a stronger economy today than we had \n3 months ago or 6 months ago, we still are in a period of very slow \ngrowth, if at all, and one where I think we need an insurance policy to \nmake sure our economy does turn around, it does pick up, and does \nbetter in the new year. We have real needs of the unemployed to address \nand their loss of benefits in our society.\n  There are plenty of reasons to believe we ought to encourage business \ninvestment through a bonus depreciation plan, and we need to help our \nStates that are running huge deficits with Medicaid matches and in \nother areas.\n  For the life of me, I do not understand why we would think that \nmaking permanent an estate tax cut 10 years in the future is going to \ndo a doggone thing to stimulate the economy now. While I have great \nrespect for the distinguished Senator from Arizona, I think this idea \nof calling for the permanent repeal of the estate tax is just a bad \nidea.\n  Last year, I did believe there was a need for some reform with \nrespect to the estate tax. I thought it was onerous on many small \nfamily farmers and also for small businesses and some individuals who \nwere trying to deal with relatively limited estates. I thought it was \nburdensome on these folks.\n\n[[Page S337]]\n\n  I strongly opposed before I was here and I strongly oppose now the \ncomplete repeal of the estate tax. Those Americans who have done well \nand have had the benefit of the American promise in its greatest format \nI think have a responsibility to give some contribution back to the \ncountry that gave them the opportunity to do so well. We are all a part \nof that community. It seems reasonable that an estate tax fits within \nthat concept.\n  We can talk about the rates and about some elements of it, but it \nseems to me there is reason to believe those who have benefited so much \nhave a responsibility to their community and society. Furthermore, it \nis a gift from one generation to the next, and if we are going to be \nconsistent in how we treat various parts of our Tax Code, gifts are \ntaxable and so, too, should be estates.\n  That is not the issue today. The issue is: Is this stimulative to the \neconomy? Is it something that makes any sense in the short term to get \nAmerica's economy moving again?\n  For the life of me, I just do not understand it. Whatever one might \nthink, there is just no credible argument that would show it is going \nto do anything to stimulate the economy today.\n  So I firmly want to speak out against this particular amendment \nbecause we have limited resources in this country. We have a fiscal \nstructure that is very dangerous with regard to our needs not only in \nthis decade but certainly in succeeding decades when the estate tax \nwill really have a bite, as opposed to in the short run coming in, in a \n10-year time frame. We have a demographic bubble that is going to \nchange the underlying demands on Social Security. The number of people \ndrawing it down will bankrupt it, or at least the resources will not be \navailable to pay the benefits at a time many folks would expect them to \ncome forward with their Social Security payments.\n  To complicate that problem further by making permanent this estate \ntax repeal is difficult to understand, particularly since it is \nimplausible to believe anybody is going to change one whit their \nspending patterns today based on an estate tax repeal that is going to \nget implemented 10 years from now. So it is an amendment that I think \nhas no place on a stimulus package or a stimulus bill that we might be \nworking on today.\n  Again, I question whether we need a repeal under any circumstances \nfor in fact it provides a huge windfall for a very small number of \nestates at the expense of the greater population. The estates of fewer \nthan 48,000 people had to pay any tax at all in 1998. That is less than \n2 percent of all estates. The beneficiaries of that estate tax, those \nburdened with that estate tax, are some of the wealthiest folks in \nAmerica.\n  I think it is fine to be wealthy, but the fact is we have great needs \nin this country. We are making choices about whether we are going to \nfund an additional 2 million new teachers so we can lower class sizes \nin this country. We have a Social Security system that everyone says is \ngoing to be stretched to meet its needs as we go through the 21st \ncentury. We have great demands on our homeland security, on national \nsecurity. It does not make sense that we should be putting this in \nplace right now.\n  Also, it is dangerous for something that is really important to all \nAmericans, and that is our charitable and philanthropic efforts in this \ncountry. It is hard to imagine what kind of impact the repeal of the \nestate tax is going to have on so much of the roughly $6 billion worth \nof charitable contributions the Treasury Department estimates we would \nbe receiving. I am concerned about our ability to continue to make sure \nwe have the community-based support that is operated through our \nphilanthropic efforts. If we have ever seen the value of that, we have \nseen it in the days that have followed the September 11 tragedy as \nAmericans have reached out to help others. Certainly that has been \nbenefited by the view that charitable contributions and estates provide \na basis for a lot of the charitable giving.\n  So while this permanent repeal of the estate tax may cost $55 billion \nin 2011, and that is a lot of money, I think the real issue is we ought \nto worry about what it is going to cost in the second decade. I have an \nestimate that it may be over $800 billion in the second decade from \n2012 to 2021. I find it hard to believe we want to take that bet at \nthis point in time, when we have such a serious issue coming with baby \nboomers and the demographics that I spoke about before, and the real \nneed to protect and provide security to Social Security and Medicare \nfor our seniors. I guess that is before we have a prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors and other things we have talked about.\n  I do not have a clue how we could put this together and call this \nsignificant stimulus. I think there are fundamental reasons to believe \nthat it is not a good policy in the long run. So I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment. I think there will be reason for \nfurther debate about this as we go forward in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S337-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S337-S338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            KENNEDY PROPOSAL TO REPEAL LAST YEAR'S TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to address a proposal by \nthe Democrat leadership to repeal the future individual income tax \nreductions enacted in last year's historic tax cut bill.\n  At this time last year, the CBO reported that, as a percentage of \nGDP, Federal taxes took 20.6 percent of GDP, a record post World War II \nlevel.\n  Individual income taxes were at even more dramatic levels. CBO \nreported individual income taxes were at 10.2 percent of GDP.\n  Even after last year's tax cut is fully in effect, however, the CBO \nestimates that Federal taxes will still take between 19.2 percent and \n19.9 percent of GDP over the next 10 years.\n  That is still way above historically average levels of Federal \ntaxation. Just look at the chart behind me.\n  This chart shows total Federal tax receipts as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product over that past 40 years, and it projects tax receipts \nover the next 10 years as a result of last year's tax cut.\n  As you can see, even after last year's tax cut, the level of taxation \nremains at historically high levels of GDP.\n  As this chart shows, tax receipts have fluctuated frequently since \n1960, but have escalated significantly since 1993. They will remain at \nhistorically high levels for the next 10 years. Now look at the history \non this chart.\n  The most shocking spike in tax receipts began in 1993. The CBO's \nJanuary 2001 report to Congress shows that in 1992, total tax receipts \nwere around 17.2 percent of GDP. Since that time, Federal receipts \nclimbed rapidly.\n  By the year 2000, Federal receipts had exploded to an astronomical \n20.6 percent of GDP.\n  The significance of this percentage can only be appreciated by \nhistorical comparison. In 1944, at the height of our buildup during \nWorld War II, taxes as a percentage of GDP were 20.9 percent--only \\1/\n2\\ percent higher than they are today. By 1945, those taxes had dropped \nto 20.4 percent of GDP.\n  Even after last year's tax cut is fully phased in, taxes will still \naverage around 19.4 percent over the next 10 years. As you can see from \nthis chart, it is still higher than most of the levels over the past 40 \nyears.\n  Taxes were higher during the years 1993 through 2000, which were \nattributable to the tax increases forced through by President Clinton \nin 1993.\n  Similarly, the increase in receipts from 1965 to 1969 was \nattributable to the Vietnam conflict. The runup in receipts from 1976 \nto 1981 was caused by ``bracket creep,'' which occurs when inflation \ncauses wages to increase, forcing people into ever higher rates \nbrackets. We corrected that problem years ago.\n  So as you can see, while the Democrats rail against last year's tax \ncut, it was actually rather modest. When compared to the levels of \ntaxation imposed over the last 40 years, we still remain at \nhistorically high levels of taxation even after last year's tax cut.\n  We hear now a great hue and cry from some on the other side of the \naisle that last year's tax cut should be repealed. But I ask: Are high \ntaxes the only way to balance our budget?\n  One of the most ardent advocates of repealing last year's tax cut is \nmy good friend Senator Kennedy. I have been pleased to work with \nSenator Kennedy on many bipartisan proposals and look forward to \ncontinuing those efforts.\n  Senator Kennedy is an important leader. Whenever he speaks, I pay \nclose attention because he's a serious and effective legislator who \noften reflects the\n\n[[Page S338]]\n\nheart and soul of the Democratic caucus.\n  Last year's tax cut legislation carried the support of over one-\nfourth of the Democratic caucus. Although the tax relief has been \ndefined by its harshest critics in terms of its budget effects, it's \nimportant to look behind the numbers and consider what this legislation \nmeans to the American people.\n  Before I get to that point, however, I want to make clear that those \nof us who support bipartisan tax relief and accelerating reduction of \nthe 27 percent rate do not agree with a fundamental premise of Senator \nKennedy's proposal.\n  Senator Kennedy and the Democrat leadership are arguing that the \nbudget effects of the bipartisan tax relief deny the Congress and the \nPresident the resources to tackle other domestic priorities such as a \nprescription drug benefit for Medicare, Social Security reform, and \neducation reform. This argument, however, is based on a couple of \ncritical assumptions with which I disagree.\n  The first assumption is that the tax relief measures beyond 2004 will \nhave no effect on the growth of our economy.\n  So, for instance, bringing the top tax rate for successful small \nbusinesses to a level equal to that of America's largest corporations \nat 35 percent is assumed to have no effect on the economy. That \nassumption flies in the face of economic theory and more importantly, \nthe anecdotal evidence I gathered from some small business folks in \nIowa. From my vantage point, the best way to bolster Federal revenues \nis to put policies in place to grow the economy.\n  The second assumption is that the only way to approach Federal budget \npolicy is to maintain record levels of Federal taxation on the American \npeople. That view is reflected in the chart behind me.\n  Senator Kennedy's proposal assumes even higher taxes are necessary to \naddress all of our priorities. So in facing budget choices, Federal \nspending goes unchecked.\n  The assumption is there are no savings to be made on the spending \nside of the ledger. Implicit in this assumption is growth in both \nfederal revenue and Federal spending as a share of our economy is a \ndesirable objective.\n  To a certain extent, the proposal that Senator Kennedy and the \nDemocratic leadership have put forward is a reversal of their previous \nsupport for significant tax relief.\n  Last year, Senate Democrats proposed a tax cut of about $1.26 \ntrillion. That compares with a bipartisan tax cut that we enacted that \ncame out at $1.35 trillion.\n  Their proposal was only about 6.7 percent less than the cut that was \nenacted. To hear the Democratic budget people describe it, however, you \nwould believe it was a 67 percent difference.\n  Keep in mind that 48 of 49 Democrats, including Senator Kennedy, \nsupported their alternative.\n  Now, I know that despite votes for long-term tax relief, many of the \nopponents of the bipartisan tax relief now think that we should keep \nthe rebate and repeal the long-term tax relief.\n  Nothing could be worse for a slumping economy.\n  Do we really want to send a signal to workers, investors, and \nbusiness people that their taxes are going to go up? Even if the \nDemocrats are talking about a repeal that takes effect in 2005, higher \ntaxes in the future are higher taxes.\n  If the Democrats believe that the only way to solve our budget \nproblems is to raise taxes, instead of reducing spending, what will \nthey do to make up the difference?\n  Let's start with the basis for the rebate. That is, the new 10 \npercent bracket. The revenue loss for this part of the package is $421 \nbillion over 10 years. It is the biggest tax cut in the bill, by the \nway. I can not believe or any other member of the Senate wants to \ndismantle that piece.\n  Where do we go next? The marginal tax rate cuts lose almost $421 \nbillion over 10 years. It appears some folks think 35 percent is too \nlow a top rate. Well, guess what. As I alluded to above, repealing the \nmarginal rate cuts hits small business, the biggest job generator in \nour economy, the hardest.\n  According to the Treasury Department, small business gets about 80 \npercent of the benefits of the cut in the marginal rates. Do we want to \nraise the tax rates of small businesses in a slumping economy? Does \nthat make any sense?\n\n  Where do we go next? Do the opponents want to repeal the proposal to \ndouble the child tax credit? Or how about the refundable piece that \nhelps 16 million kids and their families? That proposal loses $172 \nbillion over 10 years. Does the Democratic leadership really want to \ndeny American families the increase in the child tax credit that kicks \nin, in 2005?\n  How about the death tax relief package? That package scores at $138 \nbillion over 10 years. Most of the revenue loss is attributable to \nincreasing the exemption amount and dropping the rate to 45 percent on \nalready taxed property. Is it unreasonable to provide additional relief \nfrom the death tax?\n  Let's take a look at the marriage penalty piece. It is the first \nmarriage penalty relief we've delivered in over 30 years. This proposal \nscores at $63 billion over 10 years. Again, I do not think many folks \nwould want to raise taxes on folks because they decide to get married. \nUnder Senator Kennedy's proposal, most of the marriage tax relief would \nbe eliminated.\n  Continuing on through the bipartisan tax relief package, let's take a \nlook at the retirement security provisions. This package, which will \nhelp Americans save more for retirement, scores at $50 billion over 10 \nyears. With the aging of the baby boomers, does anyone really believe \nwe should reduce incentives for savings? Under Senator Kennedy's \nproposal, workers who want to put an additional $1,000 in an IRA or \nsection 401(k) plan would lose that right beginning in 2005.\n  Finally, let's talk about education. The bipartisan tax relief \npackage includes $29 billion in tax incentives for higher education. In \nthis era of rising higher education costs, should we gut tax benefits \nfor families to send their kids off to college? Do the Democrats really \nwant to cut back on these bipartisan investments in higher education?\n  Now, I have just gone through about $1.3 trillion of tax relief. It \nsounds like a lot in abstraction, but it provides relief to every \nAmerican who pays income tax. I would ask any of those who want to \n``adjust'' or ``restructure'' the bipartisan tax relief, including the \nDemocrat leadership, why would you cut the tax relief package?\n  I think the American people would like an answer to that question.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S338-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S338-S339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STATUS OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think sometime tomorrow we are going \nto have some cloture votes. Who knows what happens after you are \ninvolved with cloture votes? I suppose it depends on how the cloture \nvote turns out. But it also depends somewhat on what the majority \nleader decides to do. I did not hear him this morning or this \nafternoon. It was suggested that if we don't get cloture, then we may \ngo on to other legislation.\n  I want to speak procedurally, not so much on the substance of the \nunderlying bill as I have done a couple of times this afternoon but \nabout where we are and some of the irony of our being here; \nparticularly, some of the irony about how some things are said and \nother things are done by the leaders who decide the agenda for the \nSenate. I will take a few minutes to talk about where we are on the \neconomic stimulus bill before tomorrow's cloture vote.\n  The good news is that there is bipartisan recognition of the need to \nhelp unemployed workers with an extension of unemployment compensation. \nThere is bipartisan agreement that recognizes the need to provide \ntaxpayers with a payroll tax rebate so we are able to help stimulate \nconsumer spending and create jobs. There is bipartisan recognition of \nthe need to provide bonus depreciation. I suppose there are some others \nas well.\n  Kind of summing up in regard to that, there is kind of bipartisan \nagreement on the part of the Republicans for\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\nwhat Democrats want in this area, but in areas where Republicans want \nto add some things there is not bipartisan agreement on the other side \nfor those things.\n  That brings us to the bad news as a result of that situation. We are, \nin fact, stuck in a procedural quagmire. Yesterday the distinguished \nmajority leader claimed that Republicans were slowing down the stimulus \nbill through filing of many amendments. I think it is a bit ironic \ntoday that we have amendments pending on which the majority leader \nseemingly does not want to vote. If he wanted to move this process to \nconclusion with a bill that the President has said he would sign, that \ncould be done very easily. We could have a vote on that. There is \nbipartisan support for it. That bill would be down to the White House I \nbelieve faster than you could say Jack Robinson. Instead, the only \nvotes that it seems we are going to be able to get are votes on dueling \ncloture motions. One vote will be on the majority leader's amendment. \nThat vote is a take-it-or-leave-it vote, I believe.\n  I call upon all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to pay \nclose attention. A vote for cloture tomorrow means all amendments \noffered or filed that have not received a vote will not get a vote. \nThat is a very important point. A vote for cloture on the underlying \namendment filed by the majority leader means all of the following \namendments will not receive a vote. I will go through those.\n  Senator Bunning, a foster care amendment; Senator Baucus, emergency \nagriculture funding; a second-degree amendment to that amendment by \nSenator Kyl for permanent repeal of estate tax; Senator Hatch's \namendment for a longer net operating loss carryback provision; Senator \nReid's amendment on travel and tourism; a second-degree amendment to \nthat by Senator Dorgan on travel industry stabilization; and Senator \nDomenici on a payroll tax holiday, which is probably the most \nstimulative idea that has been presented to the Senate. We will not \nhave an opportunity to vote on that. Senator Durbin has an unemployment \ninsurance amendment; Senator Allard, a research and development \namendment, what we call permanent R Senator Lincoln, Medicaid Upper \nPayment Limit payments to hospitals; Senator Smith of New Hampshire, an \nactive duty waiver of IRA withdrawal penalty; Senator Smith again, ban \non interstate commuter taxes; Senator Smith again, income tax waiver on \ntip income; Senator Smith again, above-the-line deduction for real \nproperty taxes; Senator Sessions, tax incentives in regard to \nunemployment compensation; Senator McCain, sale of principal residence \nfor uniformed services, something our military people would benefit \nfrom very much; Senator Kyl again, a repeat of his second-degree \namendment which would be a permanent repeal of the estate tax; Senator \nThomas, small issue bond provisions; and an amendment I have offered \nwhich will also have a cloture vote for the bipartisan White House-\ncentrist package, the bill that I said has bipartisan support in the \nSenate. If we could get it up for a vote, we would have a bill down to \nthe President and signed. It would be an enacted economic stimulus \npackage faster than you can say Jack Robinson.\n\n  All of those amendments will not come to a vote if the cloture vote \ntomorrow on the Senate majority leader's motion carries.\n  We are in the mode of a lot of Senators trying to put together a bill \nthat can get a majority vote in the Senate and go to conference. Some \nof these amendments have to be agreed to to get that kind of bipartisan \nsupport. If you do not get a chance to vote on them, how do you ever \nget to a bipartisan bill? It takes that sort of bipartisanship to get \nanything done in the Senate.\n  Let me make very clear that Members who vote for the cloture on that \ncloture motion, if they want to vote on these amendments, they will be \nforeclosed.\n  I said there is going to be another cloture vote tomorrow. It arose \nout of necessity--not a necessity that I like. But the majority leader \nforced a vote on the White House-centrist bipartisan amendment that I \noffered because of his own cloture motion.\n  The other cloture vote--in relation to the cloture motion I filed--\nwill be on the White House-centrist agreement on stimulus. If cloture \nis invoked and that amendment passes, the President says that bill will \nbe signed. The bill has already passed the House of Representatives.\n  That means, bottom line, the following things will happen when the \nPresident signs the bill--and there is little disagreement that these \nthings ought to happen--workers will get unemployment checks. Low-\nincome people, qualifying for rebates, will get rebates to spend money. \nSpending that money will create jobs. Middle-income taxpayers will get \nmore income tax relief. Those who are unemployed for the first time \nwill get help with their health care insurance. And business will get \naccelerated depreciation. By doing that--investing more, increasing \nproductivity--it will increase the number of jobs.\n  That is what a stimulus package is all about--two things--one, \nresponding to the needs and the anxiety of the unemployed workers \nthrough improved unemployment benefits and for the first time, health \ncare benefits. Currently there are 800,000 of more workers who are \nunemployed because of September 11; and there is probably more \nunemployment to come. We are all encouraged that during January \nunemployment was flat, there was no an increase in the rate--and \nhelping those dislocated workers with additional unemployment benefits \nand with health insurance is greatly needed. The second thing objective \nof the economic stimulus bill, in various ways, is to stimulate the \neconomy to create jobs.\n  For those who say, ``Maybe the economy is turning around; we don't \nneed it,'' we at least have an insurance policy against the usual \ndowntick that comes after you have been a few quarters into a recovery.\n  But if we want a strong economy, and a certainty of that strong \neconomy, we are going to have to get a stimulus bill passed. So I hope \ntomorrow we have an opportunity not to have cloture on the underlying \nDaschle amendment and that we are able to then move towards a vote on \nthe White House-centrist bipartisan package that has passed the House, \nhas bipartisan support in the Senate, and the President has said he \nwill sign.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S339-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S339-S341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PASSING A STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I regret to state to my colleagues it \nis pretty obvious the Democratic majority leader does not want to pass \na stimulus package. We needed to amend the package. We have a lot of \namendments that were pending and we have not had a vote all day. We had \namendments this morning on which we were willing to vote, amendments \nthis afternoon on which we were willing to vote. That was how we would \nwork our way through and have a bill that would pass and go to \nconference.\n  Obviously, for some reason, the majority leader decided, no, he would \nfile cloture, have cloture on his underlying proposal, which many \nMembers believe falls far short of providing any stimulus. It provides \na lot of spending. The majority leader's underlying proposal has \nspending for rebate, $14 billion for people who did not pay taxes. They \ncertainly did not pay any income tax or they would have gotten a tax \ncut last year. They may have paid payroll taxes, but likely they are \navailable for an earned-income tax credit, and in many cases three or \nfour times the payroll tax they paid. So basically, $14 billion in \nwelfare reform payments that many were trying to call a tax cut or \nrebate, but it was not a rebate.\n  There is another $5 billion for an entitlement program for States, \nsupposedly to help pay for health care costs, but it was in the form of \nan entitlement. So it would not be $5 billion for 1 year, although it \nwas sunsetted in 1 year, but in all likelihood will be continued \nindefinitely and probably cost more like $50 or $60 billion over 10 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S340]]\n\n  He had unemployment compensation extension at about $8 billion. And I \nnotice our colleagues on the Democratic side said: That is not good \nenough. We need to expand that and have that apply to temporary \nworkers.\n  The Federal Government has never paid unemployment compensation for \ntemporary workers. Some people, perhaps, want to take advantage of the \nfact there is a recession, so just expand Federal entitlements. That \nwas going to cost about $16 billion.\n  Then the majority leader introduced the only stimulus piece, \naccelerated depreciation. That was 30 percent. Most people said for a \nyear. We found out the commitment had to be made by September 10 of \nthis year. That is not 12 months; that is more like 8 months from now.\n  So the stimulative side of his proposal is very small. The spending \nside was very big. I thought, well, I don't like starting with that. I \nwould have preferred starting with the bipartisan bill on which Senator \nBreaux and Senator Collins and Senator Snowe and Senator Grassley and \nothers worked. That was a bill that most, if you count both sides, \nthought there was a majority vote for. That should be underlying, but \nwe did not get that.\n  So we thought: We will amend the majority leader's proposal and \nimprove it and come up with a bill worthy of passing to conference. We \nhad several amendments. Some amendments that were adopted made the bill \nbetter. Some on our side would actually have stimulus impact. We had an \nexpensing amendment that Senator Bond and Senator Hutchinson and \nSenator Collins passed. That would allow small business to \nexpense immediately items up to $40,000. Right now the level is \n$24,000. That would have created jobs. That was a positive amendment.\n\n  Senator Gordon Smith had an amendment dealing with accelerated \ndepreciation, 30 percent for 3 years. The point of order was made and \nit was not successful. He came back with one that was 2 years at 30 \npercent. That passed and would have created jobs.\n  We had an amendment by Senator Kyl to make the death tax repeal that \nwe passed last year permanent. That would have been positive. You say: \nHow could that make a difference? It makes a difference because there \nare farms and ranches in Missouri, Oklahoma, and all across the country \nthat would not have to be broken up to pay the death tax. Maybe some \nsmall businesses would decide not to be so small because they could \nagree and know they could grow without the Federal Government getting \nhalf of it. A lot of businesses almost suffocate. Owners know if they \ngrow the business any more, the Government will get so much, so why \ngrow it? Why work and expand and build and create more jobs if Uncle \nSam will come in and get half?\n  So if we passed the death tax repeal proposed by the Senator from \nArizona, it would have had a positive stimulative impact on the \neconomy.\n  Unfortunately, our colleagues on the Democratic side do not want to \nvote on that amendment. They wanted to have other amendments. They \nwanted amendments to increase agricultural emergency spending. Senator \nBaucus had that amendment. We defeated that amendment sometime last \nweek. It was offered again. Senator Kyl offered a second-degree \namendment in addition to that to provide death tax repeal, permanent \nrepeal. To me, that would have been positive for agriculture.\n  Unfortunately, our colleagues on the Democratic side did not want to \nvote on that amendment. They have not allowed a vote on the amendment. \nIn other words, they are saying: We will vote on what we think is \nstimulative, but we don't want you to vote on your amendments. We will \nvote on spending increases.\n  They had an amendment to increase the Medicaid Federal share. I don't \nknow what is stimulative about that, but it certainly increases Federal \nGovernment costs. Medicaid is a Federal-State program, presumably the \nidea of 50/50. But in many cases the Federal ratio is 70 percent, not \n50 percent, and this amendment would increase the Federal ratio by \nanother 3 percent and cost $10 billion for a couple years and in all \nlikelihood be extended indefinitely. It would have cost $50 billion or \n$60 billion. That was an amendment by our colleagues on the Democratic \nside: Increase the Federal share on Medicaid, and instead of 70 \npercent, make it 73 percent; or 60 percent, make it 63 percent. The \nState would pay the balance.\n  Then they had an amendment to increase unemployment compensation, \nincluding temporary workers, and make that an entitlement. Maybe my \ndaughter, who works part-time while she is a college student, if she \nchanges jobs, could draw unemployment compensation. She might be \nappreciative, but that is an enormously expensive amendment. Every \nState has determined unemployment eligibility. Now we will say: States, \nyou do or we will do it for you. And decide to do temporary workers. \nSome States do temporary workers; most States do not. Most States do \nnot for a reason. But, no, we will do that.\n  I look at the amendments of our colleagues on the Democratic side, \nand I don't see anything stimulative. I see a lot of spending--\nagriculture, Medicaid, unemployment compensation, extend and expand \nentitlement programs, and do nothing to stimulate the economy, do \nnothing that would help create jobs.\n\n  On the other hand, on the Republican side we have more amendments \nthat we want to offer to stimulate the economy. I mentioned Senator \nKyl's amendment. Senator Domenici has an amendment calling for a \npayroll tax holiday. Some Democrats say they like it. They are \ncosponsors of it. Guess what. We are not going to get a vote on it. The \namendment offered by Senator Domenici might be a substitute for the \nentire package, it may well have a majority vote, but we are not going \nto get a vote on it. Why? Because cloture was filed. If we invoke \ncloture, this amendment falls.\n  There is an amendment Senator Allard has making R tax credits \npermanent to encourage investment in research and development. We are \nnot going to get a vote on it.\n  There is a bipartisan package on which many Senators have worked. I \nmentioned earlier that Senator Breaux and Senator Collins and Senator \nSnowe and Senator Grassley--several Senators worked on it, Democrats \nand Republicans. We are not going to get a vote on it, even though we \nhad a majority vote in December, probably still have a majority vote \nfor it, the President said he would sign it, it would become law, could \nbecome law this week if we pass the bill the House passed.\n  The House has actually passed a couple of stimulus packages. Let's \npass the last one and let it become law.\n  No, some people do not want to pass that one either. So we are not \neven going to get a vote on it.\n  I think it is very disappointing, to use a word my colleague from \nSouth Dakota uses on occasion, to see that cloture was being called up \nso early. I can just see the plan. We will have a cloture vote on the \nDaschle underlying bill. It will not pass. It should not pass. I \ncertainly hope it does not pass because I do not think the underlying \nbill is worth passing. And I do not think all these amendments I \nmentioned which would have a stimulative impact on our economy should \nbe closed out. I do not think this side of the aisle should be \nforeclosed from offering amendments.\n  We did not object to having an amendment on the emergency agriculture \nbill of Senator Baucus--emergency spending. It was not really relevant \nto the underlying bill, but we did it. We made a point of order. They \ncan make a point of order on Senator Kyl's amendment.\n  I would much prefer to have an up-or-down vote but no, ``We don't \nwant to vote on his amendment, we don't want to vote on Senator \nDomenici's amendment; we don't want a vote on the bipartisan stimulus \npackage. No, we are going to file cloture and pull the whole bill down. \nIf we don't get cloture, we are still going to pull the bill down. \nWe'll give a cloture vote on the bipartisan substitute''--because we \nfiled cloture on it just so we can get a vote. The idea being, we will \nvote on cloture twice, and if we don't get cloture, we will just pull \nthe bill down.\n  I hope that is not the case.\n  I think our economy needs a little shot in the arm. It is not in \ngreat shape. We have a lot of people who are still hurting, and if we \ncould craft a positive stimulus bill that would create jobs, we would \ndo something positive for America.\n  I think what we have instead, we have the majority leader and \nunfortunately most Democrats--we will find\n\n[[Page S341]]\n\nout tomorrow--who are going to say we want to have our own little \npackage. We want to have it our way. We can't consider other \namendments. We will have it our way or we will pull the bill down.\n  Tomorrow, when we vote on this--and I expect we will be voting on it \nat maybe 10:30 or 11:30 tomorrow--I urge our colleagues to vote no on \nthe cloture vote and let us consider these amendments.\n  We are more than willing on this side to have a limitation on \namendments. For anybody on the other side of the aisle to say \nRepublicans are filibustering this bill is totally false. People are \nentitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own \nfacts. We are willing to consider these amendments. We are willing to \nenter into time limits on these amendments. We are willing to pass this \nbill tomorrow night--tomorrow night. We are willing to finish this \npackage. Let's just allow our colleagues to have votes on their \namendments that they believe would stimulate the economy, and we will \nvote on amendments, as our Democrat friends have offered, to spend more \nmoney.\n  Let's vote on both. Let's vote on these amendments. Let's see how the \nvotes come out and let's pass a bill. Let's pass a bill that would help \nthe economy. Let's pass a bill that would create jobs. I hope we will.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the cloture vote. Let's allow \nthese amendments to have their fair day in the Senate. People worked \nhard on these amendments. They may well do some good.\n  I looked at several of these that were offered on the Republican \nside, some of which--several of which have Democrat cosponsors--that I \nthink could help the economy. So I would love for our colleagues to get \na chance to vote on these amendments.\n  We will be very cooperative working with the majority leader and \nothers on the Democrat side to limit amendments, to try to see if we \ncannot get a stimulus bill that would actually help the economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S341-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S341-S342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, earlier today I spoke with praise for the \nway in which the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Democratic \nLeader have been handling judicial nominations in the past few weeks. \nOne of the reasons I did so was that I detected, in a speech 11 days \nago, the possibility that the Judiciary Committee may be headed in a \nnew direction as we begin a new Session of Congress. I sensed a chance \nthat, after eight months of Democratic control, the leaders were \ngrowing beyond their previous role of critics focused on the past. I \nperceived that the leaders might now understand the value of looking \nforward through the windshield rather than steering a course with their \neyes glued to the rear-view mirror.\n  I have not given up this hope; it is still early enough to start this \nSession out on the right foot. But I now have some reason to question \nmy optimism. Comments were made here on the floor earlier today that \nhave put me in the position, once again, of having to set the record \nstraight on a number of events that occurred between 84 and 14 months \nago. I do not regard this recurring debate over the past as germane to \nthe present or important to our course for the future. Nevertheless, I \nam compelled to make sure that the historical record is correct.\n  One comment that particularly surprised me was the attempt to blame \nthe previous, Republican-controlled Senate for the creation of the \ncurrent number of judicial vacancies. The fact is that the Republican \nSenate confirmed essentially the same number of judges for President \nClinton, 377, as the Republican Senate did for President Reagan, 382, \nso there is simply no basis for the Democrat's allegations. \nInterestingly, the Democrats who controlled the Senate during the first \nPresident Bush's Administration left more judicial vacancies and \nallowed more nominees to go without Senate action when the first \nPresident Bush left office than the Republicans did when President \nClinton left office. The bottom line is that, at the close of the 106th \nCongress, there were only 67 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. In the \nspace of one Democratic-controlled congressional session, that number \nhad shot up to nearly 100.\n  How did this happen? The answer is simple: The pace of hearings and \nconfirmations under the Democratic-controlled Senate last year did not \nkeep up with the pace of vacancies. We were moving so slowly that we \nwere actually falling behind. When our friends across the aisle took \ncontrol of the Senate on June 5 of last year, President Bush had \nalready sent 18 judicial nominees to the Senate. All told for the year, \nPresident Bush nominated 66 highly qualified individuals to fill \nvacancies in the federal judiciary. But rather than focusing on the \nwork ahead, our Democratic colleagues looked back at the year 1993 to \nmimic the old route taken then. After delaying their first nominations \nhearing by over a month, during which time they held numerous hearings \non other matters, our Democratic colleagues confirmed precisely 28 \njudges, exactly one more federal judge than President Clinton saw \nconfirmed during his first year in office. This transparent tit-for-tat \nexchange of confirmations is rear-view-mirror driving at its worst.\n  In the first 4 months of Democratic control of the Senate last year, \nonly 6 federal judges were confirmed. At several hearings, the \nJudiciary Committee considered only one or two judges at a time. The \nCommittee voted on only 6 of 29 Circuit Court nominees in 2001, a rate \nof 21 percent, leaving 23 of them without any action at all. Eight of \nthe first eleven judges that President Bush nominated on May 9 of last \nyear have still not even had a hearing. In contrast, there were only 2 \nCircuit Court nominees at the end of President Clinton's first year \nleft in Committee.\n  If the Democratic leaders can take their eyes off the rear-view-\nmirror and take a look at what is ahead, they will see the rather \nobvious need to speed up the pace of hearings and votes on judicial \nnominees. We have lots of work to do. There are 98 vacancies in the \nfederal judiciary, a vacancy rate of nearly 12 percent. We have 58 \nnominees pending in the Senate. Twenty-three of those nominees are \nslated to fill positions which have been declared judicial emergencies \nby the Administrative Office of the Courts. Of those, 13 are court of \nappeals nominees. Particularly important are those areas with a high \nconcentration of judicial emergencies, such as the 4th Circuit Court of \nAppeals with 2 nominees; 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, where 2 nominees \nare pending; the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals with 7 nominees pending; \nand the District of Arizona, where 2 nominees are pending. Let's roll \nup our sleeves and get to work on these.\n\n  Another issue that was raised today was the role of the White House \nin this process. The fact is that the Bush administration has worked \nmore closely with home State senators than any other administration \nsince I have been in the Senate. Now, I know there were a couple of \ninstances very early last year where communication could have been \nbetter, but that is bound to happen with a brand new administration. \nSince that time, the Bush White House has been making unusually great \nefforts to consult with home State senators prior to making \nnominations. I do not know exactly from where the complaints, if any, \nare coming, but I have a suspicion that some of my colleagues are \nforgetting the difference between the President's power to make \nnominations, and the Senate's role to provide advice and consent. Some \nSenators may wish they could exercise the President's constitutional \nrole instead of their own, but there is no reason to blame the White \nHouse for sticking with the allocation of power established by the \nFramers. If there are any real problems, I invite my colleagues to let \nme know about them, and I pledge to do my utmost to assist in working \nthrough them.\n  Today's comments concerning the need for more ``consensus nominees'' \nfrom the White House are ironic in light of my colleague's discussion \nof several specific Clinton nominees for the districts in Texas. My \ncolleague rhetorically asked why those nominees did not get a hearing, \nbut he knows full well that at least a couple of the situations he \nmentioned were caused by serious problems created by the Clinton \nAdministration's lack of consultation with, and failure to obtain the \nsupport of, home State senators.\n\n[[Page S342]]\n\n  In contrast, President Bush's nominees, with only a couple of early \nexceptions, as I noted, enjoy the full support of both home State \nsenators. We should hold hearings and votes on those without delay. Let \nme mention one in particular that means a great deal to me: Michael \nMcConnell, a nominee for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Professor McConnell is a consensus pick not only between his home \nState Senators but also among many others who know his scholarship, his \ntemperament, and his commitment to the rule of law. His nomination has \nbeen applauded by legal scholars and lawyers from across the political \nspectrum. Professors Laurence Tribe, Charles Fried, Cass Sunstein, \nAkhil Amar, Larry Lessig, Sanford Levinson, Douglas Laycock, and Dean \nJohn Sexton are among those who have praised McConnell's integrity, \nability, and fairminded approach to legal issues. He enjoys broad \nsupport among the bar and the academy in his home State of Utah.\n  On a broader level, McConnell is regarded as fairminded and \nnonpartisan. He publicly opposed the impeachment of President Clinton, \nand wrote in support of the position taken by Justices Souter and \nBreyer in Bush v. Gore. He was part of the volunteer legal team that \nsuccessfully defended Chicago Mayor Harold Washington, the city's first \nAfrican American mayor, in a dispute with the Board of Aldermen. \nMcConnell wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal suggesting the \nnomination of Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Court, and supported a \nnumber of Clinton judicial nominations. These facts are among the \nreasons that McConnell's appointment has been praised by a number of \nformer Clinton administration officials, including Acting Solicitor \nGeneral Walter Dellinger, Deputy White House Counsel William Marshall, \nDomestic Policy Advisors Bill Galston and Elena Kagan, and Associate \nAttorney General John Schmidt.\n  Professor McConnell is best known in academic circles for his \nscholarship in the area of Free Exercise. He has generally sided with \nthe ``liberal'' wing of the Supreme Court on this issue, arguing for a \nvigorous protection for the rights of religious minorities. In one \nopinion, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia described McConnell as \n``the most prominent scholarly critic'' of Scalia's more limited view \nof Free Exercise rights. In the related area of Establishment of \nReligion, McConnell has argued that religious perspectives should be \ngiven equal--but not favored--treatment in the public sphere. Thus, he \nhas testified against a School Prayer amendment, while supporting the \nrights of religious citizens and groups to receive access to public \nresources on an equal basis. This record indicates a thoughtful and \nprincipled approach that is worthy of great respect from all sides. \nProfessor McConnell will be a careful, thoughtful and unquestionably \nfair judge when he is confirmed to the Tenth Circuit. We should have \nvoted to confirm him last summer. There is certainly no reason to put \noff his hearing any further.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I am optimistic that the \ncommittee will continue the good start we have made in the past 2 \nweeks. There is no reason not to. We have plenty of work ahead of us. \nFor those who look to the past for guidance, note that in 1994, the \nsecond year of President Clinton's first term, the Senate confirmed 100 \njudicial nominees. I am confident that Republicans and Democrats can \nwork together to achieve, or even hopefully exceed, 100 confirmations \nin 2002--President Bush's second year in office. I look forward to \nworking together with Chairman Leahy and my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to accomplish this goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S342-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE DISASTER IN NIGERIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise to express my concern regarding \nrecent events in Nigeria. On January 27, an armory of the Nigerian \nmilitary located within the massive city of Lagos erupted in a series \nof explosions, prompting desperate residents to flee the area. Reports \nindicate that more than 1,000 Nigerians were killed that night, many \ntrampled to death or drowned in nearby canals as they tried to escape \nthe disaster. Many of those who escaped with their lives lost their \npossessions and remain displaced. Disturbingly, reports quickly \nsurfaced suggesting that child traffickers attempted to take advantage \nof the tragedy, raising questions about the fate of the missing. The \nentire episode, is horrifying, and my deepest sympathies go out to the \nfamilies of the area.\n  But, I fear that this incident, whatever its precise cause, is only \none more in a series of horrors visited on the Nigerian people. My \ncolleagues have undoubtedly read about soaring levels of communal \nviolence in this critically important African state. Such violence now \ngrips parts of Lagos, adding to the sense of insecurity and fear in a \ncity that just suffered such a terrible series of blasts. Yet sadly, \nreports of fighting in Lagos sound all too familiar, given recent \nhistory in Jos, in Kano, in Nasarawa, in Bauchi, and in the delta \nregion.\n  In some cases, the government failed to act. For example, Human \nRights Watch recently released a report indicating that the Nigerian \nauthorities could have done more to prevent the massacres in Jos in \nSeptember, where as many as a thousand Nigerians may have been killed \nin one week.\n  Yet in other cases, security forces have turned on civilians, as is \nalleged to have happened in Benue in October. Consistent and reliable \nreports indicated that many unarmed civilians were killed and a great \ndeal of private property destroyed when members of the armed forces \nsought revenge for the murder of their fellow soldiers by a local \nmilitia group. The facts surrounding this incident are still in \ndispute, but coming in the wake of the 1999 incident in Odi, where the \nNigerian military massacred hundreds of civilians, this incident calls \ninto question the wisdom of continued engagement with the Nigerian \nmilitary. If that force is truly committed to reform, those responsible \nfor killing civilians in Benue must be held accountable for their \nactions.\n  In addition, the manner in which sharia, or Islamic law, is being \nimplemented in parts of northern Nigeria calls into question the \ncountry's commitment to fundamental and universal human rights. The \ncase, recently highlighted by the New York Times, of a woman sentenced \nto be stoned to death after having been found guilty of adultery, \nraises a number of important questions. In her case, her pregnancy was \nevidence of her guilt in the eyes of the court, although the alleged \nfather of the baby was set free after the same court concluded it \nlacked sufficient evidence to prosecute him. The relationship between \nthe court's decision, the sentence, and the protections contained in \nNigeria's constitution is utterly unclear. The Nigerian government's \nsilence on these pressing issues is baffling.\n  It is not my intention to encourage pessimism about Africa in this \nbody. And no one wants Nigeria's democracy to succeed more than I do. \nBut all is not well in Nigeria, and we do our Nigerian partners no \nfavors when we pretend that the situation is better than it is. The \nNigerian people want what all people want--a chance to improve their \nlives and the lives of their children. It is no surprise that many are \ndissatisfied, as it is hard to seize opportunities in a context of \nviolence and corruption. Elections were an important first step in \nNigeria's transition from the dark days of military rule. But for too \nmany Nigerians, the days are still quite dark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S342-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S342-S343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Madam President, I rise today to honor an individual for \nhis extraordinary leadership for family farmers and ranchers in South \nDakota and across the entire country. Mr. Leland Swenson has been the \npresident of the National Farmers Union (NFU) for the past fourteen \nyears, and the president of the South Dakota Farmers Union (SDFU) for 7 \nyears prior to that. For the past 20 years, Lee has been the leading \nvoice for family farm agriculture in the country. During his tenure in \nthese positions, Lee has provided immeasurable service, support, and \nleadership for family farmers and ranchers in efforts to maintain \nprosperity of rural communities.\n  A native of Minnesota, Lee was recruited to begin his career with \nSouth Dakota Farmers Union in 1971 as the Secretary/Treasurer. Lee was \na very successful organizer, resulting in an increase in membership for \n6 out of his 8 years at this post. Because of his talent, initiative, \nand ingenuity, Lee joined the National Farmers Union headquarters in \nDenver, CO as Field Services Coordinator. Lee's dedication to building \na membership base and maintaining that base is something to be admired. \nReturning to South Dakota, Lee was elected the president of SDFU in \n1981. During his swearing in ceremony, Mr. Swenson pledged to \n``preserve, protect and defend the family farm system of agriculture.'' \nLee has fulfilled that promise time and time again.\n  While farm prices were dropping and interest rates were rising in the \n1980's, Lee rose to the challenge of preserving the family farm in his \nrole as president. In response to a veto of an emergency credit bill by \nPresident Reagan in 1985, Lee organized over 8,000 farmers and ranchers \nto gather for a ``Farm Alliance Rally'' in Pierre, SD. This was the \nsecond largest farm rally ever to be held at the state capital. Two \nother organizations were involved in gathering attendants, resulting in \n25 Jackrabbit Line busses bringing the farmers and ranchers to South \nDakota's capital city. The overwhelming number of constituents rallying \ncould not be ignored by the state legislators, therefore the state \nlegislature appropriated funds to send the 105 member body plus the \ngovernor to Washington, DC to lobby Congress for the restructuring of \nfarm and ranch debt at serviceable interest rates. This first rally \nserved as a stepping stone for Lee to organize another rural rally 15 \nyears later in Washington. In 2000, bus loads of farmers, ranchers, \nchurch leaders, labor organizations, and rural community leaders \ngathered at the nation's capital to rally for the sustainability of \nrural America. Without the experience, dedication, or conviction of Lee \nSwenson this rally would not have been a success.\n  For the last 100 years, the primary goal of National Farmers Union \nhas been to sustain and strengthen family farm and ranch agriculture. \nThe key to this goal has been Farmers Union's grassroots structure in \nwhich policy positions are initiated locally. National Farmers Union \nbelieves that good opportunities in production agriculture are the \nfoundation of strong farm and ranch families and that strong farm and \nranch families are the basis for thriving rural communities. In order \nfor these goals and values to be carried out consistently, a well-\nrespected, talented, and dedicated leader is vital. That is exactly \nwhat Lee Swenson provided to the organization.\n  Lee Swenson has achieved a number of other accomplishments during his \ntenure with the National Farmers Union. Bringing the states of Alaska, \nCalifornia, and Missouri into the organization, organizing the single \nlargest farm rally in Washington, DC and expanding the government \nrelations, communications and education departments of the NFU.\n  As National Farmers Union celebrates their 100th anniversary this \nyear, and Lee steps down from his post as president, the delegation \nbody can look back on prior accomplishments and be nothing but proud. \nProud of their organization, proud of their commitment to family \nfarmers and ranchers, and proud of their outgoing leader.\n  Finally, Lee has always been dedicated to family agriculture, and I \nknow he will continue to contribute to not only the state of South \nDakota, but family agriculture across the country. Therefore, I wish \nhim all the best and I will continue to rely upon his valuable insight \non the sustainability of rural America. On behalf of the people of \nSouth Dakota, I want to thank Lee for being a true public servant who \nhas helped improve the quality of life for thousands of rural \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S343-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        AMERICAN ASSOCIATION ON MENTAL RETARDATION AWARD WINNERS\n\n Mr. DURBIN.

TOWNS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today I recognize the retirement \nof a dedicated public servant and to thank her for her contributions to \nour Nation. Since 1998, Eleanor S. Towns has been the Regional Forester \nfor the U.S. Forest Service's Southwest Region located in Albuquerque, \nNM, and in that capacity, has been responsible for the management of 22 \nmillion acres of National Forests in the Southwest.\n  Eleanor Towns brought to her work a rich and diversified educational \nbackground and varied work experiences. Born in Rockford, IL, she \nreceived her undergraduate education at the University of Illinois, \ngraduating in 1965 with an A.B. in communications. She received her \nmaster's in guidance & counseling from the University of New Mexico in \n1968, and her juris doctor from the University of Denver College of Law \nin 1982. She worked with the Bureau of Land Management before \ntransferring to the Forest Service in 1978 as Director of Civil Rights \nin the Rocky Mountain Regional Office in Denver. She held progressively \nmore responsible positions before becoming the Rocky Mountain Region's \nDirector of Lands, Water, Soils and Minerals in 1994. In 1995, she was \nadmitted to the Federal Senior Executive Service and assumed the \nposition of Forest Service Director of Lands in Washington. In April \n1998, she was promoted to Regional Forester for the Southwest Region.\n  My office has had the pleasure of working with Eleanor Towns since \nher arrival at regional headquarters in Albuquerque. Despite \ndeteriorating facilities when she first arrived, a situation that has \nsince been rectified, she remained attentive to the multiple issues\n\n[[Page S344]]\n\nof concern to New Mexico and the Forest Service. Whatever the complex \nand contentious area of public land stewardship, I have found her to be \nprofessional, responsive and decisive. For example, she gave our office \ntremendous help during the creation of the Valles Caldera National \nPreserve and the development of what we called the ``Happy Forests'' \nlegislation.\n  Throughout her Federal career, Eleanor Towns was an effective manager \nof critically important program areas, and was often called upon to \ntackle some of the more difficult problems of the Department of \nAgriculture and the Forest Service, including western water rights and \nemployee discrimination cases. Her greatest assets have been her \ninterpersonal skills.

Madam President, I would like to take a moment to \nreflect on the tremendous accomplishments of Elizabeth Brown Calleton \nduring her tenure at Planned Parenthood of Pasadena.\n  During the past 40 years, Ms. Calleton has made a major contribution \nto Planned Parenthood of Pasadena's 69-year history, ultimately serving \nas its President and CEO. A women's health care advocate, she \nestablished Planned Parenthood Community Orientation Luncheons and a \ncommunity-wide research network to provide women with access to health \ncare. Ms. Calleton served on the committee that created the North West \nCommunity Healthcare Alliance Program, a program geared to the needs of \nlow-income, uninsured individuals. The Peer Educator Program more than \ndoubled in size during Ms. Calleton's tenure.\n  In addition to her extraordinary work at Planned Parenthood, Ms. \nCalleton has served with a variety of community organizations including \nthe League of Women Voters, the Pasadena Commission on the Status of \nWomen and Women at Work. Awards she has received from the Magna Carta \nBusiness and Professional Women and the Young Women's Christian \nAssociation are a testament to her great dedication.\n  ``Celebrating the Past, Looking Towards the Future'' pays a fine \ntribute to Ms. Calleton's legacy. Ms. Calleton has much to celebrate \nand, I know, looks forward to new challenges in her future endeavors. \nHer work will serve the community for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S344-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNITION OF SUCCESS BY 6 PARTNERSHIP\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, it is with great pleasure and \nhonor that I rise today to duly recognize the Success By 6 Partnership \ninitiative for its tireless work in the area of early childhood \ndevelopment for the community of Gainesway in Lexington, KY.\n  Less than a year ago, a unique partnership was formed between the \nUnited Way of the Bluegrass and LexLinc, which aimed to address the \nmany educational and social needs of Kentucky children from birth to \nage 6. The Success By 6 initiative attempts to ready parents and \nchildren for school by the time the schools are ready for them by \nfocusing on communication as the primary tool for problem solving. This \ninitiative, adopted in more than 300 communities nationwide, does a \nphenomenal job of bringing together area leaders and families in order \nto properly identify the needs of parent, child, and teacher. Success \nBy 6 has already helped organize a citywide safety seat giveaway \nprogram in Gainesway and has sparked awareness in the community of the \nimportance of early childhood learning.\n  On January 8, 2002, President George W. Bush signed into law the No \nChild Left Behind Act, and I think initiatives such as this will work \nhand-in-hand with this Act to insure families that no child will be \nleft without access to an education.\n  I would like to personally thank all of the participants and \norganizers of the Success By 6 initiative for their strong and diligent \ncommitment to the future generations of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. \nEducation can never be taken serious enough by either members of \nCongress or area leaders, and I sincerely applaud the progressive steps \ntaken by this initiative program.\n  I believe that soon communities throughout Kentucky will see not only \nthe educational advantages but also the social benefits of this program \nand begin measures to work this initiative into their educational \nagendas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S344-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THOMAS STEPHEN COOK\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, today I rise to recognize and \nhonor the life of Thomas Stephen Cook of West Enosburg, VT, who died \nWednesday, November 21, after a 4-year fight with leukemia.\n  Thomas, who was only 12, inspired those who witnessed his strength \nand courage as he battled against his sickness. I have known Thomas \nsince his birth, and as his cousin, I can honestly say he was one of \nthe most extraordinary young people I've had the pleasure to meet. In \nApril, as the 2001 Children's Miracle Network Champion from Vermont, \nThomas visited my Washington office. He was on his way to meet \nPresident Bush, before heading to Walt Disney World to participate in \nthe national Children's Miracle Network telethon. When you met Thomas, \nyou could see that, even though he was young, he had been through a \nlot. More than that, Thomas was tough. Only his positive and optimistic \nattitude towards life was greater than his determination to fight his \ndisease.\n  Thomas took his responsibilities with the Children's Miracle Network \nvery seriously. He was also a fan of University of Vermont basketball. \nFor four seasons, Thomas served the Catamounts as the ball boy for the \nmen's basketball team. A column from the Burlington Free Press by \nPatrick Garrity about Thomas' role and influence on the team says:\n\n       Thomas Cook would have been pleased with the effort.\n       He would have loved T.J. Sorrentine's slashing drives. He \n     would have loved Grant Anderson's blue-collar play \n     underneath. He would have loved David Hehn's baseline-to-\n     baseline energy and Trevor Gaines' work on the offensive \n     boards.\n       Thomas wasn't at Patrick Gymnasium to see the University of \n     Vermont men's basketball team's near-upset of Cleveland State \n     on Saturday. He lost a long fight with leukemia last week. He \n     died at age 12.\n       His customary position for Catamounts home games was down \n     the team's bench near the baseline, where he served the past \n     four seasons as a ball boy. As he battled his disease and \n     endured the cruel roller coaster of hope and despair the \n     disease became, Thomas fought alongside the Cats, too.\n       He came to the sidelines four years ago soon after UVM \n     coach Tom Brennan learned of the little boy from Enosburg \n     Falls who had been diagnosed with a disease that kills 22,000 \n     Americans each year. What began with a hospital visit from \n     then-freshman guard Tony Orciari blossomed into a brotherhood \n     between the two that seeped into the hearts of every player \n     on the team.\n       ``He was a lot stronger than all of us,'' said senior \n     captain Corry McLaughlin. ``Our lives are cake compared to \n     what his was. To see him battling every day, to come out here \n     and be with us, let alone to make it through every day, he \n     was just a really strong kid.\n       ``From his attitude, you would have never known he was \n     sick. He was happy every day, jovial and upbeat.''\n       Here's hoping the next one goes in. For Thomas.\n\n  Thomas will be fondly remembered by everyone who was fortunate to \nhave known him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S344-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S344-S347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TESTIMONY OF RICHARD J. SANTOS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask that testimony inserted \ninto the Budget Committee record from Richard J. Santos, the National \nCommander of the American Legion, be printed in the Record.\n  The testimony follows.\n\n[[Page S345]]\n\n    Written Statement of Richard J. Santos, National Commander, the \nAmerican Legion to the Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate Concerning \n              the Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 Budget Resolution\n\n       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Budget Committee: The \n     American Legion welcomes the opportunity to present its views \n     on the FY 2003 Budget Resolution. As you and your colleagues \n     consider the President's recent budget request, I share the \n     views of the nation's largest wartime veterans' service \n     organization.\n       The American Legion's reputation as an advocate for \n     maintaining a strong national defense is well documented, \n     dating back to its very beginning in 1919 in Paris, France. \n     As veterans of the War to End All Wars, The American Legion \n     founders established an organization:\n       To uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States \n     of America;\n       To maintain law and order;\n       To foster and perpetuate a one-hundred percent Americanism;\n       To preserve the memories and incidents of our associations \n     in the Great Wars;\n       To inculcate a sense of individual obligation to the \n     community, state, and nation;\n       To combat autocracy of both the classes and the masses;\n       To make right the master of might;\n       To promote peace and good will on earth;\n       To safeguard and transmit to posterity the principles of \n     justice, freedom and democracy;\n       To consecrate and sanctify our comradeship by our devotion \n     to mutual helpfulness.\n       The only common bond of all Legionnaires is honorable \n     military service during a period of armed conflict. \n     Legionnaires are men and women that belong to an organization \n     based upon comradeship. This group of veterans is devoted to \n     fair and equitable treatment of their fellow veterans, \n     especially the service-connected disabled. Another group of \n     veterans honored by The American Legion is those fallen \n     comrades that are killed in action (KIA), missing in \n     action (MIA), or those held as prisoner of war (POW). \n     These service members often leave spouses and children \n     behind. For those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice for \n     freedom, The American Legion will honor their service by \n     making sure this nation fulfills its promises to their \n     survivors. For those listed as MIA or POW, The American \n     Legion will continue to demand the fullest possible \n     accounting of each and every comrade.\n\n\n                           NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n       The deep-rooted interest of The American Legion in the \n     security of the nation was born in the hearts and minds of \n     its founders and sustained by its current membership. The \n     bitter experiences of seeing comrades wounded or killed \n     through lack of proper training crystallized the \n     determination of Legionnaires to fight for a strong, \n     competent defense establishment capable of protecting the \n     sovereignty of the United States. The tragic events of World \n     War I, largely precipitated by unprepared military, were \n     still vivid in the minds of combat veterans that founded The \n     American Legion. After 22 years of repeated warnings by The \n     American Legion, Pearl Harbor dramatically illustrated the \n     cost of failed vigilance and complacency.\n       For over 83 years, The American Legion's drumbeat on \n     defense issues has remained constant. With the evolution of \n     space age technology and scientific advancement of \n     conventional and nuclear weapons, The American Legion \n     continues to insist on a well-equipped, fully manned, and a \n     properly trained fighting force to deter aggressors. The \n     events surrounding September 11, 2001 publicly exposed a soft \n     underbelly of America to acts of terrorism, especially the \n     vulnerability to nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) \n     warfare.\n       America's armed forces must be well manned and equipped, \n     not to pursue war, but to preserve the hard-earned peace. The \n     American Legion is fully aware of what can happen when \n     diplomacy and deterrence fail. Many military experts believe \n     that the current national security is based on budgetary \n     concerns rather than real threat levels to America and its \n     allies. As the world's remaining superpower, America's armed \n     forces need to be more fully structured, equipped, and \n     budgeted.\n       Defense budget, military manpower, and force structure are \n     currently improving over the FY 2001 levels. The current \n     operational tempo of active-duty and Reserve and Guard forces \n     remains extremely high and very demanding. The American \n     Legion recommends:\n       Active-duty personnel level should not be less than 1.6 \n     million.\n       The Army must maintain 12 fully manned, equipped, and \n     trained combat divisions.\n       The Navy must maintain 12 aircraft carrier battle groups \n     and a viable strategic transport capability.\n       The Air Force must maintain, at a minimum, 15 fighter \n     wings, a strategic bombing capability, its Intercontinental \n     Ballistic Missile capability and a global strategic transport \n     capability.\n       Deployment of a national missile defense system.\n       The defense budget should equal 3-4 percent of the Gross \n     Domestic Product.\n       The current active-duty personnel level is approximately \n     1.37 million. Military leaders are making up the difference \n     by increasing the operations tempo and by over-utilizing \n     the Reserve components. Currently, American military \n     personnel are deployed to over 140 countries worldwide. \n     Overseas deployments have increased well over 300 percent \n     in the past decade. Many of these personnel continue to \n     come from the Reserve and Guard components.\n       Cuts in force structure cannot be rapidly reconstituted \n     without the costly expenditures of time, money, and human \n     lives. Modernization of weapon systems is vital to properly \n     equipping the armed forces, but are totally ineffective \n     without adequate personnel to effectively operate the state-\n     of-the-arts weaponry. The American Legion strongly recommends \n     adequate funding for modernization of the services. America \n     is losing its technological edge. No American soldier, \n     sailor, airman, or Marine should be ordered into battle with \n     obsolete weapons, supplies, and equipment. America stands to \n     lose its service members on the battlefield and during \n     training exercises due to aging equipment. The current \n     practice of trading off force structures and active-duty \n     personnel levels to recoup modernization resources must be \n     discontinued.\n       The American Legion recommends restoring the force \n     structure to meet the threat level and to increase active-\n     duty personnel levels. Ensuring readiness also requires \n     retaining the peacetime Selective Service System to register \n     young men for possible military service in case of a national \n     emergency. Military history repeatedly demonstrates that it \n     is far better to err on the side of preserving robust forces \n     to protect America's interest than to suffer the consequences \n     of ill preparedness. America needs a more realistic strategy \n     with an appropriate force structure, weaponry, equipment, and \n     active-duty personnel leave to achieve its objectives.\n       A major national security concern is the enhancement of the \n     quality-of-life issues for service members, Reservists, \n     National Guard, military retirees, and their families. During \n     the First Session, President Bush and Congress made marked \n     improvements in an array of quality-of-life issues for \n     military personnel and their families. These efforts are \n     visual enhancements that must be sustained. The cost of \n     freedom is on going, from generation to generation.\n       The President and Congress addressed improvements to the \n     TRICARE system to meet the health care needs of the military \n     beneficiaries; enhanced the Montgomery GI Bill educational \n     benefits; and homelessness throughout the veterans community. \n     For these actions, The American Legion applauds your strong \n     leadership, dedication, and commitment. However, one issue \n     still remains unresolved: the issue of concurrent receipt of \n     full military retirement pay and VA disability compensation \n     without the current dollar-for-dollar offset. The issue of \n     concurrent receipt appeared in the FY 2002 budget resolution \n     and the FY 2002 defense authorization act. Every day, new \n     severely disabled military retirees are joining the ranks of \n     American heroes being required, by law, to forfeit military \n     retirement pay.\n       Recently, 14 soldiers and 2 airmen were awarded Purple \n     Hearts from the War on Terrorism. These newest American \n     heroes would be the latest victims of this injustice should \n     their war wounds result in debilitating medical conditions. \n     During the State of the Union Address, one such future \n     recipient, SFC Ronnie Raikes, was sitting next to the First \n     Lady. Concurrent receipt legislation in both chambers (S. 170 \n     and H.R. 303) has overwhelming support by your colleagues. \n     With the President's proposed $48 billion increase in defense \n     spending, The American Legion believes now is the time to \n     correct this terrible injustice. Enactment of corrective \n     legislative and fully funding concurrent receipt are \n     actions to properly reward heroism and courage under fire.\n       If America is to continue as the world's remaining \n     superpower, it must operate from a position of strength. This \n     strength can only be sustained through meaningful leadership \n     and adequate funding of the armed forces.\n\n\n                         veterans' health care\n\n       The American Legion believes that the primary mission of \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is to meet the health \n     care needs of America's veterans. The American Legion \n     believes that the VA should continue to receive appropriate \n     funding in order to maximize its ability to provide world-\n     class health care to the large number of aging veterans, \n     while still maintaining services to a younger cohort of \n     veterans who are using VA for the first time. The American \n     Legion greatly appreciates the actions of all Members of \n     Congress regarding the increase in VA Medical Care funding \n     for FY 2002. Now, please focus your attention to the \n     increases in FY 2003.\n       Just like the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the VA health \n     care budget requires an annual increase to maintain its \n     existing service level and to fund new mandates. For years, \n     VA managers wee asked to do more with less. The recent \n     funding increase now allows the Veterans Health \n     Administration (VHA) to catch up with the growing demands \n     placed upon the system and repair some of the problems \n     related to long patient waiting times and limitations on \n     access to care.\n       The American Legion felt that the President's budget \n     request last year failed to accurately reflect VA's FY 2002 \n     health care funding needs. VA's projections misrepresented \n     the actual number of veterans seeking care. It appears that \n     the President's budget request was based on a much lower \n     number of patients projection (less than 3 percent) than the \n     actual number of users (closer to 11 percent). Fortunately, \n     Congress added over $300 million to the President's original \n     request; however, VHA is now faced\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\n     with dealing with an inadequate FY 2002 budget. The American \n     Legion believes that close to 5 million veterans will seek \n     care in VHA medical facilities in FY 2003. Last year, The \n     American Legion requested $21.6 billion in FY 2002; however, \n     this year we recommend $23.1 billion for VA medical care.\n       Many factors are driving more veterans to use VHA as their \n     primary health care provider:\n       Many Medicare+Choice health maintenance organizations \n     (HMOs) withdrew from the program;\n       Many HMOs collapsed;\n       VHA has opened community based outpatient clinics;\n       Double-digit increase in health care premiums;\n       The dramatic fluctuations in the national economy make VHA \n     a more cost-effective option for veterans; and\n       VHA's reputation for quality of care and patient safety is \n     attracting new patients.\n       Where comparable data exist, VHA continues to outperform \n     the private sector in all indicators in health promotion and \n     disease prevention. The American Legion adamantly believes \n     VHA is the best health care investment of tax dollars. The \n     average cost per patient treated within VHA is unmatched by \n     any other major health care delivery system, especially with \n     comparable quality of care.\n       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, the reason VHA \n     medical care continues to increase annually is not because of \n     uncontrollable cost increases nor poor cost estimations, but \n     rather because thousands of veterans are voting with their \n     feet. More and more veterans are choosing to use their earned \n     benefit--access to VHA. However, enrollment in VHA is limited \n     to existing discretionary appropriations. The American Legion \n     urges Congress to evaluate several options that would assure \n     every veteran that wants to enroll in VHA can enjoy that \n     earned benefit. The key factor driving the increases in \n     medical care funding requirements has not been uncontrolled \n     cost increases, nor has it been poor cost estimation \n     processes--it has been the unexpected and dramatic increase \n     in demand for care from the VA system.\n       The overall guiding principle for VA must be improved \n     services to veterans, their dependents, and survivors. This \n     will require improving access and timeliness of veterans' \n     health care; increasing quality and timeliness in the benefit \n     claims process; and enhancing access to national and state \n     cemeteries. Specific American Legion objectives for Congress \n     include:\n       Sound VHA funding for long-term strategic planning and \n     program performance measurement,\n       Additional revenue for staff and construction,\n       Medicare subvention,\n       Pilot programs for certain dependents of eligible veterans,\n       VA and DoD sharing,\n       Reduce the claims backlog,\n       Repeal bar to service-connection for tobacco-related \n     illnesses,\n       Increase the rate of beneficiary travel reimbursement, and\n       Allow all third-party reimbursements collected by VA to \n     supplement, rather than offset, the annual Federal \n     discretionary appropriations.\n       The American Legion created the GI Bill of Health as a \n     blueprint for meeting the current and future health care \n     requirements of the nation's veterans and for supplementing \n     VA's annual health care appropriation. The GI Bill of Health, \n     once fully implemented, would expand VHA's patient base and \n     increase its non-appropriated funding through new revenue \n     sources.\n       As VHA continues to re-invent itself, change is not a \n     defining event, but rather a series of small steps. Despite \n     its recent successes, VHA still faces numerous future \n     challenges.\n       The American Legion believes VHA's long-term future must be \n     clearly defined to be responsive to those who have ``borne \n     the battle.'' All individuals, who enter military service, \n     should be assured that there is a health care system \n     dedicated to serving their needs upon leaving the military. \n     That concept is especially important to disabled veterans and \n     to retired service members. The GI Bill of Health would \n     ensure that all honorably discharged veterans would \n     be eligible for VA health care, as they will fall into one \n     of the core entitlement categories and into a health \n     insurance or buy-in category. A unique feature of the GI \n     Bill of Health is that it will also permit certain \n     dependents of veterans to enroll in the VA health care \n     system.\n       The American Legion commends VA for the changes made within \n     VHA over the past few years. These changes include \n     eligibility reform, enrollment, the reorganization of the 172 \n     medical centers into 22 integrated operating units, the \n     elimination of certain fiscal inefficiencies, and the \n     expansion of community based outpatient clinics. In some \n     cases, The American Legion believes VA has gone too far in \n     attempting to improve fiscal efficiency. Veterans should not \n     have to increase their travel time for the benefit of the \n     Department. Rather, VHA needs to improve its cooperation with \n     other Federal, state, and private health care providers to \n     improve the quality and timeliness of care for veterans and \n     their families. The American Legion encourages VHA to \n     continue to provide health care that is the highest quality \n     to all veterans at the most reasonable cost.\n       Two additional significant steps required to re-engineer \n     VHA are Medicare subvention and permitting certain dependents \n     of veterans to utilize the system.\n       Unlike in the private sector, Medicare-eligible veterans \n     cannot use their Medicare benefits in a VHA facility for \n     treatment of nonservice-connected conditions. When Medicare-\n     eligible veterans receive health care treatment for any \n     medical condition in the private sector, the federal \n     government reimburses the health care provider for a portion \n     of that service. When Medicare-eligible veterans receive \n     health care treatment for the same medical conditions \n     (nonservice-connected) within VHA, the federal government \n     will not reimburse VHA for any portion of that service. This \n     equates to a restriction on a veteran's right to access \n     health care of his or her choice and using his or her \n     Medicare benefit. The American Legion believes that Medicare \n     subvention will result in more accessible, quality health \n     care for all Medicare-eligible veterans. Furthermore, \n     Medicare subvention should greatly reduce incidents of fraud, \n     waste, and abuse in billing because it will occur between two \n     Federal agencies with congressional oversight. Today's fiscal \n     realities requires VHA to seek other revenue streams to \n     supplement the growing demand for service and not simply rely \n     on saving more dollars to serve more veterans. The American \n     Legion strongly recommends allowing Medicare subvention for \n     Priority Group 7 Medicare-eligible veterans enrolled in VHA.\n       Allowing certain veterans' dependents access to health care \n     within VHA will also help develop new revenue streams and \n     will ultimately improve recruitment and retention within the \n     armed forces. Service members need to know that their \n     dependents have access to quality health care while serving \n     on active duty. The American Legion believes that VHA can and \n     should play a larger role in the provision of this care to \n     active duty service members. Additionally, when service \n     members leave active duty, this health care coverage should \n     continue. VHA has the capacity and the capability to play a \n     much larger role in the provision of health care to the \n     beneficiaries of DoD health care system.\n       VHA has six strategic goals through the year 2006:\n       Put quality first.\n       Provide easy access to medical knowledge, expertise and \n     care.\n       Enhance, preserve and restore patient function.\n       Exceed customers' expectations.\n       Save more dollars to serve more veterans.\n       Build healthy communities.\n       Unfortunately, nowhere in the list of VHA priorities are \n     the goals of Medicare-subvention, the treatment of veterans' \n     dependents, expanding the non-appropriated funding revenue \n     base, and greater cooperation with the private sector and \n     with DoD health care system.\n\n\n                           Veterans' Benefits\n\n       Given the number of veterans and other claimants who file \n     claims each year and with an annual expenditure of over $25 \n     billion in compensation and pension payments, it is \n     imperative that Congress maintain strong oversight of the \n     operations of Veterans Benefit Administration's (VBA's) \n     Compensation and Pension Service.\n       Over the last several years, the backlog of pending claims \n     and appeals has increased dramatically and now exceeds over \n     660,000 cases. It routinely takes six months to a year or \n     more to process disability compensation claims. In addition, \n     annually, some 60,000 to 70,000 new appeals are initiated. \n     After a wait of over two years for an appeal to reach the \n     Board of Veterans Appeals (BVA or the Board), more than 20 \n     percent will be allowed and more than 22 percent will be sent \n     back to the regional office for further required development \n     and readjudication. Remanded cases may be pending for another \n     year or two, in the regional office before returning to the \n     Board. Sometimes, cases are remanded two and three times \n     because the specified corrective action had not been \n     completed, which adds several more years to the appeal.\n       Unfortunately, there is a pattern of recurring issues, \n     which continue to have a direct and adverse effect on the \n     quality and timeliness of regional office claims \n     adjudication. They relate to budget, staffing, training, \n     quality assurance, accountability, and attitude. These \n     findings confirm our long-held view that quality must be \n     VBA's highest priority. Without guaranteed quality, thousands \n     of claims will continue to process unnecessarily through the \n     system: much of VBA's valuable financial and personnel \n     resources will be wasted; and veterans will not receive the \n     benefits and services they are entitled to and that Congress \n     intended they should have.\n       The American Legion believes VBA is committed to bringing \n     about much needed change to the claims adjudication system \n     with the overall goal of providing quality, timely service to \n     veterans and its other stakeholders. In recent years, VBA's \n     strategic plans have made many promises and we have, in fact, \n     seen the implementation of a variety of programmatic and \n     procedural changes. However, it is obvious that progress \n     toward major improvements in service continues to be slow and \n     that much remains to be done. The overall quality of regional \n     office decision making remains problematic.\n       Secretary Principi has identified many problems and is \n     working diligently to find solutions that will provide \n     improved service to veterans and their families. There are a\n\n[[Page S347]]\n\n     spectrum of ongoing and planned initiatives, such as the Pre-\n     Discharge Examinations, Personnel Information Exchange \n     System (PIES), Electronic Burial Claims, Virtual VBA, \n     Decision Review Officer (DRO) Program, and personal \n     hearing teleconferencing, just to name a few. In addition, \n     VBA has begun implementing the recent recommendations of \n     the Secretary's Claims Processing Task Force focusing on \n     improving the operating efficiency of the process and \n     procedures by which claims are adjudicated. These involve \n     special initiatives to better manage the claims and \n     appeals. There will be an emphasis on better training for \n     the newly hired adjudicators. Performance standards are \n     being implemented that provide for personal and \n     organization accountability. VBA is continuing the \n     development of its information technology program.\n       While we support these much-needed changes, we are \n     concerned that they only indirectly address the core problem \n     of continued poor quality decision making. Without a \n     vigorous, comprehensive quality assurance program, thousands \n     of claims will continue to process needlessly through the \n     regional offices, the Board of Veterans Appeals, and the \n     courts wasting time, effort and taxpayers' money. Veterans \n     have a right to a fair, proper, and timely decision. They \n     should not have to endure financial hardship and delay before \n     receiving the benefits to which they are entitled by law.\n       The workload and budgetary requirements of National \n     Cemetery Administration (NCA) will continue to grow over the \n     next 15-20 years. The death rate of World War II veterans \n     will peak in 2008, but the annual death rate of veterans will \n     not return to 1995 levels under 2020. The death rates of \n     Korean and Vietnam Era veterans will greatly accelerate \n     thereafter. The American Legion continues to fully support \n     the further development of the State Cemetery Grants Program.\n       The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act \n     (Public Law 106-117) requires VA to provide long-term nursing \n     care to veterans rated 70 percent disabled or greater. The \n     new law also requires VA to provide long-term nursing care to \n     all other veterans for service-connected disabilities and to \n     those willing to make a co-payment to offset the cost of \n     care. Further, it requires VA to provide veterans' greater \n     access to alternative community-based long-term care \n     programs. These long-term care provisions will place greater \n     demand on VA and on the State Veterans Home Program for years \n     to come.\n       The American Legion believes that it makes economic sense \n     for VA to look to States governments to help fully implement \n     the provisions of PL 106-117. VA spends on average $225 per \n     day to care for each of their nursing care patients and pays \n     private-sector contract facilities an average per diem of \n     $149 per contract veteran. The national average daily cost of \n     care for a State Veterans Home nursing care resident is about \n     $140. VA reimburses State Veterans Homes a per diem of $40 \n     per nursing care resident. Over the long term, VA saves \n     millions of dollars through the State Veterans Home Program.\n       The American Legion supports the State Veterans Home \n     Program and believes the federal government must provide \n     sufficient construction funding to allow for the expected \n     increase in long-term care veteran patients.\n       On September 11, 2001, I was about to present testimony \n     before a Joint Session of the Veterans' Affairs Committees, \n     when we were directed to evacuate the Cannon House Office \n     Building. Like Americans around the world, I was shocked \n     by the barbaric, terrorist actions taken against innocent \n     airline passengers, those in the World Trade Towers, and \n     those in the Pentagon. My heart swelled with pride as \n     fearless rescue workers, fellow service members, and \n     private citizens rushed to assist the victims, only to \n     experience the heartache as the Twin Towers collapsed \n     turning heroes into victims in a matter of seconds. At \n     that specific moment, the importance of that testimony \n     paled in comparison. The American Legion's efforts, like \n     the rest of America, shifted to what we do best--helping \n     at the community, state, and national level.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       Since I was unable to formally present my testimony, I did \n     submit The American Legion's recommendations for the VA \n     budget for FY 2003 for the record. Today, it is important \n     that I share that information to this Committee:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                             Legion's FY 2003\n               Program                      P.L. 106-377              P.L. 107-73                request\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMedical Care........................  $20.2 billion...........  $21.3 billion..........  $23.1 billion.\nMedical and Prosthetics Research....  350 million.............  371 million............  420 million.\nConstruction:\n    Major...........................  66 million..............  183 million............  310 million.\n    Minor...........................  170 million.............  211 million............  219 million.\nState Veterans' Home................  100 million.............  100 million............  110 million.\nState Veterans' Cemeteries..........  25 million..............  25 million.............  30 million.\nNCA.................................  110 million.............  121 million............  140 million.\nGeneral Administration..............  1 billion...............  1.2 billion............  1.3 billion.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The American Legion believes that the true character of any \n     democracy is best reflected in the way it treats its veterans \n     of the armed forces--the true preservers and defenders of \n     liberty.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, and Members of the Committee, that concludes my written \nstatement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S347-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S347-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/05/senate-section/article/S347-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S347-S348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGES\n\n  The following presidential messages were laid before the Senate, \ntogether with accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were \nreferred as indicated:\n\n       PM-69. A message from the President of the United States, \n     transmitting, pursuant to law, the Economic Report of the \n     President along with the Annual Report of the Council of \n     Economic Advisers for 2002; to the Joint Economic Committee.\n\n                    Economic Report of the President\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Since the summer of 2000, economic growth has been unacceptably slow. \nThis past year the inherited trend of deteriorating growth was fed by \nthe events, the most momentous of which was the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001. The painful upshot has been the first recession in \na decade. This is cause for compassion--and for action.\n  Our first priority was to help those Americans who were hurt most by \nthe recession and the attacks on September 11. In the immediate \naftermath of the attacks, my Administration sought to stabilize our air \ntransportation system to keep Americans flying. Working with the \nCongress, we provided assistance and aid to the affected areas in New \nYork and Virginia. We sought to provide a stronger safety net for \ndisplaced workers, and we will continue these efforts. Our economic \nrecovery plan must be based on creating jobs in the private sector. My \nAdministration has urged the Congress to accelerate tax relief for \nworking Americans to speed economic growth and create jobs.\n  We are engaged in a war against terrorism that places new demands on \nour economy, and we must seek our every opportunity to build an \neconomic foundation that will support this challenge. I am confident \nthat Americans have proved they will rise to meet this challenge.\n  We must have an agenda not only for physical security, but also for \neconomic security. Our strategy builds upon the charter of Americans: \nremoving economic barriers to their success, combining our workers and \ntheir skills with new technologies, and creating an environment where \nentrepreneurs and businesses large and small can grow and create jobs. \nOur vision must extend beyond America, engaging other countries in the \nvirtuous cycle of free trade, raising the potential for global growth, \nand securing the gains from worldwide markets in goods and capital. We \nmust ensure that this effort builds economic bonds that encompass every \nAmerican.\n  America faces a unique moment in history: our Nation is at war, our \nhomeland was attacked, and our economy is in recession. In meeting \nthese great challenges, we must draw strength from the enduring power \nof free markets and a free people. We\n\n[[Page S348]]\n\nmust also look forward and work toward a stronger economy that will \nbuttress the United States against an uncertain world and lift the \nfortunes of others worldwide.\n                                                      George W.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself and Mr. Thurmond):\n  S. 1910. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on certain extruders, \ncastings, TDO Tenders, Transport/winders, and slitters; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, today, I, along with Senator Thurmond, \nintroduce duty suspension legislation designed to permit imports of \nmachinery into the United States duty free. This machinery is not made \nin the United States. Therefore, their importation will not displace \ndomestic sourcing. Moreover, because of the nature of the products at \nissue, they will assist in the creation of additional jobs in the \nUnited States.\n  I believe that this is the most appropriate use of such legislation. \nThe imported product will not displace any that is manufactured in the \nUnited States. Moreover, the imported product will assist in enhancing \nAmerican productive capacity. I am therefore hopeful that this new \ncapacity can be used to supply both domestic and foreign needs and will \nincrease employment in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Cleland):\n  S. 1911. A bill to amend the Community Services block Grant Act to \nreauthorize national and regional programs designed to provide \ninstruction activities for low-income youth; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, every summer since 1968 the National \nYouth Sports Program, NYSP, has enabled thousands of children, ages ten \nto sixteen, the opportunity to develop their athletic, academic and \nleadership skills in a character-building environment. Utilizing both \nprivate and public resources, the NYSP successfully partners with the \nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services, HHS, the U.S. Department of Housing and \nUrban Development, HUD, and 200 institutions of higher learning across \nthe country to provide an enriching summer experience for kids from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds.\n  Each participant in the National Youth Sports Program engages with a \ncaring, dedicated adult volunteer while being exposed to the skills, \ndiscipline, and self-esteem that organized sports provide. Each student \nalso receives academic enrichment in the classroom, instruction on \nhealthy living and drug and alcohol abuse prevention, leadership \ntraining, and a comprehensive medical exam. Collegiate athletes and \nothers from the community volunteer for the five-week program to \nnurture kids and promote their development of body and mind. The \nimprovement of physical fitness through a variety of daily activities \nfrom swimming to soccer is a key component of the program. Using the \nvehicle of high-energy sports, each student is able to learn valuable \nlife lessons. The academic portion of the National Youth Sports Program \nhas evolved since its beginnings to include special enrichment for math \nand science and useful computer training. To encourage life-long health \nand physical fitness, substance abuse prevention training is \nincorporated at several program sites, and every child receives a \nthorough medical exam by a local doctor. Quality medical attention is a \nluxury that many of these children do not otherwise have.\n  President Bush has encouraged our Nation to come together to build \ncommunities of character. The National Youth Sports Program is truly a \nnation-wide community effort. In forty-nine states, the District of \nColumbia, and Puerto Rico, volunteers give their time to help young \npeople strive for their best, develop body and mind, and build strong \ncharacter.\n  In support of the continued success and vision of the National Youth \nSports Program, today I am introducing the K.I.D.S. Act: Keeping \nInspiration and Development Strong. This bill amends the Community \nServices Block Grant Act to reauthorize appropriations for the National \nYouth Sports Program at $20 million for Fiscal Year 2003 and provides \nfor its authorization through Fiscal Year 2008. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in support of this legislation and to make the development of \nour Nation's greatest resource, children, a national priority.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  Their being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1911\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Keep Inspiration and \n     Development Strong Act'' or the ``KIDS Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) since 1968, when the National Youth Sports Program \n     (referred to in this Act as the `Program') began, the Program \n     has provided a character-building environment for low-income \n     children to develop athletic, educational, and leadership \n     skills;\n       (2)(A) the Program utilizes community resources, private \n     funding, and public funding to carry out the Program's goals; \n     and\n       (B) for every $1 in Federal funds appropriated for the \n     Program, the Program receives nearly $3 from private sources, \n     through cash contributions or services provided at Program \n     sites;\n       (3)(A) the continued investment of Federal resources in the \n     Program is in the Nation's best interest, especially given a \n     recent increase in child obesity in the United States; and\n       (B) the Surgeon General's report to the President, \n     published in the fall of 2000 and\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\n     entitled ``Promoting Better Health for Young People Through \n     Physical Activity and Sports'', indicated that child obesity \n     had doubled in the preceding 20 years;\n       (4)(A) the Program enhances the health of children by \n     providing quality medical care; and\n       (B) in 2001, 77,106 medical examinations were administered \n     at Program sites for children who might otherwise not have \n     visited a doctor;\n       (5) the Program encourages educational growth in children \n     by exposing the children to a collegiate atmosphere at an \n     early age and establishing higher education as a natural life \n     goal for the children;\n       (6) the Program is truly a national program, expanding in \n     2001 to college and university campuses in 49 States, the \n     District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; \n     and\n       (7) the Nation can best prepare the children of the United \n     States to embrace their future by encouraging healthy bodies \n     and healthy minds.\n\n     SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION.\n\n       Section 682(g) of the Community Services Block Grant Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 9923(g)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(g) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section \n     $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2003 and such sums as may be \n     necessary for each of fiscal years 2004 through 2008.''.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, the National Youth Sports Program, \nNYSP, is an educational partnership that has worked successfully for 33 \nyears. It provides at-risk children, ages 10-16, a 5-week summer \nprogram offering sports and academic enrichment at U.S. colleges and \nuniversities nationwide. Begun in 1969 as a sports enrichment program, \nthe NYSP now reaches beyond athletics to offer academic instruction, \nsubstance abuse prevention, and character education. Originally offered \nat two higher ed institutions, last year the program served over 73,000 \nparticipants at 196 host colleges and universities in 49 States, the \nDistrict of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. For many of these young people, \nit was their first opportunity to experience a college or university \ncampus from the inside.\n  In order to enhance the educational commitment of the NYSP, selected \nprograms at 123 sites across the Nation now include special emphasis on \nmath and science skills. In addition, NYSP programs serving older \nparticipants, those from ages 13-16, help them enhance their computer \nskills and academic performance through reading and writing activities \nthat offer mentoring opportunities to younger NYSP participants.\n  For over three decades the National Youth Sports Program has been a \nmodel of what a successful collaboration should be. The U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Housing and urban \nDevelopment, HUD, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, which \nprovides a hot, USDA-approved meal to NYSP students each day, and the \nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA, have worked together to \nprovide a wholesome summer experience to over 1.7 million participants \nwho have passed through the program since its inception. And over time, \nlocal medical communities have joined in. In 2000, over 74,300 medical \nexaminations were administered free of charge or at a reduced rate. If \na health problem is found, as is the case in approximately one-third of \nthe examinations, the child is referred for adequate follow-up \ntreatment. During the summer session, children who are injured or \nbecome ill during NYSP activities are covered by health insurance and \ntreated by a certified medical professional.\n  The National Youth Sports Program is a vital and effective investment \nin our youth. This program has successfully leveraged Federal funding \nto secure substantial matching community investments. For every one \ndollar provided by the Federal Government, two dollars are provided by \nparticipating colleges and universities, local public and private \nbusinesses, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National \nYouth Sports Program Fund and other National Governing Bodies of \namateur sport.\n  Today I join my distinguished colleague from Oklahoma, Senator \nInhofe, in introducing legislation to reauthorize the National Youth \nSports Program and to increase its funding authorization to $20 \nmillion. This increase in funding will allow 4,500 additional at-risk \nyouth to participate in this effective program and 15 new program sites \nto serve communities where disadvantaged youth are in need of nurturing \nand support. In addition, a $3 million increase in NYSP funding will \nincrease the number of program sites offering math and science \ninstruction as well as expand the NYSP's highly successful senior \nprogram, which emphasizes and encourages leadership skills and \ncharacter education.\n  The NYSP is a program which, year after year, has provided our \nNation's youth with the opportunity to utilize the best resources our \ncolleges and universities have to offer and to develop the skills \nnecessary to succeed. At a time when President Bush has called for a \nrenewed commitment to national service, the NYSP, with almost 1500 \nvolunteers, is an outstanding example of what community service is all \nabout. For three decades the National Youth Sports Program has provided \na positive and enriching experience and a safe haven for some of this \nNation's most vulnerable youth. This highly effective and successful \nprogram is deserving of Congress's support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon:\n  S. 1912. A bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to \nrequire the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Commerce to \ngive greater weights to scientific or commercia data that is empirical \nor has been field-tested or peer-reviewed, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that, if enacted, could prevent another tragic situation \nlike the farmers and ranchers of the Klamath Basin experienced last \nyear. The Act, the ``Sound Science for Endangered Species \nDecisionmaking Act of 2002,'' would require independent scientific peer \nreview of certain actions taken by the regulatory agencies under the \nEndangered Species Act. In addition, it would require the Secretary of \nthe Interior and the Secretary of Commerce to give greater weight to \nscientific or commercial data that is empirical or has been field-\ntested or peer-reviewed.\n  As many of you may recall, I have come to the floor of the Senate on \nmany occasions over the last year to plead the case of the farmers and \nranchers in the Klamath Basin. Last year, field-level biologists with \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries \nService developed two separate biological opinions on the operation of \nthe Klamath Project, as it related to suckers and coho salmon, \nrespectively.\n  Taken together, these two biological opinions sought to both raise \nthe lake level of Upper Klamath Lake and increase flows in the Klamath \nRiver, at the time the Basin was experiencing a severe drought. On \nApril 6, the Bureau of Reclamation announced that the agency would \ndeliver no water to most of the agricultural lands that had received \nirrigation water from the Federal project for almost one hundred years.\n  I cannot begin to describe for you the human toll that these \nbiological opinions exacted on the farmers and ranchers in the Klamath \nBasin. Suicides and foreclosures have both occurred. Those who still \nhave their farms lost most of their farm income last year, many \ndepleting their life savings to hold onto their land. Ranchers were \nforced to sell off livestock herds. Stable farm worker communities were \ndecimated as families moved to find work.\n  The real tragedy is that none of this had to occur.\n  Just this week, the National Research Council found that key \ndecisions regarding the operation of the federal Klamath Project had no \nclear scientific or technical support. In fact, the Council went so far \nas to say that, ``the committee concludes that there is no substantial \nscientific foundation at this time for changing the operation of the \nKlamath Project to maintain higher water levels in Upper Klamath Lake \nfor the endangered sucker populations or higher minimum flows in the \nKlamath River mainstem for the threatened coho population.''\n  In other words, the two key decisions that deprived farmers of their \nwater were not justified by the science.\n  This situation should never be repeated. Decisions of this magnitude \nunder the Endangered Species Act must be peer reviewed, and some \nstandard for the science used in these decisions must be established.\n  I was in Klamath Falls the day after the decision was made to cut off \nwater\n\n[[Page S351]]\n\nto the farmers. I will never forget the anguish on the faces of the \npeople I met with that day. Many were World War II veterans who \nreceived homesteads in this Basin after the war.\n  Our constituents deserve better from their government. They will get \nit if this bill is enacted. I urge my colleagues to join me in \ncosponsoring this bill. I've submitted for the Record an editorial from \ntoday's Oregonian newspaper that describes this situation, and \nexpresses support for the House companion bill. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Victory for Klamath Farmers\n\nScientists find no basis for decision to withhold water from farms for \n                threatened fish during historic drought\n\n       Klamath Basin farmers insisted throughout last year's \n     bitter drought and intense environmental battle that the \n     government had no good reason to hold back their irrigation \n     water for federally protected fish.\n       Now it seems they were right. A panel of top scientists \n     convened by the National Academy of Sciences has concluded in \n     an interim report that there was ``no sound scientific \n     basis'' for withholding irrigation water from more than 1,000 \n     farmers last summer.\n       The report by the independent panel of 12 scientists \n     changes dramatically the national debate over the Klamath \n     Basin. Suddenly, the farmers are on the high ground, having \n     endured a summer of emotional stress and financial loss due \n     to the federal government's decision to keep extra water in \n     Klamath Lake for endangered suckers and in the Klamath River \n     for threatened coho salmon.\n       The scientists said there is no evidence that to protect \n     the suckers it was necessary to hold back irrigation water \n     and keep the level of Klamath Lake relatively high. Further, \n     they said a second decision to send warm lake water \n     downriver, rather than to irrigators, may have actually \n     harmed coho by increasing the river's temperature.\n       These findings aren't a green light to open wide the \n     irrigation headgates, in good water years and bad ones. \n     However, President George W. Bush vowed in an appearance in \n     Portland last month that he would get more water to farmers--\n     and now he's got a stronger hand to do so.\n       The scientists suggested that in the short term that lake \n     and river levels be held to standards in place from 1990 to \n     1999. They also emphasized that the U.S. Bureau of \n     Reclamation, which recently proposed a farmer-first, fish-\n     and-wildlife-second water plan for the Klamath Basin, should \n     not draw down the lake and river below levels of the last \n     decade.\n       Now the burden of recovering fish shifts from the farmers \n     to where it really belongs--to a broad effort to improve fish \n     habitat and water quality throughout the Klamath Basin, \n     restore wetlands that naturally filter the water and install \n     screens to protect fish from getting sucked into canals.\n       The report also should help persuade Congress to approve \n     pending bills to fund Klamath projects and provide more \n     relief to farmers. Too, it may provide impetus for a bill \n     proposed by Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., to require independent \n     scientific review of all government decisions to protect \n     endangered species.\n       The federal biologist who ordered the withholding of \n     Klamath water said last summer they were required by law to \n     err on the side of imperiled species. While that's true, what \n     happened in the Klamath last summer is beginning to look like \n     an awful and avoidable error.\n       The decision to keep extra water in Klamath Lake and \n     Klamath River cost the regional economy $134 million, \n     according to a report from Oregon State university and \n     University of California at Berkeley.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Terrorism Risk Insurance Act \n     of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) property and casualty insurance firms are important \n     financial institutions, the products of which allow \n     mutualization of risk and the efficient use of financial \n     resources and enhance the ability of the economy to maintain \n     stability, while responding to a variety of economic, \n     political, environmental, and other risks with a minimum of \n     disruption;\n       (2) the ability of businesses and individuals to obtain \n     property and casualty insurance at reasonable and predictable \n     prices, in order to spread the risk of both routine and \n     catastrophic loss, is critical to economic growth, urban \n     development, and the construction and maintenance of public \n     and private housing, as well as to the promotion of United \n     States exports and foreign trade in an increasingly \n     interconnected world;\n       (3) the ability of the insurance industry to cover the \n     unprecedented financial risks presented by potential acts of \n     terrorism in the United States can be a major factor in the \n     recovery from terrorist attacks, while maintaining the \n     stability of the economy;\n       (4) widespread financial market uncertainties have arisen \n     following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \n     including the absence of information from which financial \n     institutions can make statistically valid estimates of the \n     probability and cost of future terrorist events, and \n     therefore the size, funding, and allocation of the risk of \n     loss caused by such acts of terrorism;\n       (5) a decision by property and casualty insurers to deal \n     with such uncertainties, either by terminating property and \n     casualty coverage for losses arising from terrorist events, \n     or by radically escalating premium coverage to compensate for \n     risks of loss that are not readily predictable, could \n     seriously hamper ongoing and planned construction, property \n     acquisition, and other business projects, generate a dramatic \n     increase in rents, and otherwise suppress economic activity; \n     and\n       (6) the United States Government should provide temporary \n     financial compensation to insured parties, contributing to \n     the stabilization of the United States economy in a time of \n     national crisis, while the financial services industry \n     develops the systems, mechanisms, products, and programs \n     necessary to create a viable financial services market for \n     private terrorism risk insurance.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a \n     temporary Federal program that provides for a transparent \n     system of shared public and private compensation for insured \n     losses resulting from acts of terrorism, in order to--\n       (1) protect consumers by addressing market disruptions and \n     ensure the continued widespread availability and \n     affordability of property and casualty insurance for \n     terrorism risk; and\n       (2) allow for a transitional period for the private markets \n     to stabilize, resume pricing of such insurance, and build \n     capacity to absorb any future losses, while preserving State \n     insurance regulation and consumer protections.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act, the following definitions shall apply:\n       (1) Act of terrorism.--\n       (A) Certification.--The term ``act of terrorism'' means any \n     act that is certified by the Secretary, in concurrence with \n     the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General of the \n     United States--\n       (i) to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to--\n\n       (I) human life;\n       (II) property;
