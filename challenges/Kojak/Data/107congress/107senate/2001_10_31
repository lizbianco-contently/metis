Mr. President, I have come to floor this morning to talk \nabout the priority of national security issues. Since the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, debate in the country has changed. We now \nfocus on issues we used to take for granted. We must look at those \nissues from the perspective of national security.\n  Senator Fred Thompson has repeatedly called for a review of our \nexport control laws for dual-use technologies. In the past year, as \nchairman and now as ranking member of the Senate Government Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Thompson has repeatedly called for increasing our \ndefenses against cyberterrorism. He has also sought to halt \nproliferation of nuclear weapons. For all of these issues, export \ncontrols, cyberterrorism and nuclear proliferation, he has cited \nnational security concerns--real national security issues. He is right. \nThey are national security issues.\n  The week before the September 11 attacks, the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee heard testimony about terrorism. At that hearing, \nthe committee heard from former Senator Sam Nunn and the ex-CIA \nDirector James Woolsey. They described in detail the threats of \nbiological and chemical weapons as tools of terrorists. They described \nthe need for more vaccines, stockpiles of drugs and antibiotics, and \nthe new technologies for delivering these medicines. Senator Nunn \nstated it best when he said: ``Public health has become a national \nsecurity issue.''\n  Sam was right.\n  The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee held a \nhearing to discuss the FAA's response during and after the terrorist \nattacks. At that hearing, Chairman Hollings properly noted: ``Airport \nand aircraft security are national security issues.'' He, too, was \nright.\n  The Bismarck Tribune in North Dakota reported on September 20 that \nRobert Carlson, president of the North Dakota Farmers, said food \nsecurity is an issue that should ``become important in the mind of \nCongress.'' As head of a farm group from a farm State, this position is \nunderstandable. And Senator Dorgan repeated that position here: food \nsecurity is a national security issue.\n  On October 11, Representative Henry Waxman called for the regulation \nof sniper rifles under the National Firearms Act. In his statement, he \ncited a national security need for such legislation. He was right. \nSelf-defense is a national security issue.\n\n  On October 11, Newsday reported that several television networks had \ndiscussed screening video footage of Osama bin Laden before airing that \nfootage publicly. Such screening is necessary--it is a national \nsecurity issue.\n  In July, the Senate Appropriations, Intelligence, and Armed Services \nCommittees held hearings on terrorism. On October 12, the House \nCommittee on Government Reform held a hearing to assess the threat of \nbioterrorism in America. Clearly, these are all national security \nissues.\n  Just a few days ago, the junior Senator from Washington, Ms. \nCantwell, said the northern border is a national security issue because \nit controls the flow of people and goods between our country and \nCanada. Representative Marge Roukema voiced similar concerns about the \nnorthern border and the need to triple the number of border agents \npatrolling the area. These are national security issues.\n  Congress is considering a seaport security bill, an economic stimulus \npackage with infrastructure security measures, increased funding for \nthe intelligence communities, and better preparedness within the health \ncommunity. All of these specific items have been tied to national \nsecurity.\n  But none of these national security issues faces the threat of a \nfilibuster. To filibuster any of these actions that involve national \nsecurity would be wrong for the country. Amazingly, some Members of \nthis body have now threatened to filibuster specific portions of the \ncomprehensive energy bill.\n  Tuesday's Baton Rouge Advocate reported the President may direct an \nadditional 70 million barrels of oil be put into the National Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. The President realizes that energy is a national \nsecurity issue.\n  My colleague, Senator Murkowski of Alaska, the ranking member on the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, has been calling for a \ncomprehensive energy package for over 2 years. He has been joined by \nSenators Breaux, Landrieu, Thomas, Craig, and others. Most recently, \nSenator Inhofe took to the floor to make the point that energy should \nbe at the top of the list of national security issues. I agree with my \ncolleagues and countless others who have called energy a national \nsecurity issue.\n  Yesterday, several veterans groups called on the Senate to consider \nan energy bill. In early October, the Printing Industries of America \ncalled for an energy plan in response to last year's domestic energy \nshortages and high fuel costs. Charles Jarvis, chairman and CEO of the \nUnited Seniors Association, called on the Senate to consider \nlegislation that would lower our dependence on foreign oil. His members \ndo not want to be held hostage by countries that do not share our \ninterests.\n  If any issue should be debated along with an economic stimulus \npackage, health preparedness, and airline security, it must be energy. \nPlanes cannot fly without jet fuel. Americans cannot drive without \ngasoline. Roads cannot be made without crude oil, and many medicines \ncannot be made without the chemicals that come from crude oil. Many of \nour everyday products are in fact made from crude oil. Economic \nstimulus, health care, and transportation are all tied to energy and \noil.\n  In 1973, the Senate debated the amendment to create a right-of-way \nfrom Alaska's North Slope to Valdez, which I offered with my then \ncolleague from Alaska. The amendment allowed the transport of 2 million \nbarrels of oil a day, which that pipeline is capable of carrying. At \nthe time there was a tacit understanding in this body that any item \ndealing with national security would not be filibustered. Perhaps \nSenator Moss of Utah put it best when he said:\n\n       I cannot get overly upset about the ritual mating season \n     for Alaskan caribou when in the city of Denver last weekend \n     it was almost impossible to find gas. How long do you suppose \n     the people of this country will tolerate an empty gas tank \n     while we debate the merit of a pipeline to bring 2 million \n     barrels of oil a day over a right-of-way traversing lands \n     that belong to the people of the United States?\n\n  Mr. President, one of the arguments put forth by opponents to that \nright-of-way was the potential impact of the oil pipeline on caribou. \nNearly 30 years and over 13 billion barrels of oil later, there are \nmore than 4 times the number of caribou in that area of Alaska compared \nto the years before the oil pipeline.\n  During the debate on the Alaska oil pipeline amendment, Energy \nCommittee Chairman Henry Jackson, my great friend from Washington, said \nthe pipeline ``involves a national security issue.'' He said, ``There \nis no serious question today that it is urgently in the national \ninterest to start north slope oil flowing to markets.''\n  He also said that if he saw any more attempts to delay construction \nof the pipeline, he would push legislation to have the Federal \nGovernment build the project. The national security concerns were that \nimportant to Scoop Jackson, and they are important to me.\n  Even Senator Walter Mondale supported the construction of the Alaska \noil pipeline and the transport of oil to the lower 48. He said then, \n``It has always been my position that we need Alaskan oil and that this \noil should flow to the lower 48 as soon as possible, consistent with \nenvironmental safeguards and the greatest benefit for the entire \ncountry.''\n  In addition to that, Senator Bartlett of Oklahoma said then, ``We \nneed every\n\n[[Page S11253]]\n\npossible drop of crude oil production that can be developed and \nmaintained.''\n  We debated the construction of this 800-mile pipeline when we \nbelieved there was a probability we could recover 1 billion barrels of \noil from the area near Prudhoe Bay. As I said, last year, Alaskans \nproduced our 13 billionth barrel of oil from Prudhoe Bay.\n  I want to talk about that same pipeline today being used to transport \noil from the Arctic Coastal Plain--an area predicted to contain a \nminimum estimate of 5 billion barrels of oil, with the possibility of \nup to 30 billion barrels of oil. This is a resource on Federal land; it \nis not a State resource. Not to have it available to produce puts us at \nthe mercy of foreign interests who produce the oil we import.\n  The Alaska oil pipeline carried 2 billion barrels during the Persian \nGulf war. It was up as high as 2.1 billion barrels a day. We increased \nit, through special means, to secure the supply for America and to \nassure that we had domestic oil to rely upon then. Now our Alaska \npipeline is only half filled with oil coming from Prudhoe Bay and other \nnorth slope wells. If the remainder of the pipeline is to be filled, it \nmust come from the coastal zone, from the ANWR area. At the minimum \nestimate of 5 billion barrels, being produced at 1 million barrels per \nday, that oil supply would last for over 14 years. At the medium \nestimate of 10 billion barrels it would last for 27 years.\n\n  As I stand here, I remember the debate on the oil pipeline. I \nremember Alan Bible of Nevada sitting right there across the aisle from \nme. We were in the minority. Senator Bible then was in the majority. He \nsaid to me that he had not made up his mind about the pipeline. I don't \nthink I have seen it since--I had never seen it before. But Senator \nBible sat there for the whole time of the debate on the floor, and just \nbefore the end of that debate he came to me and said: I am going to \nvote with you because I know this is a national security issue.\n  There is no question today, because of the security crisis we face \nand our dependence upon foreign oil, the oil from Alaska's north slope \nis a national security issue. We now import nearly 60 percent of our \noil daily. We have over 700,000 barrels of oil a day coming from Iraq--\nIraq, Mr. President. There was not one barrel of oil coming from Iraq \nat the time we debated the concept of what we should do during the \nPersian Gulf war. Obviously, there has been a great change.\n  It is estimated that we will import nearly 230 million barrels of \ncrude oil from Iraq by the end of this year. Almost 40 million barrels \nof that will be unloaded in California. Why? It is replacing oil that \nused to be delivered to California through the Alaska oil pipeline.\n  As I said, we delivered 2.1 billion barrels a day during the Persian \nGulf war. Today, it is 1.2 billion barrels a day. At a rate of $20 per \nbarrel, we send over $5 billion a year to Iraq to buy oil that we could \nproduce in our own country.\n  During peacetime operations, the Department of Defense uses about \n300,000 barrels of oil a day. Most of it is jet fuel. That has \nincreased now by over 200,000 barrels a day, as it did during the gulf \nwar. Defense fuel usage is increasing daily because of our activities \nin the global war against terrorism, particularly the events in \nAfghanistan.\n  During the Alaska pipeline debate, Senator Paul Fannin of Arizona \ngave two reasons for why the pipeline was a national security issue. \nFirst, he said it would reduce our dependence on foreign countries. \nObviously, that was a valid statement.\n  Senator Fannin's second point was the construction of the pipeline \nwould create tens of thousands of jobs. It did. Economic reports show \nthat a small pipeline connecting the Alaska pipeline to transport oil \nout of the Coastal Plain will create several hundred thousand jobs \nnationwide.\n  Just yesterday I was given a study completed by the American \nPetroleum Institute. It stated that oil transported from the Coastal \nPlain down the pipeline to the Valdez terminal would require the \nconstruction of an additional 19 tankers to transport that oil to the \ncoastline of the United States, particularly the west coast.\n  It will take 19, as I said, new tankers, with 2,000 direct \nconstruction jobs and 3,000 support jobs for each tanker. That is 5,000 \njobs per tanker resulting in over 90,000 new jobs just in the \nshipbuilding industry by opening the coastal plain of ANWR for \nexploration and production.\n  During the debate on the Alaska pipeline issue in this body, I said, \n``We cannot afford to bury our heads in the snow and freeze, nor must \nwe allow our economy and the jobs of thousands to be endangered while \nwe stand idly by.'' That was true then, and it is even more true now.\n  Drilling on the Arctic coast and going forward with production of oil \nin the United States will help stimulate this economy. I intend to \nraise this issue again and again as we talk about stimulus for the \neconomy.\n  I hope we will not hear the threat of filibuster against this measure \nto bring oil from the Arctic coast to the United States. It is a \nnational security issue, and it must not be filibustered. No national \nsecurity issue has ever been filibustered on the floor of the Senate. \nTo do so now would be not only a violation of tradition, it would be a \ntravesty of justice during a time of war.\n  I intend to speak often on this issue in the days to come. We cannot \nend this session of Congress without a national security energy plan \nwhich includes Alaska's North Slope oil and gas potential, particularly \nthe oil and gas from the coastal plain.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak in morning business for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am here to address another aspect of \nthe energy issue that will come before us as comprehensive energy \nlegislation, hopefully either this fall or early next year. It may seem \nto be an unusual item to address on Halloween as we are going into the \ncolder months of the year, but it is one which I think deserves \nattention.\n  There was a development 10 days ago that I think needs to be called \nto the attention of colleagues in the Senate. About 10 days ago, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency transmitted formal comments to the \nDepartment of Energy--that is one agency of the Federal Government \ncommenting to another Agency or Department of the Federal Government--\non the proposed standard for efficiency in central air conditioners. \nThe Clinton administration had finalized a rule that mandated a 30-\npercent increase in efficiency for those central air conditioners. It \nwas a so-called 13 SEER standard. SEER stands for seasonal energy \nefficiency rating.\n  Shortly after the current administration took office, they proposed \nto back off this mandate and reduce it to only a 20-percent increase or \na 12 SEER standard. The argument used by the new administration in \nrolling back the air-conditioning standard struck many of us in \nCongress as being based on outdated price data and a faulty analysis.\n  The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, where the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer and I both serve, had a hearing on this \ntopic. We had expert testimony that demonstrated these analytical \nproblems in the decisionmaking which the new administration had gone \nthrough.\n  This EPA filing 10 days ago capsulized those concerns eloquently. In \nthe Agency's own words, the new proposed standard--that is, the 12 SEER \nstandard, the lesser standard this administration embraced--\n``overstates the regulatory burden,'' it ``understates the savings \nbenefits of the 13 SEER standard, over and underestimates certain \ndistributional inequalities,'' and ``mischaracterizes the number of \nmanufacturers that already produce at the 13 SEER level or could \nproduce at the 13 SEER level through modest changes to the product. . . \n.''\n  I will read one other quotation from the explanation of the EPA \nposition. It says:\n\n[[Page S11254]]\n\n       EPA believes there is a strong rationale to support a 13 \n     SEER standard.\n\n  That is what the previous administration adopted.\n\n       EPA also believes that the more stringent standard will be \n     more representative of the long term goals of the \n     administration's energy policy and will do more to reduce \n     both the number of new power plants that need to be \n     constructed, as well as the emissions resulting from these \n     plants. . . .\n\n  While these comments by the Environmental Protection Agency have \nreceived some attention, I believe they deserve broader attention by \nthe public and certainly deserve to be recognized by people in the \nSenate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the EPA letter to the \nDepartment of Energy and their explanation which they attached to that \nbe printed in the Record following my statement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, getting to a more efficient air-\nconditioning standard is an important part of a national energy \nstrategy. This past summer, a nationwide heat wave in August led to \nbrownouts and blackouts as our electricity system was stretched to its \nlimits. While the new standard would take effect gradually over the \nlong term, it would help reduce the peak demand for electricity on very \nhot days, and it would give consumers a break.\n  I have been informed that thousands of public comments have been \nfiled with the Department of Energy favorable to the 13 SEER standard, \ndemonstrating broad public support for sticking with that standard.\n  Previously, I indicated my belief that we should include a \nlegislative provision mandating a 13 SEER standard in any energy \nlegislation that we pass. It should be clear to all that this is a \nmatter where there is broad public support for the better standard, and \nI believe the administration should try to be in line with that public \nsentiment.\n  I hope the Department of Energy decides to go back to the earlier \nestablished standard, and they can certainly do that administratively \nwithout Congress having to act. But if DOE continues to push for \nwatering down the standard, then I hope the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget will exercise \nits watchdog role to ensure that good technical and economic analysis \ncarries the day on this issue.\n  I expect we will continue to see strong legislative support for this \nstandard in the debate on energy legislation we have over the next \nweeks and months, and I hope that ultimately the EPA view of this \nmatter will prevail.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         United States Environmental Protection Agency,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 2001.\n     Ms. Brenda Edwards-Jones,\n     U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Edwards-Jones: On behalf of the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency, I am pleased to submit the attached \n     comments to Docket No: EE-RM-98-440, the Department of \n     Energy's Proposed Rule: Energy Conservation Program for \n     Consumer Products; Central Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps \n     Energy Conservation Standards.\n       DOE has proposed a change to its previously issued standard \n     that decreases energy efficiency requirements for residential \n     air conditioners and heat pumps. DOE proposes to withdraw its \n     previously issued 13 SEER standard and replace it with a 12 \n     SEER standard. These comments affirm EPA's support for DOE's \n     original 13 SEER standard.\n       EPA believes there is a strong rationale to support a 13 \n     SEER standard. A 13 SEER standard represents a 30% increase \n     in the minimum efficiency requirements for central air \n     conditioners and air source heat pumps. In contrast, a 12 \n     SEER standard represents only a 20% increase. The \n     Administration's National Energy Policy stresses the \n     important role that energy efficiency plays in our energy \n     future. A 13 SEER DOE standard will do more to stimulate \n     energy savings that benefit the consumer. DOE has quantified \n     these savings at approximately 4.2 quads of energy over the \n     2006-2030 period, equivalent to the annual energy use of 26 \n     million households and resulting in net benefits to the \n     consumer of approximately $1 billion by 2020. In comparison, \n     DOE projects that only 3 quads of energy would be saved over \n     that same period with a 12 SEER standard.\n       A 13 SEER standard will also do more to reduce fossil fuel \n     consumption and more to limit emissions of air pollutants. \n     For example, by avoiding the construction of 39 400 megawatt \n     power plants, a 13 SEER standard will reduce nitrous oxides \n     (NOX) emissions by up to 85 thousand metric tons \n     versus up to 73 thousand metric tons that would be reduced \n     with a 12 SEER standard. A 13 SEER standard will also result \n     in cumulative greenhouse gas emission reductions of up to 33 \n     million metric tons (Mt) of carbon. This is in contrast to a \n     12 SEER rule which will reduce up to 24 Mt of carbon \n     equivalent by avoiding the construction of 27 400 megawatt \n     power plants. At a time when many areas across the nation are \n     struggling to improve their air quality, the additional \n     emissions reductions achieved by a 13 SEER standard are \n     especially important.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to provide these written \n     comments. Should you have any questions, please contact Dave \n     Godwin in EPA's Office of Air and Radiation at 202-564-3517 \n     or via e-mail at godwin.dave@epa.gov.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Linda J. Fisher,\n                                             Deputy Administrator.\n\n Comments of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on the Proposed \n Rule: Energy Conservation Programs for Consumer Products; Central Air \nConditioners and Heat Pumps Energy Conservation Standards, October 10, \n                                  2001\n\n\n                        overview of epa comments\n\n       The Environmental Protection Agency welcomes the \n     opportunity to comment on the Department of Energy's Proposed \n     Rule setting forth energy conservation standards for \n     residential central air conditioners and central air \n     conditioning heat pumps. EPA recognizes that the new proposed \n     DOE rule represents a 20% increase in minimum efficiency \n     standards for central air conditioning and heat pumps. \n     However, we instead support the previous final rule of a 30% \n     increase.\n       EPA has issue with several of the arguments DOE used to \n     justify the withdrawal of the previous final rule as outlined \n     within the Federal Register Notice of July 25, 2001 and the \n     Technical Support Document. In summary, EPA believes that the \n     information in the Federal Register Notice of July 25, 2001\n       overstates the regulatory burden on manufacturers due to \n     HCFC phase-out and concludes that the industry is under \n     greater financial pressure from a 13 SEER standard than it \n     is,\n       understates the savings benefits of the 13 SEER standard,\n       over and underestimates certain distributional \n     inequalities,\n       mischaracterizes the number of manufacturers that already \n     produce at the 13 SEER level or could produce at the 13 SEER \n     level through modest changes to the products, and thereby \n     mischaracterizes the availability of 13 SEER product.\n       [EPA believes there is a strong rationale to support a 13 \n     SEER standard. EPA also believes that the more stringent \n     standard will be more representative of the long term goals \n     of the administration's energy policy and will do more to \n     reduce both the number of new power plants that need to be \n     constructed, as well as the emissions resulting from these \n     plants.] EPA's more detailed comments are provided below.\n       Another example would be:\n       Move directly to producing R-407C and/or R-410A units that \n     meet the new DOE efficiency regulations;\n       Increase the production of these units to meet customer \n     demand by 2006;\n       Meanwhile, phase out all HCFC-22 units by 2006.\n     Of course, some combination of these strategies is more \n     likely to be taken and seems to offer the most opportunity \n     for manufacturers to reduce regulatory burden.\n       The TSD states ``To the extent that manufacturers can \n     introduce new products utilizing the new refrigerant and \n     meeting the new efficiency standard, the cumulative burden \n     will be reduced.'' (TSD page 8-62). EPA believes that there \n     is ample opportunity to meet both a 13 SEER efficiency \n     standard and a ban on HCFC-22 in new equipment with limited \n     regulatory burden.\n\n\n         Underestimates of Savings in the Cost Benefit Analysis\n\n       DOE's analysis of the benefits of the withdrawn 13 SEER \n     rule are significantly underestimated. DOE's analysis is \n     based on summer 1996 electricity prices, adjusted downward \n     based on EIA projections of future annual electricity prices. \n     Changes in the electricity market due to utility deregulation \n     has resulted in increased electricity prices overall. DOE did \n     not consider this trend in its analysis.\n       According to Synapse Energy Economics' wholesale \n     electricity price data, DOE analysis underestimates the cost \n     of electricity for residential air conditioning by an average \n     of approximately $0.02/kWh. In addition, the California \n     Public Utilities Commission raised some residential rates by \n     as much as 37%, affecting more than 10% of the U.S. \n     electricity market and thereby, raising the national average \n     electricity prices above DOE's projections. Adjusting DOE's \n     analysis to include more recent electricity prices will \n     definitely and drastically alter the results indicating that \n     a DOE minimum standard of 13 SEER represents the better \n     decision for the nation.\n\n\n         Over and Under Estimates of Distributional Inequities\n\n       EPA sees distributional inequalities that DOE has not \n     adequately considered. One results from the fact that the \n     residential price of electricity does not capture the \n     complete cost for running systems that largely run at peak \n     times. That is, except in select circumstances, residential \n     customers purchase electricity based upon average rates, not \n     ``time-of-use'' rates. The actual costs of electricity at \n     peak times are dramatically more\n\n[[Page S11255]]\n\nand therefore, higher peak rates drive up the average costs. Less \nefficient equipment operating at peak times drives up the cost of \nelectricity for all customers, including those of low income, who are \nless likely to have central air conditioning. According to 1997 \nResidential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) microdata (the same data \nset used by DOE in their analysis), of the total 101 million households \nrepresented, approximately 46% have central air conditioning, but among \npoor households, only 25% have central air conditioning; just half the \nrate of presence among non-poor households (See Exhibit 2).\n       Also related to distributional equities and according to \n     the RECS data, among households below the poverty level, \n     about 60% rent their housing units. This is in contrast to \n     27% of above poverty level households that rent (See Exhibit \n     2). Therefore, low-income consumers, or those defined as \n     ``poor'' in TSD Table 10.1, are not the ones to buy a central \n     A/C or heat pump product, but they would be the one to pay \n     the utility bill (or likely face increased rents if utilities \n     were included in their rent) for the use of that product. \n     Instituting a higher minimum efficiency standard will \n     actually ensure that low-income consumers have lower utility \n     bills, providing a benefit to this population.\n\n\n                 misinformation on product availability\n\n       DOE justifies a lower SEER rule because the higher \n     efficiency levels would put manufacturers out of business. \n     However, according to the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration \n     Institute (ARI) database of model combinations, many \n     manufacturers already produce models that meet the 13 SEER \n     requirements. This technology has been available for many \n     years to large and small manufacturers alike. Although \n     confidential ARI shipment information may not reflect large \n     sales of high efficiency equipment, the publicly accessible \n     ARI database of models shows extensive product availability. \n     Over 7,000 air source heat pump model combinations and over \n     14,000 central air conditioner model combinations currently \n     meet or exceed the 13 SEER level as listed by ARI.\n       The TSD (TSD page 8-2) describes a group of manufacturers \n     that ``offer more substantial customer and dealer support and \n     more advance products. To cover these higher operating \n     expenses, this group attempts to ``sell-up'' to more \n     efficient products or products with features that consumers \n     and dealers value.'' With a higher standard, these \n     manufacturers would not go out of business, but would rather \n     continue to sell-up, to even higher efficiency levels or \n     additional valued features.\n       Furthermore, results and upcoming plans for utility \n     programs around the country also document the availability of \n     13 SEER and above products, as well as the demand for such \n     products. Austin Energy's Residential Efficiency Program \n     2000-2001 gave rebates to single family existing homes for \n     installation of split systems and heat pumps \n     with efficiencies of 12 SEER and above. Rebates were \n     staged: $150 for 12.0-12.9 SEER; $250 for 13.0-13.9 SEER; \n     $400 for 14.0-14.9 SEER; and $500 for 15.0 and above. In \n     total, 4,000 rebates averaging $312 were given to \n     consumers. These numbers illustrate that a significant \n     portion of the rebates given were for 13 SEER and above \n     units.\n       In New Jersey, a 3-year rebate structure began in 2000 with \n     a $370 rebate given for the installation of 13.0 SEER \n     equipment and a $550 rebate given for 14.0 SEER equipment. A \n     total of 14,000 rebates were given in the year 2000. As of \n     August 2001, 8,000 rebates were given out with approximately \n     6,000 of these units at the 14.0 SEER level. Overall results \n     in New Jersey show that 27% of the market (1998-2000) are 13 \n     SEER or higher with 60% of those being at the 14 SEER or \n     higher levels.\n       The Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) instituted a program \n     similar to the one in New Jersey offering rebates for \n     installation of 13.0 and 14.0 SEER equipment. Results to date \n     show that LIPA is on target to reach their goal of \n     approximately 3,500 rebates for 13 SEER equipment. \n     Approximately 80% of these rebates are for SEER 14 equipment. \n     LIPA is expecting to ramp up to 5,000 rebates in 2002. \n     Overall, 17% of LIPA's market in 2000 is at 13 SEER or \n     higher, with the market share for existing homes even higher \n     at 22%.\n       Program plans for 2002 in Texas and California are geared \n     toward equipment at 13 SEER and above. Reliant Energy in \n     Southeast Texas is planning an incentive program to target 13 \n     SEER and above matched systems. California's two large \n     municipal utilities (Sacramento Municipal Utility District \n     and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power) and four \n     investor owned utilities (San Diego Gas and Electric, \n     Southern California Gas, Southern California Edison, and \n     Pacific Gas and Electric), serving over 30,000,000 consumers, \n     are planning rebate programs to assure California residents \n     receive energy efficient equipment, measures, and practices \n     that provide maximum benefit for the cost. These programs all \n     revolve around 13 SEER equipment or higher. Actual incentive \n     amounts are not yet available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/31/senate-section/article/S11255-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RECORD CLARIFICATION\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first I salute Chairman Harkin and Senator \nSpecter for doing, in my view, a superb job with respect to this bill. \nThey have really set a special standard in terms of trying to work on \nimportant issues in a bipartisan way. The chairman has left the \nChamber, but I want him to know how much I appreciate the good work he \nand his staff are doing on this issue.\n  This morning I wish to talk about a health and a scientific issue of \nextraordinary importance, and that is the vacancies that now exist at \nthe National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, \nand the National Cancer Institute. At a time when the public is focused \non public health because of bioterrorism, there are many reasons we \nshould be concerned about the work of these agencies and get these \npositions filled.\n  I want to talk for a few moments about why I am so troubled by the \nvacancies we are seeing at these agencies today. This has been, as all \nof us know, a decade of remarkable scientific progress in the health \ncare field. It has really been something of a scientific and health \ncare renaissance with extraordinary amounts of information learned \nabout cells, about cancers, about what has come to be known as \nbiological detectors that are important as we deal with anthrax and \nsmallpox, and various other serious health concerns that Americans are \nfocused on today.\n  This scientific progress has been bipartisan. Democrats and \nRepublicans alike have joined to support funding for these very key \npublic health agencies, and we have worked together to ensure these \nprograms are properly funded.\n  I am convinced if those vacancies are not promptly filled, if we do \nnot soon get a head of the National Institutes of Health and the Food \nand Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institute--if those \npositions are not soon filled--it threatens to unravel some of the \nimportant progress that has been made in this country over the last \ndecade.\n  Suffice it to say, if those positions are not filled, a message is \nsent to the young scientists, to the young future leaders of this \ncountry in the health care field, that the Federal Government does not \nthink this is particularly important. It takes years for\n\n[[Page S11256]]\n\ncompanies to get products developed and approved, and this is \nespecially true of the new products created by biotechnology. It is \nimportant that we have scientific leadership throughout this process--\nat the companies developing these products and at every level of these \ntwo important agencies--NIH and the FDA. Without these scientists \nthroughout the process, in the companies, and at the Federal level, \nbiotech companies lose the incentive to invest in what might be the \nnext medical breakthrough.\n  I spoke to a group of students on a college campus just a few days \nago. A young woman came up to me and only half jokingly said: ``I am \nready to be the head of the National Institutes of Health. I have \nfocused on these issues. I have studied the questions for some time. \nWhy in the world can the Federal Government not get somebody to head \nthe National Institutes of Health right now?''\n  I have focused on health care and technology questions over the last \nfew years in Congress, and the business community is especially alarmed \nthat these vacancies are open. They want to work with leaders at the \nFederal level to expedite the development of drugs, vaccines, and \ntherapies. One of these business leaders told me recently what concerns \nhim is that at a time when the public is focused on public health, on \nthe question of how to deal with anthrax and smallpox and bioterrorism, \nthere is not anybody home in the Federal Government.\n  I think it is extraordinarily important that the Congress work with \nthe President to get the officials we need sent up for review by the \nkey committees. The National Institutes of Health has now been without \na leader for almost two years.\n  The National Institutes of Health is now hemorrhaging the key people \nthey need to be effective advocates for the public health. Recently, \nthere was another vacancy at the National Institutes on Mental Health, \nand there is a vacancy at the National Cancer Institute. There has been \na substantial period of time where we have not had anybody heading up \nthe Food and Drug Administration.\n  If we want to attract the stellar scientists whom I know Democrats \nand Republicans both are so interested in supporting, we are not going \nto be able to do it, and we are going to lose very talented people who \nare in these agencies now.\n  We are already seeing a real brain drain in these essential agencies. \nWhat we need to do, and the Congress is prepared to do, and what the \nchairman and Senator Specter have made it very clear that they are \nwilling to do, is make sure these agencies are properly funded. What we \nneed now especially are scientifically sound programs to take on \nanthrax, smallpox, and ensure we can allow our scientists to work on \nwhat are known as biological detectors so we can move more rapidly and \nreadily to recognize the agents in the field. We can more precisely \ndescribe the various strains of these bacteria and diseases. We will \nhave a chance to learn more about their genomic sequence and develop \ncreative strategies for public health that could pay very significant \nbenefits for this country. Certainly the potential benefits to this \ncountry can be extraordinary.\n\n  I am very interested in working with the President on filling these \npositions. Biomedicine research and science policy has long been \nbipartisan. Senator Mack, for example, from Florida, did yeoman work \nfor years and years with Senator Specter, Senator Harkin, myself, and \nothers. That is the kind of progress, it seems to me, that is in danger \nof being lost at this time.\n  The President of the United States certainly has lots on his agenda \nright now. All of it is extremely important as we deal with the \nquestion of fighting terrorism. I come to the Chamber today to say it \nis of extraordinary importance these positions at the National \nInstitutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration move to the \ntop of the President's agenda, move to the top of the congressional \nagenda, and we work together in a bipartisan way, as we have done on a \nvariety of subjects in recent weeks, to get the key officials in these \nagencies in place.\n  To make progress in the area of biomedical research and science, we \nneed a public-private partnership, one where the Federal Government is \ninvolved in ensuring our laboratories are helping address issues that \ninvolve coming up with the basic knowledge that companies and \nscientists can then take to develop the cures and therapies that will \nimprove the quality of life for the public.\n  I want to work with the President of the United States to get the \nbiosciences back on track. I want to make sure we don't step back from \nthis golden age of scientific progress, when we had an administration \ncommitted to ensuring we moved forward with this important research, \nand Congress backed it up on a bipartisan basis. The Congress has the \npower to advise and consent, and it is important that the Congress and \nthe President work together to fill the positions at the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the National Institutes of Health, and the National \nCancer Institute.\n  We are not dealing just with bioterrorism although that is obviously \nvery much on our mind this morning--but the entire public health \nsystem. We are seeing, obviously, when we open our morning newspaper, \nthere are gaps that we need to address. We can best address this if \nofficials in these key agencies are in a position to advise the \nCongress.\n  It has been too long that we have gone without a leader at the \nNational Institutes of Health. It has been too long that we have gone \nwithout a leader at the Food and Drug Administration. The Senate will \nmeet the President of the United States more than halfway. He can speak \nfor himself. He has been extraordinarily eloquent on biomedical \nresearch over the years. Senator Kennedy, who I have discussed this \nwith, has made it very clear as chairman of the committee that focuses \non these issues, he is very anxious to get these officials confirmed.\n  I hope this message this morning, at a time when we are working on \nthis important bill that funds so many key health agencies, can help \nspark a new effort to speed up getting these key positions filled. I, \nand I believe every Member of the Senate, wants to work with the \nPresident to get these positions filled. Even though there are so many \nimportant issues the President has to deal with, this issue of the \nvacancies at the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and the National Cancer Institute has become so \nserious, it needs to be a priority matter that Congress moves quickly \nto deal with. We ought to move quickly to deal with it before we \nadjourn for the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we urge our colleagues to come to the \nChamber to offer amendments. There was a long list filed yesterday \nwhere we have a unanimous consent agreement limiting amendments to \nthose which have been listed. Many of them are obviously placeholder \namendments. We need to move ahead with this bill. We have been on this \nbill now into our second day. We have had only one amendment offered so \nfar. We urge our colleagues to come to the Chamber and identify what \namendments they intend to offer and to be in a position to move forward \nto proceed with the disposition of this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. We have an amendment pending, the Dorgan amendment. Has \nthere been a decision made whether that would be accepted or do you \nwant a vote on it?\n  It is my understanding now that staff is still working on that.\n  Senator Stevens wanted to alternate back and forth, and I said that \nwas fine, but if we could get all Democrats to offer their amendments \nand all Republicans, one after the other--we are so desperate to have \namendments, we don't care where they come from.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond, I don't think we have a problem on \nalternating. We have a problem finding amendments. If a series of \namendments from your side of the aisle come forward, we will take them; \nand if a series of amendments from our side of the aisle come forward, \nwe will take them. If there is a complication, we will alternate. We \nare now in search of amendments.\n  The Senator from Alabama is prepared to offer an amendment. I ask\n\n[[Page S11257]]\n\nunanimous consent the pending amendment be set aside so we may proceed \nto the amendment of the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2042\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Specter for his leadership and courtesy \nin allowing me to present this amendment which I believe is exceedingly \nimportant to health care in America. It is a problem with which we \nsimply have to deal. It affects hospitals all over America, causing the \nricher hospitals to get richer and the poorer hospitals to get poorer.\n  The problem is the wage index. I offer the Wage Index Fairness Act, \nand I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2042.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to establish \n    a floor on area wage adjustment factors used under the medicare \n   prospective payment system for inpatient and outpatient hospital \n                               services)\n\n       On page 54, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Floor on Area Wage Adjustment Factors Used \n     Under Medicare PPS for Inpatient Hospital Services.--Section \n     1886(d)(3)(E) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395ww(d)(3)(E)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(i) In general.--'' before ``The \n     Secretary'', and adjusting the margin two ems to the right;\n       (2) by striking ``The Secretary'' and inserting ``Subject \n     to clause (ii), the Secretary''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new clause:\n       ``(ii) Floor on area wage adjustment factor.--\n     Notwithstanding clause (i), in determining payments under \n     this subsection for discharges occurring on or after October \n     1, 2001, the Secretary shall substitute a factor of .925 for \n     any factor that would otherwise apply under such clause that \n     is less than .925.

Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Which amendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Wage Fairness Index Act.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank you.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I note that Iowa is also adversely impacted by this \nwage index formula.\n  I introduced this amendment as a bill earlier this year with my \ncolleagues, Senator Shelby and Senator Hutchinson. We have a terrible \ninequity in the system and in the index formula. This amendment will \nestablish a floor on the area wage index adjustment factors that are \nutilized under the Medicare prospective payment system for inpatient \nand outpatient hospital services. I believe this is the best way to do \nthat.\n  Several other Members have other proposals to help fix this problem. \nThis is a solution I believe would be most effective. Over the past \nseveral years, I visited a number of hospitals, 15 or more, in the \nState of Alabama. In every one, hospital administrators and staff have \nurged me to do something about the wage index. Time after time it has \nbeen cited to me in personal and confidential discussions, just heart \nto heart, as we discussed the frustrations and problems they face in \nhospitals, and in particular rural hospitals. It has been raised to me \nas a No. 1 issue facing hospitals in Alabama.\n\n  The Alabama Hospital Association and its members have helped craft a \nplan. They consider it an emergency problem and a priority for them. \nThe National Hospital Association has recognized this as a problem, and \nthey support reform.\n  A complicated and a mostly arbitrary formula, the wage index, is part \nof the hospital prospective payment system which was created just in \nthe early 1990s, about 10 years ago. We are just now beginning to feel \nhow it plays out in real life. It was an effort to cut Medicare \nspending. It established a base rate for Medicare reimbursement based \non two components--the labor component and the nonlabor-related costs. \nThat is how a hospital is paid for Medicare services they render to a \nperson who is not otherwise paying. This could be the elderly on \nMedicare and they come in and the hospital provides services. All they \nget for that service is what the Federal Government pays them under the \nMedicare Act.\n  So everyone knows that basically hospitals are not making any money. \nIn fact, they lose money, often, on Medicare patients. It is the \nindividuals who pay their way or have insurance to pay their way who \nhelp them be a success. The hospitals that have larger numbers of \nMedicare patients who serve a poorer population are more critically \nimpacted by this problem. Once again, the wage index is falling \nparticularly hard on hospitals that serve a disproportionately high \nnumber of Medicare patients and poor patients--Medicaid also.\n  It established a base rate for paying Medicare costs. They decide how \nmuch we are going to pay for a gall bladder operation, how much we will \npay for pneumonia and other things, and that is what the hospital gets. \nThey factor that on labor and nonlabor costs.\n  Nonlabor costs--that is the material and all--are similar nationwide, \nand the factors come out the same. But labor-related costs must be \nadjusted to regional differences in wage costs. This adjustment is made \naccording to the wage index. The wage index, by the way, is a larger \ncomponent of the cost of hospital care than the other factors. It is \nthe biggest component. I believe about 60 percent of the reimbursed \nrate is based on the wage rate.\n  Rural areas such as Alabama and other States have lower wage costs, \nwhich is not a good thing. We don't like it that our nurses and support \npersonnel aren't paid the same wages as in other States. But it is true \nwe have some lower wage rates. Therefore, the Medicare reimbursement \ncost for health care in Alabama and many other States and rural areas \neven within larger States is much lower. Actually, Alabama has the \nlowest average wage index in the country and Montgomery, AL, the \ncapital--a good, strong city, not some small rural town--has the lowest \nwage rate in the State. In fact, the wage index for all Alabama \nhospitals is between .74 and .89, well below the national average of \n1.0.\n\n  In other words, where the national average is hospitals are \nreimbursed at the rate of $1, they are reimbursed at the rate of maybe \n78 cents in Alabama, many of them at 74 cents. Some hospitals in the \ncountry that have somehow, some way, under this formula found their \ncosts higher, they get as much as $1.50. So it is twice as much, 74 \ncents to $1.50, on 60 percent of the formula on the payment for health \ncare. This is too big a gap. This is more than we ought to accept. For \nperson in Iowa, a person in Alabama, their health care is just as \nvaluable and as important as the health care of someone in New York or \nCalifornia.\n  To further exacerbate the problem, Alabama has to compete for nurses \nand hospital personnel with nearby urban areas such as Atlanta. To \nrecruit these highly qualified health care professionals, Alabama \nhospitals must compete with urban wages. This has become a bidding war \nand has really impacted adversely the bottom line of hospitals in the \nState. Until we fix this problem, Alabama hospitals and hospitals all \nover the country will continue to lose millions of dollars each year. \nUnfortunately, it is falling hardest, and the losses fall most often, \non\n\n[[Page S11258]]\n\nhospitals in poorer areas, the ones that are actually doing the care \nand the good deed of treating people who otherwise would not have \nhealth care. They are already forced to make the most of limited \nresources and to continue to provide care for the State's uninsured.\n  These hospitals will face tough decisions regarding health care \nservices. They will continue to postpone important projects and the \npurchasing of much needed equipment. The rich are getting richer and \nthe poor are getting poorer.\n  In fact, what happens is, when your wage index is low and you talk \nwith your nurses about what kind of raises they might expect, or how \nmany RNs and how many LPNs and how many less skilled personnel you have \nbecause you are not being reimbursed at the national rate but maybe 75 \npercent of the national rate, you end up cutting those salaries even \nmore, so you have more LPNs rather than RNs, you have more support \npersonnel than nursing personnel to try to get by, and what happens \nthen? Your wage index goes down even further. They come in and say: \nLook, your wage index isn't that high. You don't get reimbursed as \nmuch. So your formula can even go down worse.\n  The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission, and the MedPAC have recognized the \nproblem, and they have even made recommendations to improve the wage \nindex.\n  In addition to these recommendations, several pieces of legislation \nhave been introduced in this Congress to address the wage index. Five \nbills have been introduced so far this year to address the wage index. \nForty-five Senators from twenty-nine States have either sponsored or \ncosponsored wage index legislation.\n\n  Eight members of the Senate Finance Committee, including the ranking \nmember, Senator Grassley, agree something must be done. Unfortunately, \nalthough many have recognized the problem with the wage index, we have \nnot been able to do anything to fix it.\n  So I raise this issue today to call attention to what is a critical \nproblem in health care in America. Particularly in light of September \n11, we know we are going to have to be sure we have a healthy health \ncare system to deal with crises with which we may be faced at any time. \nIf we allow an unfair reimbursement system to continue, then we will \nallow our hospitals to weaken and eventually close.\n  This is a matter of serious import. The wage index is irrational. It \nis not working correctly. It is ratcheting down wages on poorer \nhospitals in rural areas. When the hospitals cut and reduce and cut and \nreduce, then the next year the wage index formula people come in and \nsay your wages are lower, and your index drops even further, and you go \ndown even more.\n  This is something we have to confront. I will share this specific \nexample from my hometown of Mobile, AL. The wage index dropped from .81 \nto .77, whereas 50 miles away in Pensacola, FL, it is maybe .87; it is \nin the high .80s in Pascagoula, MS, an hour's drive either way from the \ncity. That means millions of dollars of reimbursement for those people. \nMontgomery, our capital, has the lowest rate in the Nation. Its \nhospitals are hurting as a result.\n  Mr. President, this is an important issue. The time has come to \naddress it. Although this is a Health and Human Services bill that \ndeals with health care issues, I recognize that this amendment is not \nappropriately favored to be offered here--although we could offer it \nwith a point of order. I hope we can begin to draw some attention to an \nissue that is getting out of control. The gap is simply too large. We \ncannot accept it. We cannot allow it to continue. We have to do \nsomething to fix this problem.\n\n  My bill will bring everybody up to 92 percent. It would not bring \ndown anybody. It would at least bring those 74-cents-on-the-dollar \nhospitals up to 92 cents on the dollar. They would still be well below \nthe national average--and well below the people who are above the \nnational average--but it would at least bring them out of poverty and \nallow them to provide the kind of quality health care we need.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to make these remarks. I \nyield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DAYTON pertaining to the introduction of S. 1600 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BAYH). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will just follow up on the remarks I \nmade previously concerning the wage index and share with our fellow \nMembers some of the information I have concerning this issue.\n  I have a letter from the Mobile/Baldwin County area hospitals. It was \nsent to me, Senator Shelby, and Congressman Callahan. I will share some \nof the things that are in it supporting the legislation I have offered. \nThey note this:\n\n       Because of the huge discrepancy in the Area Wage Index \n     which applies in Mobile and Baldwin Counties, Alabama as \n     compared to our neighboring areas of Pascagoula, Mississippi \n     and Pensacola, Florida, not to mention the even greater \n     discrepancy with other parts of the country, we are beginning \n     to face a critical shortage of skilled registered nurses with \n     which to staff our hospitals. In the last three months alone \n     we have lost at least 87 registered nurses from our area \n     labor pool to traveling nurse agencies and to facilities in \n     adjacent states. Collectively, we have over 200 registered \n     nurse vacancies in the hospitals of Mobile and Baldwin \n     Counties. . . .\n       We are literally unable to compete with the salaries that \n     are being offered these individuals because of the very low \n     (.80) Medicare Area Wage Index under which we must now labor.\n       Already our ability to handle the volume of patients being \n     seen in our emergency rooms has been hampered and the waiting \n     time has increased significantly. Already this summer we have \n     had occasions where one or more of our hospitals have had to \n     declare a ``Code Red'' status, meaning that they could not \n     accept any more patients in their facility that would require \n     intensive care due to a lack of staffed intensive care beds.\n\n  As a matter of fact, this weekend I was in an airport and talked to \nan administrator at one of our area hospitals. He told me for the first \ntime in years, they cannot accept more patients. This is a great \nhospital. My mother has been there a number of times; other relatives, \nincluding my father, have been hospitalized there. I said: You mean you \ndon't have beds or you don't have nurses?\n  He said: We don't have nurses. We have the beds. We don't have \nnurses.\n  This index situation is working in a perverse way so that when you \neconomize, when you reduce your cost and cut your salary and negotiate \ntoughly with nurses and pay them the most minimum salary you can get \naway with paying them, then they come back the next year and rate your \nwage costs lower. Then they want you to cut it again next year. This \nthing is getting out of sync.\n  We have nurses in Alabama--and I have heard this all over the State \nin talking to administrators--who go off for a week or two. They work \nlong hours at nearly twice the salaries they make in the State of \nAlabama. Then they quit working at the local hospitals where they have \nworked before. This is done because the majority of health care in \nhospitals in most areas of the country is Medicare/Medicaid work. So if \nyou are not paying a living wage, if you are not paying a basic amount \nfor those Medicare payments--this is our elderly who are most often \nhospitalized--then the net result of all that is the hospital gets \nsqueezed badly.\n  Last year, we made a good step in increasing the overall inflation \nindex for\n\n[[Page S11259]]\n\nhospitals. We had reduced that substantially as part of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997. It helped us create a surplus in this country, but \nwe realized that it was beginning to cut deeper and deeper and deeper \ninto hospitals. So this helped hospitals across the board.\n  I know the hospitals in more rural areas are at a double disadvantage \nbecause 60 percent of their reimbursement cost is based on the wage \nindex.\n  Again, in Mobile, one of the larger cities in the State, a city on \nthe coast, Mobile's wage index is 80. They get 80 cents on the dollar. \nThe average in America is $1. Some hospitals in America are being \nreimbursed at $1.50. So this is really a huge difference. That is \nalmost twice.\n  In Montgomery, another sizable city in the State of Alabama--Alabama \nis a State of 4 million people, an almost average State in America--it \nis being reimbursed at 74 cents on the dollar. That is half what you \nare getting reimbursed in some other areas of this country.\n  It is draining our qualified nursing personnel and endangering health \ncare, causing the poor to be poorer and the rich, in a way, to get \nricher. At least the poor will get poorer. Nobody is getting rich on \nMedicare reimbursement today.\n  I will share one more letter from the Baptist Health Care System of \nthe State of Alabama. I talked with Dennis Hall a number of times. I \nhave visited in several of his hospitals around the State of Alabama. \nHe is passionately of the belief that the wage index is devastating \ntheir health care system. He said:\n\n       The national crisis is affecting hospitals in Alabama in \n     dramatic ways. Most of the hospitals in Alabama, including \n     the very strong Baptist Health System, are losing money on \n     operations. We have counted on interest earnings on \n     reserves to offset losses. However, most institutions are \n     now facing losses on their reserves also.\n       Our total losses in operations for our year ended June 30, \n     2001 will be in excess of $21 million. Charity, Medicaid and \n     Medicare played a big role in causing these losses. We simply \n     cannot continue to sustain these operating losses. We \n     certainly cannot be adequately prepared to respond to bio-\n     terrorism should it strike one of our hospitals where we \n     serve.\n\n  Mr. President, I have also a letter from the Coffee Health Group. I \nvisited the Coffee Health Group. It is in Florence, AL, the Quad Cities \narea. There are a number of people in this area, a series of smaller \ncommunities in a fairly sizable metropolitan area.\n  This is what Carl Bailey writes me:\n\n       The wage index is a complicated issue that I truly believe \n     few understand. Nevertheless, you have asked us to help you \n     get some grasp of the problem by describing the impact of the \n     recruitment of a registered nurse from one of our Alabama \n     hospitals (``Hospital A'') to another institution (``Hospital \n     B'') that is already receiving higher Medicare payment due to \n     higher wage index.\n\n  Hospital B will pay the travel, lodging, and higher wages to recruit \nthe RNs. This additional cost to Hospital B actually increases the wage \nindex for Hospital B.\n  The hospital that is hiring a person at a higher wage and paying all \nthese costs then bills that to create a higher wage index.\n  This increase can only be paid from other areas because of budget \nneutrality.\n  Get that? This increase for Hospital B that is paying a higher wage \ncan only be paid from taking money from the other areas because of \nbudget neutrality. We only have a certain pot of money.\n  Therefore, Hospital A must share in the cost of paying for the \nincreased wages of Hospital B. Since Hospital A cannot replace this RN, \nHospital A's average wage decreases due to the loss of an employee with \na higher than average hourly rate.\n  You get that? Hospital A's, the losing hospital's wage index goes \ndown because their wage rate goes down because they lost one of their \nhigher paid people and one of their better people.\n  This lowers the wage index for Hospital A and because of budget \nneutrality further increases the wage index gain for Hospital B. To \nrespond to the shortage of staff, Hospital A then hires two or three \nnursing assistants to share the workload, reducing the number of \nnurses. This creates an even lower wage index for Hospital A which \ndecreases the wage index even more. It also decreases the quality of \ncare in Hospital A. Again, because of budget neutrality, the decrease \nin reimbursement to Hospital A is passed on as a higher wage index to \nHospital B. Hospital B is now in a better financial position to hire \nadditional employees from Hospital A than they were before, and the \ncycle continues.\n\n       Although this scenario takes three years to play out, the \n     mechanics are very real. We in Alabama have been living with \n     similar recruitment strategies and subsequent negative \n     reimbursement impact that has occurred in the past. Our loss \n     in the past cannot be recruited, but we must stop the flow of \n     Medicare funds from the ``have-nots'' to the ``haves.''\n\n  Mr. President, those are the points we are making. This affects \nhospitals all over America, States such as New York. Both Senators from \nNew York support wage index reform because their State has large \nnumbers of hospitals that are being adversely affected. It is not just \nwhat State or what area of the State you are from; the gap has grown \ntoo great, and the gap is widening and accelerating. It is not good for \nquality of health care in America. We have to do something about it.\n  Perhaps this is not the best bill to fix it, but I hope we can bring \nsome increased attention to it. I look forward to working on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for \nraising this very important issue. It is also an important issue to our \nproviders in my State also, I might add. According to the Iowa Hospital \nAssociation, providers in Iowa would get about an additional $25 \nmillion a year under this amendment. To put it simply, we are being \ndiscriminated against in our State and in a lot of rural areas, as I am \nsure Alabama is.\n  This critical issue is at the center of States' like Iowa that are \ntrying in vain to recruit and retain an adequate number of providers in \nrural areas. This is something of which I am very supportive. This is a \npoint in time where I wish I were chair of the Finance Committee and we \nhad a finance bill on the floor and we could take care of it right now.\n  The Senator raised this issue in good faith. He is right on the mark. \nWe have to change this wage index floor. We have to raise that floor. \nAlso, I say to my friend from Alabama, since we are now talking about \nthis issue, I ask him to look at another piece of legislation that I \nand others have introduced called the FAIR Act. The difference in \nStates between Medicare reimbursement for Medicare patients on a per \npatient basis vary widely. Some States are as low as about $3,000 per \nbeneficiary per year; some States are as high as $7,000 per beneficiary \nper year. In other words, if you are on Medicare in one State, the \nreimbursement rate for your State might be as high as $7,000; in \nanother State, it may be less than half that amount. In Iowa, we are \nNo. 50 out of the 50 States. I think Alabama is down pretty low with \nus. We need to close that gap. My bill would do just that as well as \naddress the wage index floor problem this amendment seeks to address.\n  My bill would take the national average and you say that no State can \ngo over 105 percent and no State can go under 95 percent. You would \nleave some leeway for different problems, but no State could go over \n105 percent and no State could go below 95 percent of the average. I \nask the Senator to take a look at that because that is something that \nwould even out some of the problems we have in Medicare reimbursements. \nBut the bottom line is simple. Any Medicare reform bill, whether it is \nattached to an appropriations bill or goes on its own, has to include a \nprovision to level the playing field and fix a system that is currently \nunfair and inequitable. Again, I would like like to accept the \nSenator's amendment and include it in this bill, but the Chair and \nRanking Member of the Senate Finance Committee have made it clear that \nthey will oppose any attempt to attach amendments that fall under the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee--including this amendment--to \nthis appropriations bill.\n\n  I wanted to mention that, and I thank the Senator for raising this \nissue. Count me on board to work with him to see what we can do.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think it would take a point of order to do this. I \nwanted to\n\n[[Page S11260]]\n\nraise this issue, and maybe others would like to speak on it. I would \nlike to go on to another issue. I have had my say at this point. \nPerhaps a vote would not be necessary on this amendment or on a point \nof order. It is a health care bill.\n  It is time to talk about one of the biggest problems we have in \nhealth care, which I believe is the wage index. I have been to \nhospitals and talked to administrators and CFOs, the people writing the \nchecks, and the heads of nursing, and they see people leave, driving up \nthe wage index at another hospital and reducing theirs even further. We \nhave to fix this.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is right on target on this issue.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator for his interest and leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I commend my distinguished colleague from \nAlabama for raising this important issue. I believe it has national \nimplications. There is certainly a problem in my state of Pennsylvania.\n  For those who are watching on C-SPAN II and don't understand the \nprocedures, it might be worth a word or two of explanation. This is a \nmatter for the Finance Committee, and they have the jurisdiction over \nthis matter and have lodged an objection to having it taken up on this \nbill.\n  So what we have to do is look for an opportunity to raise it in a \ncontext where there is a Finance Committee bill on the floor. At that \ntime, I think the Senator from Alabama will have a lot of support. I \nthank him for raising the issue at this time.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any Senator seeking recognition to \nintroduce an amendment, I ask our colleagues to come forward. We have \n29 amendments on the list on one side and 32 on the other, for a total \nof 61. We need to proceed to conclude this bill. The conference is \ngoing to be very lengthy. If we are to have the appropriations for the \nNational Institutes of Health, and the education bill, and the other \nmatters, we are going to have to move ahead and not have this folded \ninto a continuing resolution. I urge colleagues to come forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2044\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendments be set aside and that an amendment I have just sent to the \ndesk be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2044.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rarely come to the floor to offer \namendments on appropriations because, I have to say, especially in this \ncase, the chair and ranking member have done a phenomenal job under \nvery difficult circumstances to get us to this point. I admire their \nwork and their leadership and appreciate very much their extraordinary \nefforts as we have attempted to accelerate consideration of the \nappropriations bills.\n  I come to the floor to offer this amendment in part because I believe \nthis provides perhaps the only vehicle we will have to consider \nlegislation that I believe ought to have the opportunity to be \nconsidered before the end of this year. I offer the amendment on this \nbill in part because of the importance I think this legislation holds, \nnot only for firefighters but for the country as a whole.\n  When the planes crashed into the World Trade Center on September 11, \nthe shift had just changed at fire houses all across the country. In \nNew York, firefighters who had just worked through the night could have \ngone home, but they didn't. Without a moment's hesitation, they rushed \nto what we now call Ground Zero to try to save lives.\n  They climbed on the first pumper or ladder truck they saw. One group \nof firefighters even commandeered a city bus to get to the World Trade \nCenter as quickly as they could. Retired firefighters who heard what \nhad happened rushed from their homes. Within hours, we now know, 343 \nNew York City firefighters had lost their lives in the greatest \nterrorist attack in our Nation's history.\n  More than 7 weeks later, other firefighters, police, and rescue \nworkers continue to comb through the still smoldering pile at Ground \nZero, still risking their lives.\n  We have heard many words of praise for these heroes, and for their \nextraordinary efforts and for their first responders who risked their \nlives at the Pentagon, and in western Pennsylvania. They deserve every \nword of that praise, and far more.\n  As we honor them, it is important to remember that they are not \nalone.\n  Every day, in every State in America, firefighters, police officers \nand other emergency workers risk their lives to protect our safety. But \nin 18 States, they don't have the legal right to sit down with their \nemployers and talk about their own health and safety.\n  That is wrong, and I believe the time has come for those \ncircumstances to change.\n  That is why Senators Dodd and Gregg, and I are offering this \nbipartisan amendment today: the Public Safety Employer-Employee \nCooperation amendment.\n  Our amendment extends the basic right of collective bargaining to \nfirefighters, police officers, paramedics, and emergency medical \ntechnicians.\n  It guarantees public safety officers the right to form and join a \nunion, and the right to bargain collectively over hours, wages, and \nconditions of employment.\n  That is it.\n  There are things this amendment does not do, and I want to clarify \nand emphasize that.\n  It expressly forbids strikes or ``lockouts'' by public safety \nworkers. It exempts all States with State bargaining laws for public \nsafety workers that are equal to or greater than this proposal. And it \npreserves all management rights.\n  We know the essential role firefighters, police and other first \nresponders played on September 11.\n  We know the role Capitol Police played on October 15. When a member \nof my staff opened a letter containing anthrax, Capitol police officers \nwere immediately notified and were there immediately as well. They \nrisked their lives to protect us. As a result, six law enforcement \nofficers were exposed to the deadly bacteria. Today, every one of them \nis on the job.\n  Capitol Police are all working 12-hour, 14-hour days, 6 days a week, \nto protect us all; and they are all union members.\n  People who say that protecting public safety workers' basic rights \nwill somehow jeopardize the public safety simply do not understand the \ndedication of the men and women who take these jobs.\n  We owe them our thanks. We owe them the basic right to collective \nbargaining. We owe them this opportunity to look out for themselves in \nthe best way they know how, in their health, in their work, and in \ntheir lives.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues will look favorably on \nthis amendment. I commend the extra effort made by Senators Kennedy and \nDodd in particular, and Senator Gregg, who has been an outspoken \nadvocate and proponent of this legislation. I am grateful to them. I am \nespecially grateful for the opportunity this afternoon to offer this \namendment with their support.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank our leader, Senator Daschle, for \nthe introduction of amendment No. 2044 to this Health and Human \nServices appropriations. I welcome the opportunity to cosponsor this \nwith him.\n  So much of the Labor, HHR appropriations bill addresses the well \nbeing of our Nation's workers. We must meet the needs of all our \nworkers, including our public safety workers, who do so much for us. \nThe firefighters tell us that this amendment is their highest\n\n[[Page S11261]]\n\npriority. This amendment is the least we can do for them, in light of \nthe sacrifices they have made for our country.\n  This amendment is an important bipartisan effort to help protect our \nNation's public safety officers on the job. I have been pleased to work \nwith my Republican cosponsors, Senator Gregg, Senator DeWine, and \nSenator Snowe. This amendment will measurably add to the caliber of our \ndefense against threats to the security of our communities. It will \nalso further this country's historic commitment to collective \nbargaining. I can point out to the Senate the substance of this \namendment, in legislation, passed overwhelmingly from our Senate Labor \nand Human Resource Committee.\n  I know that no one in this room needs to be reminded of the heroic \nefforts made by the country's public safety officers in the last 10 \ndays. The pictures of tired, dust covered firefighters confronting \nunimaginable horror are permanently emblazoned in our minds.\n  The courage and dedication of those who died--including Peter Ganci, \nthe chief of the New York Fire Department; William Feehan, the first \ndeputy commissioner; and Mychal Judge, the chaplain of the Department--\nset a shining example for all of us. There were 344 firefighters and \nparamedics who died in the World Trade Center rescue effort. They were \nmembers of locals 94 and 854 of the International Association of \nFirefighters. And, just miles from the Capitol, hundreds of \nfirefighters risked their lives in the rescue efforts at the Pentagon. \nAmerica needs these men and women, now more than ever, and it is no \nexaggeration to say that we owe our lives to them.\n  This amendment will ensure that firefighters, police officers, \ncorrectional officers, and emergency medical personnel will be afforded \nthe fundamental right to bargain collectively with their employers. The \namendment guarantees the basic rights that are necessary to meet that \ngoal--to form and join a union; to bargain over hours, wages, and \nworking conditions; to sign legally enforceable contracts; and to deal \nwith an impasse in negotiations.\n  This proposal follows in the honorable traditions of our country's \nlabor laws, by recognizing the importance of collective bargaining to \nimprove job conditions, increasing worker safety, and improving \nproductivity. Most importantly, this amendment will lead to safer \nworking conditions for public safety officers and to enhanced safety \nfor the public that they serve.\n  As we now know all too well, firefighters, police officers, and \nemergency medical personnel serve in some of the country's most \ndangerous, strenuous, and stressful jobs. They are frequently asked to \nrisk--and sometimes give--their lives to protect the safety of others. \nWe have a moral obligation to do whatever we can to increase the safety \nof these critical jobs--and thereby to add to the Nation's defense \nagainst threats to the public's health and safety.\n  It is clear that this amendment will help us to meet these goals. The \nmen and women who serve on the front lines in providing firefighting \nservices, law enforcement services, and emergency medical services know \nwhat it takes to create safer working conditions. Ensuring that these \nprofessionals have a right to collective bargaining will give them a \nvoice in decisions that can literally make a life-or-death difference \non the job. Making such a difference for our country's public safety \nofficers will, by definition, improve our collective safety.\n\n  Available data prove that collective bargaining enhances safety. \nThese data show that States that lack collective bargaining laws have \ndeath rates for firefighters that are nearly double that of States in \nwhich bargaining takes place.\n  In States with collective bargaining, there were 1.5 firefighters \nkilled in the line of duty for every 10 thousand firefighters. In \nStates without collective bargaining, 2.5 out of every 10 thousand \nfirefighters were killed on the job. Similarly, in 1993, firefighters \nin 9 of the 10 States with the highest firefighters death rate lacked \ncollective bargaining protection.\n  This amendment will also save money for States and local communities. \nA study by the International Association of Fire Fighters shows that \nStates and municipalities that give firefighters the right to discuss \nworkplace issues have lower fire department budgets than States without \nsuch laws.\n  When workers who actually do the job are able to provide advice on \ntheir work conditions, there are fewer injuries, better morale, better \ninformation on new technologies, and more efficient ways to provide the \nservices.\n  The amendment also accomplishes its goals in a reasonable and \nmoderate way. The amendment requires that public safety officers be \ngiven the opportunity to bargain collectively; it does not require that \nemployers adopt agreements.\n  Nor does it regulate the content of any agreements that are reached. \nWhere States have collective bargaining laws that substantially provide \nfor the modest minimum standards set forth in the bill--as a majority \nof States already do--moreover, those States will be unaffected by the \nlegislation.\n  Where States do not have such laws, they may choose to enact them or \nto allow the Federal Labor Relations Authority to establish procedures \nfor bargaining between public safety officers and their employers. This \napproach respects existing State law and gives each State the authority \nto choose the way in which it will comply with the requirements set by \nthis amendment. States will have full discretion to make decisions \nregarding their implementation and enforcement of the basic rights set \nforth in this proposal.\n  This approach respects existing State law and gives each State the \nauthority to choose the way in which it will comply with the \nrequirements of this proposal. States will have full discretion to make \ndecisions regarding the implementation and enforcement of the basic \nrights in this amendment.\n  This amendment will not supersede State laws which already adequately \nprovide for the exercise of--or are more protective of--collective \nbargaining rights by public safety officers. This amendment is intended \nto ensure that public safety officers have a role in addressing their \nwages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment; and to improve \nthe safety and welfare of public safety officers and the communities \nthey serve.\n  It is a matter of basic fairness to give these courageous men and \nwomen the same rights that have long been enjoyed by other workers. \nThey put their lives on the line to protect us every day. They deserve \nto have an effective voice on the job, and improvements in their work \nconditions will benefit their entire community.\n  I commend my cosponsors for their leadership on this important \nproposal, and I urge the Senate to approve it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hollings are printed in Today's record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2044\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Daschle which deals with the rights of police officers and \nfirefighters--especially--firefighters to have the opportunity to \norganize in collective bargaining agreements.\n  This amendment is timely in light of what we have seen relative to \nthe commitment of our firefighters across the\n\n[[Page S11262]]\n\ncountry, along with our police officers and police personnel, in that \nit gives them rights which are given to most American Government \nemployees.\n  With the enactment of this language, we will have essentially covered \nthe majority of State and local employees in a consistent manner across \nthe country.\n  The language of this amendment simply requires States to provide \nminimum collective bargaining rights to their public safety employees \nin whatever manner the States choose. In other words, if the State has \nany form of collective bargaining, they are basically exempt from this \nbill.\n  It outlines certain rights that must be protected, but it leaves the \nmajority of decisions to State legislatures, and States that already \nhave the minimum collective bargaining protection, as outlined in the \nlegislation, will be exempt from Federal statutes, as will small \nmunicipalities and subdivisions.\n  The amendment also addresses the issue of the right to strike. As we \nknow, public employees do not have a right to strike, and this \namendment does nothing to advance that right to any public employee.\n  Further, it protects the right of each employee to join or refrain \nfrom joining a labor union organization. In other words, in States \nwhich have right-to-work laws, those right-to-work laws are not \nimpacted at all by this legislation.\n  This legislation is extremely important, in my opinion, at this time \nbecause it is a statement by the Congress of our understanding of the \nimportance of the jobs which firefighters and police officers do. We \nsaw in New York, obviously, and we saw in Washington that these \nindividuals put their lives on the line, and it is reasonable that they \nhave a fair opportunity to make their case in the form of a collective \nbargaining atmosphere which is consistent with other Government \nemployees and which is consistent with the laws in the States in which \nthey live and work should those States have collective bargaining \nagreements.\n  I strongly support this amendment. I appreciate the majority leader \nbringing it forward. It did pass the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions, of which I am the ranking member. There was not a \nrecorded vote on it, but I can assure my colleagues it was a \nsignificant majority who supported the bill.\n  I look forward to it being taken up here and adopted in the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDorgan be allowed to speak following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2044\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wish to speak briefly about the amendment Senator \nDaschle laid down which would allow firefighters, police officers, and \nemergency medical personnel basic collective bargaining rights; that is \nto say, the right to form a union and to bargain over hours and wages \nand working conditions.\n  In other words, what we are saying is the firefighters, the police \nofficers, the emergency medical personnel, the first responders on \nSeptember 11--and indeed I meet with them all across Minnesota--they \nwill be the first responders in all of our States if, God forbid, we \nhave to deal with other attacks that they have the right to join a \nunion, bargain collectively in order to be able to earn a decent \nliving, in order to have civilized working conditions, in order to be \nable to support their families.\n  I have to say on this last day of October of the year 2001, this is a \nno-brainer amendment, a no-brainer in that everybody should support it. \nIt is crystal clear. As many have said, we are redefining heroes and \nheroines. It is crystal clear people in our country that there is just \na reservoir of good feeling and strong support for these men and women. \nWhile we can have all of the benefit concerts and everybody can give \nall of the speeches in the world, enough speeches to deafen all the \ngods, the way we can actually show our support as Senators is to \nsupport this amendment, give the firefighters, give the police \nofficers, and give the emergency medical personnel the right to join a \nunion and bargain collectively.\n  My last point--and believe me, I will not do this, but I could \nliterally talk for the next 20 hours on this, and I will only talk for \n1 minute--I want this in the Record if it is not in the Record: \nWashington Post, A4, ``Quick Action Urged on Economic Stimulus.''\n  We have some quotes from several members of the administration \nbasically saying if we extend the health insurance subsidies--in other \nwords, people are out of work, it is terrifying, now you have lost your \njob, now you do not have any health care coverage for yourself and, \nmaybe more importantly, for your children--that if in fact we pass a \nrecovery bill that helps people to afford health care coverage for \nthemselves and their loved ones, workers will lose the incentive to \nsearch for new jobs.\n  Coming from several members of the administration, the insulting \nassumption is if we were to help out unemployed workers with health \ncare benefits so they could afford coverage for themselves and their \nloved ones, being lazy, they might not then actually find a job and \nwork.\n  This is outrageous. I do not even know if I need to say anything \nmore. I said I would only speak briefly, so I will not say any more. It \nis just outrageous.\n  We as Democrats have to have an economic recovery act that speaks to \nthe unemployment benefits, speaks to health care coverage, speaks to \njob training, workforce development, speaks to investment and \naffordable housing or rebuilding crumbling schools, speaks to the whole \ninfrastructure of public safety in the country, creates jobs, puts \nmoney in the economy, and enables people to purchase.\n\n  We ought to do that. We ought to do it now. If Democrats cannot stand \nfor these families--firefighters, police, and other working families--\nand if we cannot do this now, then who are we and for what do we stand? \nI am confident we will have a strong package of benefits. This is \nsomething for which we have to fight hard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will speak about an amendment I have pending, but I \nwill follow on the comments of my colleague from Minnesota. We do not \nhave the option, in my judgment, of leaving this session of Congress \nwithout passing a package of legislation that will try to stimulate \nthis economy. This economy was on its knees going into September 11. It \nwas a weak economy in a great deal of trouble.\n  On September 11, we had the cowardly terrorists acts that cut a hole \nin this country's economy. I fear very much that perhaps most of us do \nnot fully understand how and why the economy hurts. We need to err, if \nwe err, on the side of taking bold, aggressive action to stimulate the \neconomy.\n  Stimulating an economy is done by creating incentives for investment \nand incentives for consumption. Part of the incentives for consumption \nare to assist those in this country who, during a tough economy, are \nlosing their jobs. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have lost their \njobs and have unemployment compensation that is inadequate, for too \nshort a duration.\n  Part of the stimulus package has to be to help those families, as \nwell. That money is invested immediately into the economy in the form \nof consumption. I think it is important to do a range of things: \nIncentivize consumption, incentivize investment, and a range of other \napproaches to stimulate the economy and give lift to the American \neconomy. We are likely in a recession. We do not know how deep or how \nlong. I know we cannot afford to adjourn this Congress without working \ntogether with the President, in a bipartisan way, to create a stimulus \npackage that is serious. This is not just politics as usual. This is \nserious business.\n  The question of whether the American people have opportunity and hope \nis dependant on whether we have an economy that provides an expanded \neconomic base, and therefore creates that hope and creates that \nopportunity for jobs.\n\n[[Page S11263]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2024\n\n  On the subject I want to discuss, I have an amendment now pending, or \nmaybe it was set aside temporarily, but I offered the amendment, and I \nwould like to get it approved this afternoon. The amendment deals with \nsomething called the advance passenger information system, a system \nthat now exists in this country. It is for those who are entering our \ncountry from foreign lands. For those bringing a commercial airliner \ninto this country and for those who will disembark today, we have what \nis called an advance passenger information system. Those airlines will \nsend to this country a list of the passengers. Our Customs Service, the \nFBI, and other Federal law enforcement agencies can check names against \nlists that we have to make sure we are not allowing someone into our \ncountry, as a guest, who might be a known or suspected terrorist or \nsomeone who is associated with terrorists or someone who is on a list \nthat we do not want to enter this country.\n  There are lists of people who have committed acts of terror, criminal \nacts, people we do not want to be allowed into this country.\n  Today, we have the advance passenger information systems. Most \nairliners voluntarily comply with it and send the information to us. \nNot all airlines, however. About 15 percent of the passengers come into \nthis country without having their name on a manifest that is sent to \nour country to be run against one of the lists.\n  Let me describe, among others, the airlines that do not voluntarily \ncomply: We do not get this information from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, \nKuwait, Egypt, Jordan, just to name a few. Does anyone here think it \nwould be important we would get that information from those countries? \nYou better believe it is important. Yet under the voluntary system we \ndo not get it.\n  I chaired a hearing with the Customs Commissioner and the INS \nCommissioner. We talked about securing this country's borders, among \nother things. Mr. Potter, the Customs Commissioner, said we must make \nthis advance passenger information system mandatory. It is now only \nvoluntary, and we are not getting all the information we need in order \nto process who is coming into our country. We need all this \ninformation. We need information on people who are going to visit this \ncountry from Pakistan, from Saudi Arabia, from Kuwait, and others.\n  I introduced a piece of legislation in the Senate that says the \nadvanced passenger information system shall be mandatory. The Senate \npassed it. It was part of the counterterrorism bill, which is exactly \nwhere it should have been because it deals with border security. It \nwent to conference with the House of Representatives. Some Members in \nthe House of Representatives, citing ``committee jurisdiction,'' \ndecided they were going to knock this out. So that bill went to the \nPresident, the counterterrorism bill, was signed into law, is now the \nlaw of the land, and does not contain this provision. The result is a \nprovision the Senate previously enacted is now not part of the law \ndealing with counterterrorism.\n  The result is that today there is an airplane landing from Pakistan, \nairplanes coming from Saudi Arabia, from Kuwait, from Egypt, from \nJordan, and more, whose passenger list has not been provided to our \nCustoms Service, our FBI, and other law enforcement agencies. Why? \nBecause those airlines do not comply. It is voluntary. They don't have \nto comply.\n  Just yesterday, I understand, Kuwait has signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding. That is good; that is progress. It seems to me it is \nbusiness as usual for some in this Congress to say: What is most \nimportant to me is not national security. Some Members say: What is \nimportant to me is the jurisdiction of my committee. If we didn't bless \nit, if we didn't put our stamp on it, if we didn't have our mitts on it \nin some way, we will not allow it to proceed.\n\n  The entire Senate passed this provision and it got knocked out in \nconference last week. So the President signs a bill that does not \ninclude this amendment. I have offered it again. Does it belong on an \nappropriations bill? No, it doesn't. But I will offer it on this bill \nand every other bill until it becomes law. It is absurd to think we \nwill deal with national security without securing our borders. Securing \nour borders does not mean closing our borders, it means understanding \nwho is coming into this country as guests of ours. That is the whole \napproach.\n  The visa approach is to say people coming into this country are \nguests of our country. Mr. President, 57 million people come in by air \nevery year; 45,000 people today come into this country by commercial \nairliner, 45,000 people whose names are not run against the Customs, \nthe FBI, and other lists. Why are those 45,000 names not able to be run \nagainst those lists? Because we have some people who, in my judgment, \nare thickheaded. Committee jurisdiction is more important to them than \nnational security.\n  That is strong language, I know. But it upsets me that we are so \nsmall minded in some parts of this Congress that we cannot see the \nbigger picture. The bigger picture is things have changed. The \nSeptember 11 terrorist attack that murdered thousands of American \ncitizens changed a lot in this country. The anthrax letters that have \nnow killed some American citizens and caused such chaos and concern \nacross this country have changed a lot of things. It apparently has not \nchanged the mindset of some who are busily guarding their tiny little \narea of committee jurisdiction.\n  With regret to those folks, but not at all apologetic, I say we \npassed this provision once, and I intend to offer it again and again \nand again. I intend to have a vote on it. My hope is it will be \naccepted by voice vote. We will go to conference and get this done in \nthis conference. If not, it will be the next conference. If not, then \nit will be the next conference. I simply will not allow people who \nthink about jurisdiction over national security to win this issue. This \nought to be done. It should have been done last week, but it wasn't. It \nought to be done this afternoon, again, in the Senate to say to those \nwho blocked it: You will not block it for long.\n  These are extraordinarily difficult times for our country. We face \ntwo very significant challenges. One challenge deals with national \nsecurity--and that is not an insignificant challenge. It is about as \ntough a challenge as we faced in many decades.\n  Second, we face the challenge of dealing with our country's economy. \nMy colleague from Minnesota described that. I just came from a caucus \nin which we discussed it for an hour and a half. This country will meet \nthose challenges. There are no people in the world better prepared or \nbetter equipped, no people I have more confidence in than the American \npeople to meet any challenge at any time.\n  This is not a time for us to shrink back in fear. This is a time for \nus to be bold and to join together in action that we know will prepare \nus and will secure us and will allow us to have the kind of opportunity \nthat we want for us and our children.\n  One small piece of that is this amendment that is now pending that I \nhope will be approved by the Senate this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to express strong support for what \nour good friend from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, has addressed. I am \nvery hopeful it will be successful on whatever legislation he offers \nit, and is signed into law. It is a provision we have included in \nstrong bipartisan legislation which Senator Brownback and I have \nintroduced. The reasons for it are so compelling. He has outlined those \nreasons this afternoon. I congratulate and thank him for his leadership \non this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the matter now \nbefore the Senate is the Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The matter before the Senate is the Daschle \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2024\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we return to \nthe Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two managers are not in the Chamber, but \nthere has been an understanding that\n\n[[Page S11264]]\n\nthe Dorgan amendment could be accepted by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2024.\n  The amendment (No. 2024) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the legislation \nbefore us, and particularly I want to take this opportunity to thank \nthe chairman and ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee, as \nwell as members of that subcommittee, because they have included some \nvery important pieces in this legislation that deal with issues before \nthe Senate Finance Committee of which I am a member. I would like to \nspeak about those provisions and explain some of the subsequent action \nwe anticipate over the next 12 months.\n  This is obviously a very important bill. There are some key \nprovisions in it that relate to the work of the Finance Committee. \nFirst, I thank the Appropriations Committee for its action on the \nsocial services block grant. Earlier this year, I wrote a letter to the \ncommittee leaders requesting that funding for this key program be \nrestored to the levels agreed to in the 1996 Welfare Reform Act.\n  State and local governments rely on this key block grant, that we \ncall the social services block grant, to address a range of human \nservice needs, particularly for vulnerable children, families, elderly, \nand persons with disabilities.\n  The bill before us would give States needed flexibility to transfer \nsome of the funds they receive under the Temporary Assistance to Needy \nFamilies Program to the Social Services Block Grant Program. Many \nGovernors have asked for this flexibility. I am glad that the \nAppropriations Committee has acted accordingly.\n  I also note the bill's report language favoring improved health care \nin rural America, including more equitable Medicare payments. While the \nappropriations report language is not binding on the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services within the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, I appreciate the support for the Finance Committee's \nefforts to make Medicare payments more fair for providers in rural \nAmerica.\n\n  For years I have worked, along with other colleagues, to sustain and \nsupport rural communities. As a result, Medicare legislation has passed \nin recent years to take significant steps to bring greater equity to \nrural America but still not enough equity, hence the report language, \nand hence the need for the Finance Committee to do greater work in this \narea.\n  I will give an example. My Finance Committee colleagues and I have \nsuccessfully worked to make the Critical Access Hospital designation \nmore widely available, allowing small rural hospitals to actually keep \ntheir doors open; otherwise, they would be out of business and we would \nnot have health care in those parts of rural America.\n  As a second point, we worked to begin eliminating the bias of the \nMedicare Disproportionate Share Program against rural hospitals, and, \nlastly, to protect small rural facilities against adverse effects from \nthe new outpatient payment system.\n  As I said, we still have a long way to go. So I am working with my \nFinance Committee colleagues to craft further legislation that will \nmake Medicare more equitable as part of our broader efforts to \nstrengthen Medicare. I plan to work to ensure Finance Committee \napproval of such legislation next year, in 2002. And I look forward to \nthe support of Appropriations Committee members when it reaches the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  On another point, appropriators have recognized the importance of \nenhancing education opportunities for Medicare providers, an issue I \nhave been working on for the past 10 months with colleagues on my own \nFinance Committee. There is broad recognition that health care \nproviders participating in Medicare should have access to timely and \nclear information about changes to the program.\n  Before the Senate leaves for the year, I expect to introduce some of \nthis legislation on which we have reached agreement, after these months \nof work with Senators Murkowski, Baucus, and Kerry, to enhance Medicare \nprovider education, improve communication between Health and Human \nServices and health care providers out in the field, and streamline \npaperwork burdens among other things this bill does.\n  Providing more money to the Medicare Integrity Program for provider \neducation is one aspect of the legislation, and the Appropriations \nCommittee affirmed their support in its committee report of the bill \nthat is now before us.\n  I applaud, specifically, the efforts of Senator Bayh of Indiana--\nthere are others who worked with him whom I will not name--to require \nthe General Accounting Office report to the committees of jurisdiction \non the status of HIPAA's administrative simplification regulations. \nObviously, I look forward to receiving that report in the Finance \nCommittee, and working with my colleagues to implement administrative \nsimplification in a commonsense, rational way so that well-intended \nlegislation will actually accomplish its goals without hurting innocent \nprograms, peoples, or facilities.\n  For today, the good news is that we have already taken steps in the \nFinance Committee to address immediate problems with administrative \nsimplification. Senator Baucus and I have worked closely with Senator \nCraig of Idaho and Senator Dorgan of North Dakota to introduce \nlegislation--and we did this just yesterday--allowing States, counties, \nhealth care providers, and health plans a much needed additional 1 year \nto comply with the ``transactions and code sets'' regulation.\n\n  Our bill will give everyone covered by the rule additional time to \nplan, implement, and finance the systems changes required under that \nrule. This is especially important for State and local offices, the \npublic health infrastructure, and, most importantly, the patients who \nwe all want to serve so that they continue to receive timely access to \nthese benefits.\n  I pledge my full support to consider the General Accounting Office's \nrecommendations on administrative simplification in the Finance \nCommittee next year.\n  I also continue to applaud appropriators for their decision to \nincrease funding for survey and certification activities of the Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services. For years, I have called attention \nto the need for nursing homes to be examined more carefully. And this \ncannot be done without the additional funding. The committee's \nallocation for this purpose represents an $18.5 million increase over \nthe 2001 year level.\n  I am pleased to note that the bill proposes a $20 million increase in \nfunding to the Administration on Aging for the Family Caregiver \nProgram, which supports our Nation's everyday heroes--family \ncaregivers--to a level of $140 million. As the author of this \nlegislation that was passed as part of the Older Americans Act \nreauthorization last year, I thank the appropriators for their \ncontinued support of what I consider an important program that puts us \nwell on the way of recognizing the economic contribution, as well as \nthe quality of life contribution of family caregivers.\n  Finally, I commend the appropriators for their support of the Safe \nand Stable Families Act. This is a broadly supported program that \nprovides crucial services to at-risk families. I look forward to \nworking with Chairman Baucus to reauthorize that program this year with \nincreased funding levels.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for 10 minutes and that we move from the pending \namendment so I may offer another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, that Alabama accent got me toward the end. \nWhat did the Senator say?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I asked unanimous consent to move from debate on the \npending amendment so I may offer a new amendment, one that is approved \non the list.\n\n[[Page S11265]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the two managers are not here, but I am \nsure they would agree to this. It is my understanding that at the \nappropriate time the Senator from Alabama will withdraw his amendment. \nIs that the one that is now pending?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. On the previous one, I do expect that I will not ask \nfor a vote. On the one I am offering today, I believe we have reached \nan accord by altering my original language and it will be accepted.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the Senator wanted to speak for 10 \nminutes and then offer an amendment after that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2045\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, in this country, I have come to \nrealize we have a very large student loan program which provides great \nbenefits to a lot of American children and students who are not \nchildren in college. I am offering an amendment today that will deal \nwith one of the more serious problems in that program that has created \nquite a good deal of fraud.\n  The amendment I submit would require the General Accounting Office to \nconduct a study on Federal student loan disbursements to students who \nattend foreign schools and ask them to report on the fraud, waste, and \nabuse in the Federal Family Education Loan Program as it relates to \nstudents receiving funding in order to attend foreign schools.\n  Study abroad can certainly be a wonderful experience for students, \none we ought to encourage. It is something of which more and more \nstudents are availing themselves. I certainly celebrate that and \nencourage it. I do not oppose, as we do today, some form of student \nloan aid to students who wish to participate in the foreign educational \nexperience. It can be a very enriching time for a student.\n  We do need to ensure, however, that the program involves study and \nnot a European vacation at the expense of hard-working American \ntaxpayers for whom a visit to the ballpark may be beyond their budget.\n  In recent years, there have been a number of criminal cases of so-\ncalled students falsely claiming they are attending foreign schools, \ndirecting that their student loan checks be paid directly to them as \nthe law will allow and not to the school, and then taking the money and \nspending it on themselves and not even attending the foreign school at \nall.\n  This fraud has been documented with many examples listed in the 1997 \nDepartment of Education inspector general's report. I believe the \nFederal Family Education Loan Program is at great risk of fraud unless \nwe institute some sound controls immediately.\n  In the United States, student loan checks, if you go to a college in \nthe United States, are made out to the school and the student. If the \nschool doesn't get the check and tuition is not paid, they don't \nendorse it; the check can't be cashed. Both the student and the school \nhave to endorse the check, and the tuition is thereby paid with \ncertainty.\n  With regard to foreign schools, the checks are made out simply to the \nstudents routinely. Since 1995, there have been at least 25 felony \nconvictions of students who fraudulently claimed they were attending a \nforeign school and then they just cashed the Government loan check and \nsimply did not attend class.\n  Of course, these are only the students who were caught in this \nfraudulent activity. I have no doubt that there are many more who have \nnot been apprehended.\n  This is why we should take action. We must prevent cases such as this \none. Mr. Conrad Cortez claimed to be such a student. He applied for \nstudent loans. In March of 2000, he admitted to charges of submitting \n19 fraudulent student loan applications over a 3-year period. He pled \nguilty before a Federal judge to numerous counts of mail fraud, bank \nfraud, and Social Security account number fraud in the State of \nMassachusetts. The prosecutor in that case told the court that Cortez \nwas responsible for dozens of auto loans filed outside Massachusetts, \nin Florida and in Texas.\n  The absolute disregard for the American taxpayers is epitomized by \nthe activities of Mr. Conrad Cortez. He was living high at the expense \nof American taxpayers and in violation of law by filing false documents \nto receive loans and money from the Federal Government.\n  During the period from 1996 through 1999, he bought gifts for his \nfriends, including jewelry and cars, paid for private tennis lessons--I \nguess he might have thought that was educational--made a downpayment on \na house, sent some money back to his native Colombia, ate in the best \nrestaurants, and even paid restitution for a previous charge of \ndefrauding the Government, all with taxpayers' money. It was a \nfraudulent loan he had claimed.\n  His fraud only ended when he was turned in by his sister's boyfriend \nwho claimed that Mr. Cortez had used his identity to obtain additional \nloans. In fact, Mr. Cortez was about to help himself to $800,000 worth \nof loans that you and I would pay for out of our Federal income tax. He \nhad filed 37 false claims in all, spending the money as fast as it \narrived.\n  The inspector general's office of the Department of Education, with \nthe FBI and the attorney general's office in Boston, combined forces to \napprehend him before he could get all of the money he had claimed \nthrough these false loans. He did, however, pocket about $300,000 \nbefore he was caught.\n  This is a perfect example of how this program is at risk and is not \nbeing managed properly. Currently the methodology for approving and \nreleasing student loan funds is vulnerable. Current law says that a \nstudent may request a check be issued directly to him or her when \nclaiming that they are attending a foreign school, and a check will be \nsent directly to them without the requirement of a cosignature by the \nschool.\n  The Office of Inspector General at the Department of Education found \nthat the number of students claiming to attend foreign schools and \napplying for loans increased each academic year from 1993 through 1997 \nand went from 4,594 students to 10,715 students in just 4 years, more \nthan doubling.\n\n  The later figures since that date of 1997 indicate that the loan \nnumbers for foreign education continue to increase. Indeed, in 1998 to \n1999, there were 12,000 loan applications from American students \nclaiming to attend foreign schools.\n  The question then comes, Why are we paying to send students to \nforeign schools at all? These are American taxpayers' dollars flowing \nto foreign economies where the standard of education often is not as \ngood as the education we have.\n  Certainly, our education system in the United States--our colleges \nand universities--is not overcrowded. It certainly has the capacity to \nhandle more students. We need to ask that question to some degree.\n  I would support some assistance in the form of loans or aid to people \nwho would attend school in a foreign country for a year or two. But I \nhave serious doubts about whether this country ought to pay for a full \ndegree course, 4, 5, 6 years, through subsidized loans and grant \nprograms to students who choose to further their education in another \ncountry where they will not be accredited according to the standards of \nthe United States.\n  I had attempted to raise that issue. I do believe we have not had \nsufficient hearings on it. We have not gone into this in some depth. \nCertainly educating young people through allowing them to be exposed to \nforeign education programs can have some benefit. But I think we need \nto look at curtailing that. As a matter of comity and working with the \nmanagers of this bill, they did not think this was the appropriate time \nto move forward on a limit of just how many years a person ought to be \nable to get Federal subsidies to attend foreign universities. So I have \ntaken that out of this amendment.\n  Basically, what our amendment would do would be to require a GAO \nstudy to find out exactly what is going wrong with this program and to \nmake sure that it is tightened up so that these fraudulent activities \ncannot continue.\n  This report will compare the oversight controls for loans dispensed \nto students attending foreign schools and domestic institutions and \nexamine the default rates at foreign schools that\n\n[[Page S11266]]\n\nenroll American students receiving federally guaranteed student loans \nto determine the number of students that are receiving loans for \nmultiple years.\n  My amendment will also require the GAO to make recommendations for \nlegislative changes that would be required to ensure the integrity of \nthe Federal Family Educational Loan Program. It will help us to get \nthis information we need so that we can have a complete and accurate \npicture and then Congress should be able to take legislative action to \nstop this abuse.\n  We have now, as I understand it, an agreement to spend over $600 \nbillion in discretionary money in this year's budget. By any standard, \nthat is a lot of money. I think sometimes we see the big billion dollar \nnumbers so often that we are not impressed at all when somebody comes \nup and says, well, this person got $300,000 fraudulently. We just don't \npay attention to it.\n\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for almost 15 years, and I put a lot of \npeople in jail for defrauding the Federal Government. I know there are \ngood laws that work to help apprehend thieves. I know there are some \nareas in which our laws are weak. I know there are procedural methods \nby which Federal agencies can make it much more difficult to allow a \nperson to defraud the Government. I am sure this person who got \n$300,000 is not going to be able to pay restitution of $300,000 unless \nhe can figure out a third way to defraud the Government to pay \nrestitution. He is not going to pay us back, the truth be known. We \nwill never get that money back. It is lost. Decent, honest people who \ndo not get a vacation to Disney World will be paying for his \nextravagant lifestyle, his fraudulent activities, and we ought to \ntighten up these procedures. Every day that I come to work I have in my \nmind a commitment to make sure that we have as much accountability in \nour Federal system as possible. I think sometimes we pay too little \nattention to it. I have a program I call ``Integrity Watch,'' and it is \njust a way I focus on abuses in the system that I think could be \ncorrected. And we will try to move to correct those problems.\n  I thank the Chair for the time. I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I offer my amendment I referred to \npreviously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2045.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Inspector General of the Department of Health \n  and Human Services to audit all Federal amounts allocated for AIDS \n   prevention programs and to report to Congress concerning programs \n    offering sexually explicit workshops using any of such amounts)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, over 765,000 people in the United States have \n     been diagnosed with the virus that causes AIDS since 1981, \n     and over 442,000 deaths have occurred in the United States as \n     a result of the disease;\n       (2) Federal AIDS prevention funds should be used to provide \n     resources, training, technical assistance, and infrastructure \n     to national, regional, and community-based organizations \n     working to educate the public on the virus that causes AIDS \n     and stopping the spread of the disease;\n       (3) recent reports from the Associated Press highlight the \n     use of Federal AIDS prevention money to conduct sexually \n     explicit workshops for homosexual men and women;\n       (4) such sexually explicit workshops teach homosexual men \n     and women how to write erotic love stories and how to use sex \n     toys for solo and partner sex; and\n       (5) Federal AIDS prevention funds should not be used to \n     promote sexual activity and behavior and potentially transmit \n     the disease that such funds were allocated to fight.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services shall conduct an \n     audit of all Federal amounts allocated for AIDS prevention \n     programs and report to Congress concerning programs offering \n     sexually explicit workshops using such dollars.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I offer the amendment and note that it has eliminated \ncertain language from it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/31/senate-section/article/S11266-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11266-S11268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I rise today to talk about the economic stimulus package \nthat is being discussed and debated in both Houses of Congress.\n  When it became apparent that our economy was weakening, those of us \nwho have special responsibilities for the budget--the leaders of the \nHouse Budget Committee and the Senate Budget Committee--got together \nand agreed on a bipartisan, bicameral basis on certain principles for \nan economic stimulus package. These were the chairman and ranking \nmember of the House Budget Committee and the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Budget Committee.\n  After several weeks of work, we were able to agree on a bipartisan \nbasis on a set of principles to apply to the stimulus package. We \nagreed on an overall principle that an economic stimulus package should \nbe based on the recognition that long-term fiscal discipline is \nessential to sustained economic growth. We agreed that measures to \nstimulate the economy should be limited in time so that as the economy \nrecovers, the budget regains a surplus at least equal to the surplus in \nSocial Security. And that any short-term economic stimulus should not \nresult in higher long-term interest rates.\n  We went on to agree to the objectives, the timing, the rapid impact, \nthe sunset, the targets, and the size of any economic stimulus package. \nAgain, this was on a bipartisan basis and involved the leaders of both \nthe Senate Budget Committee and the House Budget Committee.\n  On objectives, we agreed that an economic stimulus package should \nrestore consumer and business confidence, increase employment and \ninvestment, and help those most vulnerable in an economic downturn. On \ntiming, we agreed that Congress should assemble an economic stimulus \npackage with dispatch, aiming for passage within 3 to 4 weeks of our \nreport which was done on October 4.\n  On rapid impact, we agreed that a substantial portion of the fiscal \nimpact should be felt within 6 months.\n  On sunset, we agreed that all economic stimulus proposals should \nsunset within 1 year to the extent practicable.\n  On targets, we agreed that an economic stimulus package should be \nbroad based, rather than industry specific, and that policies should \nachieve the greatest possible stimulus per dollar spent be, and should \nbe, directed to individuals who are most likely to spend the additional \nafter-tax income and businesses most likely to increase spending and \nemployment.\n  On size, we agreed that the economic stimulus package should be equal \nto roughly 1 percent of gross domestic product, which would be $100 \nbillion, but take into account what we had already done at that point, \nwhich was some $40 billion. That would mean a floor of at least $60 \nbillion of economic stimulus.\n  And on offsets, we agreed to uphold the policy of repaying the \ngreatest amount of national debt feasible between 2002 and 2011; that \noutyear offsets should make up over time for the cost of any near-term \neconomic stimulus.\n  With those principles in mind, we can now apply them to the various \nproposals that are out there. Senator Baucus, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, has released a proposal, and we find in looking at \nthe elements of Senator Baucus' proposal--we matched them with the \nprinciples that were agreed to on a bipartisan basis--that his package \npasses on each and every principle that had been agreed to.\n  On the question of temporary, on a bipartisan basis we agreed that \nproposals should sunset within 1 year. Senator Baucus' package provides \nfor that.\n  On rapid impact, we said a substantial portion should be out within 6\n\n[[Page S11267]]\n\nmonths. Senator Baucus' proposal has all of his impact in the first \nyear.\n  On size, we said approximately $60 billion. Senator Baucus' proposal \nhas $70 billion in this fiscal year but actually costs less than that \nover the 10 years because some of the things that provide lift now \nactually will generate revenue later on.\n  On targeting, we said the stimulus dollars should go to those most \nlikely to spend them. Senator Baucus' proposal includes $14 billion of \nrebates to those who were not included in the first package of rebates \nand $33 billion in worker relief targeted to low- and middle-income \nAmericans who are the most likely to spend the money.\n  On the question of not hurting our long-term fiscal condition, \nSenator Baucus' proposal has virtually no effect on the surplus after \nthis fiscal year.\n  His proposal clearly passes each of the tests.\n  If we apply those same principles to the House package, we get quite \na different result. In fact, we find that they fail each of the tests. \nNot just one of them, not two of them; the House proposal fails each \nand every test that was agreed to on a bipartisan basis by those of us \nmost responsible for the budget.\n  With respect to temporary, the House bill has 71 percent of its tax \ncuts as permanent. There is no temporary package. It is largely a \npermanent package. So that fails the first test of being temporary.\n  Second, on the question of rapid impact, we said a substantial \nmajority of the fiscal impact should be felt within 6 months. But in \nthe House package, nearly 40 percent of the 10-year cost is after this \nyear. That is not a stimulus package. A stimulus is designed to give \nlift to the economy now, not 2003, not 2004, and yet 40 percent of the \ncost of the House package is after the year 2002. That clearly fails \nthe principle of rapid impact.\n  On size, we said $60 billion as a starting point, as a floor. The \nHouse package is $162 billion over 10 years. That is far in excess of \nwhat the President called for. He said $60 billion to $75 billion. This \nhas a cost of $162 billion.\n  On the question of targeting, the House package has 35 percent of the \ntax cuts going to the wealthiest 1 percent. We on a bipartisan basis \nagreed to the principle that stimulus ought to go to those most likely \nto spend the money. That is what will lift the economy. That is what \nwill provide stimulus. But the House package disproportionately goes to \nthe wealthiest 1 percent. Those are the very people most likely to save \nthe money, not to spend it.\n  However meritorious savings may be--and goodness knows I am an \nadvocate for savings--that does not stimulate the economy. The thing \nthat stimulates the economy, according to every economist who came and \ntestified before the Budget Committee, is if people and companies spend \nthe money that they get, and spend it now--not 2 years from now, not 3 \nyears from now, but now. Now is when the economy is weak. Now is when \nwe need stimulus.\n  This morning's economic report on the last quarter of economic growth \nshows we are in negative territory. It makes the point as clearly as it \ncan be made that we need economic stimulus now--not 2 years from now, \nnot 3 years from now but now.\n\n  Madam President, while the House package has 35 percent of the \nbenefits going to the wealthiest 1 percent, the bottom 60 percent of \nthe income category get only 19 percent of the benefits. Yet those are \nthe people who are the most likely to spend the money and give lift to \nthe economy. So the House package violates that principle.\n  Finally, on the question of a package not worsening our long-term \nfiscal condition, the House package has a cost of $171 billion when you \ninclude the interest costs beyond the year 2002. In other words, every \ndollar of that part of their stimulus package would be coming out of \nthe Social Security trust fund surplus.\n  In essence, they are taking payroll tax dollars from people in this \ncountry and giving the money in an income tax cut that goes \ndisproportionately to the wealthiest 1 percent. That stands stimulus on \nits head. That is taking money from the people who are most likely to \nspend it and giving it to people who are most likely to save it.\n  That is not what stimulus is all about. That cannot be the result. I \njust want to make clear to my colleagues, as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, I will not accept this kind of result. I will use every \ndevice available to me to stop any package similar to what the House \npassed.\n  Given the ability of a Senator to stop a package, I can assure my \ncolleagues, this is not going to happen because I am not going to let \nit happen, and there will be plenty of others who will join me. We are \nnot going to let it happen because it should not happen. This is not a \nstimulus package; it is a political package.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury said it very well when asked about the \nHouse package. He called it show business. This is no time for show \nbusiness; this is time for real business. This is time for the business \nof America. This is the time to have a stimulus package that really \ndoes the job and does not abandon fiscal discipline for the long term \nby putting upward pressure on interest rates that would undo all the \ngood we are trying to accomplish by a package of fiscal stimulus.\n  When we go to the question of the plan that was released yesterday by \nSenator Grassley, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, \nand apparently now adopted by the Senate Republican caucus, we have \nlooked at each of the measures, each of the principles that had earlier \nbeen agreed to on a bipartisan basis, and we have graded the Grassley \npackage. Here is what we found.\n  On the question of temporary--the principle was the stimulus should \nsunset within 1 year--what we find is that 82 percent of the Grassley \npackage is not temporary; 82 percent is permanent tax cuts. That \nabsolutely fails the test of temporary.\n  Why do we have that test? We have that test because every economist \nwho has come to us has said: Look, you have to marry fiscal stimulus \nwith long-term fiscal discipline; otherwise, you will put upward \npressure on interest rates, and, guess what. You will undo all of the \npotential good of a fiscal stimulus package. You will put fiscal policy \nat war with monetary policy, and while you are giving lift to the \neconomy with fiscal stimulus, you will be suppressing the economy by \nincreasing interest rates.\n  This principle is there for a reason, and the reason is, as Secretary \nRubin, who is the former Secretary of the Treasury who did such a \nbrilliant job in the Clinton administration, made clear to us, you have \nto be careful while you are providing fiscal stimulus to couple it with \nlong-term fiscal discipline.\n\n  We all understand, because of the tax cuts that were provided \nearlier, because of the attacks on our country, because of the need to \nrebuild, because of the continuing economic weakness, this country is \nheaded into deficits in the fiscal year we have just ended.\n  We are not talking just about trust fund deficits; we are talking \nabout deficits that mean we are going to be using every penny of the \nMedicare trust fund surplus this year to pay for other items.\n  We are going to be using every penny of the Social Security trust \nfund surplus this year to pay for other items, and we are going to be \nspending beyond that. We are not only taking all of the trust fund \nsurpluses, but we are taking billions of dollars beyond that.\n  That may be acceptable at a time of war, at a time of economic \nslowdown, but we cannot permit that to continue. We cannot allow a \ncircumstance to develop in which we are raiding and looting every trust \nfund in sight, even when the economy is forecasted to be in recovery. \nThat will devastate this country's position when the baby-boomers start \nto retire in 10 years.\n  Please, I say to my colleagues, let us not get stampeded to do things \nthat make our long-term fiscal condition far worse. That would be a \ndisaster for this country.\n  On the question of rapid impact, looking at the Grassley package, \nagain we had the principle of the money should go out, the vast \nmajority of it in 6 months. Why? Because in looking at past results, \nwhat we have found is every time there was an attempt to use fiscal \npolicy to stimulate the economy, we have been too late--not just some \nof the time, every time. Every time there has been an economic slowdown \nand we tried to use fiscal policy to give stimulus, each and every time \nwe have been too late.\n\n[[Page S11268]]\n\n  So this time we are saying if we are going to stimulate the economy, \nget the money out in time to make a difference. That is why we have \nthis principle. Yet if one looks at the Grassley plan, nearly half of \nit, 48 percent of the 10-year cost, occurs after the first year. That \nis not a stimulus package. That is a tax cut package--I will grant \nthat--but it is not a stimulus package.\n  It is going to be too late. It is going to be like all the other \ntimes when we tried to use fiscal stimulus, and every time it has been \ntoo late. Let us not make that same mistake again. On a bipartisan \nbasis we said: Let us not do that again. If we are going to have \nstimulus, let us get it out there to be effective.\n  The Grassley plan does not do it. Half of it comes after the year \n2002.\n  On the size, we said $60 billion. The cost of the Grassley plan is \n$175 billion over 10 years. That does not count the interest cost.\n  On targeting, we said stimulus dollars should go to those most likely \nto spend them. Well, the Grassley package flunks that big time. Forty-\nfour percent of the value of the tax cuts in the Grassley plan goes to \nthe wealthiest 1 percent. Eighteen percent goes to the bottom 60 \npercent. Talk about taking a principle and standing it on its head. \nThat is what the Grassley proposal does. It does not funnel the money \nto those who receive the lowest income, who are the ones most likely to \nspend it. It gives the disproportionate share to the wealthiest 1 \npercent who are the ones most likely to save it, not spend it.\n  Again, however meritorious saving is--and I believe in it and applaud \nthose who save--every economist has said to us you have to put this \nmoney in the hands of companies and people who will spend it and spend \nit now; not 2 years from now, not 3 years from now but now. The \nGrassley plan absolutely flunks that test.\n  Finally, the package should not worsen our long-term fiscal \ncondition. The Grassley plan costs over $200 billion, counting the \ninterest. It costs over $200 billion after fiscal year 2002.\n  That is digging the hole deeper. That is taking every penny of it \nfrom the Social Security trust fund surpluses.\n  When one thinks about it, here is what he is doing: He is taking \nmoney from payroll taxes--and over 70 percent of the people in this \ncountry pay more in payroll taxes than they do in income taxes--he is \ntaking payroll tax money and using it to fund an income-tax cut that \ndisproportionately goes to the wealthiest 1 percent. Think about that. \nHe is taking money, over $200 billion, after this economic slowdown is \nover--according to the administration's projections, he is taking $200 \nbillion of people's payroll tax money and going over and giving half of \nit to the wealthiest 1 percent in an income-tax cut when every \neconomist has told us we ought to give the money in tax cuts to the \nlower income people who are most likely to spend it.\n  Instead, what he is doing is taking it from the low-income people, \nthe 60 or 70 percent of the people who pay more in payroll taxes than \nthey pay in income taxes, and giving it to the wealthiest 1 percent, \nwho are the ones most likely to save it and not spend it. That is not a \nstimulus package. That is a tax cut package for the most privileged and \nthe wealthiest among us. It is certainly not a stimulus package. It \nflunks every test, every principle that we agreed to on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  I hope our colleagues are thinking very carefully about this matter \nof a stimulus package. It is needed. It is needed soon. We have an \neconomy that is in decline. We were in trouble before September 11. \nThat circumstance has gotten seriously worse after the events of \nSeptember 11, after the sneak attack on this country. We have an \nobligation to develop a stimulus package that is really stimulus, not a \npolitical plan, not a partisan plan but a plan that is going to help \nlift this economy. To do that it is critically important that while we \nare giving a short-term lift, a lift that will take effect in a way \nthat is timely, that we also couple that with long-term fiscal \ndiscipline so we do not push up interest rates, so we do not undo all \nof the good we are attempting with a stimulus package.\n\n  I feel very strongly about this issue because I have seen in the 15 \nyears I have been in the Senate the difference between healthy fiscal \npolicy and fiscal policy that is built on debt and deficits and \ndecline. The last thing we should do in this country is put our Nation \nback on the course of massive fiscal deficits, draining every trust \nfund in sight in order to cover other costs. That is especially \nimportant in the decade before the baby-boomers retire.\n  I am going to be ferocious on the question of not digging the fiscal \nhole deeper beyond the time of economic weakness. That would be a \nprofound and tragic mistake to this country.\n  The distinguished occupant of the chair is the Senator from New York. \nNew York has been devastated by the attacks on September 11. I think \nall of us are proud of the reaction of the people of New York. They \nhave stood tall. They have responded with courage, and they deserve our \nhelp. Every time in our Nation's history when one of our States has \nbeen hit by natural disaster or some tragedy, all of the other States \nhave rushed to help.\n  I remember when my own State was devastated in the 1990s by floods, \nthe worst floods in 500 years. Colleagues from all across this country \nreacted in a generous way to help the people of my State who were so \nbadly hurt. I remember when California was devastated by fires and \nearthquakes how all of us rallied around to help the State of \nCalifornia because it was the right thing to do and because we also \nrecognized we are the United States of America and we are united at a \ntime of difficulty for many of our people.\n  The people of New York have suffered not a natural disaster; it is a \nman-made disaster, a disaster made by fanatics who took innocent lives \nby the thousands and devastated tens of millions of dollars worth of \nproperty and put New York's economy on a course that is going down. It \nis our obligation to help. We will help. We will fashion a stimulus \npackage that will help all of our country recover.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I say to my colleague from North \nDakota, as always, his analysis is spot on. He is addressing one of the \nfundamental needs of our Nation to have a responsible stimulus program, \none that happens soon, one that has real impact and is not an \nideological platform or program, but one that is designed to truly \nstimulate our economy. The more we hear the Senator from North Dakota \narticulate this, the better our country will be and the sooner our \neconomy will be moving forward.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (referred \n     to in this section as ``LIHEAP'') is the primary Federal \n     program available to help low-income households, the elderly, \n     and individuals with disabilities pay their home energy \n     bills.\n       (2) Congress provided $300,000,000 in emergency funding for \n     LIHEAP in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2001 because \n     regular appropriations were insufficient to help States \n     offset the increase in high utility bills during the winter \n     of 2000-2001.\n       (3) Congress expected that half of the emergency funding \n     would be made available for targeted assistance to States \n     with the most critical needs, and half would be given to help \n     States address unmet energy assistance needs resulting from \n     the extraordinary price increases in home heating fuels and \n     residential natural gas, experienced during the winter of \n     2000-2001.\n       (4) In the winter of 2000-2001, there was a 30 percent \n     increase in households receiving LIHEAP assistance in large \n     part due to the high price of home energy and severe weather.\n       (5) In the winter of 2000-2001, the LIHEAP program was only \n     able to serve 17 percent of the 29,000,000 households \n     eligible for LIHEAP assistance.\n       (6) In the winter of 2000-2001--\n       (A) heating oil prices were 36 percent higher than in the \n     winter of 1999-2000, and residential natural gas cost 42 \n     percent more per cubic foot than in the winter of 1999-2000; \n     and\n       (B) the weather was 10 percent colder than in the winter of \n     1999-2000.\n       (7) In the winter of 2000-2001, record cold weather and \n     high home energy bills took a financial toll on low-income \n     families and the elderly who spend, on average, 19.5 percent \n     of their annual income on energy bills, as compared to 3.7 \n     percent for all other households.\n       (8) Families in the United States need emergency LIHEAP \n     funding to pay home energy bills from the winter of 2000-2001 \n     and restore heat as the succeeding winter approaches.\n       (9) More citizens will need LIHEAP assistance in fiscal \n     year 2002 due to the recent increase in unemployment and the \n     slowing economy.\n       (10) States are being forced to draw down fiscal year 2002 \n     LIHEAP funds in order to address unmet needs from fiscal year \n     2001 and help low-income households pay overdue home energy \n     bills.\n       (11) Emergency LIHEAP funding will provide States with \n     critical resources to help provide assistance to residents.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should immediately release the \n     $300,000,000 in emergency funding for LIHEAP provided by the \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2001.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2051\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Department of \n  Health and Human Services produce a Notice, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 54, after the period on line 15, add the following:\n       Sec. 218.

Mr. President, I previously spoke on an amendment to \nprovide for a study and report regarding Federal student loan \ndisbursements to students attending foreign schools. I offer that \namendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2054.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a study and report regarding Federal student \n       loan disbursements to students attending foreign schools)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. STUDY AND REPORT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The number of students applying for loans and claiming \n     to attend foreign institutions has risen from 4,594 students \n     in 1993 to over 12,000 students in the 1998-1999 school year.\n       (2) Since 1995 there have been at least 25 convictions of \n     students who fraudulently claimed they were attending a \n     foreign institution, then cashed the check issued directly to \n     them, and did not attend the foreign institution.\n       (3) Tighter disbursement controls are necessary to reduce \n     the number of students fraudulently applying for loans under \n     title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and claiming \n     they are going to attend foreign institutions. Funds should \n     not be disbursed for attendance at a foreign institution \n     unless the foreign institution can verify that the student is \n     attending the institution.\n       (b) Study and Report.--\n       (1) Study.--The Comptroller General shall conduct a study \n     regarding--\n       (A) Federal student loan disbursements to students \n     attending foreign schools; and\n       (B) fraud, waste, and abuse in the Federal Family Education \n     Loan Program as the fraud, waste, and abuse relates to \n     students receiving funding in order to attend a foreign \n     school.\n       (2) Report.--The Comptroller General shall report to \n     Congress regarding the results of the study.\n       (3) Report contents.--The report described in paragraph (2) \n     shall--\n       (A) include information on whether or not there are \n     standards that a foreign school must meet for an American \n     student to attend and receive a federally guaranteed student \n     loan;\n       (B) compare the oversight controls for loans dispensed to \n     students attending foreign schools and domestic institutions;\n       (C) examine the default rates at foreign schools that \n     enroll American students receiving federally guaranteed \n     student loans and determine the number of students that are \n     receiving loans in multiple years; and\n       (D) make recommendations for legislative changes that are \n     required to ensure the integrity of the Federal Family \n     Education Loan Program.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, for the record, I made reference to this \namendment earlier, but I inadvertently submitted another amendment. \nThis is the amendment to which I spoke previously. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have been consulting with the \ndistinguished assistant Democratic leader. He reports to me there are a \nnumber of procedural agreements that have been entered into. I \nappreciate Senators' cooperation in reaching these agreements.\n  As I understand it, we have also adopted by voice vote a couple of \namendments. There are a number of amendments pending. It is my hope \nthat we can proceed with votes on those at some point early in the day \ntomorrow. It would be my expectation that we could finish this bill by \ntomorrow night, and I would be inclined then not to have votes \nscheduled on Friday. We would want to lay down the appropriations bill \non the District of Columbia, but I think we could probably work through \nthat bill and make arrangements for further consideration of the bill \nearly next week.\n  We have to get this bill done. If we are not finished with it by \ntomorrow night, clearly we will work on it throughout the day on \nFriday. My hope is we could finish our work on it sometime tomorrow \nnight, and then Senators would have the opportunity to schedule their \nday on Friday knowing there would not be votes, although there will be \nSenate business.\n  I also have been asked by a number of our colleagues if we could \naccommodate them and their families tonight. We will do so. In keeping \nwith that understanding, there will be no more rollcall votes this \nafternoon.\n  Having said that, it means we have a very full day tomorrow with a \nlot of votes on amendments tomorrow. I hope Senators will come to the \nChamber, offer their amendments, agree to time limits, and allow us to \nwork through them. We are leaving a lot of work for 1 day, but it would \nbe my hope we could complete our work on that day.\n\n  I see the chairman is in the Chamber. I know he will work with \nSenators if they have amendments. Let us offer them tonight. Let us \ndeal with them tomorrow if rollcalls are required, but let us get this \nbill done. I hope we can do so relatively early in the day. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2044\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we are in the midst of debating and \namending an appropriations bill. Earlier in the day, the distinguished \nmajority leader offered an amendment relating to labor rights of public \nsafety employees. I have been told that because there was a reference \nto collective bargaining in some area related to agriculture in the \nbill, this made it possible for this extraneous amendment, having to do\n\n[[Page S11271]]\n\nwith collective bargaining and unionism among public safety employees, \nto be offered and considered germane to the pending bill.\n  If we are really trying to finish the Labor-HHS appropriations bill--\nwhich I would like to do, because certainly it is in my interest, and \nit is in the interest of all 100 Members of the Senate, but, more \nimportantly, I think it is in the interest of the working men and women \nof America that we finish our legislative activities prior to \nThanksgiving and put our permanent appropriations process into place, \nhopefully adopt a stimulus package that is worthy of the name to help \nthe economy and do the work we have to do and complete our business \nprior to Thanksgiving--Then I do not think the pending amendment \nrelated to unionism of public safety workers contributes to that \ndesired goal of finishing our work. In fact, I think exactly the \nopposite is true.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2055 to Amendment No. 2044\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have come to amend a pending Daschle amendment. So I \ncall for regular order with respect to the Daschle amendment, and I \nsend a second-degree amendment to the pending amendment to the desk, \nand I would like it read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has called for regular order. The \nclerk will report the second degree amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2055 to amendment No. 2044:\n       After line 7 on page 9, insert the following:\n       ``(6) Protecting the constitutional right of all \n     firefighters, law enforcement officers and public safety \n     employees who risk their lives on a daily basis to protect \n     our property, freedoms and loved ones in exercising their \n     right to follow their conscience in whether or not to join a \n     labor organization in connection with their decision to \n     pursue a career dedicated to service and sacrifice in defense \n     of the innocent in order to provide for their own families.''\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is a right-to-work amendment for \npublic safety employees. It is interesting to me that in listing the \nthings we want to do in the pending amendment, we have before us an \namendment which overrides State law, which overrides county ordinances, \nand which would literally set in place a structure to unionize the \nsheriff's department in Brazoria County in Texas. I think it would come \nas a shock to people that we are in the process of doing that in the \nname of appropriating for the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  I am not in favor of doing this. I think this is a decision that \nStates have to make. My State has decided Americans have a right to \njoin or not join a union. My State is a right-to-work State, as 22 \nother States are. In fact, Oklahoma just joined the ranks of States \nthat give people the right to decide to join or not join unions.\n  The idea that we are going to override State law and county \nordinances and city ordinances to establish this Federal system of \nunionism comes as somewhat of a surprise to me.\n  As I read the rights that we are guaranteeing, it struck me that a \nright was missing. In fact, a real right was missing. Basically, in the \nDaschle amendment, we guarantee public safety officers the right to \nform and join a labor organization but, interestingly enough, nowhere \ndo we give them a right not to join a labor organization. I do not \nunderstand rights where you have the right to do something but you do \nnot have the right not to do it. I thought rights had to do with \nfreedom to choose.\n  Under section 4 of the amendment, No. 2 on page 8, has to do with \npublic safety employers recognizing employees' labor organizations.\n  No. 3 has to do with collectively bargaining over hours and wages and \nterms and conditions of employment.\n  No. 4 has to do with a requirement of dispute resolution.\n  No. 5 has to do with requirements enforcement through State courts.\n  It suddenly struck me that if this is really about rights, if we are \ngoing to try to reward those who have recently, through their actions, \nreaffirmed the affection and love that we have for them, should not one \nof those rights be freedom? In many States in the Union, people who are \npolice officers or emergency workers do have the freedom to say, boy, I \nreally appreciate you all giving me a chance to give you part of my \nwages and to join your union; I am really grateful for having a chance, \nbut I do not want to do it, and I live in America. So since I live in \nAmerica and you all have offered me this chance to be part of your \nunion, but I would rather spend the money sending my child to college \nor buying a new refrigerator or fixing my truck, I am just going to say \nthank you but no thank you.\n  Now we have before us a proposal that would basically override State \nlaw in every State in the Union, override county ordinances in every \ncounty in America, and override the policies of every city in this \ncountry and establish a Federal standard for unionism for public safety \nworkers. Yet in all of these rights we are giving public safety \nworkers, never, ever do we mention freedom.\n  So we override State law. We set up a structure for unionism and we \nnever give workers the right to say thanks but no thanks, I do not want \nto join a union; I appreciate it, but I think I could spend that money \nbetter than that union could spend it on my behalf. No harm meant, no \ndisrespect. I just would rather spend it myself.\n  So I sent to the desk a second-degree amendment that adds a No. 6. \nYou have five other rights that basically override State law and set up \na structure for unionism with regard to public safety and emergency \nemployees. I add a sixth right, and that would be a right to not join a \nunion.\n  If we are going to override State authority and State law in setting \nup a structure for unionism, should not we override State law with \nregard to allowing people to say thank you but I do not want to join a \nunion? I thought this was America.\n  In fact, a public safety employee might say I put on this badge this \nmorning to protect freedom and yet I find I do not have the freedom to \nnot give my money to a union of which I do not want to be a member.\n  So it struck me that if, in fact, we really want to get into the \nbusiness of writing county ordinances--I did not run for the county \ncommission because I did not want to make county ordinances, and I did \nnot run for the state legislature because I did not want to make law at \nthe State level. My State, my county do a great job. They did not need \nmy help. I was needed in Washington, at least I thought. So I came to \nWashington to write Federal law, but now today I have found the \nmajority leader has decided he wants to get in the county commission \nbusiness and the city council business and the State legislature \nbusiness.\n  So as long as we are going to get into it, it seems to me that \nprotecting freedom is something that we have to do. If we are going to \nhave a Federal labor standard that protects people's right to join a \nunion is a wonderful thing, is it less wonderful to protect their \nrights not to join a union? Is it really the American way to say you \nhave a right to join a union--in fact, in over half the States in the \nUnion, over half the States in the country, not to use the same word \nwith a very different meaning, but in over half the States in America \nyou have to join a union to be a police officer, you have to join a \nunion to be a firefighter, you have to join a union to be an emergency \nworker because those States require that you join a union if that area \nis organized, and in those States it is.\n  So as long as we are writing Federal statute, I wanted to add the \nsimple provision that said you had a right to join or not to join as it \nwould suit your individual conscience or as it would suit your own \npreferences and the well-being of your family. I hope this amendment \nwill be adopted if we are going to adopt the Daschle amendment. I \noffered it in all seriousness because I think it ought to be included.\n\n  If we really want to finish our work, I don't think this is an issue. \nI think the underlying Daschle amendment, while it is certainly \ngermane--and the Parliamentarian has ruled it is germane--it doesn't \npromote our objectives to finish our business. I personally believe it \nshould be dropped. If we are going to get into the business of \noverriding State law, county ordinances, and city ordinances, and \nmandate a structure of unionism, we ought to guarantee the right of \npeople not to join a union.\n\n[[Page S11272]]\n\n  I have offered such an amendment. If people want to put it into a \npigeonhole, they can put it in the pigeonhole of a national right-to-\nwork provision within a national union structure amendment that would \nsimply say, with all the rights for unions the distinguished majority \nleader would provide, I add a right for an individual. The right is to \nsay, yes, I want to join a union, or, no, I don't want to join a union.\n  That is what my amendment does. I hope my colleagues will look at it. \nIt is simple. It is five lines long. It is flowery; and quite frankly, \nso is the amendment I am amending. I didn't want my part to be less \nflowery than the rest of it. If you read it, you will understand \nexactly what I am talking about. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there are a few things I want to do on \nthe floor. I thank Senator Daschle for his amendment. I have not looked \nat the amendment of the Senator from Texas. Looking at the language of \nthe Daschle amendment, there is the operative language that the role of \nthe Federal labor relations authority, to the extent provided in this \ntitle, in accordance with regulations prescribed in the authority, \nshall protect the right of each employee to join, form, or assist any \nunion organization, or to refrain, freely and without fear of reprisal, \nand protect each employee in the exercise of such right.\n  I think it ought to be clear that protection is already in the \nDaschle amendment.\n  The second point is, there is absolutely nothing in this legislation \nthat undercuts State laws. I personally think the right-to-work laws \ncan be debated at some other time.\n  Finally, I point out if they are interested in supporting the second-\ndegree amendment and undercutting the amendment Senator Daschle has \nintroduced--and I ask unanimous consent to be a cosponsor of the \nDaschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That amendment basically is saying: Give the \nfirefighters, the police, and other public safety workers the right to \njoin a union and bargain collectively for decent wages and civilized \nworking conditions, the right to be able to have a good wage to support \ntheir family. That is what this amendment says.\n  I originally introduced this bill, or a version of this bill several \nyears ago. Now we can get it to the floor of the Senate introduced by \nthe Senate majority leader. We can give all the speeches in the world \nabout how much we appreciate the first responders, those who came to \nthe World Trade Center building and tried to save people and lost their \nlives--firefighters, police, and other rescue workers. We can give \nspeeches about it, we can give concerts, we can pass resolutions, but \nthe best way we can say thank you in this Chamber is to give these \nworkers, these men and women, the right to join a union if they want to \nand to be able to bargain collectively.\n  That is what the vote is about. The second-degree amendment undercuts \nthe amendment that Senator Dashcle and others, myself included, have \nintroduced.\n  We will get back to this later. That is my initial quick response.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, last week during consideration of the \nAgriculture Appropriations bill, the Senate adopted an amendment \nChairman Tom Harkin and I authored which will provide $1 million to the \nFood and Drug Administration for enforcement of three important \nconsumer protection provisions of the Dietary Supplement Health and \nEducation Act of 1994, DSHEA. Those provisions relate to the \nrequirement that the dietary supplements be adequately labeled as to \ntheir ingredients and the proportion of each ingredient contained \nwithin, that statements of nutritional support (so-called ``structure/\nfunction'' claims) must be truthful and non-misleading, and that \nmanufacturers be able to substantiate the claims they make.\n  These are very important protections we included in DSHEA so that \nconsumers have the assurance that the products they buy are accurately \nlabeled. In the seven years since the Congress passed this law \nunanimously, there have been sporadic reports that products are being \nsold that are not properly labeled. Indeed, the Senate Aging Committee \nheld a hearing last month during which it was shown that there have \nbeen problems with appropriate enforcement of DSHEA.\n  It is my strong contention that the law is completely adequate to \ndeal with these problems, as FDA Commissioner Jane Henney advised the \nCongress on more than one occasion. However, it is obvious to me that \nenforcement has not been the priority it should be at HHS and FDA.\n  Accordingly, I rise to offer an amendment which will provide the \nGeneral Counsel with an additional $500,000 for legal support for \nenforcement of the labeling provisions of DSHEA. I am pleased to be \njoined in this effort by Chairman Harkin. This is part of our on-going \ninitiative to make certain that consumers have access to safe dietary \nsupplements and information about those products. This amendment we \noffer today will complement the amendment we adopted last week. The \nincreased funding for the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Nutrition \nwill be used for investigations and compliance activities in the field. \nThe funds contained within the amendment we are offering today will be \nused to support any legal activities which might arise from field \nenforcement.\n  Let me emphasize my strong belief that the majority of dietary \nsupplements are of great benefit to consumers who wish to maintain or \nimprove their healthy lives. However, consumers need the assurance that \nthe products they buy are safe and accurately labeled, and it is time \nfor the FDA to place a greater priority on enforcement against the few \nbad actors that are casting a large shadow over the industry. Our \namendment will help the government place a renewed emphasis on removing \nillegal products from the marketplace. This will be a great benefit to \nAmerican consumers.\n  Before I close, let me mention one other provision of our amendment. \nThe 1994 law called upon the FDA to develop Good Manufacturing \nPractice, GMP, guidelines for dietary supplements. GMPs are the primary \nenforcement tool whereby government inspectors ensure that all food \nproducts, including dietary supplements, are manufactured according to \nrigorous quality control standards, including appropriate labeling, \nsanitation, purity and records-keeping.\n  Although HHS published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule-Making in \nearly 1997, to date the agency has not published the Notice of Proposed \nRule-Making which is necessary to being finalization of the GMPs. \nSenator Harkin and I have called, written and implored the Office of \nManagement and Budget, HHS, and FDA to issue these regulations. To \ndate, we have not been successful, although it is our understanding \nthat the NPRM was about to be published in the final days of the \nClinton Administration.\n  I am not aware of what the NPRM will contain. Perhaps it will be a \ngood document. Perhaps I will disagree with it vehemently. I cannot \nsay.\n  What I can say is that the NPRM must be published and available for \ncomment before we can move to finalize the GMPs for dietary \nsupplements. For that reason, the amendment we are offering today \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that the Administration release this \nregulation within 15 days after the bill is enacted. It should not \nrequire an act of Congress for this regulation to be issued, and I \nstill remain hopeful that the NPRM will be published in the next few \ndays so that we may continue the long-delayed process of finalizing the \nregulation.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education appropriations bill.\n  First, I want to commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens, as well \nas Chairman Harkin and Senator Specter, and their staff, for their work \non this bill. Given the budget realities, I know it wasn't an easy task \nto put this bill together, and I know they would agree we should have \neven more robust numbers for many programs.\n  That is why it is important to recognize the increased investments \ncontained in this bill, like dislocated workers; NIH; CDC; SAMHSA; \nLIHEAP; Head Start; Title I; teacher quality; and Pell grants.\n\n[[Page S11273]]\n\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill significantly enhances the \nchildhood immunization program under CDC, providing $84.5 million more \nthan last year and $62.5 million more than the administration's budget \nrequest.\n  This additional funding is critical to the continued success of the \nprogram, which has faced dramatic increases in vaccine purchase costs, \nas well as new challenges in program outreach and in vaccine delivery \ninfrastructure development.\n  In addition to its work in preventing and tracking diseases, the CDC \nalso plays a critical role in our effort to maintain and control the \nonset of chronic disease among Americans. Seven of every 10 deaths in \nthis country each year can be attributed to chronic diseases such as \nheart disease, stroke and cancer.\n  CDC's work to improve our understanding of risk factors, such as \ntobacco use, poor nutrition and lack of physical activity, through \napplied research is the cornerstone of our Nation's effort to curb the \ncurrent epidemic of chronic disease related deaths.\n  I would also like to commend the chairman and ranking member for \npreserving funding for the Health Professions Program at HRSA. This \nprogram provides vital support to academic institutions and students in \nan effort to improve the accessibility, quality and racial and ethnic \ndiversity of the health care workforce. The administration's budget \nproposal would have decimated this program.\n  During this time of shortages in a variety of health care settings, \nthe health professions and nurse education programs are key to our \ncontinued efforts to recruit motivated and qualified individuals for \nthe health care workforce.\n  I have been particularly interested in the work of the Geriatric \nEducation Centers Program, which provide training for health care \nprofessionals who provide care to our Nation's seniors, as well as \nsupport for faculty who teach geriatrics. Rhode Island has one of the \nhighest concentrations of people over the age of 65, with persons over \nthe age of 85 being the fastest growing segment of the population. As \nsuch, I am deeply concerned about the lack of health professionals \nspecifically trained to address the health care needs of our rapidly \naging population. The geriatric programs sponsored by HRSA, including \none in my State, play a vital role in enhancing the skill base of \nhealth professionals who care for frail and vulnerable seniors.\n  As a final point with regard to the health related provisions in this \nlegislation, I would simply add that I hope that Senate conferees will \nbe able to work with the House to increase the current funding level \nfor the Community Access Program (CAP) at HRSA.\n  I also want to thank Senators Harkin and specter for providing $2 \nbillion in LIHEAP funding. This is an 18-percent increase over funding \nprovided in the fiscal year 2001 appropriation bill. LIHEAP is an \nimportant program for residents of the Northeast and Midwest, and this \nincreased funding is especially important now. The slowing economy and \nlayoffs will make it increasingly more difficult for low-income \nfamilies to be able to afford to heat their homes this coming winter. \nIf these families cannot pay their heating bills then they will be \nforced to chose between heat, prescription drugs, housing, and food. \nThis additional funding will help working poor families maintain \neconomic stability during this difficult time.\n\n  As for education funding, I am pleased on many fronts. The bill \nprovides an overall increase of $6.3 billion, including a $1.4 billion \nincrease for title I, $925 million to preserve the School Renovation \nProgram, $1 billion for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers \n(after school) program, $3 billion for teacher quality, and a $250 \nboost in the maximum Pell grant to $4,000.\n  I particularly appreciate the $15 million increase for LEAP, bringing \nfunding for this program to $70 million. LEAP is a Federal-State \npartnership program which helps needy students attend and stay in \ncollege. I have worked closely with my colleague from Maine, Senator \nCollins, on this program, and I look forward to continuing to work with \nher, Chairman Harkin, and Senator Specter to maintain this funding \nlevel in conference.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Harkin and Senator Specter for \nincluding funding for a critical national cause I have long championed, \nalong with Senator Cochran and others in this body--support for our \nNation's school libraries.\n  The condition of our school libraries is a national disgrace; they \neither contain mostly bare shelves or are filled with outdated books. \nWithout funding, the goal of the President's Reading First Program to \nensure children can read and read well at an early age, will not be \nmet.\n  While I am pleased that the bill provides a modest downpayment for \nthis program at $25 million, additional funding is certainly needed.\n  I want to continue to work with Chairman Harkin and Senator Specter \nto provide increased resources for this critical program, so that it \nwill work hand in hand with Reading First to improve our student's \nliteracy levels and reading scores.\n  Certainly Chairman Harkin's ESEA amendment to fully fund IDEA would \nprovide the resources needed for the school library program and \ncountless other programs, while meeting the needs of our children with \ndisabilities and schools.\n  I strongly support this effort, and will work with the chairman of \nthe subcommittee to press for this amendment to be retained in the ESEA \nconference. Indeed, we must pass this amendment to ensure that \nessential initiatives get the funding needed to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/31/senate-section/article/S11273-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11273-S11274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS CONSENT--S. 739\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to Calendar \nNo. 191, S. 739, the Homeless Veterans Program Improvement Act; that \nthe committee-reported substitute amendment be agreed to; that the \nbill, as amended, be read three times, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is the second or the third time I \nhave come to the floor. My colleague from Alabama, though we do not \nagree on all issues, is a friend, so nothing I am about to say is \ndirected to him. He has to object.\n  I would like to know which brave Senator has put an anonymous hold on \nthis bill. With all due respect, this piece of legislation, which is \ncalled the Heather French Henry Veterans Assistance Act, is named after \nHeather French Henry, a Miss America who made this her No. 1 priority. \nHer dad is a disabled Vietnam vet. It passed out of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee with bipartisan unanimous support.\n  It is the same piece of legislation introduced by Lane Evans. There \nis nobody better in the whole Congress, House and Senate; he is the \nbest when it comes to being for veterans. He has introduced this, moved \nthrough the House, and the VA has supported it. We had the Secretary \nthere. He approves of this legislation--Secretary Principi. The VA \nreported there were 345,000 homeless veterans in 1999, a 34-percent \nincrease in homeless veterans from 1998 to 1999. I bet a third of the \nmales who are homeless are veterans. That is a scandal. I know my \ncolleague from Alabama agrees with that.\n  What does this bill do? It increases the $50 million authorization \nfor the Department of Labor Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program. \nThey basically contract out; the nonprofits do the work at the local \nlevel. These are effective job training programs for homeless veterans \nso they can get back on their feet.\n  The bill authorizes additional funding for community-based \norganizations which do the best work in providing different \ntransitional services to veterans, whether it be programs that deal \nwith addiction, whether it be programs to help veterans find more \naffordable housing.\n  Finally, it talks about more comprehensive homeless centers that will \nbe available in the country's major metropolitan areas; in other words, \na place where there can be medical care, where there can be job \ncounseling, and where there can be social services.\n  My understanding is--and I don't know how many veterans organizations\n\n[[Page S11274]]\n\nhave now sent in letters, but I can safely say there is not a veterans \norganization in the country that would oppose this legislation. I could \ntravel to any State, any center, and I could go to a homeless shelter. \nI used to organize with homeless people, visit with homeless veterans, \nmany Vietnam veterans. This legislation provides some support services \nfor them--job training, counseling for veterans struggling with \naddiction, other social service programs.\n  There is a Senator who has put a hold on it, and I cannot find out \nwho he or she is. These anonymous holds drive me up the wall. I have \nnever put an anonymous hold on a bill--never. I am putting a hold on \njust about every single piece of legislation that any Senator on the \nother side of the aisle wants to put through here until this piece of \nlegislation goes through. I have come out here twice or three times. I \ncan't find out who objects to it. I would love to debate a Senator \nabout why he or she opposes this homeless veterans bill.\n  So I am going to come to the Chamber every day, every single day, and \nI am going to ask unanimous consent to pass this bill. I hope that \nwhoever opposes it will tell me why. In the meantime, I am putting a \nhold on just about every single piece of unanimous consent legislation \nthat is proposed from the other side of the aisle, which I hardly ever \ndo.\n  This is a great way to proceed in a bipartisan manner, to have some \nSenator, who has apparently very little courage, put an anonymous hold \non a bill which provides more homeless assistance to veterans, who will \nnot come out here to debate it, and basically stops it dead in its \ntracks. I have been around here 11 years. The only thing I can figure \nout is I just put a hold on pretty much everything that comes from the \nother side of the aisle. I will review them one by one, but I will not \ndo it anonymously.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, many of whom I enjoy and like and rarely \nam angry with even if I disagree, I am sorry. I apologize. But I am \nputting a hold on just about every single piece of legislation that \ncomes through here from the other side.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell).

Madam President, I rise to reflect a little bit on the \nissues we have before us and the idea that we have some things to do \nthat are priorities. I think most of us would agree to a certain set of \npriorities, and that we ought to be dealing with those priorities and \nmoving forward with what we have to do. We have known this for quite a \nlong time, as a matter of fact.\n  I am sure the folks on the other side of the aisle will get up and \nsay the Republicans are blocking everything; that is not true. We need \nto put a priority on what we are seeking to do and get those jobs done.\n  We have three more appropriations, I think, out of the 13 with which \nto deal. We ought to be doing that and we are working on one now.\n  Conference reports, which will be coming back--handle those.\n  Certainly, I think everyone is committed to the idea of doing an \neconomic stimulus package. I understand there are different points of \nview, and it is understandable because I don't think anybody knows \nprecisely what it is that will have the most and quickest impact on the \neconomy. Nevertheless, we need to do that; we need to do some things \nthat are short term that have an impact. Most of us understand that.\n  We need to finish up airport security. That has to be done, of \ncourse, before we go.\n  Somewhere along the line, of course, bioterrorism is something that \nneeds to be done.\n  We had hoped as part of the stimulus package or related to it we \ncould get a date or do something with energy. If there is anything that \nimpacts the economy, certainly it is an energy policy. An energy policy \nalso, of course, is becoming vital to what we are seeking to do in the \nMiddle East.\n  The idea that here we are in kind of a shutdown, when we are kind of \nin a press to get things done, and it seems like an opportunity to \nstick on everything that everybody has ever wanted to do is not a very \ngood way to manage this place. It is not a very good way for us to set \nthe priorities that this country needs, which is our job, and then to \nget on with doing it.\n  I have to say it gets a little discouraging sometimes for us to be \ngoing along with all this to do and somehow we can't seem to get with \nit. We have not even voted in the last 2 days in a rollcall vote.\n  I know it is a difficult thing to do. I am not critical of anyone \nparticularly. But I think collectively we ought to come to the snubbing \npost and say we have these things to do and here is what we have to do \nto them and put aside some things that have been hanging around forever \nand put them on something that is going in, which is always the impact \nand effect of coming down to the end.\n  I have to share a certain amount of frustration with what is \nhappening. We are not going to agree on every issue. To not understand \nthat is naive. But we could agree on saying we have to get this job \ndone. Some have to give up this or have to give up that, but we have to \ndo it.\n  I feel very strongly about the energy issue. I have been part of the \ngroup that has worked on that for a very long time. I do believe it \nhas, indeed, always been important to have a policy, to do something \nmore about domestic production. But it is even more important now, and \nclearly so.\n  I can't think of anything, as a matter of fact, that probably has \nmore impact on the economy than the availability and cost of oil and we \nproduce that oil and the cost of production.\n  These are the kinds of things we can do. So I am hopeful that as we \nwork towards adjournment time, which can't be too far off, we will set \na list of priorities. We should say: These are the things we need to \ndo. Here are our priorities. Let's do them. Let's get on with it.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would just like to share a few \nremarks at this time concerning the energy bill. We need to improve our \nproduction of energy within the United States, and I would like to \nshare a few thoughts about why I think it is a critical part of \nstimulating the economy.\n  At this time of economic slowdown, we need to create circumstances \nthat will allow the economy to grow and flower. It has struck me for \nsome time--and I have mentioned this on the floor previously--that our \neconomic slowdown began over a year ago, and it began not long after we \nsaw a tremendous surge in the price of energy. The price of a barrel of \noil in the United States was as low as $13 a barrel. It soon leaped to \n$30 a barrel. And 60 percent of all the oil we utilize in the United \nStates is purchased abroad.\n  So there was a tremendous transfer of American wealth. We got no more \noil--not a single barrel of oil--but we were paying more than twice as \nmuch for that oil as we were paying just months before it surged \nupward.\n  That drained a great deal of money from this economy. It \ndemonstrated, with great clarity, the dependence we have on foreign \noil. And most of the reserves of foreign oil are in the Middle East. It \nhas pointed out the dangers we face if we do not make some changes.\n  Now we are engaged in hostilities in the Middle East, and we see, \nonce again, just how fragile that supply of oil is to our Nation, and \nhow quickly it can be interrupted.\n  Our economy needs to improve. I think it is incumbent on us to \nconsider, quite seriously, reforming our energy laws so that we can \nproduce more energy in this country. If we can do that, we will be able \nto keep more money at home. So when a well is drilled, the question is, \nWill it be drilled in Saudi Arabia or Iran or Iraq or Kuwait, or will \nit be drilled somewhere in the United States? When it is drilled here, \nnot only does the money stay here--the royalties that are paid to the \nState or the landowner for the oil--but all the people who drill the \nwell, all the people who work at it, process the oil, and move that oil \nfrom the wellhead site--all of those people will be paid salaries; and \nthen they will pay taxes. They will help reduce our unemployment, \nincrease tax revenue, and provide income for American workers.\n  So we need to do a number of things to improve our energy situation \nso that we reduce the drain on our economy from the constant purchase \nof oil abroad.\n  Conservation is a critical part of that. The more we can reduce the \nuse of oil and gas in America, then the less demand we have to transfer \nwealth abroad to purchase it. At the same time, the more we can produce \nin the United States, the greater our chance will be to churn that \nmoney again within the United States, creating jobs, salaries, \nretirements, and health care benefits, as well as taxes for our States \nand our governments, our local school systems, and the Federal \nGovernment. It will strengthen our economy in a number of ways.\n  I think improving our energy production would be a critical step in \nrevitalizing our economy. I do not think it is coincidental that we \nbegan to sink not long after we saw a tripling of the price of oil on \nthe world market.\n  I am delighted to see the ranking member of the Energy Committee, \nSenator Murkowski, in this Chamber. I know he wants to speak on this \nissue. He has been a constant, steady advocate for America: What is \ngood for American workers, what is good for this country, what we need \nto do to remain economically strong.\n  If we do not remain economically strong, we cannot do the good things \nin this country, and around the world, we want to do.\n  He has been a great champion of that. As I said, I see he is in this \nChamber. I suspect he would like to talk on the energy issue in more \ndetail.\n  I thank him for his leadership and yield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, let me acknowledge the comments of my \ngood friend. He and I have shared stands on many issues; and one that I \nthink is prominent at this time, as indicated, is on the issue relative \nto the request by our President that we have and pass an energy policy, \nand that we do it with dispatch.\n  Our President has spoken out four times in the last 2 weeks, \nindicating the general observation that, indeed, we need an energy \nbill.\n  Quoting from a late October release, the statement is made that:\n\n       Tax relief is only part of the job. We need an energy plan \n     for America. Under the leadership of the Vice President, we \n     have drafted a comprehensive, common sense plan for the \n     future of our country.\n\n  It further states that:\n\n       It has passed the House of Representatives in H.R. 4. It \n     needs a vote in the U.S. Senate. We need to be more self-\n     reliant and more self-sufficient.\n\n  On October 17, he indicated:\n\n       I ask Congress to now act on an energy bill. The House of \n     Representatives passed its bill in August. This is an issue \n     of special importance to California, the State of Washington \n     [which the Presiding Officer represents]. Too much of our \n     energy comes from the Mideast. The plan I sent up to Congress \n     promotes conservation, expands energy supplies, and improves \n     the efficiency of our energy network. Our country needs \n     greater energy independence.\n\n  On October 4:\n\n       There are two other aspects to a good, strong economic \n     stimulus.\n\n  I note that the President uses the words ``economic stimulus.''\n\n       One is trade promotion authority, and the other is an \n     energy bill. I urge the Senate to listen to the will of the \n     Senators and move forward on a bill that will help Americans \n     find work and also make it easier for all of us around the \n     table to protect the security of the country.\n\n  We have spent a lot of time talking about homeland security. An \nintegral piece of homeland security is energy independence. I ask the \nSenate to respond to the call to get an energy bill moving.''\n  The President made another comment to a group today asking again that \nthis body move on an energy bill. It would be derelict if we are to \nconclude this session without addressing an energy bill.\n  We are not alone. I have letters here from the American Legion, \nVietnam Veterans Institute, Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, Gold Star \nWives of America, Catholic War Veterans, Survivors of Pearl Harbor, all \nwho participated in a press conference yesterday here in Washington.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We write today out of a sense of \n     urgency concerning our national security, as it relates to \n     our need for energy independence. The development of \n     America's domestic energy resources is vital to our national \n     security. We respectfully urge you to adopt the provisions \n     contained in H.R. 4, the ``Securing America's Future Energy \n     Act of 2001.''\n       War and international terrorism have again brought into \n     sharp focus the heavy reliance of the United States on \n     imported oil. During times of crises, such reliance threatens \n     our national security and economic well being. The import of \n     more than 50 percent of our petroleum from the Persian Gulf \n     further compounds our foreign trade balance at a time when \n     our energy demands continue unabated. It is important that we \n     develop domestic sources of oil, contained within our public \n     lands--such as the supplies within the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge.\n       Working for a comprehensive energy policy and achieving \n     responsible energy independence are critical national \n     security and economic goals. H.R. 4, as passed by the House \n     of Representatives, is a major step forward to achieving \n     these imperative goals. We strongly urge your support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard J. Santos,\n     National Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Vietnam Veterans Institute,\n\n                                                 October 30, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We write today out of a sense of \n     urgency concerning our national security as it relates to our \n     energy supply. The development of America's domestic energy \n     resources is vital to our national security. We respectfully \n     urge you to\n\n[[Page S11276]]\n\n     immediately pass H.R. 4, the comprehensive energy \n     legislation.\n       We are pleased the House of Representatives, acting with \n     bipartisan support, addressed our energy vulnerability by \n     passing H.R. 4, the `Securing America's Future Energy Act of \n     2001' or the `SAFE Act of 2001.' It is imperative the Senate \n     do the same. Following the horrific events of September 11, \n     2001, failure to pass this bill would pose a threat to our \n     people, our economy, and our national security, that we all \n     wore the uniform to maintain.\n       All Americans, as well as our military troops, need this \n     legislation enacted into law. If we intend to rebuild our \n     economy and continue the campaign against international \n     terrorism and those who attacked us, we must develop domestic \n     sources of oil contained within our public lands--such as the \n     supplies within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We must \n     be able to rely to the fullest extent possible on our own \n     resources to provide for the maintenance of our economy at \n     home and our prolonged war effort abroad.\n       By passing H.R. 4, the comprehensive energy legislation \n     now, the Senate will be supporting our troops in the field \n     and all working Americans, including those displaced by this \n     heartless act of aggression. We, as Veterans, stand united \n     and cannot overstate the importance of this legislation, and \n     respectfully request you lead the Senate by voting on and \n     passing H.R. 4 so our nation can move forward in defense of \n     freedom around the world.\n       We know that when the chips are down, America can and will \n     stand and fight, using all its resources and all its might to \n     defend our nation and the cause of freedom around the world. \n     Join us in this cause. Pass the comprehensive energy bill and \n     help us rebuild America!\n       With the support of our members,\n                                                   J. Eldon Yates,\n     Chairman and Founder.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       AMVETS,\n\n                                     Lanham, MD, October 26, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Daschle: On behalf of AMVETS, I am writing to \n     encourage you to bring H.R. 4, the Securing America's Future \n     Energy Act of 2001, before the full Senate for consideration \n     at the earliest possible moment prior to the close of the 1st \n     Session of the 107th Congress.\n       As you know, our current reliance on foreign oil leaves the \n     United States vulnerable to the whim of individual oil-\n     exporting countries, many existing in the unpredictable and \n     highly dangerous Persian Gulf. And it cannot be overstated \n     that energy supplies touch nearly every aspect of our lives \n     from our economy to our national security.\n       Passage of H.R. 4, would greatly assist in our ability to \n     secure a more dependable and diversified domestic supply of \n     energy. And, I would note that since the Persian Gulf War our \n     security has become more threatened with our dependence on \n     foreign sources of oil growing from 35 percent of domestic \n     supply to nearly 60 percent.\n       AMVETS firmly believes that we cannot wait for the next \n     crisis before we act. H.R. 4, as approved by the House, is a \n     critical part of an overall policy America requires to \n     promote dependable, affordable, and environmentally sound \n     production and distribution of energy for the future. We urge \n     your expedited approval of this legislation.\n       Dedicated to service,\n                                               Joseph W. Lipowski,\n     National Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n\nStatement Of Our Nation's Veterans Group ``Our Domestic Energy Security \n              is Our National Security'', October 30, 2001\n\n       We, the undersigned, representing our nation's veterans, \n     strongly believe that the development of America's domestic \n     energy resources is a vital national security priority. The \n     horrific events of September 11, 2001, constitute a threat to \n     our people, our economy, and our nation's security. With U.S. \n     troops actively engaged in combat overseas, we firmly believe \n     that America can and will win this prolonged war against \n     terrorism, using all its resources to defend our nation and \n     the cause of freedom around the world.\n       Because of these beliefs, we applaud the House of \n     Representatives for its bipartisan work in addressing our \n     energy vulnerability by passing H.R. 4, the ``Securing \n     America's Future Energy Act of 2001'' or the ``SAFE Act of \n     2001.'' It is imperative that the Senate pass the House \n     version of H.R. 4 so that our nation can move forward in \n     establishing our energy security, as well as our defense of \n     freedom at home and abroad. It is essential for us to develop \n     all domestic energy resources including the supplies within \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       By passing H.R. 4, the comprehensive energy legislation, \n     the Senate will be supporting our troops in the field, all \n     Americans, their families, and our nation. We, as Veterans, \n     stand united and respectfully request that the Senate vote on \n     and pass H.R. 4.\n\n                                               J. Eldon Yates,\n\n                                             Chairman and Founder,\n                                       Vietnam Veterans Institute.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. These letters indicate their support for energy \nlegislation to be passed out of the U.S. Senate. From October 25:\n\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We write today out of a sense of \n     urgency concerning our national security as it relates to our \n     need for energy independence. The development of America's \n     energy resources is vital to our national security. We \n     respectfully urge you to adopt the provisions contained in \n     H.R. 4, the ``Securing America's Future Energy Act of 2001.''\n\n  The House has acted. This letter was signed by the American Legion.\n  Here is a quote from the AMVETS letter:\n\n       On behalf of AMVETS, I am writing to encourage you to bring \n     H.R. 4, the Securing America's Future Energy Act of 2001, to \n     the full Senate for consideration.\n\n  The Vietnam Veterans Institute:\n\n       We write today out of a sense of urgency concerning our \n     national security as it relates to our energy supply.\n\n  The important point is that each one of these organizations reflect \non our energy supply in conjunction with our national security.\n  They further state:\n\n       If we intend to rebuild our economy and continue the \n     campaign against international terrorism and those who \n     attacked us, we must develop domestic sources of oil \n     contained within our public lands--such as supplies within \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We must be able to rely, \n     to the fullest extent possible, on our own resources. . .\n\n  That is signed by J. Eldon Yates, chairman and founder of the Vietnam \nVeterans Institute. We have our Nation's veterans groups also signing \non as well. These represent a pretty significant voice of those who \ngave so much for America, for the freedoms we enjoy and the realization \nthat we can never properly repay the contribution made by our veterans.\n  I note in the letter from the American Legion:\n\n       War and international terrorism have again brought into \n     sharp focus the heavy reliance of the United States on \n     imported oil. During these times of crisis, such reliance \n     threatens again our national security and economic well-\n     being. The importation of more than 50 percent of our \n     petroleum from the Persian Gulf further compounds our foreign \n     trade deficit at a time when our energy demands continue \n     unabated. It is important that we develop domestic sources of \n     oil contained within our public lands, such as the supplies \n     within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n  We have a pretty good representation of what America's veterans think \nabout the necessity of this body passing an energy bill. It is \nimportant to note that one member of this body, the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts, is quoted as saying, with regard to his comments on \npatriotism vis-a-vis ANWR:\n\n       This is not the moment to falsely cloak in the mantle of \n     patriotism a choice as clear and as critical as the choice \n     about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n  I will let the Senator speak for himself relative to an explanation. \nIt is in deep contrast to the attitude prevailing among America's \nveterans organizations.\n  If we look at reality associated with what is happening in the world \ntoday, we can reflect on just how we have compromised ourselves into a \nposition of vulnerability. There is a gentleman who was a Member of \nthis body for many years, Mark Hatfield of Oregon. Mark Hatfield was a \npacifist. I think I can liberally use that general terminology. His \nposition on opening up this area of public lands in my State of Alaska \nwas very clear. He said: I will support opening up ANWR any day rather \nthan send another American man or woman into harm's way to fight a war \non foreign soil. Make no mistake about it, that is just what we are \ndoing today; we are fighting a war on foreign soil.\n\n  What is the last war we fought over oil? We have to go back to the \nPersian Gulf conflict. We have to go back to what Saddam Hussein of \nIraq was basically up to, what his objective was. His objective was to \ngo into Kuwait, invade Kuwait and go into Saudi Arabia. He knew that he \ncould control the world's supply of oil, and the power and influence \nthat would come as a consequence of that would certainly put him in the \ndriver's seat relative to policies in the Mideast.\n  What are we doing today? We are importing somewhere between 700,000 \nand a million barrels of oil from Iraq, from our friend Saddam Hussein. \nWhat do we do with that oil? We enforce an aerial blockade to a large \ndegree because we fly our planes over enforcing the no-fly zone. It \nmight be compared to a blockade at sea, only this is one in the air. We \nare putting in danger our men and\n\n[[Page S11277]]\n\nwomen as they enforce this. They take out targets, radar targets, from \ntime to time. He attempts to shoot us down. He shot down a couple of \ndrones. He has almost shot down one of our interceptor aircraft. As a \nconsequence, as we continue this policy, our vulnerability is evident.\n  In so doing, he takes our money, pays his Republican Guards for \nprotection, develops a missile capability, develops, for all practical \npurposes, activities associated with fostering terrorism, he develops a \nbiological weapons capability. Who does he aim it at? He aims at our \nally Israel.\n  That is a consequence of the United States losing its leverage \nrelative to its continued dependence on Mideast oil.\n  We see the latest press release dated October 25, AP, ``Qatar Calls \nFor Oil Production Cuts.'' We all know what this means. This means the \nOPEC nations are coming together to reduce the supply so that the price \nof oil can be increased in that range of $22 to $25.\n  We see another headline, from Washington Post, October 26, ``Iraq \nCaught Smuggling Oil, U.N. Official Says.''\n  As we all know, Iraq is under economic sanctions regime. The U.N. has \ncontrol, up to a point, over monitoring the sale of oil from Iraq. But \nwhat Iraq has been doing is they have been cheating. What they do is \nthey bring a tanker into their port. There is a certification on a bill \nof lading for so many barrels of oil. The U.N. inspectors sign off on \nit. And then after they leave, they fill up the rest of the tanker with \nillegal oil, and, obviously, the profits go to Saddam Hussein.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 26, 2001]\n\n             Iraq Caught Smuggling Oil, U.N. Official Says\n\n                            (By Colum Lynch)\n\n       United Nations, Oct. 25.--Iraq was caught smuggling $10 \n     million worth of oil through an Athens-based shipping company \n     in violation of U.N. sanctions, the United Nations said \n     today. U.S. and U.N. officials have long suspected Iraq of \n     siphoning between $1 billion to $2 billion in oil revenue \n     each year. But this is the first time that the United Nations \n     has obtained hard evidence to support those suspicions. Under \n     the terms of a U.N. oil-for-food program begun in 1996, Iraq \n     is allowed to sell oil to buy humanitarian goods, pay \n     restitution to the victims of the Persian Gulf War and fund \n     improvements in the country's infrastructure. Iraq exported \n     more than $18 billion worth of oil last year.\n       Benon Sevan, the executive director of the program, \n     provided the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday with a letter \n     from a Greek captain who has admitted illegally exporting \n     500,000 barrels of Iraqi crude during two trips to the \n     Persian Gulf port of Mina Al-Bakr in May and August. \n     Chiladakis Theofanis, captain of the oil tanker Essex, wrote \n     to the United Nations and the United States in September that \n     Iraq loaded 1.8 million barrels into his vessel on May 16 \n     while a team of U.N. inspectors looked on.\n       When the U.N. officials left the site, the Iraqis pumped an \n     additional 230,000 barrels of crude into the tanker and \n     provided a bill of lading for the additional oil to a company \n     called Roundhead Inc., Sevan said. A similar scheme was \n     repeated on Aug. 27.\n       ``The ships involved first loaded the quantities of oil \n     which were authorized under the program,'' Sevan said in a \n     letter to the Security Council committee that oversees Iraq's \n     oil exports. ``After United Nations inspection agents had \n     finalized their activities on board of the ships, the load \n     pumps on the platform were allegedly restarted in order to \n     load additional volumes of oil on the vessels.'' Iraq's \n     ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammed Douri, denied the \n     charges.\n       The Security Council has been attempting to stop the Iraqi \n     smuggling but has encountered resistance from Russia, which \n     has contended there is little proof. Russia has blocked a \n     U.S.-British proposal to revise the sanctions policy against \n     Iraq.\n       The proposal aims to ease civilian imports while tightening \n     the controls on oil smuggling and the purchase or prohibited \n     weapons. Moscow favors steps aimed at lifting the sanctions \n     entirely. The oil-for-food program will be up for renewal on \n     Nov. 30.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It indicates that when the U.N. officials left the \nsite, the Iraqis pumped an additional 230,000 barrels of crude oil into \nthe tanker and provided a bill of lading for the additional oil to a \ncompany called Roundhead Incorporated. This was repeated again on the \n27th. The estimated revenue that has come into Iraq is indicated to be \nbetween $1 and $2 billion in additional revenue as a consequence of \nthese activities.\n  We know this cheating is going on. We are about to face the reality \nthat the price of oil is going to be increasing as OPEC recognizes the \nvulnerability of the United States.\n  I want to share one more thing with the Senate. This is the \nforeboding reality of the future. Some of us around here remember what \nhappened in Iran a little over a decade ago. The fall of the Shah. The \nShah fell. How did he fall? He fell in a revolution that occurred as a \nconsequence of the unrest in that country at that time.\n  I would suggest that the record would note that the same set of \ncircumstances are very much in evidence in Saudi Arabia today.\n  You may recall the Greek myth about Cassandra, who had the ability to \npredict the future, combined with the curse that nobody would believe \nher. When it comes to energy, I am beginning to feel somewhat like \nCassandra.\n  I have come to this floor week after week pointing out the peril of \nour current energy situation and the looming disaster that is our \nenergy future if we simply maintain our current course. I have come \nbefore this Senate week after week calling for a balanced and \nresponsive energy policy to the crisis ahead, a policy that stresses \nproduction and conservation, which promotes the development of \nalternative energies, as well as prudent development of traditional \nresources.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Breaux and I submitted a bipartisan energy \nbill that had over 300 pages. The bill had extensive proposals for \nconservation and alternatives. But the only thing most of the \ncolleagues focused on was the 2 pages covering a small sliver of the \nArctic in my State of Alaska known as ANWR. That is where the lightning \nrod was, Madam President.\n  As we know, we are living in a new era today, after September 11. Our \ncountry and our way of life were attacked on that date, and we are in \nthe midst of the anthrax scare. It is, in all likelihood, closely \nconnected with the attacks in New York and Washington. What do \nSeptember 11 and the subsequent events have to do with energy? I say, \neverything.\n  At the risk of sounding like a Cassandra again, I want to set out the \nfacts as they are known now and invite this body to look into the \nfuture.\n  Fact No. 1: Every reputable scientific study of our future energy \nconsumption suggests that, even with dramatic conservation and rapid \ndevelopment of economical alternatives, our dependence on oil as a \npercentage of overall energy use will increase for the next 20 years. \nWhether we like it or not, a stable source of oil is key to our \neconomic viability for the foreseeable future.\n  Fact No. 2: Absent new discoveries, the major source for new energy \nimports will be the Persian Gulf, the location of a majority of the \nworld's known reserves. We are already dependent for about 25 percent \nof our total oil use on the Persian Gulf, and that number will only \nincrease. This Nation today is importing 57 percent of the crude oil we \nconsume, with half of that coming from the Persian Gulf.\n  Fact No. 3: Our relationship with the Persian Gulf countries is \nuneasy, to say the least. Of the major oil-producing countries in the \nPersian Gulf, we apply some form of economic sanction to all of them. \nThink of that. We have economic sanctions on virtually all of those \ncountries in the Persian Gulf from which we import oil. We have a \nmoratorium on imports from Iran. We import, as I indicated, somewhere \nbetween 700,000 and a million barrels a day from Iraq, which we have \nbeen bombing for 10 years. Our relations with the remainder are \ncomplicated by a number of factors, not the least of which is our \nalliance with Israel, a country which is the sworn enemy of most of \nthose nations in the Mideast.\n  Fact No. 4: The stability of the Persian Gulf is in grave doubt. We \nhave spent billions to have troops stationed in Saudi Arabia to contain \nIraq in the name of the Persian Gulf Stability Accord. Radical Islamic \nmovements are a serious political force in many other countries. Even \nSaudi Arabia, our traditional bulwark of stability in the region, is \nnow a cause for grave concern.\n  Mr. Hersh's article, written after extensive consultations with the \nNational Security Agency and others, paints a grave picture of Saudi \nArabia's political future, the corruption of\n\n[[Page S11278]]\n\nthe country's regime, its alienation from the country's religious rank \nand file, and its vulnerability to Islamic fundamentalism.\n\n  Detailed in the article is an eerie reminder of the situation in Iran \nin the late 1970s under the Shah. Iran was, of course, at that time the \nUnited States' stable anchor in the gulf. We all remember too clearly \nwhat happened in Iran.\n  Mr. Hersh also points out the level of complicity between those we \nrely on for energy in Saudi Arabia and those who seek to attack the \nUnited States and our citizens.\n  Saudi Arabia is the largest single source of funding for radical \nfundamentalism and its organs of terror. The Taliban would not exist \nbut for Saudi Arabian money. That has been identified. Al-Qaida and \nOsama bin Laden would not exist but for Saudi money. I need not remind \nyou that Saudi money would not exist at all but for oil. It all comes \nback to oil.\n  On October 22, the two largest newspapers in New York and Washington, \nDC--the sites of the attacks on September 11--issued editorial opinions \nurging that we resist linkage between the events of the 11th and energy \npolicy--totally in contrast to the position, I might add, of organized \nlabor and veterans in this country.\n  Let me confront those opinions with another set of basic facts about \nthe September 11 attacks. Osama bin Laden and other radical Islamic \ngroups have three major issues with our Nation. First, the United \nStates alliance with Israel--our traditional alliance with Israel is \nbeing put to the test by energy dependence in the gulf. The Bush \nadministration, which has been as good or a better friend to Israel \nthan any other administration in recent memory, is now somewhat at odds \nwith Israel in an attempt to appeal to more moderate elements in the \nGulf. What is this all about? It is about oil.\n  Secondly, bin Laden wants United States troops out of Saudi Arabia. \nWhy are we there? To prevent Iraq from threatening the stability of the \ngulf. The issue is oil.\n  Thirdly, bin Laden believes that the value of Persian Gulf oil should \nbe seven times its current price--that is, $144 a barrel. He has \nwritten in his extensive writings that he wants to seize control of \nwhat he calls the ``Islamic wealth'' in order to end what he calls the \n``greatest theft in human history''--the U.S. purchase of cheap oil.''\n  It is all about oil, oil, oil. To suggest there is no linkage between \nenergy policies and the events of September 11, in my opinion, is \nludicrous. It doesn't take Cassandra to see where our energy future is \nheaded. It will, however, require action by this Senate in order to \nreverse our present course. The House has done its job. The President \nhas asked the Senate to act. I urge my colleagues to pass energy \nlegislation as soon as possible.\n  I think we have continually communicated, as a minority, with the \nDemocratic leadership urging the scheduling of an energy bill that we \ncan take up and debate prior to going out on recess. There seems to be \na reluctance in the Democratic leadership. There is an energy task \nforce report in the energy bill that we have outlined. It is very \nunrealistic, in my opinion, to address the arguments, one of which, of \ncourse, continues to be the issue of ANWR.\n  One of the fascinating things about the contribution of oil that \ncomes down the west coast to the States of Washington, California, and \nultimately Oregon--although Oregon does not have a refinery--is the \nreality that nearly two-thirds of that oil comes from Alaska. If Alaska \ndoesn't replace that oil, that oil is going to come into these States, \nand it is going to come from the Mideast, come in foreign tankers that \nare built in U.S. shipyards, with U.S. crews.\n  The States of Washington, Oregon, and California should recognize \ntheir secure supply from Alaska is much more valuable than the unknown \nrisks associated with bringing oil in from the Mideast.\n  As Congress looks at the current exposure to terrorism, where a \nterrorist act in Saudi Arabia can overthrow the royal family in Saudi \nArabia, or there could be a terrorist attack on ships going through the \nStraits of Hormuz--all of that leads to the question: Should we have an \nenergy bill that balances conservation and production?\n  I will close with the argument relative to those who seem to have a \nlittle difficulty with the issue of opening up the Coastal Plain. I \nwill give some idea of the vastness of the area.\n  Many people in this body have not chosen to take advantage of \nopportunities to visit the area for themselves. ANWR happens to be \nabout the size of the State of South Carolina. It is about 19 million \nacres. The House bill allows 2,000 acres to be utilized for development \nand exploration; 2,000 acres is not much bigger than a small farm, if \none can somehow recognize we are talking about 2,000 acres out of 19 \nmillion acres.\n  What is the rest of ANWR? Madam President, 8.5 million acres have \nbeen put in wilderness in perpetuity, 9 million acres in refuge, and \nthere is only 1.5 million acres left that only Congress has the \nauthority to open.\n  In the House bill, only 2,000 acres can have the footprint of \ndevelopment only. Is that responsible? We think it is. Can it be opened \nsafely? We have had 30 years experience in Prudhoe Bay. Prudhoe Bay has \ndeveloped 13 billion barrels of oil. It was only supposed to develop 10 \nbillion barrels of oil. It has provided the Nation with 25 percent of \nits total crude oil supply for the last 27 years.\n  People say ANWR contains a 6-month supply. That is assuming there is \nno other oil produced in this country and no other oil imported. If, \nindeed, ANWR is in the range of estimates of 5.6 billion to 16 billion \nbarrels, it would replace what we would import from Saudi Arabia in 30 \nyears or Iraq in 50 years. It would be very substantial.\n  The merits of whether we can do this safely, the merits of the \narguments of some of America's extreme environmental communities that \nhave used this issue, very frankly, as a cash cow--and they have milked \nit for all they can and will continue to do so until we eventually \nauthorize the opening of it and they can move on to something else--\nbecause this issue is so far away, the American people cannot see the \nreality of ANWR for themselves. That, indeed, we have the technology to \nopen the area safely.\n  Recognize the experience we have had in the Arctic over the last 30 \nyears. We built ice roads. We do not develop when the migratory path of \nthe caribou are involved. The potential of the area is very large. If \nthere isn't the oil we expect there to be, we can make a park out of \nit.\n  For us not to have knowledge of what is in there at a time when we \nare increasing our dependence on the Mideast is unconscionable to me.\n  There are other issues that enter into this, such as our relationship \nwith Canada. Canada considers us a competitor, and there is nothing \nwrong with competition. Nevertheless, their view of the world is we \nshould not develop any more resources out of Alaska because it competes \nwith theirs in the Canadian Arctic. I can understand that.\n  As to the growth of the caribou herds in the Prudhoe Bay field, there \nwere 3,000 to 4,000 animals, and now they have close to 26,000 animals \nin the Prudhoe Bay area. You cannot shoot them.\n\n  The Washington Post ran articles depicting polar bears. It is \ninteresting because the pictures--and this is yesterday's Washington \nPost article--shows a couple of polar bears. When one reads this, one \nassumes this is in the 1002 area. This is a little east of Barrow. It \nis not in the 1002 area. We have certification from the photographer \nwho took these pictures that it is not in the 1002 area. But it is a \nwarm, cuddly issue, and people look at polar bears.\n  The article does not tell you that these polar bears are protected. \nThey are marine mammals. If one wants to take a trophy polar bear, one \ncan go to Canada and shoot it, or one can go to Russia and shoot it, \nbut one cannot in the United States, in Alaska, shoot a polar bear.\n  I do not know a better way to protect the polar bear than protecting \nthem from traditional trophy hunting. We have taken steps to try and be \nresponsible relative to development in this fragile area. We have the \ntechnology to do it right.\n  Some people say: That is academic, Senator Murkowski, because we are \nlooking at 7 to 10 years before development is complete. If we built \nthe Pentagon in 18 months and the Empire State Building in a little \nover a year, and this body expedited the permitting\n\n[[Page S11279]]\n\nprocess--we already have a pipeline halfway from the trans-Alaska 800-\nmile pipeline over to the 1002 area. It ends in a field called Badami. \nWe only have another 40 to 50 miles to go. We can have oil flowing in \n18 months. There is absolutely no question about it.\n  The arguments being used are the same arguments that were used in the \nlate sixties opposing the opening of Prudhoe Bay. They are exactly the \nsame. Only then they said: You are going to run an 800-mile pipeline \nfrom the Arctic to southern ports of Alaska, and it is going to be like \na fence. The caribou and moose are not going to be able to cross, it is \ngoing to break and notwithstanding earthquakes. It is one of the \nengineering wonders of the world, and it has provided jobs in this \ncountry.\n  I am going to finish with one point, and that is the stimulus. We are \ntalking about a stimulus in this Nation. What does a stimulus mean? It \nmeans different things to different people. To some it means jobs; to \nothers it means tax relief. I defy any Member of this body to tell me a \nstimulus that is more meaningful than authorizing the opening of ANWR \nbecause what it would do is it would provide hundreds of thousands of \njobs. Not government jobs, private sector jobs in shipbuilding, in \ndeveloping pipes and valves. It would start immediately. This would \ncome from the private sector in exploration, and those ships would be \nU.S. ships built in U.S. yards.\n  What else would it do, Madam President? It would result in the \nFederal Government getting probably $1.6 billion in revenue immediately \nin lease sales because it is Federal land. The Federal Government puts \nit up for lease, competitive bids. The estimate of the Federal share is \nroughly in that area. That is a pretty good return to the Federal \nGovernment to start out.\n  The last thing, as we look at this stimulus package, you are not \ngoing to find anything in it except potentially ANWR which is not going \nto cost the Federal Government one red cent. I challenge my colleagues \nto find another project which would provide such a major economic \nstimulus without costing the taxpayers money, and indeed bringing \nsignificant revenue into the treasury.\n  I rest my case. I thank the Chair for her attention and wish her and \nall a happy Halloween.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, will the Senator from Alaska yield for \na question? I want to get this straight. Right now when we buy oil from \nforeign countries, the royalties, the labor, the pipes, and all the \nconstruction and drilling, all the economic investment is in those \nforeign countries; is that correct?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. But if we were to open ANWR, the Federal Government, \njust from the sale of the leases, would receive $1.6 billion?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is estimated the lease sale would bring the Federal \nGovernment about $1.6 billion in revenue. It may be more. Nobody knows \nbecause industry would competitively bid it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would there be royalties paid each year after that \nduring production?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If there is production, the Federal Government would \nreceive additional royalties?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would the State of Alaska benefit from that?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes, obviously. I also want to point out that a \nsizable percentage of our deficit balance of payments, as the Senator \nknows, is the cost of imported oil.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And the workers even in Alaska are supposed to pay \nFederal income tax.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. They do pay Federal income tax. They are all American \ncitizens, and they are subject to the same laws as the Senator from \nAlabama and I.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Instead of having workers in Saudi Arabia paying taxes \nto Saudi Arabia, Iraq, or Iran, they would be paying taxes to the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Absolutely. This would be all U.S. labor. There would \nbe a prohibition on any of the oil that comes from ANWR being exported \nout of the United States.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know there are people who have become emotionally \ncommitted to this ANWR issue. I hope people will rethink it. As the \nSenator from Alaska has explained repeatedly, we have such a small area \nthat needs to be produced, and wells are so much more sophisticated \ntoday. One well can drain a much larger area than ever before. There is \na virtual pipeline there. That is important. The Senator mentioned a \nthreat from foreign dependence.\n  Was it not just a few years ago the price of oil per barrel on the \nworld market was around $13 and the cartel, since they had so much of \nthe oil, fixed the price and drove it up to as high as $30 a barrel?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It was a little over $30. As a matter of fact, they \nbasically came together and set a floor and a ceiling. The floor was \n$22 and the ceiling was $25. If it goes up above that, that is fine for \nawhile. Then they increase production and bring it down.\n  Of course, what has happened with this terrorist activity is less jet \nfuel is used, less automobile gasoline. So we temporarily have a \nsurplus and we are seeing that, but now OPEC is reducing their supply.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I guess the point is, these are supposedly our friends \nwho triple the price we have to pay for oil. We have to pay three times \nas much money to foreign sources, and we get no more oil than we did \nthe day before they drove it up?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is true.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If they can do that, if they are friends, if we were to \nhave some turnover in government or a war were to break out that could \ndeny some of this, we could see prices even higher than that on the \nworld market?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Absolutely. There is one other point that is obvious \nto the Senator and to me, but it is overlooked by some, and that is we \nhave other sources of energy. We have natural gas. We have coal. We \nhave biomass. We have wind power, solar power. But because of our \ntechnology, America and the world moves on oil. It is put in airplanes. \nIt is put in boats. It is put in trains, automobiles. For the \nforeseeable future, we are evidently unlikely to find any significant \nreplacement for oil. So that is why we have become so dependent and our \nvulnerability, to the extent of our national security, is at risk, as \nour veterans are pointing out.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Of course, the Senator is not overlooking conservation. \nThat is another way to reduce dependence on foreign oil.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is a big part of this bill that the Senator \nproposed.\n  I again want to express my appreciation to the Senator. I came to the \nSenate 5 years ago and heard the Senator delineate this problem and \ntell us over and over again what we were going to be facing in the \nfuture. I think the events in recent weeks have validated the Senator's \nwarnings, the Senator's caution to America, the Senator's call for us \nto do the smart thing.\n  I also believe if we can produce more oil at home, it would reduce \nour deficit and help this economy recovery.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. As the Senate knows, symbolism is so significant. If \nwe were to make a decision to allow the opening of this particular \narea, we would send a signal to OPEC that we mean business, that we are \nserious about reducing our dependence. We are not going to replace \ndependence, but we can reduce it dramatically by a conscientious effort \nto keep these jobs at home, and, as we both know, the economic forecast \nsuggests there could be significant growing concern over loss of jobs \nand this is the most significant single identifiable project to create \njobs that anybody has been able to pinpoint that does not cost the \nGovernment any money or the taxpayer.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will ask one more question. The Senator has \nchallenged us now to name one more project anywhere in this country \nthat will produce as much stimulus as increasing our domestic oil \nsupply as this bill will do, and I think it is a challenge that ought \nto stay out there and we ought to see if somebody can meet it. Not only \nwill it help us, it will actually produce income and not cost us any \nmoney.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I certainly would challenge any Member to come up with \na stimulus that would provide jobs, not cost the American taxpayer \nanything, and indeed bring revenue into the coffers. I thank my good \nfriend and wish him a good day.\n\n[[Page S11280]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/31/senate-section/article/S11275-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11275-S11280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would just like to share a few \nremarks at this time concerning the energy bill. We need to improve our \nproduction of energy within the United States, and I would like to \nshare a few thoughts about why I think it is a critical part of \nstimulating the economy.\n  At this time of economic slowdown, we need to create circumstances \nthat will allow the economy to grow and flower. It has struck me for \nsome time--and I have mentioned this on the floor previously--that our \neconomic slowdown began over a year ago, and it began not long after we \nsaw a tremendous surge in the price of energy. The price of a barrel of \noil in the United States was as low as $13 a barrel. It soon leaped to \n$30 a barrel. And 60 percent of all the oil we utilize in the United \nStates is purchased abroad.\n  So there was a tremendous transfer of American wealth. We got no more \noil--not a single barrel of oil--but we were paying more than twice as \nmuch for that oil as we were paying just months before it surged \nupward.\n  That drained a great deal of money from this economy. It \ndemonstrated, with great clarity, the dependence we have on foreign \noil. And most of the reserves of foreign oil are in the Middle East. It \nhas pointed out the dangers we face if we do not make some changes.\n  Now we are engaged in hostilities in the Middle East, and we see, \nonce again, just how fragile that supply of oil is to our Nation, and \nhow quickly it can be interrupted.\n  Our economy needs to improve. I think it is incumbent on us to \nconsider, quite seriously, reforming our energy laws so that we can \nproduce more energy in this country. If we can do that, we will be able \nto keep more money at home. So when a well is drilled, the question is, \nWill it be drilled in Saudi Arabia or Iran or Iraq or Kuwait, or will \nit be drilled somewhere in the United States? When it is drilled here, \nnot only does the money stay here--the royalties that are paid to the \nState or the landowner for the oil--but all the people who drill the \nwell, all the people who work at it, process the oil, and move that oil \nfrom the wellhead site--all of those people will be paid salaries; and \nthen they will pay taxes. They will help reduce our unemployment, \nincrease tax revenue, and provide income for American workers.\n  So we need to do a number of things to improve our energy situation \nso that we reduce the drain on our economy from the constant purchase \nof oil abroad.\n  Conservation is a critical part of that. The more we can reduce the \nuse of oil and gas in America, then the less demand we have to transfer \nwealth abroad to purchase it. At the same time, the more we can produce \nin the United States, the greater our chance will be to churn that \nmoney again within the United States, creating jobs, salaries, \nretirements, and health care benefits, as well as taxes for our States \nand our governments, our local school systems, and the Federal \nGovernment. It will strengthen our economy in a number of ways.\n  I think improving our energy production would be a critical step in \nrevitalizing our economy. I do not think it is coincidental that we \nbegan to sink not long after we saw a tripling of the price of oil on \nthe world market.\n  I am delighted to see the ranking member of the Energy Committee, \nSenator Murkowski, in this Chamber. I know he wants to speak on this \nissue. He has been a constant, steady advocate for America: What is \ngood for American workers, what is good for this country, what we need \nto do to remain economically strong.\n  If we do not remain economically strong, we cannot do the good things \nin this country, and around the world, we want to do.\n  He has been a great champion of that. As I said, I see he is in this \nChamber. I suspect he would like to talk on the energy issue in more \ndetail.\n  I thank him for his leadership and yield the floor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, let me acknowledge the comments of my \ngood friend. He and I have shared stands on many issues; and one that I \nthink is prominent at this time, as indicated, is on the issue relative \nto the request by our President that we have and pass an energy policy, \nand that we do it with dispatch.\n  Our President has spoken out four times in the last 2 weeks, \nindicating the general observation that, indeed, we need an energy \nbill.\n  Quoting from a late October release, the statement is made that:\n\n       Tax relief is only part of the job. We need an energy plan \n     for America. Under the leadership of the Vice President, we \n     have drafted a comprehensive, common sense plan for the \n     future of our country.\n\n  It further states that:\n\n       It has passed the House of Representatives in H.R. 4. It \n     needs a vote in the U.S. Senate. We need to be more self-\n     reliant and more self-sufficient.\n\n  On October 17, he indicated:\n\n       I ask Congress to now act on an energy bill. The House of \n     Representatives passed its bill in August. This is an issue \n     of special importance to California, the State of Washington \n     [which the Presiding Officer represents]. Too much of our \n     energy comes from the Mideast. The plan I sent up to Congress \n     promotes conservation, expands energy supplies, and improves \n     the efficiency of our energy network. Our country needs \n     greater energy independence.\n\n  On October 4:\n\n       There are two other aspects to a good, strong economic \n     stimulus.\n\n  I note that the President uses the words ``economic stimulus.''\n\n       One is trade promotion authority, and the other is an \n     energy bill. I urge the Senate to listen to the will of the \n     Senators and move forward on a bill that will help Americans \n     find work and also make it easier for all of us around the \n     table to protect the security of the country.\n\n  We have spent a lot of time talking about homeland security. An \nintegral piece of homeland security is energy independence. I ask the \nSenate to respond to the call to get an energy bill moving.''\n  The President made another comment to a group today asking again that \nthis body move on an energy bill. It would be derelict if we are to \nconclude this session without addressing an energy bill.\n  We are not alone. I have letters here from the American Legion, \nVietnam Veterans Institute, Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, Gold Star \nWives of America, Catholic War Veterans, Survivors of Pearl Harbor, all \nwho participated in a press conference yesterday here in Washington.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We write today out of a sense of \n     urgency concerning our national security, as it relates to \n     our need for energy independence. The development of \n     America's domestic energy resources is vital to our national \n     security. We respectfully urge you to adopt the provisions \n     contained in H.R. 4, the ``Securing America's Future Energy \n     Act of 2001.''\n       War and international terrorism have again brought into \n     sharp focus the heavy reliance of the United States on \n     imported oil. During times of crises, such reliance threatens \n     our national security and economic well being. The import of \n     more than 50 percent of our petroleum from the Persian Gulf \n     further compounds our foreign trade balance at a time when \n     our energy demands continue unabated. It is important that we \n     develop domestic sources of oil, contained within our public \n     lands--such as the supplies within the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge.\n       Working for a comprehensive energy policy and achieving \n     responsible energy independence are critical national \n     security and economic goals. H.R. 4, as passed by the House \n     of Representatives, is a major step forward to achieving \n     these imperative goals. We strongly urge your support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard J.

Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We write today out of a sense of \n     urgency concerning our national security as it relates to our \n     energy supply. The development of America's domestic energy \n     resources is vital to our national security. We respectfully \n     urge you to\n\n[[Page S11276]]\n\n     immediately pass H.R. 4, the comprehensive energy \n     legislation.\n       We are pleased the House of Representatives, acting with \n     bipartisan support, addressed our energy vulnerability by \n     passing H.R. 4, the `Securing America's Future Energy Act of \n     2001' or the `SAFE Act of 2001.' It is imperative the Senate \n     do the same. Following the horrific events of September 11, \n     2001, failure to pass this bill would pose a threat to our \n     people, our economy, and our national security, that we all \n     wore the uniform to maintain.\n       All Americans, as well as our military troops, need this \n     legislation enacted into law. If we intend to rebuild our \n     economy and continue the campaign against international \n     terrorism and those who attacked us, we must develop domestic \n     sources of oil contained within our public lands--such as the \n     supplies within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We must \n     be able to rely to the fullest extent possible on our own \n     resources to provide for the maintenance of our economy at \n     home and our prolonged war effort abroad.\n       By passing H.R. 4, the comprehensive energy legislation \n     now, the Senate will be supporting our troops in the field \n     and all working Americans, including those displaced by this \n     heartless act of aggression. We, as Veterans, stand united \n     and cannot overstate the importance of this legislation, and \n     respectfully request you lead the Senate by voting on and \n     passing H.R. 4 so our nation can move forward in defense of \n     freedom around the world.\n       We know that when the chips are down, America can and will \n     stand and fight, using all its resources and all its might to \n     defend our nation and the cause of freedom around the world. \n     Join us in this cause. Pass the comprehensive energy bill and \n     help us rebuild America!\n       With the support of our members,\n                                                   J.

Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Daschle: On behalf of AMVETS, I am writing to \n     encourage you to bring H.R. 4, the Securing America's Future \n     Energy Act of 2001, before the full Senate for consideration \n     at the earliest possible moment prior to the close of the 1st \n     Session of the 107th Congress.\n       As you know, our current reliance on foreign oil leaves the \n     United States vulnerable to the whim of individual oil-\n     exporting countries, many existing in the unpredictable and \n     highly dangerous Persian Gulf. And it cannot be overstated \n     that energy supplies touch nearly every aspect of our lives \n     from our economy to our national security.\n       Passage of H.R. 4, would greatly assist in our ability to \n     secure a more dependable and diversified domestic supply of \n     energy. And, I would note that since the Persian Gulf War our \n     security has become more threatened with our dependence on \n     foreign sources of oil growing from 35 percent of domestic \n     supply to nearly 60 percent.\n       AMVETS firmly believes that we cannot wait for the next \n     crisis before we act. H.R. 4, as approved by the House, is a \n     critical part of an overall policy America requires to \n     promote dependable, affordable, and environmentally sound \n     production and distribution of energy for the future. We urge \n     your expedited approval of this legislation.\n       Dedicated to service,\n                                               Joseph W.

The \n     horrific events of September 11, 2001, constitute a threat to \n     our people, our economy, and our nation's security. With U.S. \n     troops actively engaged in combat overseas, we firmly believe \n     that America can and will win this prolonged war against \n     terrorism, using all its resources to defend our nation and \n     the cause of freedom around the world.\n       Because of these beliefs, we applaud the House of \n     Representatives for its bipartisan work in addressing our \n     energy vulnerability by passing H.R. 4, the ``Securing \n     America's Future Energy Act of 2001'' or the ``SAFE Act of \n     2001.'' It is imperative that the Senate pass the House \n     version of H.R. 4 so that our nation can move forward in \n     establishing our energy security, as well as our defense of \n     freedom at home and abroad. It is essential for us to develop \n     all domestic energy resources including the supplies within \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       By passing H.R. 4, the comprehensive energy legislation, \n     the Senate will be supporting our troops in the field, all \n     Americans, their families, and our nation. We, as Veterans, \n     stand united and respectfully request that the Senate vote on \n     and pass H.R. 4.\n\n                                               J. Eldon Yates,\n\n                                             Chairman and Founder,\n                                       Vietnam Veterans Institute.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. These letters indicate their support for energy \nlegislation to be passed out of the U.S. Senate. From October 25:\n\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We write today out of a sense of \n     urgency concerning our national security as it relates to our \n     need for energy independence. The development of America's \n     energy resources is vital to our national security. We \n     respectfully urge you to adopt the provisions contained in \n     H.R. 4, the ``Securing America's Future Energy Act of 2001.''\n\n  The House has acted. This letter was signed by the American Legion.\n  Here is a quote from the AMVETS letter:\n\n       On behalf of AMVETS, I am writing to encourage you to bring \n     H.R. 4, the Securing America's Future Energy Act of 2001, to \n     the full Senate for consideration.\n\n  The Vietnam Veterans Institute:\n\n       We write today out of a sense of urgency concerning our \n     national security as it relates to our energy supply.\n\n  The important point is that each one of these organizations reflect \non our energy supply in conjunction with our national security.\n  They further state:\n\n       If we intend to rebuild our economy and continue the \n     campaign against international terrorism and those who \n     attacked us, we must develop domestic sources of oil \n     contained within our public lands--such as supplies within \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We must be able to rely, \n     to the fullest extent possible, on our own resources. . .\n\n  That is signed by J. Eldon Yates, chairman and founder of the Vietnam \nVeterans Institute. We have our Nation's veterans groups also signing \non as well. These represent a pretty significant voice of those who \ngave so much for America, for the freedoms we enjoy and the realization \nthat we can never properly repay the contribution made by our veterans.\n  I note in the letter from the American Legion:\n\n       War and international terrorism have again brought into \n     sharp focus the heavy reliance of the United States on \n     imported oil. During these times of crisis, such reliance \n     threatens again our national security and economic well-\n     being. The importation of more than 50 percent of our \n     petroleum from the Persian Gulf further compounds our foreign \n     trade deficit at a time when our energy demands continue \n     unabated. It is important that we develop domestic sources of \n     oil contained within our public lands, such as the supplies \n     within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n  We have a pretty good representation of what America's veterans think \nabout the necessity of this body passing an energy bill. It is \nimportant to note that one member of this body, the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts, is quoted as saying, with regard to his comments on \npatriotism vis-a-vis ANWR:\n\n       This is not the moment to falsely cloak in the mantle of \n     patriotism a choice as clear and as critical as the choice \n     about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n  I will let the Senator speak for himself relative to an explanation. \nIt is in deep contrast to the attitude prevailing among America's \nveterans organizations.\n  If we look at reality associated with what is happening in the world \ntoday, we can reflect on just how we have compromised ourselves into a \nposition of vulnerability. There is a gentleman who was a Member of \nthis body for many years, Mark Hatfield of Oregon. Mark Hatfield was a \npacifist. I think I can liberally use that general terminology. His \nposition on opening up this area of public lands in my State of Alaska \nwas very clear. He said: I will support opening up ANWR any day rather \nthan send another American man or woman into harm's way to fight a war \non foreign soil. Make no mistake about it, that is just what we are \ndoing today; we are fighting a war on foreign soil.\n\n  What is the last war we fought over oil? We have to go back to the \nPersian Gulf conflict. We have to go back to what Saddam Hussein of \nIraq was basically up to, what his objective was. His objective was to \ngo into Kuwait, invade Kuwait and go into Saudi Arabia. He knew that he \ncould control the world's supply of oil, and the power and influence \nthat would come as a consequence of that would certainly put him in the \ndriver's seat relative to policies in the Mideast.\n  What are we doing today? We are importing somewhere between 700,000 \nand a million barrels of oil from Iraq, from our friend Saddam Hussein. \nWhat do we do with that oil? We enforce an aerial blockade to a large \ndegree because we fly our planes over enforcing the no-fly zone. It \nmight be compared to a blockade at sea, only this is one in the air. We \nare putting in danger our men and\n\n[[Page S11277]]\n\nwomen as they enforce this. They take out targets, radar targets, from \ntime to time. He attempts to shoot us down. He shot down a couple of \ndrones. He has almost shot down one of our interceptor aircraft. As a \nconsequence, as we continue this policy, our vulnerability is evident.\n  In so doing, he takes our money, pays his Republican Guards for \nprotection, develops a missile capability, develops, for all practical \npurposes, activities associated with fostering terrorism, he develops a \nbiological weapons capability. Who does he aim it at? He aims at our \nally Israel.\n  That is a consequence of the United States losing its leverage \nrelative to its continued dependence on Mideast oil.\n  We see the latest press release dated October 25, AP, ``Qatar Calls \nFor Oil Production Cuts.'' We all know what this means. This means the \nOPEC nations are coming together to reduce the supply so that the price \nof oil can be increased in that range of $22 to $25.\n  We see another headline, from Washington Post, October 26, ``Iraq \nCaught Smuggling Oil, U.N. Official Says.''\n  As we all know, Iraq is under economic sanctions regime. The U.N. has \ncontrol, up to a point, over monitoring the sale of oil from Iraq. But \nwhat Iraq has been doing is they have been cheating. What they do is \nthey bring a tanker into their port. There is a certification on a bill \nof lading for so many barrels of oil. The U.N. inspectors sign off on \nit. And then after they leave, they fill up the rest of the tanker with \nillegal oil, and, obviously, the profits go to Saddam Hussein.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 26, 2001]\n\n             Iraq Caught Smuggling Oil, U.N. Official Says\n\n                            (By Colum Lynch)\n\n       United Nations, Oct. 25.--Iraq was caught smuggling $10 \n     million worth of oil through an Athens-based shipping company \n     in violation of U.N. sanctions, the United Nations said \n     today. U.S. and U.N. officials have long suspected Iraq of \n     siphoning between $1 billion to $2 billion in oil revenue \n     each year. But this is the first time that the United Nations \n     has obtained hard evidence to support those suspicions. Under \n     the terms of a U.N. oil-for-food program begun in 1996, Iraq \n     is allowed to sell oil to buy humanitarian goods, pay \n     restitution to the victims of the Persian Gulf War and fund \n     improvements in the country's infrastructure. Iraq exported \n     more than $18 billion worth of oil last year.\n       Benon Sevan, the executive director of the program, \n     provided the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday with a letter \n     from a Greek captain who has admitted illegally exporting \n     500,000 barrels of Iraqi crude during two trips to the \n     Persian Gulf port of Mina Al-Bakr in May and August. \n     Chiladakis Theofanis, captain of the oil tanker Essex, wrote \n     to the United Nations and the United States in September that \n     Iraq loaded 1.8 million barrels into his vessel on May 16 \n     while a team of U.N. inspectors looked on.\n       When the U.N. officials left the site, the Iraqis pumped an \n     additional 230,000 barrels of crude into the tanker and \n     provided a bill of lading for the additional oil to a company \n     called Roundhead Inc., Sevan said. A similar scheme was \n     repeated on Aug. 27.\n       ``The ships involved first loaded the quantities of oil \n     which were authorized under the program,'' Sevan said in a \n     letter to the Security Council committee that oversees Iraq's \n     oil exports. ``After United Nations inspection agents had \n     finalized their activities on board of the ships, the load \n     pumps on the platform were allegedly restarted in order to \n     load additional volumes of oil on the vessels.'' Iraq's \n     ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammed Douri, denied the \n     charges.\n       The Security Council has been attempting to stop the Iraqi \n     smuggling but has encountered resistance from Russia, which \n     has contended there is little proof. Russia has blocked a \n     U.S.-British proposal to revise the sanctions policy against \n     Iraq.\n       The proposal aims to ease civilian imports while tightening \n     the controls on oil smuggling and the purchase or prohibited \n     weapons. Moscow favors steps aimed at lifting the sanctions \n     entirely. The oil-for-food program will be up for renewal on \n     Nov. 30.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It indicates that when the U.N. officials left the \nsite, the Iraqis pumped an additional 230,000 barrels of crude oil into \nthe tanker and provided a bill of lading for the additional oil to a \ncompany called Roundhead Incorporated. This was repeated again on the \n27th. The estimated revenue that has come into Iraq is indicated to be \nbetween $1 and $2 billion in additional revenue as a consequence of \nthese activities.\n  We know this cheating is going on. We are about to face the reality \nthat the price of oil is going to be increasing as OPEC recognizes the \nvulnerability of the United States.\n  I want to share one more thing with the Senate. This is the \nforeboding reality of the future. Some of us around here remember what \nhappened in Iran a little over a decade ago. The fall of the Shah. The \nShah fell. How did he fall? He fell in a revolution that occurred as a \nconsequence of the unrest in that country at that time.\n  I would suggest that the record would note that the same set of \ncircumstances are very much in evidence in Saudi Arabia today.\n  You may recall the Greek myth about Cassandra, who had the ability to \npredict the future, combined with the curse that nobody would believe \nher. When it comes to energy, I am beginning to feel somewhat like \nCassandra.\n  I have come to this floor week after week pointing out the peril of \nour current energy situation and the looming disaster that is our \nenergy future if we simply maintain our current course. I have come \nbefore this Senate week after week calling for a balanced and \nresponsive energy policy to the crisis ahead, a policy that stresses \nproduction and conservation, which promotes the development of \nalternative energies, as well as prudent development of traditional \nresources.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Breaux and I submitted a bipartisan energy \nbill that had over 300 pages. The bill had extensive proposals for \nconservation and alternatives. But the only thing most of the \ncolleagues focused on was the 2 pages covering a small sliver of the \nArctic in my State of Alaska known as ANWR. That is where the lightning \nrod was, Madam President.\n  As we know, we are living in a new era today, after September 11. Our \ncountry and our way of life were attacked on that date, and we are in \nthe midst of the anthrax scare. It is, in all likelihood, closely \nconnected with the attacks in New York and Washington. What do \nSeptember 11 and the subsequent events have to do with energy? I say, \neverything.\n  At the risk of sounding like a Cassandra again, I want to set out the \nfacts as they are known now and invite this body to look into the \nfuture.\n  Fact No. 1: Every reputable scientific study of our future energy \nconsumption suggests that, even with dramatic conservation and rapid \ndevelopment of economical alternatives, our dependence on oil as a \npercentage of overall energy use will increase for the next 20 years. \nWhether we like it or not, a stable source of oil is key to our \neconomic viability for the foreseeable future.\n  Fact No. 2: Absent new discoveries, the major source for new energy \nimports will be the Persian Gulf, the location of a majority of the \nworld's known reserves. We are already dependent for about 25 percent \nof our total oil use on the Persian Gulf, and that number will only \nincrease. This Nation today is importing 57 percent of the crude oil we \nconsume, with half of that coming from the Persian Gulf.\n  Fact No. 3: Our relationship with the Persian Gulf countries is \nuneasy, to say the least. Of the major oil-producing countries in the \nPersian Gulf, we apply some form of economic sanction to all of them. \nThink of that. We have economic sanctions on virtually all of those \ncountries in the Persian Gulf from which we import oil. We have a \nmoratorium on imports from Iran. We import, as I indicated, somewhere \nbetween 700,000 and a million barrels a day from Iraq, which we have \nbeen bombing for 10 years. Our relations with the remainder are \ncomplicated by a number of factors, not the least of which is our \nalliance with Israel, a country which is the sworn enemy of most of \nthose nations in the Mideast.\n  Fact No. 4: The stability of the Persian Gulf is in grave doubt. We \nhave spent billions to have troops stationed in Saudi Arabia to contain \nIraq in the name of the Persian Gulf Stability Accord. Radical Islamic \nmovements are a serious political force in many other countries. Even \nSaudi Arabia, our traditional bulwark of stability in the region, is \nnow a cause for grave concern.\n  Mr. Hersh's article, written after extensive consultations with the \nNational Security Agency and others, paints a grave picture of Saudi \nArabia's political future, the corruption of\n\n[[Page S11278]]\n\nthe country's regime, its alienation from the country's religious rank \nand file, and its vulnerability to Islamic fundamentalism.\n\n  Detailed in the article is an eerie reminder of the situation in Iran \nin the late 1970s under the Shah. Iran was, of course, at that time the \nUnited States' stable anchor in the gulf. We all remember too clearly \nwhat happened in Iran.\n  Mr. Hersh also points out the level of complicity between those we \nrely on for energy in Saudi Arabia and those who seek to attack the \nUnited States and our citizens.\n  Saudi Arabia is the largest single source of funding for radical \nfundamentalism and its organs of terror. The Taliban would not exist \nbut for Saudi Arabian money. That has been identified. Al-Qaida and \nOsama bin Laden would not exist but for Saudi money. I need not remind \nyou that Saudi money would not exist at all but for oil. It all comes \nback to oil.\n  On October 22, the two largest newspapers in New York and Washington, \nDC--the sites of the attacks on September 11--issued editorial opinions \nurging that we resist linkage between the events of the 11th and energy \npolicy--totally in contrast to the position, I might add, of organized \nlabor and veterans in this country.\n  Let me confront those opinions with another set of basic facts about \nthe September 11 attacks. Osama bin Laden and other radical Islamic \ngroups have three major issues with our Nation. First, the United \nStates alliance with Israel--our traditional alliance with Israel is \nbeing put to the test by energy dependence in the gulf. The Bush \nadministration, which has been as good or a better friend to Israel \nthan any other administration in recent memory, is now somewhat at odds \nwith Israel in an attempt to appeal to more moderate elements in the \nGulf. What is this all about? It is about oil.\n  Secondly, bin Laden wants United States troops out of Saudi Arabia. \nWhy are we there? To prevent Iraq from threatening the stability of the \ngulf. The issue is oil.\n  Thirdly, bin Laden believes that the value of Persian Gulf oil should \nbe seven times its current price--that is, $144 a barrel. He has \nwritten in his extensive writings that he wants to seize control of \nwhat he calls the ``Islamic wealth'' in order to end what he calls the \n``greatest theft in human history''--the U.S. purchase of cheap oil.''\n  It is all about oil, oil, oil. To suggest there is no linkage between \nenergy policies and the events of September 11, in my opinion, is \nludicrous. It doesn't take Cassandra to see where our energy future is \nheaded. It will, however, require action by this Senate in order to \nreverse our present course. The House has done its job. The President \nhas asked the Senate to act. I urge my colleagues to pass energy \nlegislation as soon as possible.\n  I think we have continually communicated, as a minority, with the \nDemocratic leadership urging the scheduling of an energy bill that we \ncan take up and debate prior to going out on recess. There seems to be \na reluctance in the Democratic leadership. There is an energy task \nforce report in the energy bill that we have outlined. It is very \nunrealistic, in my opinion, to address the arguments, one of which, of \ncourse, continues to be the issue of ANWR.\n  One of the fascinating things about the contribution of oil that \ncomes down the west coast to the States of Washington, California, and \nultimately Oregon--although Oregon does not have a refinery--is the \nreality that nearly two-thirds of that oil comes from Alaska. If Alaska \ndoesn't replace that oil, that oil is going to come into these States, \nand it is going to come from the Mideast, come in foreign tankers that \nare built in U.S. shipyards, with U.S. crews.\n  The States of Washington, Oregon, and California should recognize \ntheir secure supply from Alaska is much more valuable than the unknown \nrisks associated with bringing oil in from the Mideast.\n  As Congress looks at the current exposure to terrorism, where a \nterrorist act in Saudi Arabia can overthrow the royal family in Saudi \nArabia, or there could be a terrorist attack on ships going through the \nStraits of Hormuz--all of that leads to the question: Should we have an \nenergy bill that balances conservation and production?\n  I will close with the argument relative to those who seem to have a \nlittle difficulty with the issue of opening up the Coastal Plain. I \nwill give some idea of the vastness of the area.\n  Many people in this body have not chosen to take advantage of \nopportunities to visit the area for themselves. ANWR happens to be \nabout the size of the State of South Carolina. It is about 19 million \nacres. The House bill allows 2,000 acres to be utilized for development \nand exploration; 2,000 acres is not much bigger than a small farm, if \none can somehow recognize we are talking about 2,000 acres out of 19 \nmillion acres.\n  What is the rest of ANWR? Madam President, 8.5 million acres have \nbeen put in wilderness in perpetuity, 9 million acres in refuge, and \nthere is only 1.5 million acres left that only Congress has the \nauthority to open.\n  In the House bill, only 2,000 acres can have the footprint of \ndevelopment only. Is that responsible? We think it is. Can it be opened \nsafely? We have had 30 years experience in Prudhoe Bay. Prudhoe Bay has \ndeveloped 13 billion barrels of oil. It was only supposed to develop 10 \nbillion barrels of oil. It has provided the Nation with 25 percent of \nits total crude oil supply for the last 27 years.\n  People say ANWR contains a 6-month supply. That is assuming there is \nno other oil produced in this country and no other oil imported. If, \nindeed, ANWR is in the range of estimates of 5.6 billion to 16 billion \nbarrels, it would replace what we would import from Saudi Arabia in 30 \nyears or Iraq in 50 years. It would be very substantial.\n  The merits of whether we can do this safely, the merits of the \narguments of some of America's extreme environmental communities that \nhave used this issue, very frankly, as a cash cow--and they have milked \nit for all they can and will continue to do so until we eventually \nauthorize the opening of it and they can move on to something else--\nbecause this issue is so far away, the American people cannot see the \nreality of ANWR for themselves. That, indeed, we have the technology to \nopen the area safely.\n  Recognize the experience we have had in the Arctic over the last 30 \nyears. We built ice roads. We do not develop when the migratory path of \nthe caribou are involved. The potential of the area is very large. If \nthere isn't the oil we expect there to be, we can make a park out of \nit.\n  For us not to have knowledge of what is in there at a time when we \nare increasing our dependence on the Mideast is unconscionable to me.\n  There are other issues that enter into this, such as our relationship \nwith Canada. Canada considers us a competitor, and there is nothing \nwrong with competition. Nevertheless, their view of the world is we \nshould not develop any more resources out of Alaska because it competes \nwith theirs in the Canadian Arctic. I can understand that.\n  As to the growth of the caribou herds in the Prudhoe Bay field, there \nwere 3,000 to 4,000 animals, and now they have close to 26,000 animals \nin the Prudhoe Bay area. You cannot shoot them.\n\n  The Washington Post ran articles depicting polar bears. It is \ninteresting because the pictures--and this is yesterday's Washington \nPost article--shows a couple of polar bears. When one reads this, one \nassumes this is in the 1002 area. This is a little east of Barrow. It \nis not in the 1002 area. We have certification from the photographer \nwho took these pictures that it is not in the 1002 area. But it is a \nwarm, cuddly issue, and people look at polar bears.\n  The article does not tell you that these polar bears are protected. \nThey are marine mammals. If one wants to take a trophy polar bear, one \ncan go to Canada and shoot it, or one can go to Russia and shoot it, \nbut one cannot in the United States, in Alaska, shoot a polar bear.\n  I do not know a better way to protect the polar bear than protecting \nthem from traditional trophy hunting. We have taken steps to try and be \nresponsible relative to development in this fragile area. We have the \ntechnology to do it right.\n  Some people say: That is academic, Senator Murkowski, because we are \nlooking at 7 to 10 years before development is complete. If we built \nthe Pentagon in 18 months and the Empire State Building in a little \nover a year, and this body expedited the permitting\n\n[[Page S11279]]\n\nprocess--we already have a pipeline halfway from the trans-Alaska 800-\nmile pipeline over to the 1002 area. It ends in a field called Badami. \nWe only have another 40 to 50 miles to go. We can have oil flowing in \n18 months. There is absolutely no question about it.\n  The arguments being used are the same arguments that were used in the \nlate sixties opposing the opening of Prudhoe Bay. They are exactly the \nsame. Only then they said: You are going to run an 800-mile pipeline \nfrom the Arctic to southern ports of Alaska, and it is going to be like \na fence. The caribou and moose are not going to be able to cross, it is \ngoing to break and notwithstanding earthquakes. It is one of the \nengineering wonders of the world, and it has provided jobs in this \ncountry.\n  I am going to finish with one point, and that is the stimulus. We are \ntalking about a stimulus in this Nation. What does a stimulus mean? It \nmeans different things to different people. To some it means jobs; to \nothers it means tax relief. I defy any Member of this body to tell me a \nstimulus that is more meaningful than authorizing the opening of ANWR \nbecause what it would do is it would provide hundreds of thousands of \njobs. Not government jobs, private sector jobs in shipbuilding, in \ndeveloping pipes and valves. It would start immediately. This would \ncome from the private sector in exploration, and those ships would be \nU.S. ships built in U.S. yards.\n  What else would it do, Madam President? It would result in the \nFederal Government getting probably $1.6 billion in revenue immediately \nin lease sales because it is Federal land. The Federal Government puts \nit up for lease, competitive bids. The estimate of the Federal share is \nroughly in that area. That is a pretty good return to the Federal \nGovernment to start out.\n  The last thing, as we look at this stimulus package, you are not \ngoing to find anything in it except potentially ANWR which is not going \nto cost the Federal Government one red cent. I challenge my colleagues \nto find another project which would provide such a major economic \nstimulus without costing the taxpayers money, and indeed bringing \nsignificant revenue into the treasury.\n  I rest my case. I thank the Chair for her attention and wish her and \nall a happy Halloween.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, will the Senator from Alaska yield for \na question? I want to get this straight. Right now when we buy oil from \nforeign countries, the royalties, the labor, the pipes, and all the \nconstruction and drilling, all the economic investment is in those \nforeign countries; is that correct?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. But if we were to open ANWR, the Federal Government, \njust from the sale of the leases, would receive $1.6 billion?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is estimated the lease sale would bring the Federal \nGovernment about $1.6 billion in revenue. It may be more. Nobody knows \nbecause industry would competitively bid it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would there be royalties paid each year after that \nduring production?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If there is production, the Federal Government would \nreceive additional royalties?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would the State of Alaska benefit from that?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes, obviously. I also want to point out that a \nsizable percentage of our deficit balance of payments, as the Senator \nknows, is the cost of imported oil.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And the workers even in Alaska are supposed to pay \nFederal income tax.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. They do pay Federal income tax. They are all American \ncitizens, and they are subject to the same laws as the Senator from \nAlabama and I.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Instead of having workers in Saudi Arabia paying taxes \nto Saudi Arabia, Iraq, or Iran, they would be paying taxes to the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Absolutely. This would be all U.S. labor. There would \nbe a prohibition on any of the oil that comes from ANWR being exported \nout of the United States.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know there are people who have become emotionally \ncommitted to this ANWR issue. I hope people will rethink it. As the \nSenator from Alaska has explained repeatedly, we have such a small area \nthat needs to be produced, and wells are so much more sophisticated \ntoday. One well can drain a much larger area than ever before. There is \na virtual pipeline there. That is important. The Senator mentioned a \nthreat from foreign dependence.\n  Was it not just a few years ago the price of oil per barrel on the \nworld market was around $13 and the cartel, since they had so much of \nthe oil, fixed the price and drove it up to as high as $30 a barrel?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It was a little over $30. As a matter of fact, they \nbasically came together and set a floor and a ceiling. The floor was \n$22 and the ceiling was $25. If it goes up above that, that is fine for \nawhile. Then they increase production and bring it down.\n  Of course, what has happened with this terrorist activity is less jet \nfuel is used, less automobile gasoline. So we temporarily have a \nsurplus and we are seeing that, but now OPEC is reducing their supply.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I guess the point is, these are supposedly our friends \nwho triple the price we have to pay for oil. We have to pay three times \nas much money to foreign sources, and we get no more oil than we did \nthe day before they drove it up?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is true.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If they can do that, if they are friends, if we were to \nhave some turnover in government or a war were to break out that could \ndeny some of this, we could see prices even higher than that on the \nworld market?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Absolutely. There is one other point that is obvious \nto the Senator and to me, but it is overlooked by some, and that is we \nhave other sources of energy. We have natural gas. We have coal. We \nhave biomass. We have wind power, solar power. But because of our \ntechnology, America and the world moves on oil. It is put in airplanes. \nIt is put in boats. It is put in trains, automobiles. For the \nforeseeable future, we are evidently unlikely to find any significant \nreplacement for oil. So that is why we have become so dependent and our \nvulnerability, to the extent of our national security, is at risk, as \nour veterans are pointing out.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Of course, the Senator is not overlooking conservation. \nThat is another way to reduce dependence on foreign oil.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is a big part of this bill that the Senator \nproposed.\n  I again want to express my appreciation to the Senator. I came to the \nSenate 5 years ago and heard the Senator delineate this problem and \ntell us over and over again what we were going to be facing in the \nfuture. I think the events in recent weeks have validated the Senator's \nwarnings, the Senator's caution to America, the Senator's call for us \nto do the smart thing.\n  I also believe if we can produce more oil at home, it would reduce \nour deficit and help this economy recovery.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. As the Senate knows, symbolism is so significant. If \nwe were to make a decision to allow the opening of this particular \narea, we would send a signal to OPEC that we mean business, that we are \nserious about reducing our dependence. We are not going to replace \ndependence, but we can reduce it dramatically by a conscientious effort \nto keep these jobs at home, and, as we both know, the economic forecast \nsuggests there could be significant growing concern over loss of jobs \nand this is the most significant single identifiable project to create \njobs that anybody has been able to pinpoint that does not cost the \nGovernment any money or the taxpayer.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will ask one more question. The Senator has \nchallenged us now to name one more project anywhere in this country \nthat will produce as much stimulus as increasing our domestic oil \nsupply as this bill will do, and I think it is a challenge that ought \nto stay out there and we ought to see if somebody can meet it. Not only \nwill it help us, it will actually produce income and not cost us any \nmoney.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I certainly would challenge any Member to come up with \na stimulus that would provide jobs, not cost the American taxpayer \nanything, and indeed bring revenue into the coffers. I thank my good \nfriend and wish him a good day.\n\n[[Page S11280]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/31/senate-section/article/S11280-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, we are fiddling while Rome burns. The \nheadline in this morning's Washington Post, ``Airport Security \nCrackdown Ordered,'' particularly galls this Senator. I have been with \nthe FAA since its creation. I have been on the Commerce Committee for \nright at 35 years. I worked with the old Civil Aeronautics Board. We \ntried our best to get this entity in ship shape over many years.\n  It was only the year before last that we finally got the monies that \nshould have gone to airport safety and improvement to go to airport \nsafety and improvement.\n  We had, in 1988, Pan Am 103. We had extensive hearings. And what did \nwe come up with? What we came up with is exactly what they write in the \neditorial here, that what we really need is more training and more \nsupervision--``help wanted.'' And then we had further hijackings.\n  We had the TWA Flight 800 in 1996, and we had further hearings. We \nhad the Gore commission. What did they recommend? The same old, same \nold of more training and more supervision, more oversight. Got to get \nstern about this. Crackdowns.\n  Last year, we passed the FAA authorization bill. And what did we call \nfor? We called for more supervision, more training, and then 5,000 \npeople were killed. And we have folks over on the House side, most \nrespectfully, who do not understand that we have lost these 5,000. \nTerrorists came along with cardboard knives and committed mass murder, \nand everything else like that, but they say don't worry about what \nhappened on 9-11.\n  What happened just this last week? Last week, a man boarded a plane \nwith a pistol down in New Orleans. The individual remembered he had the \ngun and said: Oh, my heavens. Then he turned it over to the airline \ncrew, or otherwise. And the same airline security firm that was fined \nlast year in Philadelphia for hiring criminals is still hiring \ncriminals.\n  The Senate reacted. We got together. We had hearings. We had the \nairline pilots, the airline crews, the assistants, the airline \nexecutives--everyone connected--and they endorsed the approach of \nfederalization; that this was a public safety role, need and \nresponsibility. This coalition determined resolutely that we could not \ntoy with this anymore after that tremendous loss on 9-11 and continue \nto play games with more oversight and more supervision and more \ntraining.\n  And ordering crackdowns: Can you imagine that, ordering a crackdown 7 \nweeks afterwards? Why not that afternoon, that night, or the next \nmorning? A crackdown? Oh, no, they had to think of the airlines first, \nwhile the airlines themselves are begging for safety because they \nrealize that ensuring passenger safety is essential to reviving the \nindustry. The Senate passed our bill 100-zip; every Republican, every \nDemocrat voted for it. Our measure is, more than anything, an airline \nstimulus bill.\n  Americans are not going to get on these planes as long as there is \nfear, and we have the insecurity that we have. They are not going to \nget on the planes as long as they have U.S. Air Force planes flying \nover them ready to shoot them down.\n  With our bill that stops immediately. Once you secure that cockpit \ndoor, not to be opened in flight, there is no reason for hijackings \nbecause you can't.\n  All you can do is start a fight in the cabin, knowing that the order \nto the pilot is to land at the nearest airport where law enforcement is \ngoing to be there and you are going to prison. That is the Israeli El \nAl approach. We outlined it. We provided the diagram for the El Al plan \nthat I still have. If I had time this morning, I would show it. It is a \nperimeter defense. In 30 years El Al has not had a hijacking.\n  Don't talk to me about European private airport security. Sure, \nEuropean security personnel is better paid because all the European \nfolks are supported for retirement and health care. These minimum wage \nfolks have no retirement, no health care, no security, no anything. And \nthe security firms are worried that they may quit. They all are \nquitting. That has been the experience at the Hartsfield airport in \nAtlanta. There has been over 400-percent turnover there. They don't \nstay there longer than 3 months.\n  Yet the opposition to real airport security has stories going around. \nThe reason I came to the floor is to again bring attention to the \ncommonsensical, thorough, and bipartisan fashion with which the Senate \napproached airline security. They are still talking about the \nDemocratic bill on the House side. You can't get it any more bipartisan \nunless we are going to let the pages vote. Maybe we ought to do that. I \nmean, can't we get the truth to the American people that we are ready, \nwilling, able, and glad to pay for it, $2.50 per flight? The polls show \npeople would be willing to pay $25 added to a ticket, glad to do it. \nBut we can take care of it with $2.50 so there is no question about \nbeing paid for.\n  The fundamentals of safety have to be hammered home to our colleagues \non the House side. We are not playing games anymore. Noone wants to \ncontract out the FBI. I wonder what the President wants? We were told a \nmonth ago that the President would go along with our bill. We felt \nabsolutely secure. But they have some political machinations going on \nover there with Mr. Armey and Mr. DeLay. And Mr. Armey says: I don't \nwant them all to join a union. Well, they all can join the unions under \nthe private contractor. In fact, a third of them have. The reason the \nother two-thirds have not, is they can't read the application in order \nto join. They are refugees and immigrants. The application is in \nEnglish. Go ahead to the airports. I go through there regularly, almost \nevery week. They just cannot speak the language. That is no fault of \ntheir own. They are getting what jobs they can. But we can't do this \nwith Americans' and the airline travelers' safety at risk.\n  We would not contract out the Capitol Police or the Border Patrol or \nthe Secret Service or the FBI or defense. What is the matter with the \nGovernment? You just heard about a bill--all the defense workers at the \nCharleston naval shipyard, all the ``navalees'' belong to a union. You \njust heard the majority leader talk about laying down to conservative \ninterests. I am not talking pro-union or anti-union. I am saying \nfederal public safety officers cannot strike and they can be fired. \nThis particular Senator supported President Reagan when he had to take \nthat approach with the airline pilots. But we fiddle while Rome burns.\n  Would we ever not just contract out? Would we ever give our safety to \nforeign corporations? Can you imagine taking the defense and \ncontracting it out, or the FBI, to the Swedish company or the Secret \nService to the Netherlands company? These are the firms responsible for \nairline security now. The airlines get the lowest bidder, and they \ncouldn't care less.\n  That English company, they were fined for hiring criminals and \nfalsifying their background checks. And since the time of the court \nfines, they have continued to hire criminals and not give the \nbackground checks. Yet they say: Well, let's see what they want. Let's \nget flexibility. You aren't going to have flexibility with the FBI or \nSecret Service or the Capitol Police. There is not flexibility. It is \nsafety. That is what they have to understand over there, that we are \nnot going to give it to the foreign companies.\n\n  We are not going to have the momentary safety checks or the European \nsystem. We are going to have the El Al, the Israeli system that has \nworked, proof positive, for 30 years. Once you secure that cockpit and \nthey know there can't be a hijacking, you can take all these F-15s and \nF-16s and National Guard reserves that are flying all night long over \nWashington and New York and wherever and say: Save the money and save \nthe time. Let them go back to their work. There is not going to be a \nhijacking. There is not going to be a plane shot down. If there is an \nattempted hijacking, it is down to the first landing and on to jail. \nThat is where they are headed. They know that. So our terrorist \nadversaries will find some other way, like the mail and anthrax, but \nnot the airlines.\n\n[[Page S11281]]\n\n  Security has to be comprehensive. Under El Al, they check thoroughly \nand rotate the screeners from the boarding gates, to the tarmac and to \ncleaning out the aisles.\n  I flew out of Dulles last week. And what do you do? You get seat 9A. \nSo I can call out to my friend who has been working on the tarmac for \nthe last 2 years who is in cahoots with me as a terrorist. I say: Paste \na pistol underneath seat 9A, loaded. I get on. I got through all the \nscreeners and everything else. And afterwards, they wonder why, because \nyou have to have the same kind of security on the tarmac. You have to \nhave the same security for the people who cater. You have to have the \nsame security with the people who clean. This is a safety/security \nresponsibility and not a game of playing around on whether they are \ngoing to join a union or not.\n  A third of airline security workers join unions now and have the \nright to strike. Yes, they can join our union, but they can't strike \nand they can be fired.\n  On contracting out, 669,000 civilian personnel work in our defense \nforces and at the Pentagon. Some of them were lost on September 11. \nGive us a Senate bill or something very similar to it because that is \nthe overwhelming sentiment. The captain of the airline pilots appeared \nwith us again yesterday and said: Please pass the Senate version so we \ncan get on and move with it and get the cockpit doors secured, get \nthorough background checks, and then be ready, willing, and able to \ngive the watch list to the screeners so they will know what to look \nfor.\n  At the present time, you wouldn't give the watch list to these \nforeign companies, agents at minimum wage. You wouldn't give it to \nthem. You would try to keep that security knowledge to yourself and \nsend somebody out. If I had a watch list and was trying, I would have \nan FBI agent at the likely airports where they may board, but I \nwouldn't give it to the present screeners. We have to clean that out \nentirely and come down to the reality that this is totally bipartisan. \nIt is not in the sense of trying to be pro-labor or anti-union, pro-\nDemocrat or pro-Republican, or anything else like that.\n  We have finally learned at least one lesson from 9-11--that we can't \nplay around any longer with airline security. We have to get on with it \nand not fiddle here some 7 weeks as ``Rome\" burns, and we wonder what \nto do and put all this political pressure on to change the folks around \nand not bring it up and not allow them to vote common sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/31/senate-section/article/S11281-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Madam President, on October 11, 2001, I filed Report No. \n107-83 to accompany S. 1533, a bill to amend the Public Health Service \nAct to reauthorize and strengthen the health centers program and the \nNational Health Service Corps, and to establish the Healthy Communities \nAccess Program, which will help coordinate services for the uninsured \nand underinsured, and for other purposes. At the time the report was \nfiled, the estimate by the Congressional Budget Office was not \navailable. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the CBO estimate be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n\n          S. 1533.--Health Care Safety Net Amendments of 2001\n\n       Summary: S. 1533 would extend expiring provisions and \n     authorizations for appropriations in title III of the Public \n     Health Service Act (PHSA). The bill would reauthorize and \n     expand the Health Centers and National Health Service Corps \n     programs, and establish the Community Access Program in \n     statute. It also would create several new grant programs and \n     demonstrations. The provisions in this bill would be \n     administered by the Health Resources and Services \n     Administration (HRSA).\n       Assuming the appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 1533 would cost about $1 \n     billion in 2002 and between $8 billion and $9 billion over \n     the 2002-2006 period.\n       The bill would increase spending by the Medicare program \n     for rural health clinic services, and reduce Medicaid \n     spending for certain beneficiaries who use those clinics. In \n     total, direct spending would increase by $146 million over \n     the 2002-2011 period. Because enacting S. 1533 would affect \n     direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply.\n       S. 1533 contains an intergovernmental mandate as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA), but CBO estimates \n     that the mandate would not affect the budgets of state, \n     local, or tribal governments. Those governments may also \n     benefit either directly or indirectly from some of the grant \n     programs authorized in the bill, but their participation in \n     those programs would be voluntary. S. 1533 contains no \n     private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 1533 is shown in the following table. \n     For the purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that the bill \n     will be enacted this fall and that the necessary \n     appropriations will be provided for each fiscal year. The \n     table summarizes the budgetary impact on discretionary \n     spending of the legislation under two different sets of \n     assumptions. In cases where the bill would authorize the \n     appropriation of such sums as may be necessary, the first set \n     of figures provides the estimated levels of authorizations \n     assuming annual adjustments for anticipated inflation after \n     fiscal year 2002. The second set of assumptions does not \n     include any such inflation adjustments. The costs of this \n     legislation would fall within budget functions 550 (health) \n     and 570 (Medicare).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       By fiscal year, in millions of dollars\n                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        2001         2002         2003         2004         2005         2006\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \n                                         With Adjustments for Inflation\n \nSpending Under Current Law:\n    Budget Authority a............        1,513            0            0            0            0            0\n    Estimated Outlays.............        1,368          662           60            7            0            0\nProposed Changes:\n    Estimated Authorization Level.            0        1,887        1,878        1,914        1,953        1,989\n    Estimated Outlays.............            0        1,004        1,776        1,886        1,923        1,961\nSpending Under S. 1533:\n    Estimated Authorization Level.        1,513        1,887        1,878        1,914        1,953        1,989\n    Estimated Outlays.............        1,368        1,665        1,835        1,893        1,923        1,961\n \n                                        Without Adjustments for Inflation\n \nSpending Under Current Law:\n    Budget Authority a............        1,513            0            0            0            0            0\n    Estimated Outlays.............        1,368          662           60            7            0            0\nProposed Changes:\n    Estimated Authorization Level.            0        1,887        1,836        1,834        1,833        1,833\n    Estimated Outlays.............            0        1,003        1,753        1,826        1,824        1,825\n\n[[Page S11282]]\n\n \nSpending Under S. 1533:\n    Estimated Authorization Level.        1,513        1,887        1,836        1,834        1,833        1,833\n    Estimated Outlays.............        1,368        1,665        1,813        1,832        1,824        1,825\n \n \n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Budget Authority a......            0            9           15           15           15           15\nEstimated Outlays.................            0            9           15           15           15          15\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\na The 2001 level includes the amount appropriated for that year for the programs.\n\n       Basis of Estimate:\n\n\n                   spending subject to appropriations\n\n     Title I: Consolidated Health Center Program\n       S. 1533 would reauthorize and expand the scope of the \n     consolidated health centers program, which provides grants to \n     entities that provide health care and other services to \n     uninsured and underinsured populations. S. 1533 contains two \n     new provisions: It would authorize the use of up to 5 percent \n     of authorized funds for grants to health centers or networks \n     for the construction and modernization of buildings, and it \n     would permit HRSA to guarantee the refinancing of non-federal \n     loans by health centers. The costs of these additional \n     activities would be subsumed in the general authorization of \n     appropriations for the health center program, which is $1,379 \n     million in 2002 and such sums as necessary for 2003-2006. The \n     bill also would establish a linguistic grant program, which \n     would award grants to health centers for the provision of \n     translation and interpretation services for clients for whom \n     English is a second language. The bill would authorize the \n     appropriation of $10 million for that grant program in 2002, \n     and then such sums as necessary each year until 2006. CBO \n     estimates that outlays for these programs would be $745 \n     million in 2002 and $6.4 billion during the 2002-2006 period, \n     assuming appropriation of the necessary funds.\n     Title II: Rural health\n       Rural Health Grants. S. 1533 would reauthorize several \n     grant programs administered through the Office of Rural \n     Health Policy within HRSA: health care services outreach, \n     health network development, and small provider quality \n     improvement grants. The bill would not substantially change \n     the activities of the existing program. The bill would \n     authorize $40 million in 2002 and such sums as necessary in \n     subsequent years through 2006. (The 2002 authorization level \n     is less than the 2001 appropriation level, which included a \n     one-time appropriation of $18 million for a special project.) \n     Based on past spending for these activities, CBO estimates \n     that this provision would cost $12 million in 2002 and $164 \n     million during the 2002-2006 period.\n       Telehealth Grant Consolidation. S. 1533 would create a new \n     section in the Public Health Service Act for this established \n     program. The bill would authorize appropriations for \n     telehealth network grants as well as for telehealth resource \n     centers grants. Telehealth refers to health information and \n     services that are communicated via telecommunications \n     technologies. Telehealth network grants are provided to \n     entities to expand access to services, to train providers, \n     and to improve access to health care information. Grants to \n     telehealth centers may fund projects that demonstrate the \n     uses of telehealth technologies. The bill stipulates that not \n     less than 50 percent of funds for grants for networks shall \n     be awarded to entities in rural areas, and that the total \n     funds awarded for network grants in 2002 may not be less than \n     the total awarded for such grants in fiscal year 2001. S. \n     1533 would authorize the appropriation of $60 million in 2002 \n     (compared to the $36 million appropriated in 2001) and then \n     such sums as necessary through 2006. CBO estimates that \n     outlays for this program would be $19 million in 2002 and \n     $245 million over the 2002-2006 period, assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary funds.\n\n    TABLE 2.--APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001 AND AMOUNTS AUTHORIZED IN S. 1533 ASSUMING ADJUSTMENTS FOR\n                                                    INFLATION\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       By fiscal year, in millions of dollars\n                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                       2001 a        2002         2003         2004         2005         2006\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTitle I: Health Centers...........        1,164        1,379        1,410        1,440        1,469        1,496\nTitle II:\n    Rural Health Grants...........           58           40           41           42           43           43\n    Telehealth Grants.............           36           60           61           63           64           65\n    Telehomecare Demonstration....            0            4            2            b            b            b\n    Emergency Medical Services                0            1            1            1            1            1\n     Grants.......................\n    Mental Health Services                    0           20           20           21           21           22\n     Demonstration................\n    School-Based Health Networks..            0            5            5            5            5            5\nTitle III:\n    National Health Service Corps.          130          202          207          211          216          220\n    Chiropractor and Pharmacist               0            1            1            1            0            0\n     Demonstration................\nTitle IV:\n    Community Access Program......          125          125          128          130          133          136\n    Primary Dental Programs.......            0           50            0            0            0            0\n                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Title b...................        1,513        1,887        1,878        1,914        1,953        1,989\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\na The 2001 level includes the amount appropriated for that year for the programs.\nb Total includes Title VI study, with budget authority estimated at less than $500,000.\n\n       Telehomecare Demonstration Project. S. 1533 would authorize \n     a demonstration project for the provision of telehomecare \n     services for residents of rural areas. Telehomecare means the \n     provision of health services by providers at a distant site \n     to patients in the home via telemedicine technology. The bill \n     would limit the number of grants to five entities and would \n     fund grantees for no more than three years. The Office for \n     the Advancement of Telehealth within HRSA currently funds a \n     dozen grants to home health agencies, so this demonstration \n     would not represent a substantially new activity for the \n     administration. The bill also would require HRSA to submit an \n     interim and final report to the Congress describing the \n     results of the demonstration. Based on historical patterns of \n     spending for similar activities, CBO estimates the cost of \n     this demonstration would be $4 million in 2002 and $7 million \n     over the 2002-2006 period.\n       Rural Emergency Medical Services Program. S. 1533 would \n     establish a program of grants, primarily to state and local \n     entities, to pay up to 75 percent of the cost of recruiting \n     and training emergency medical service (EMS) personnel in \n     rural areas. It would authorize the appropriation of such \n     sums as may be necessary for 2002 through 2006. The bill also \n     would authorize grants for the acquisition of emergency \n     medical equipment and for EMS training programs for the \n     public. Based on information from HRSA staff about \n     participation in similar programs, CBO assumes that about 20 \n     states would participate in any given year. CBO estimates the \n     cost of implementing this program would be about $1 million \n     in 2002 and $6 million during the 2002-2006 period, assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary funds.\n       Mental Health Services via Telehealth Grants. The bill \n     would create a demonstration program to award grants to \n     entities for the development of telehealth networks for the \n     provision of mental health education and services in areas \n     designated as mental health underserved areas. The grants \n     would be directed to nursing homes and schools, with grants \n     to be used for education about mental health issues, for the \n     provision of mental health services, and for collaborative \n     and other purposes. HRSA currently oversees more than 25 such \n     grants. Appropriations at the authorized levels, which are \n     $20 million in 2002 and such sums as necessary through 2006, \n     would allow for 50 to 60 grants of similar size. Assuming \n     appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO estimates that \n     outlays for this demonstration project would be about $7 \n     million in 2002 and $93 million over the 2002-2006 period.\n       School-based Health Center Networks. S. 1523 would \n     establish a new program to award grants to nonprofit \n     organizations for the creation of state-wide technical \n     assistance centers and for other purposes. The bill would \n     authorize the appropriation of $5 million in 2002 and such \n     sums as may be necessary for 2003-2006. Based on historical \n     spending patterns for similar activities, CBO estimates this \n     program would cost $2 million in 2002 and $23 million over \n     the 2002-2006 period.\n     Title III: National Health Service Corps\n       S. 1533 would reauthorize the National Health Service Corps \n     (NHSC) field, recruitment, and state loan repayment programs. \n     The field and recruitment programs support activities to \n     identify the health professional\n\n[[Page S11283]]\n\n     needs of underserved communities and to recruit and support \n     providers in those communities. The state loan repayment \n     program provides federal matching funds to state programs \n     that repay the educational debts of health care providers \n     practicing in underserved communities.\n       The bill would add new authority to the field program to \n     establish a demonstration project to create a program of \n     part-time corps members. The bill would allow the Secretary \n     to change both the methodology and process of designating \n     health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) and would instruct \n     the Secretary to develop a plan to increase participation by \n     dental health providers in the scholarship and loan repayment \n     programs.\n       S. 1533 would authorize such sums as necessary for 2002-\n     2006 for the field program, $146 million in 2002 and such \n     sums as necessary through 2006 for the recruitment program, \n     and $12 million in 2002 and such sums as may be necessary \n     through 2006 for the state loan repayment program. While the \n     authorization of appropriations for the recruitment program \n     is substantially larger than the appropriation for fiscal \n     year 2001, the demand for corps members in the community is \n     strong. CBO assumes that the NHSC will be able to spend the \n     proposed appropriations at current rates. The authorizations \n     for the field and state loan repayment programs are not \n     substantially larger than 2001 appropriation levels, and we \n     therefore assume that the programs will spend funds at \n     current rates. CBO estimates spending to implement all three \n     programs would total $109 million in 2002 and $941 million \n     during the 2002-2006 period, assuming appropriation of the \n     necessary funds.\n       The bill would also establish a demonstration project that \n     would allow chiropractors and pharmacists to participate in \n     the NHSC loan repayment program. The determination of a HPSA \n     would not be affected by the inclusion of these providers. \n     The demonstration would be authorized for three years at such \n     sums as may be necessary. Based on information from experts \n     at HRSA and spending for similar activities within the NHSC \n     loan repayment program, CBO estimates the demonstration would \n     cost less than $500,000 in 2002 and about $3 million over the \n     2002-2004 period.\n     Title IV: Healthy Communities Access Program\n       Community Access Program. S. 1533 would establish in \n     statute the community access program (CAP), which has been \n     funded since 1999. The program awards grants to consortiums \n     to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and the \n     coordination of health services to uninsured and underinsured \n     in their community. The bill would authorize the \n     appropriation of $125 million for fiscal year 2002, and such \n     sums as may be necessary for the subsequent four years. CBO \n     estimates this provision would result in outlays of $94 \n     million in 2002 and $613 million over the 2002-2006 period, \n     assuming appropriation of the necessary funds.\n       Primary Dental Programs. S. 1533 would authorize the \n     appropriation of $50 million in 2002 to be available for five \n     years, for the development of a grant program to be \n     administered by HRSA to respond to states' dental workforce \n     needs. The grants would provide federal matching funds to \n     state programs for loan forgiveness, recruitment, practice \n     expansion, dental residency programs, and for other purposes. \n     The estimated cost of implementing this program is $10 \n     million in 2002 and $50 million over the 2002-2006 period.\n     Title VI: Study\n       S. 1533 would require the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services to conduct a study to determine the ability of the \n     department to provide for solvency for managed care networks \n     whose member organizations are health centers receiving funds \n     from the Consolidated Health Centers Program. The bill would \n     direct the Secretary to submit a report to the Congress \n     detailing the results of the study. CBO estimates the cost of \n     implementing this provision would be less than $500,000 in \n     2002 and 2003.\n\n\n             direct spending effects--rural Health clinics\n\n       Under current law, Medicare beneficiaries must pay for the \n     first $100 of the Part B services before the Medicare program \n     will begin paying for such services. The bill would exempt \n     certain low-income beneficiaries from the requirement that \n     they satisfy that deductible before Medicare will pay for \n     services furnished by a rural health clinic (RHC) at which a \n     NHSC member is assigned. The proposal would affect Medicare \n     spending for eligible patients of rural health clinics who \n     receive nearly all of their Part B services from those \n     clinics. (Medicare spending would not be affected for those \n     beneficiaries who also receive at least $100 in Part B \n     services from other providers.) CBO estimates that this \n     provision would eliminate the deductible in calendar year \n     2002 for about 200,000 low-income beneficiaries who receive \n     nearly all of their Part B services from qualifying RHCs.\n       Increasing Medicare spending to pay for the deductible for \n     those beneficiaries would also have other effects on spending \n     by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Annual increases in \n     payment rates for Medicare+Choice plans are tied to increases \n     in per-capita spending in the fee-for-service sector, so this \n     provision would increase payments to Medicare+Choice plans. \n     Part B premiums would also rise, so about one-quarter of the \n     increase in Medicare spending would be offset by higher \n     premium receipts. Medicaid spending would be reduced because \n     Medicaid would not have to pay the Medicare deductible for \n     some patients at RHCs who are enrolled in both programs, \n     although some of those savings would be offset by higher \n     Medicaid spending for Part B premiums. Taking all those \n     interactions into account, CBO estimates the provision would \n     increase federal direct spending by $9 million in 2011 and by \n     $146 million over the 2002-2011 period.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts. The following table displays CBO's estimate of the \n     direct spending effects of S. 1533. For the purposes of \n     enforcing pay-as-you-go procedures, only the effects in the \n     budget year and the succeeding four years are counted.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                             By fiscal year, in millions of dollars\n                                                               ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    2002         2003         2004         2005         2006         2007         2008         2009         2010         2011\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChange in Outlays.............................................            9           15           15           15           15           15           15           15           16           16\nChange in Revenues                                                                                                       Not applicable\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal governments: \n     S. 1533 would preempt state laws governing statutes of \n     limitations for cases against individuals who have breeched \n     their contracts under the National Health Services Corps \n     program. This preemption would be an intergovernmental \n     mandate as defined in UMRA. However, CBO estimates that the \n     preemption would not affect the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments because, while it would limit the \n     application of state law, it would impose no duty on states \n     that would result in additional spending.\n       The bill also would authorize a number of grant programs \n     that could either directly or indirectly benefit state, \n     local, or tribal governments through increased assistance for \n     a variety of community and rural health programs. In some \n     cases, those governments may be required to provide matching \n     funds for the federal assistance, but their participation in \n     the programs would be voluntary.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: The bill contains \n     no private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Alexis Ahlstrom (226-\n     9010).

Madam President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to commend the efforts of artists and cultural \norganizations across the country during this difficult time. October \nhas been National Arts and Humanities Month, and this year, in \ncommunities across the country, artists have participated in numerous \npublic programs and performances to help families cope with the \nconcerns they have.\n  In Boston, musicians from the Boston Symphony joined in a poignant \ntribute to the victims of the World Trade Center attack. Here in \nWashington, the Kennedy Center hosted the ``Concert for America.'' So, \ntoo, in other cities across the country, performing artists have \ndonated their time and their talent to raise funds to support those who \nhave suffered the most because of the terrorist attacks, and to help \nwith the healing process for all Americans who share their sense of \ngrief and loss.\n  The arts represent the highest levels of human achievement. They give \nexpression to the deepest human emotions, and they are an indispensable \npart of the Nation's recovery and future strength.\n\n[[Page S11284]]\n\n  Last week, President Bush issued a strong statement commemorating \nNational Arts and Humanities Month and acknowledging the special role \nof the arts in these challenging times. I commend the President for his \neloquent statement, and I ask unanimous consent that it may be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, October 25, 2001.\n       I am pleased to join my fellow Americans in observing \n     National Arts and Humanities Month in October.\n       The arts and humanities enrich our lives, inspire our \n     hearts and minds, and help us to view the world from a \n     different perspective. Capturing the diversity and richness \n     of human experience, they allow us to explore ideas and \n     emotions and to better understand our history, culture, and \n     beliefs. The study and appreciation of the arts and \n     humanities serve as both a unifying force in society and as a \n     vehicle for individual expression.\n       During these extraordinary times, the arts and humanities \n     have provided means for coping and healing in the face of \n     tragedy. Since the September 11 attacks, individuals and \n     groups throughout our country have joined together to \n     celebrate their patriotism by proudly singing ``The Star-\n     Spangled Banner'' and ``God Bless America.'' Others have \n     expressed their grief by creating visual or written tributes \n     to those who lost their lives. People of all ages have \n     documented their personal experiences, firsthand knowledge, \n     and impressions of recent events to create a lasting \n     historical record for future generations.\n       These varied activities point to the vital importance of \n     the arts and humanities in maintaining a vibrant society and \n     a strong democracy. During National Arts and Humanities \n     Month, I encourage all Americans to reflect on the \n     contributions of these creative and intellectual traditions \n     to our quality of life, and to participate in activities that \n     celebrate the spirit of our Nation and our love for freedom, \n     justice, and peace.\n       Best wishes on this special occasion.\n     George W. Bush.  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/31/senate-section/article/S11284-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAJOR BENCESLADO RAEL UPON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nfellow New Mexican who is retiring after 32 years of dedicated service \nwith the United States Air Force and the New Mexico Army National \nGuard. Sergeant Major Benceslado ``Ben'' Rael has made duty, honor and \nservice the hallmarks of his career and is a shining example of a true \nAmerican patriot.\n  Ben was born in Truchas, NM in 1941 and graduated from St. Michael's \nHigh School in 1960; he also received his A.A. from Wilber Wright \nCollege in 1973. Upon joining the Air Force, he immediately made an \nimpact as a recruiting and retention specialist where he helped \ncountless young people find a confidence and self-esteem building \ncareer in the United States Armed Forces.\n  Ben's skills in recruiting did not go unnoticed. Upon joining the New \nMexico Army National Guard, Ben was assigned the position of Vice \nChairman of the Guard's National Recruiting and Retention advisory \nCouncil. Again, Ben showed himself to be a tremendous asset in keeping \nthe National Guard vibrant in New Mexico.\n  Ben has made all of New Mexico proud, and in tribute, Governor \nJohnson has proclaimed October 31, 2001 as ``Sergeant Major Benceslado \nRael Day.'' I want to take this opportunity to join with the Governor, \nand indeed with all New Mexicans, in saluting Ben on a job well done \nand in wishing him many years of happiness in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/31/senate-section/article/S11284-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  IN RECOGNITION OF THE EXPANSION OF YOUNG ISRAEL OF OAK PARK, MI\n Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I ask that a statement by David \nFoster of the United Steelworkers of America be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n     Opposition To Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge\n\n       Intelligent approaches to energy development are needed at \n     a time when energy security, economic development, and \n     environmental protection are more important than ever.\n       USWA District #11 represents thousands of workers in the \n     Pacific Northwest's energy-intensive aluminum industry where \n     40% of the nation's aluminum capacity is located. The recent \n     West Coast energy crisis that resulted in the shutdown of all \n     ten of that region's aluminum smelters awakened our union to \n     the need for a comprehensive energy policy based on sound \n     environmental principles. We are currently working to help \n     transition the industry to a cleaner, safer, and more \n     dependable mix of energy sources that will help preserve \n     industrial jobs in the United States and lead the industry \n     toward energy self-sufficiency.\n       I believe that the best long-term solution to retaining \n     aluminum jobs in the Northwest is 1) by reducing demand \n     through energy efficiency and conservation, and 2) by \n     increasing the supply of diversified energy sources including \n     clean, renewable energy generated by wind, solar, and \n     geothermal power. This combination would minimize the \n     environmental impacts related to energy extraction and use, \n     create good, family-wage jobs, and protect consumers from \n     supply disruptions and price fluctuations.\n       Consequently, I am convinced that drilling for oil in the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is not a sensible option. \n     Rather, it is a shortsighted remedy that is unreliable, \n     environmentally unsound, and fraught with economic \n     shortcomings. As a better alternative, I would encourage the \n     building of a new natural gas pipeline where existing \n     supplies of natural gas can be captured.\n       In particular, I would recommend that the infrastructure \n     for a gas pipeline be developed on the North Slope to bring \n     to market gas currently being shunted back into the ground or \n     flared off. A new Environmental Impact Statement must be \n     completed prior to construction, and North American, rather \n     than imported, steel should be utilized for the construction \n     of the pipeline. This natural gas project would produce many \n     times more jobs and be safer for workers than drilling in the \n     Refuge, and would increase the supply of a cleaner and more \n     valuable energy source, without posing severe threats to \n     sensitive wildlife and tundra.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/31/senate-section/article/S11284-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11284-S11285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORLD POPULATION AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1595. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to \nestablish a program to control bovine Johne's disease; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Johne's \nDisease Elimination Act, which would provide incentives to encourage \ndairy producers to voluntarily begin testing for Johne's disease and to \nremove infected and exposed animals from their dairy herds.\n  Johne's disease is a devastating infection that has adversely \nimpacted dairy herds across the country for many years.\n  Johne's disease was identified more than a century ago, yet remains a \ncommon and costly infectious disease of dairy cattle.\n  Johne's disease starts as an infection in calves, though indications \ndo not appear until 2 to 5 years later. Over 20 percent of all dairy \nherds may be infected with an animal pathogen that causes Johne's \ndisease, which causes losses in milk production and an eventual wasting \naway of the animal. And if not detected and eliminated, the disease can \nspread throughout the herd.\n  This animal disease, for which there is no cure, is projected to cost \nU.S. diary producers in excess of $200 million annually.\n  Let me repeat, $200 million. The average cost to producers is about \n$245 per cow. In other words, the cost for a 100 cow dairy with an \ninfected herd would be about $24,000.\n  One of the biggest challenge to eradicate Johne's disease is the lack \nof a consistent national or industry-wide education or control program. \nOne of the more prominent recent efforts involves the Johne's Committee \nof the U.S. Animal Health Association, which formed the National \nJohne's Working Group to begin more cohesive education, research, and \ncontrol efforts to deal with the disease.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is based on the work of the \nNational Johne's Working Group. My legislation would authorize the \ncreation of a program to encourage dairy herd owners to be practically \nfree of Johne's disease in 7 years.\n  This program would be absolutely voluntary and confidential, as the \nworking group recommended.\n  This program would provide incentives to encourage dairy producers to \nvoluntarily begin testing for Johne's disease and to remove infected \nand exposed animals from their dairy herds.\n  The incentives provided will also help farmers to perform herd risk \nassessments and utilize best management practices to develop \nappropriate Johne's Herd Management Plans to prevent further \nintroduction and spread of the disease.\n  We need to listen to America's dairy industry and follow their common \nsense suggestions to eradicate a disease that hurts dairy farmers \nacross the United States. I urge my colleagues to join me in \ncosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1598. To amend section 1706 of title 38, United States Code, to \nenhance the management of the provision by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs of specialized treatment and rehabilitation for disabled \nveterans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I am proud today to introduce \nlegislation that would improve upon the current requirement that the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs maintain specialized health care \nservices. It is my hope that the ``Veterans Specialized Treatment Act'' \nwill finally settle the issue and that high quality, specialized health \ncare services will be readily available to our veterans at each and \nevery VA hospital.\n  From its inception, the Department of Veterans' Affairs' health care \nsystem has been challenged to meet the special needs of its veteran \npatients, such as spinal cord injuries, amputations, blindness, post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, and homelessness. Over the \nyears, VA has developed widely recognized expertise in providing \nspecialized services to meet these needs. We have all been proud of \nVA's expertise, some of which is unparalleled in the larger health care \ncommunity.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years, VA's specialized programs have come \nunder stress due to budget constraints, reorganizational changes, and \nthe introduction of a new resource allocation system. Budgetary \npressures, in particular, raised concerns back in 1996 that VA's costly \nspecialized programs may be particularly vulnerable and \ndisproportionately subject to reductions. As a result, Congress \nrecognized the need to include protections for the specialized services \nprograms. Public Law 104-262 specifically required the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to maintain capacity to provide for the specialized \ntreatment needs of disabled veterans at the level in existence at the \ntime the bill was passed, October 9, 1996 and to report annually to \nCongress on the status of its efforts.\n  While each of the VA's required reports have proclaimed success in \nmaintaining capacity, some remain skeptical. The General Accounting \nOffice found that ``much more information and analyses are needed to \nsupport VA's, 1998, conclusion, that capacity was up to par.'' The VA \nFederal Advisory Committee on Prosthetics and Special Disability \nPrograms has in the past called VA's data ``flawed'' and has not \nendorsed all of VA's report. In 1999, my own staff on the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs also examined VA's implementation of the law and \nfound that certain key programs, such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \nand substance abuse disorder programs, were not meeting the mandated \ncapacity levels.\n  The most recent report shows, again, that there is concern about \nwhether VA is adhering to the law. The VA Federal Committee on Care of \nSeverely Chronically Mentally Ill Veterans stated in an official \nresponse that the 2000 report on capacity ``once again, documents the \nDepartment's decline in maintaining specialized services for . . . high \npriority patients, without explicitly acknowledging it.'' Committee \nmembers also emphasized that based on the results of the report, it did \nnot appear that high-quality, system-wide access to specialized \nservices is being provided by VA.\n  I am disappointed that VA has still been unable to properly \ndemonstrate that adequate levels of care for those veterans with \nspecialized health care needs are being maintained. The legislation I \nintroduce today seeks to remedy this problem by closing loopholes in \nthe original law to ensure VA's compliance. Congress has spoken quite \nclearly in the past: VA does not have the discretion about whether or \nnot to maintain capacity for specialized services.\n  My proposed legislation would modify the existing report and require \nthat VA submit information on the number of full-time staff providing \ntreatment and the number of dedicated staffed beds; the number of \nveterans served by each such distinct program and facility; the number \nof units of service provided to veterans by such program, including the \nnumber of inpatient and residential days of care as well as the number \nof outpatient visits; and the amount of money spent for the care of \nveterans using these specialized services. Having this information for \neach of the distinct specialized services will allow Congress to fully \nunderstand how the specialized services are fairing. While I applaud \nVA's use of outcome measures, I believe it is imperative that the \nreport contain hard data on the number of staffed beds and other \ninformation.\n  VA would also be required to maintain capacity of the Department at \neach and every medical center. Current law only requires that \n``overall'' capacity be maintained.\n  Another key element of the legislation is that the Inspector General \nof\n\n[[Page S11288]]\n\nVA would conduct an annual audit to ensure that the requirements of the \ncapacity law are carried out every year. The IG would also be required \nto review the VA's yearly report and provide their assessment, on that \nreport, to Congress. Finally, in an effort to encourage VA managers to \ncomply with the legislation, VA would be required to look at the status \nof the specialized services programs whenever job performance is \nreviewed.\n  My colleagues, I ask for your support of this bill, as it would help \nensure that specialized services, a crucial segment of the health care \nVA provides to veterans, are maintained at the necessary level.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DAYTON:\n  S. 1600. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nMedicare beneficiaries a refundable credit against income tax for the \npurchase of outpatient prescription drugs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, one of the groups consistently left out \nof most current economic stimulus proposals are America's senior \ncitizens. Prescription drug prices continue to escalate, putting \nenormous financial strains on seniors in Minnesota and throughout the \nNation. That is why I am introducing today The Rx Relief for Seniors \nAct. It would give America's hard-pressed senior citizens a one-time, \nrefundable tax credit of up to $500 per individual and up to $1,000 per \nmarried couple, to offset their payments for prescription drugs during \nthe year 2001.\n  Millions of senior citizens in my home state of Minnesota and \nthroughout this country have had their limited personal incomes ravaged \nby the rising costs of prescription medicines. These escalating prices \nforce the elderly to reduce their expenditures for other essential \nneeds such as food, clothing, and utilities. They also prevent seniors \nfrom spending money on additional discretionary items such as \nrecreation, travel, and other needed goods and services.\n  The assurance of this $500 refundable tax credit, either as a credit \non Federal taxes due next April 15, or as a cash refund from the \nInternal Revenue Service shortly thereafter, would permit budget-\nconscious senior citizens to increase immediately their purchases of \nadditional consumer goods and services. Seniors, especially the \nmajority who live on limited and fixed incomes, would be among the \npeople most likely to spend quickly any new tax relief and thus help \nstimulate the economy. For this reason, the bill directs the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services to notify all Medicare beneficiaries that \nthey are eligible for this refundable tax credit for their 2001 \nprescription drug purchases.\n  Since my election to the Senate a year ago, I have been urging my \ncolleagues to adopt some form of prescription drug coverage for \nAmerica's senior citizens. Regrettably, such permanent, comprehensive \ncoverage has been once again delayed by differences over the design of \nsuch a program. Yet, for millions of elderly citizens, the financial \nstrains caused by escalating drug costs are urgent and acute. The Rx \nRelief for Seniors Act would provide them with a one-time dose of \nimmediate relief. Hopefully, it would also provide a transition to \npermanent, comprehensive prescription drug coverage legislation next \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. \n        Clinton):\n  S. 1602. A bill to help protect the public against the threat of \nchemical attack; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, today I am introducing a bill, the \nChemical Security Act of 2001, that will reduce the vulnerability of \nour communities to releases of hazardous chemicals.\n  In the past, concern about chemical facilities has largely focused on \naccidental releases. Unfortunately, recent events have shown that the \npotential for catastrophic accidents is still with us. As recently as \nSeptember 21, an accident at a chemical plant in France caused 300 tons \nof nitrates to explode, killing 29, injuring thousands, and damaging \n10,000 houses.\n  We need to ensure that we are taking all appropriate measures to \nprevent such catastrophes from occurring accidentally. But today, in \nthe world of post 9/11, perhaps more importantly, we need to ensure \nthat we do what we can to prevent such catastrophes from being caused \nintentionally by terrorists.\n  In the wake of the attacks in New York and Washington, it is clear \nthat wee need to look at all of our nation's assets and people as \npotential terrorist targets. We need to get ahead of the curve as \nquickly as we can. I believe that one of the places that we need to \nlook first is at our nation's chemical production, processing, \ntransportation and disposal infrastructure. Vulnerability of these \nsectors to either terrorist attack or the theft of dangerous chemicals \ncan pose a serious threat to public health, safety and the environment.\n  This is not just my opinion, Madam President. The Department of \nJustice studied this matter last year and concluded that there is a \n``real and credible threat'' that terrorists would try to cause an \nindustrial chemical release in the foreseeable future. The Department \nnoted that attacking an existing chemical facility, for example, \npresents an easier and more attractive alternative for terrorists than \nconstructing a weapon of mass destruction. In addition, the Department \nconcluded that many plants that contain hazardous chemicals would be \nattractive targets for terrorists because of the plants' proximity to \ndensely populated areas. This is certainly the case in my home state of \nNew Jersey--the most densely populated State in the Nation.\n  Other studies also have shown that our nation's chemical facilities \nare indeed vulnerable. For example, the Agency for Toxic Substances and \nDisease Registry studied over 60 chemical plants in West Virginia, \nGeorgia, and Nevada. The Agency found that security at those plants \nranged from fair to very poor.\n  As I noted earlier, beyond the new threat of terrorism is the \nexisting problem of chemical accidents. According to the National \nResponse Center of the United States Coast Guard, which is the sole \npoint of registry for reporting oil and chemical spills, there were \n28,822 accidental industrial chemical releases in 1998. Those releases \ncaused 2,193 injuries and 170 deaths.\n  Remarkably, Madam President, despite this risk, the federal \ngovernment lacks mandatory security standards for any chemical \nfacilities. Even those in densely populated areas. Even those with \nextremely hazardous chemicals. Now we do require owners and operators \nof such facilities to prepare risk management plans that analyze the \npotential off-site consequences of a release of regulated substances. \nThese reports must include plans to prevent an unintended release and \nto mitigate the effects of such a release, should it occur. However, no \nfederal requirements are in place that require specific steps to \nprevent releases caused by criminal or terrorist activity.\n  Madam President, the Chemical Security Act of 2001 would fill this \ngap in current law by requiring common sense steps to address the \nhighest priority threats from accidents and attacks involving hazardous \nchemicals.\n  To enable the federal government to take immediate action upon \nenactment to address the most serious risks on a case-by-case basis, \nthe bill provides EPA and the Attorney General the authority to issue \nadministrative orders and secure relief through the courts to abate an \nimminent and substantial endangerment from a potential accidental or \ncriminal release.\n  The bill directs the EPA Administrator to consult with the Attorney \nGeneral, states and localities to identify ``high priority'' categories \nwithin our chemical production, processing, transportation and disposal \ninfrastructure. In designating these ``high priority'' categories, the \nAdministrator is to consider a set of factors, including the severity \nof potential harm from a release, proximity to population centers, \nthreats to critical infrastructure and national security, and other \nfactors the Administrator considers appropriate.\n  The bill also directs the Administrator to consider threshold \nquantities of chemicals in establishing high priority categories. This \nis to ensure that small businesses like gas stations and photo shops \nare not swept up in the regulations.\n  Those businesses that are designated as high priorities are subject \nto two\n\n[[Page S11289]]\n\nother provisions of the bill designed to reduce the threat of chemical \nattacks.\n  First, a general duty is placed on any owner or operator of a \nfacility that falls within a high priority category to identify \nhazards, take measures to prevent a criminal release, and minimize the \nconsequences of any criminal release that occurs.\n  Second, the EPA is directed to develop regulations for the high \npriority categories that will require them to take adequate actions to \nprevent, control, and minimize the potential consequences of an \naccident or attack.\n  The bill includes other provisions to enable the EPA and the Attorney \nGeneral to carry out and enforce the act, such as the authority to \nobtain information that may be needed, while providing for protection \nof trades secrets and national security information.\n  Madam President, the legislation is not overly prescriptive, and this \nis intentional. I believe that in the wake of September 11, it is self-\nevident that we need to do a better job safeguarding our communities \nfrom terrorism. And I believe that the possibility of chemical attacks \nis something we need to look at. So the heart of the bill is a \nrequirement that EPA and DOJ work with state and local agencies to \nensure that the highest priority threats from chemical facilities are \nbeing addressed. But I don't want to tie the hands of the executive \nbranch. I think that they should have wide latitude in determining what \ntypes of chemicals and facilities need to implement better security \nmeasures. But this latitude should not be misconstrued as a mandate to \nregulate gas stations, photo shops, and everyone under the sun who uses \nhazardous chemicals. Rather, the latitude is there to give EPA and DOJ \nbroad enough authority so that they are able to address the most \npressing threats, wherever they may be.\n  Madam President, strengthening security at high priority chemical \nsources is an immediate and necessary step to safeguard our \ncommunities. Over the longer, term, however, I believe that our desire \nto protect our communities and our environment will be best served by \nreducing the use of hazardous chemicals. That's why this bill includes \nprovisions to require high priority chemical sources to reduce risks \nwhere practicable by using inherently safer technology, well-maintained \nsecondary control equipment, robust security measures, and buffer \nzones.\n  We have seen this type of approach work in New Jersey, where the \nlegislature enacted a law requiring facilities to implement alternate \nprocesses that would reduce the risk of a release of extremely \nhazardous substances. After the enactment of this law, the number of \nwater treatment plants using levels of chlorine at a level considered \nextremely hazardous decreased from 575 in 1988 to 22 in September of \n2001. Chlorine, which can cause a number of problems include burning of \nthe skin and eyes, nosebleeds, chest pain, and death, was replaced by \nsodium hypochlorite or other much less hazardous chemicals or \nprocesses. Although I believe this New Jersey law has afforded my \nconstituents a high level of safety with regard to accidents, the \ncurrent federal and state security requirements in New Jersey do not \naddress the threat of terrorist attacks. I suspect that this is most if \nnot all of our states, Madam President. That's why it's critical for \nCongress to act.\n  I am glad to note, Madam President, that the chemical industry has \nindicated a willingness to engage the federal government on the issue \nof security. On October 4, 2001, the American Chemistry Council sent a \nletter to President Bush, requesting that the federal government \nimmediately begin a comprehensive assessment of security at chemical \nplants. On October 10, a representative of the American Chemistry \nCouncil who testified before the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Subcommittee on Water and the Environment reiterated \nthis message, stating that ``Our industry believes it will benefit from \na comprehensive assessment conducted by appropriate federal law \nenforcement, national security and safety experts. While we are taking \naggressive steps to make our operations more secure, we recognize that \nwe cannot achieve this objective by ourselves.'' Madam President, I \nagree with the American Chemistry Council's on this point, and I look \nforward to working with industry to ensure that the federal government \nhas the tools that it needs to play its proper role.\n  In conclusion, Madam President, reducing the threat of a terrorist \nattack against a chemical facility, or an accidental release of \nhazardous substances, is critically important to ensure the safety of \nall Americans. We should not wait any longer before beginning to \naddress this problem, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 1604. A bill to establish a national historic barn preservation \nprogram; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the National \nHistoric Barn Preservation Act of 2001.\n  As I am sure my colleagues agree, historic barns are some of \nAmerica's greatest national treasures symbolizing the agriculture \nfoundations upon which our Nation was founded. Unfortunately, many are \nin danger of falling beyond repair. These symbols of the American \nspirit are a vital component of our cultural heritage and must be \npreserved.\n  From our agricultural beginnings in Colonial times to the \nfrontiersmen' expansion to the West, barns have been a fixture of the \nrural American landscape. Unfortunately, Agriculture and farm \nproduction has weathered many painful changes over the past decades. \nThese changes have been particularly difficult for small and medium \nsized farms where most of our nation's historic barns reside. According \nto a survey conducted by Successful Farming, 65 percent of the farmers \nsurveyed had barns over 50 years old on their property.\n  Our legislation allows these farmers to receive funds administered \nthrough States and non-profit organizations to bring their barns into \nproductive use. Preserving these barns will not only ensure their \nsurvival for generations to come, it will also provide many practical \nbenefits to the communities and economies that surround them.\n  Specifically, this bill will allow small and medium-sized farms to \nmake necessary investments in their production facilities to keep their \nfarms working by providing direct grants. In hard times, small and \nmedium-sized farms have had to choose between making improvements on a \nhistoric structure on their property or investing in machinery to keep \ntheir existing operations running. Between 1982 and 1997, our nation \nsaw a 15 percent decline in the number of farms in use, averaging a \nloss of 22,000 farms per year. This bill will ensure the economic \nviability of these farms by helping farmers preserve their historic \nstructures and maintain essential investments. Given our current \neconomic outlook, this bill will be particularly beneficial.\n  Also, preserving historic barns helps ensure that farmers keep their \nland in agricultural use. This has a tremendous effect in preventing \nsprawl from encroaching on rural communities. It is estimated that 3.6 \nmillion acres of farmland is removed from agricultural use each year.\n  This is a sensible bill that ensures the preservation of historic \nbarns in ways individual farmers want. The National Trust for Historic \nPreservation recently conducted a survey asking farmers how they could \npreserve historic barns on their property. The number one response from \nthese farmers was to create a national grant program, exactly what this \nlegislation does.\n  This bill enjoys wide support and has been endorsed by the National \nTrust for Historic Preservation. I invite my colleagues to join me in \nmy efforts to preserve our Nation's historic barns for the prosperity \nof future generations and the well-being of our rural communities. I \nask that a summary of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Bill Summary\n\n       The bill would instruct the Secretary of Agriculture to act \n     through the Undersecretary of Rural Development to: Assist \n     states in developing a listing of historic barns; collect and \n     disseminate information concerning historic barns; foster \n     educational programs relating to historic barns and their \n     preservation; sponsor and conduct research on the history of \n     barns; and sponsor or conduct research, and study techniques, \n     on protecting historic barns.\n\n[[Page S11290]]\n\n       The bill would authorize the Office of Rural Development of \n     USDA to award $25 million in grants over FY 2002 through 2006 \n     for barn preservation projects to the following agencies: \n     State Departments of Agriculture, National or State Non-\n     profits that have been determined by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to have experience in historic barn preservation, \n     and a State Historic Preservation Office.\n       While most of the $25 million authorized would be awarded \n     for grants used to rehabilitate or repair historic barns, the \n     bill would allow some of the funds to be used to: Install \n     fire detection systems and/or sprinklers; install systems to \n     prevent vandalism; and identify, document and conduct \n     research on historic barns to develop and evaluate \n     appropriate techniques or best practices for protecting \n     historic barns.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1607. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide coverage of remote monitoring services under the Medicare \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a small \nbill, but one with important consequences. My measure, the ``Medicare \nRemote Monitoring Services Act of 2001,'' seeks to increase access to \nremote management technologies by providing equal payment for these \nservices under Medicare. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Snowe in \nintroducing this measure.\n  As my colleagues know, many new technologies that collect, analyze, \nand transmit clinical health information are in development or have \nrecently been introduced to the market. These remote management \ntechnologies hold clear promise: Better information on the patient's \ncondition, collected and stored electronically, analyzed for clinical \nvalue, and transmitted to the physician or the patient, should improve \npatient care and access. Instead of a time-consuming 20-mile trips to \nthe doctor's office, it takes the patient 10 minutes to transmit the \ndata by computer. This is not going to replace hands-on medicine, but \nwhen it's not possible for the physician to be there, this can be a \ntool. It's a more aggressive way to be with the patient and help avoid \na crisis.\n  Despite these innovations, many new clinical information and remote \nmanagement technologies have failed to diffuse rapidly. A significant \nbarrier to wider adoption and evolution of the technologies is the \nrelative lack of payment mechanisms under Medicare for services \nprovided by a physician related to these technologies.\n  The June 2001 ``MedPAC report to Congress on Medicare in Rural \nAmerica'' raises concerns about access to health care in rural areas. \nThe report states that if policymakers are interested in expanding the \nuse of telemedicine approaches to improve access to care, one avenue \nthat could be explored is the coverage of technology that enables a \ndiagnostic test to be performed on a patient remotely and then be sent \nelectronically to the consulting physician for review at a later time.\n  In addition, in its March 2001 report, ``Crossing the Quality \nChasm,'' the Institute of Medicine stated that the automation of \nclinical and other health transactions was an essential factor for \nimproving quality, preventing errors, enhancing consumer confidence, \nand improving efficiency, yet ``health care delivery has been \nrelatively untouched by the revolution in information technology that \nhas been transforming nearly every other aspect of society.''\n  Under this legislation remote monitoring services that are found to \nbe comparable to face to face, encounter-based, monitoring services \nwill be given the same coverage and level of Medicare payment as the \ncomparable encounter-based physician service. The provision will be \nimplemented in a budget-neutral manner. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor this legislation that will improve patient access, care, and \nmanagement, as well as spur the development of new technologies that \nwill improve services further.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, today I am joining with Senator \nRockefeller in introducing the Medicare Remote Monitoring Service \nCoverage Act of 2001. This bill is designed to place Medicare on the \ncutting edge of technology and ensure that our Nation's seniors have \naccess to the best treatment options available.\n  Ever since the first stethoscope was developed in Paris in 1816, \nmedical technology has had a dramatic impact on health care. Over the \npast twenty-five years, the technology of medical devices has improved \ndramatically. The resulting changes in the practice of medicine and the \nimprovements in the quality of patient care of have been dramatic and \nthis trend will continue as we move into the future.\n  Once such important improvement is in the ability of new cutting-edge \nmedical devices to electronically monitor a patient's response to \ntreatment. The new devices will collect, analyze and transmit clinical \nhealth information to the patient's physician. As a result, the \nphysician will have access to better information on the patient's \ncondition, which will improve patient care. These innovative devices \nwill also monitor their own internal performance and transmit this \ninformation in real-time to the physician's office. Physicians can use \nthis data to assess a patient's response to treatment and determine if \nnew interventions are required.\n  One such device that is under development is an advanced version of \nthe internal cardiac defibrillator or ICD similar to the one used by \nVice President Cheney. These devices monitor the heart and respond \nautomatically when indicated. When the heart's rhythm triggers certain \ninterventions, the patient is required to immediately contact their \nphysician and must travel to the emergency room to determine if a more \nserious problem has developed. It is also crucial at these times to \ndetermine that the device is working properly. Access to care in these \ncircumstances is imperative.\n  With these new devices, this important information can be transmitted \nelectronically to the physician. The physician can then analyze this \nclinical data and determine if further intervention is required. As a \nresult of this innovation, costly emergency room visits are avoided and \npatients can receive their physician's assessment more quickly. This \nreduces the cost of the health care intervention by avoiding the \nemergency room visit and provides piece of mind to the patient that the \nlife-saving device is working properly. One can easily see that this is \nof greatest value to patients in rural areas who would otherwise have \nto travel great distances to the emergency room for evaluation, many \ntimes in the middle of the night.\n  While these new technologies hold great promise, Medicare \nreimbursement policies are an unfortunate barrier to their use. Under \ncurrent Medicare payment policy, most physician billing codes are \nlimited to face-to-face interactions between physician and patient. The \nphysician payment system does not provide reimbursement for time spent \non a clinical evaluation when a face-to-face encounter is not needed. \nAs a result, Medicare payment rules will inhibit the adoption of this \npromising technology. This is unfortunate when one considers that, in \nmany cases, costly emergency room visits can be avoided while the \nidentical clinical analysis and interpretation takes place using data \nthat is transmitted electronically to the physician.\n  This legislation, which we are introducing today, would create \nreimbursement parity between physician visits on a face-to-face basis \nand equivalent interventions resulting from remote patient management \nmade possible by these devices. The legislation would provide the same \nMedicare coverage and level of reimbursement for remote monitoring \nservices that are found to be comparable to face-to-face, encounter-\nbased, services specifically for data collection and analysis. This new \nreimbursement policy will be implemented in a budget-neutral manner and \nsimply designed to pay for remote monitoring when a face-to-face \nphysician encounter would be reimbursed for the same services under the \nsame set of circumstances.\n\n  This proposal will improve patient care and promote the adoption of \nthis innovative new technology. Moreover, it will provide better access \nand improved quality of care for patients who rely on these devices, \nparticularly in rural areas. This is especially true in cases when an \nimmediate evaluation is required. We believe this is a sensible \nproposal that will reduce costs in the long-run and will ensure that \nseniors have access to cutting edge, life-saving technologies. We are \nhopeful that this legislation can be adopted quickly to assure that \nMedicare beneficiaries are\n\n[[Page S11291]]\n\nnot prevented from accessing this technology.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Graham, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 1608.

In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and their employees to reach and maintain \n     agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working \n     conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts through \n     negotiations to settle their differences by mutual agreement \n     reached through collective bargaining or by such methods as \n     may be provided for in any applicable agreement for the \n     settlement of disputes.\n       (3) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent work \n     stoppages and industrial strife between labor and management \n     that interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. __03.

Mr. HARKIN (for Ms. Collins (for herself and Mr. Reed)) \nproposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 3061, making appropriations for \nthe Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and \nrelated agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec. 516. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (referred \n     to in this section as ``LIHEAP'') is the primary Federal \n     program available to help low-income households, the elderly, \n     and individuals with disabilities pay their home energy \n     bills.\n       (2) Congress provided $300,000,000 in emergency funding for \n     LIHEAP in the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2001 because \n     regular appropriations were insufficient to help States \n     offset the increase in high utility bills during the winter \n     of 2000-2001.\n       (3) Congress expected that half of the emergency funding \n     would be made available for targeted assistance to States \n     with the most critical needs, and half would be given to help \n     States address unmet energy assistance needs resulting from \n     the extraordinary price increases in home heating fuels and \n     residential natural gas, experienced during the winter of \n     2000-2001.\n       (4) In the winter of 2000-2001, there was a 30 percent \n     increase in households receiving LIHEAP assistance in large \n     part due to the high price of home energy and severe weather.\n       (5) In the winter of 2000-2001, the LIHEAP program was only \n     able to serve 17 percent of the 29,000,000 households \n     eligible for LIHEAP assistance.\n       (6) In the winter of 2000-2001--\n       (A) heating oil prices were 36 percent higher than in the \n     winter of 1999-2000, and residential natural gas cost 42 \n     percent more per cubic foot than in the winter of 1999-2000; \n     and\n       (B) the weather was 10 percent colder than in the winter of \n     1999-2000.\n       (7) In the winter of 2000-2001, record cold weather and \n     high home energy bills took a financial toll on low-income \n     families and the elderly who spend, on average, 19.5 percent \n     of their annual income on energy bills, as compared to 3.7 \n     percent for all other households.\n       (8) Families in the United States need emergency LIHEAP \n     funding to pay home energy bills from the winter of 2000-2001 \n     and restore heat as the succeeding winter approaches.\n       (9) More citizens will need LIHEAP assistance in fiscal \n     year 2002 due to the recent increase in unemployment and the \n     slowing economy.\n       (10) States are being forced to draw down fiscal year 2002 \n     LIHEAP funds in order to address unmet needs from fiscal year \n     2001 and help low-income households pay overdue home energy \n     bills.\n\n[[Page S11295]]\n\n       (11) Emergency LIHEAP funding will provide States with \n     critical resources to help provide assistance to residents.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should immediately release the \n     $300,000,000 in emergency funding for LIHEAP provided by the \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2001.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 2051.
