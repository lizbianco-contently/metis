Strengthen them \nin body, soul, and spirit. May each one be open to hear Your still, \nsmall voice for guidance and direction in every decision they make. May \nYou always be their guiding force. We must, as the most powerful Nation \nin the world, let God be our guiding force. I pray this in Your holy \nname.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to talk about \nS. 1860, a piece of legislation I have introduced in the Senate along \nwith my colleague, Senator Hagel, from the State of Nebraska. I want to \ndescribe what this legislation does and what it is.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer if I could be notified when I have \nconsumed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the legislation we have introduced is the \nNew Homestead Economic Opportunity Act. The President pro tempore will \nremember well the old Homestead Act in this country. We decided to try \nto populate the middle of this country well over a century ago by \noffering land to people who would move to the center of the country and \nwork to improve the land. They would start a farm, start a family, and \nthe Federal Government would give them 160 acres of land. That was \ncalled the Homestead Act.\n  Let me describe what has happened to the middle part of our country \nin the last 50 years or so and why there is a need for a new Homestead \nAct now. No, it is not to give land away, because we don't have more \nland to give away, but to develop unique and different approaches \nthrough a New Homestead Economic Opportunity Act.\n  This is a map of the United States of America. The red areas on this \nmap are the rural counties that have lost at\n\n[[Page S794]]\n\nleast 10 percent of their population over the last 20 years. All of \nthese red areas are rural counties that have lost more than 10 percent \nof their population.\n  You will see almost an egg shape in the middle of America. The middle \npart of America is being depopulated. People are leaving. Our rural \ncounties are shrinking.\n  If you are trying to do business in one of these rural counties, you \nare in very big trouble; you are trying to do business in a recession \nand have been for some long while.\n  My home county is bigger than the State of Rhode Island. When I left \nit, there were 5,000 people. Now there are only 3,000 people--just to \ndescribe to you what is happening in the middle part of our country.\n  Let me also describe how I came to this county. My county is right \nhere in the corner of North Dakota. How did I get there? A Norwegian \nwidow named Caroline, with six children, got on a train in St Paul, MN, \nand went to southwestern North Dakota by train, pitched a tent with her \nfamily, built a house, started a farm, had a son who had a daughter who \nhad me. That is how I got here. Strong people? Sure.\n  Can you imagine the strength of this widow with six children \ndeciding, ``I am going to homestead. I am going to North Dakota to \nstart a farm and raise my family.'' What a wonderful thing to have \nhappen, and it happened all across the middle part of our country. That \nis the way we populated what is now called the heartland in America.\n  But this population is now leaving. It is shrinking dramatically.\n  Nearly 70 percent of the rural counties in the Great Plains have seen \ntheir populations shrink by a third over the past fifty years. Let me \nrepeat that. Nearly 70 percent of the counties in rural America in the \nGreat Plains have seen their population shrink by a third, despite the \nfact that in this part of America we have much of what people want. It \nis a wonderful place to raise a family. It is a wonderful place to \nlive, with great neighbors and low crime rates. It has much of what \npeople aspire to have in their lives. Yet rural counties in the middle \npart of our country are losing their economic strength, and they are \nlosing their population at a rapid pace.\n  Some years ago, we had a problem in inner cities in our country \ncalled urban blight. The Congress decided to do something about that. A \nnew program was developed called the Model Cities Program. Urban \nrenewal was developed to try to breathe life into major cities of this \ncountry that were suffering from very difficult problems.\n  In introducing this bill, Senator Hagel and I are saying, we \nunderstand that out-migration is a national problem, and we ought to do \nsomething in public policy to try to breathe life into these rural \nareas in the heartland of our country.\n  What is the heartland about? Let me describe North Dakota, and my \ncolleague, Mr. Hagel, will perhaps describe Nebraska.\n  Havana, ND, is a tiny little town. It is not big enough to keep a \ncafe unless everybody in town signs up to work for free. There is a \nsign-up sheet for everyone to volunteer to keep it from going out of \nbusiness. This is the way the residents of Havana keep this business \nopen in their town.\n  Sentinel Butte, ND, has a population of 80 people. The owner of the \ngas station and his wife have reached retirement age. They do not want \nto be open all day long. They close at about 1 o'clock. They lock the \ngas pumps and hang the key to the gas pumps on a nail on the front \ndoor. If you need gas and they are not there, you take the key, unlock \nthe pumps, pump some gas, and then make a note on a little sheet of \npaper. That is the way it works in a small town in western North \nDakota. It probably wouldn't work very well in a big city, but it works \nin Sentinel Butte, ND.\n  In Marmouth, ND, if you need a hotel, there is a hotel. Nobody works \nin the hotel. You check yourself into the hotel, and you have a good \nnight's rest. When you check out in the morning, you leave your room \nkey and some money in a cigar box that is nailed to the inside of the \ndoor. That is the place to stay if you visit Marmouth, ND. It may sound \nfar-fetched, but it is not.\n  In Tuttle, ND, they lost their grocery store. The city council said: \nWe will have to build our own grocery store. So they built a city-owned \ngrocery store. When they cut the ribbon for the new grocery store, I \nwas there that day, they had the high school band out on Main Street. \nThey closed Main Street to celebrate the opening of a city-owned store \nin Tuttle, ND.\n  My point is that these are wonderful places with great people, with \ngreat qualities, and with great character. Yet all of the people in \nthese areas are discovering that their population is shrinking and \ntheir Main Streets are dying. They are losing the economic vitality and \nthe hope that ought to exist in communities like these.\n  What can we do about that? Senator Hagel and I say the Government \nshould play a role here, just as it did when the major cities in our \ncountry were in trouble. We have proposed the New Homestead Economic \nOpportunity Act. We propose that Federal policy embrace the notion that \nthese rural areas in the heartland of America are worth saving as well. \nLet us provide some incentives to see if we can encourage people to \nmove there or to come back and to live in these areas.\n\n  We propose new homestead opportunities saying to young people that if \nyou want to stay in one of these rural counties, which is losing \npopulation as defined in the bill, we will forgive up to 50 percent of \nyour college loans by a certain percentage each year--about 10 percent \neach year for 5 years that you live and work in one of those counties, \nand help them to rebuild.\n  We will offer a tax credit for home purchases in those counties that \nhave been shrinking and losing population.\n  We will protect your home values by allowing you to write off on your \nincome tax the loss of the value of that home.\n  These days, if you build a home in a small town of 200 people in one \nof our States--Nebraska, or North Dakota--the minute that home is \ncompleted, it is worth substantially less than it cost to build it. \nThat is the way the market works in these small towns because banks and \nothers don't want to finance in those areas. We propose that tax policy \nhelp alleviate that.\n  We would establish individual homestead accounts to help people build \nsavings and have access to credit if they live in these areas. Their \nsavings could grow tax free, and after 5 years they could be tapped \ninto for small business loans, education expenses, first-time home \npurchases, and so on.\n  In addition to these homestead opportunities, we propose a new rural \ninvestment tax credit that says if you are doing business, investing, \nand creating jobs in these rural counties, you should be eligible for \nan investment tax credit because, as a matter of public policy, we want \nnew opportunities for growth in the heartland.\n  We propose a new homestead venture capital fund to promote business \ndevelopment and growth in these high outmigration areas by making sure \nthey have access to capital in order to grow the businesses they need \nin order to create jobs. Even if entrepreneurs are willing to work hard \nand take risks, they can't make it in a county that is losing its \npopulation unless they have access to capital.\n  Again, with respect to the middle part of America that is now losing \npopulation, let me say that when we sing that wonderful song, ``America \nthe Beautiful,'' and talk about our country from ``sea to shining \nsea,'' and as we fly across America and pass over the heartland of our \ncountry and the breadbasket of America, we see wonderful values. We see \nwonderful people who are struggling to live in circumstances where \ntheir economy, their communities, and their schools are shrinking.\n  I graduated from a little school with a class of nine, Regent High \nSchool, which closed last year. They had their last high school prom, \nand then they combined their school with that of a town 14 miles away. \nIt is no longer the little school that I attended.\n  That is happening all across the heartland. We can see the effect and \nthe change that it causes in small communities. But can we in public \npolicy make a difference? Can we begin to make an effort to change the \nfuture of rural America to a future of hope, opportunity, and growth? I \nthink we can.\n  That is why Senator Hagel and I have joined in proposing legislation \nthat I think will begin to offer that hope, and that will begin to \noffer the\n\n[[Page S795]]\n\npeople there the tools for economic opportunity and development in the \nheartland.\n  I believe there are 10 minutes remaining. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those 10 \nminutes be given to Senator Hagel, and I ask unanimous consent to \nextend 5 minutes beyond the additional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to join my friend and \ndistinguished colleague from North Dakota to speak about the New \nHomestead Economic Opportunity Act, S. 1860.\n  We have heard Senator Dorgan speak of this act, the reasons and \npossibilities for changes in our lifestyle in our country, and in \nparticular how it has affected the part of America from which Senator \nDorgan and I come. But it is not just a heartland issue. This issue of \noutmigration has received little attention over the years.\n  North Dakota and Nebraska and other Midwestern States, as you saw \nfrom Senator Dorgan's map, have been more affected by this outmigration \nthan most other States. Senator Dorgan talked with me last year about \npossibilities to not only address the issue but to go beyond just \nbringing up solutions and go beyond in an area where we think there are \nexpansion opportunities for many people.\n  Many communities in rural America have not shared in much of the boom \nthat has brought great prosperity to America over the last few years. \nAs we look at the numbers, at least over the last 50 years, we see \nclearly that the nonmetropolitan counties in the Nation lost more than \na third of their population during this time. You contrast this with \nthe fact that during the same period the number of people living in \nmetropolitan areas grew by more than 150 percent.\n\n  It is not our intention to restructure, reframe, or in any way try to \ndominate lifestyles and have a disproportionate effect on where people \nlive and how they live. That is not the point. The point is to offer \nsome incentives that might, in fact, give people more possibilities and \nmore opportunities at a time in the history of our country where \nquality of life is as important as some of the other dynamics that we, \nas a nation, as a culture, as a society, have had to deal with over the \nyears: Jobs, how to raise your family, how to take care of that family, \neducation, health care.\n  So quality of life has become an issue, as it should. We are most \nblessed in this country that it is an issue. We have conquered most of \nthe great diseases. We have conquered poverty and hunger, not in the \nworld but certainly in this country. So we are now looking at other \npossibilities as we try to help make the world more just and do more \nfor more people than history has ever recorded one nation having been \nable to do.\n  So my colleague from North Dakota and I are exploring possibilities. \nHe noted the 1862 Homestead Act, which I think is somewhat analogous to \nwhat we are proposing. In fact, the first claim made under this act in \n1862 was just outside Beatrice, NE. That first homestead under the 1862 \nHomestead Act is still there. It is a national park. We are very proud \nof that.\n  But, as I said earlier, as much as we have benefited--the State of \nNebraska, the Midwest; and we have benefited mightily from the \nHomestead Act of 1862--of the 93 counties in Nebraska, 61 of those 93 \nhad net outmigration of at least 10 percent over the last 20 years.\n  There is no particular mystery as to why we have seen this \noutmigration. Again, referring to Senator Dorgan's map, which gives a \nvery accurate assessment of what has happened, people will go where \nthere are opportunities. Jobs are a part of that universe of \nopportunities.\n  So as Senator Dorgan pointed out, in our legislation that we are \nproposing, we set out some specific areas that we think people might \nhave an interest in exploring to incentivize their interest in not only \nthe Midwest but all rural areas of America. And they are attached to \nwhat is important in our lives: Our families, our friends, our faiths, \nour sense of voluntarism, and community participation. It is being part \nof something larger than one's self-interest, a community spirit that \nin many ways is unique to America. So we would like to, in some way, \noffer opportunities to renew some of that.\n  There are currently joint capital formation projects, joint ventures, \nused in some States--Nebraska happens to have one of them--where, in \nfact, we can call upon the resources of both the public and private \nsectors to come together and provide those incentives. That is what we \nare proposing we do today in startup capital joint ventures, using \nprivate and public facilities. Senator Dorgan addressed some of those \nissues.\n  Infrastructure in these communities is critical, infrastructure such \nas roads and water and schools and medical facilities, hospitals, and \nsomething that Senator Dorgan has spoken of often, the Internet, access \nto high-speed Internet that many times we in the Midwest and many rural \nareas in the country get forgotten.\n\n  If we can, in fact, continue to build around and develop those \ninfrastructures, people who want a different approach, who want maybe a \nstyle of life that isn't always found or conducive in large \nmetropolitan areas, would have an option. I think it is worth \nexploring.\n  I am proud to be part of what Senator Dorgan and I are doing. We \nwould hope others will have some interest as well.\n  One last point on this.\n  Later this month, the Lincoln Journal Star newspaper in Nebraska will \npartner with the Nebraska Educational TV Network to explore issues \nsurrounding outmigration. In fact, the Lincoln Journal Star has done a \nseries of articles which have been very insightful and informative on \nhow we can deal with some of the concepts that Senator Dorgan and I are \nproposing in this legislation.\n  This presentation that will be made on educational TV will help frame \nthe problems, solutions, and issues. When that report is completed and \nthat program is aired, I will have that printed in the Record because I \nthink it very much focuses on and frames up, in a relevant way, what we \nare attempting to do with this legislation.\n  With that, Mr. President, again, I appreciate the time and I \nappreciate Senator Dorgan and his staff's effort on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first, let me say how much I appreciate \nworking with Senator Hagel on this legislation. As he indicated, the \nState of Nebraska has an abiding problem, just as the State of North \nDakota, South Dakota, and all of the States up and down the heartland \nof our country. It is not just our states.\n  I notice the Senator from Georgia is in the Chamber. Rural counties \nin Georgia, as well, are shrinking like prunes.\n  What do we do about that? Will Rogers used to chuckle when he thought \nabout what would get the Federal Government's attention. He said: If \nyou have two hogs that come down with something and get sick in a barn \nsomeplace, you will have all kinds of USDA people coming down to find \nout what is wrong with your hogs. But not much will happen if you have \nother problems. No one will show up.\n  I have an example that I would like to share with my colleague from \nNebraska. In recent months, we had a little prairie dog fight. I will \nnot go into all of the details. But prairie dogs took over a picnic \ngrounds in the Badlands in North Dakota. They were going to do an \nenvironmental assessment. Then they did an EA. They did a FONSI, a \nfinding of no significant impact. They had all these studies going on, \nand the Federal agencies got all cranked up about the prairie dogs, and \nthey decided to spend a quarter of a million dollars to move the picnic \ngrounds.\n  I said: Look we are not short of prairie dogs in western North \nDakota; we are short of people. My home county went from 5,000 people \nto 3,000 people in 25 years. The county next to mine is bigger than the \nState of Rhode Island, and it has 900 people and only had seven babies, \nin a recent year, born in the entire year. These are counties that are \ndramatically shrinking, and\n\n[[Page S796]]\n\nlosing their economic vitality. Yet you get a prairie dog problem in a \npicnic area, and the Federal Government mobilizes, and you have all \nthese agencies all juiced up to do something. But what about the fact \nthat the economy throughout the heartland of our country is in \ndesperate trouble, and you can hardly get anybody's attention in \ngovernment?\n\n  What Senator Hagel and I are saying is, let's go at this just as we \ndid with model cities or urban renewal, and decide that this is not \nonly a North Dakota problem--although it is certainly ours--not only a \nNebraska problem--although it is certainly theirs--but that it is a \nnational problem. A century after we populated the middle part of our \ncountry through the Homestead Act, depopulation is a national problem.\n  What has happened to cause the movement of people away from the \nheartland? A shift of jobs from production of natural resources--\nfarming, mining, and other industries--to work in service or \ntechnology-oriented industries that shifted the population in our \ncountry.\n  New industries do not necessarily need to be near the grain elevator \nor the mouth of a mine. New technologies allow us to make many products \nwith far fewer people, and that includes agriculture.\n  Free trade agreements have made it cheaper to produce goods overseas. \nThat, too, has shifted population.\n  What Senator Hagel and I are talking about is choice, giving people a \nchoice to be able to live in rural America if they choose to do that.\n  I recently gave a commencement speech to a large class at one of our \ncolleges in North Dakota, and I know most of those students are going \nto leave the State following their graduation--not because they want \nto, but because they do not have any choice.\n  Those young men and women, who represent our best and brightest, are \ngoing to leave North Dakota. Many will leave Nebraska. They will end up \non the west coast or the east coast or down south. And our States, in \nmy judgment, be weakened because they left. Other States will be \nstrengthened. We want to give them a choice to be able to stay if they \nwould like to stay.\n  If we want to stop outmigration and try to bring opportunity back to \nthe heartland, we need to do it as a nation, not just for the sake of \nthe heartland States, but for the sake of all our country. By any \nmeasure, the rural towns and counties that suffer from outmigration and \npopulation loss are still in many respects among the strongest in our \ncountry. They have good schools, a high level of civic involvement, \nextremely low rates of crime, good neighbors, a good life, and are \ngreat places in which to raise children. Our Government spends a great \ndeal of time and money trying to emulate these attributes in areas \nwhere they don't exist instead of trying to help preserve them in areas \nwhere they do exist; namely, rural counties in small-town America.\n  I know some might say Senator Hagel and I have this Norman Rockwell \nnotion of small town in our minds, and that is just wonderful, but that \nit is more nostalgia than it is reality. But I don't agree. In my \njudgment, public policy has a lot to do with where people locate. We \nsimply want to provide additional choices. Nebraska and North Dakota \nand many other States just don't have the opportunities that a \nCalifornia, Texas, Massachusetts, or New York has.\n  For instance, consider that the Federal Government is the largest \nresearcher in the world. Where do most of our research dollars go? Not \nto Nebraska or North Dakota. The bulk of it goes to four States: \nCalifornia, New York, Massachusetts, Texas. That is where, with these \ncenters of excellence in research serving as anchors, industries and \njobs locate. Public policy has a lot to do with where people live.\n\n  All Senator Hagel and I are saying is that we can sit around and \nwring our hands, gnash our teeth, wipe our brow, and worry about this \nforever or we can decide to put together an initiative that says, let's \ntry to do something about this shrinkage and outmigration in some of \nthese wonderful places. Let's give people more choices, especially \nyoung people, to stay in those areas where they grew up and where they \nwant to live, and provide them with spirit, hope, and opportunity to \nmake their future economy a good economy. We can do that.\n  That is the initiative we are proposing, one to provide tools and to \noffer choices to those who are working hard in a wonderful part of \nAmerica. We introduced the legislation in December. It is S. 1860. It \nis bipartisan. We will work very hard in the Senate and around the \ncountry to see if we can't get America to do for the heartland what it \nonce did for the cities, and to get people to see that something is \nhappening in rural America and that it needs help now. Let's join \ntogether and do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MILLER). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. May I be recognized?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Senators who have just \nspoken make a most compelling case. I take very seriously my role as \nSenator, in which I have a responsibility to the rest of the Nation in \naddition to the wonderful State I have the privilege of representing. \nWhat I would like to do is come to their respective States and see \nthese areas where there is outmigration. This is quite a contrast to \nwhat I have experienced in the State of Florida which has been just \nexactly the opposite kind of experience.\n  As a matter of fact, my home county, Brevard County, in the early \n1960s, because of the space race, when the Soviet Union surprised us \nwith Sputnik and then surprised us by launching Yuri Gagarin, one \norbit, before we could ever get to sub orbit with Alan Shepard, people \nwere just pouring in, sleeping in cars.\n  As a result, a lot of development was done in a rush with tremendous \nmistakes, not attending to zoning and not attending to proper drainage, \nand so forth and so on. So the experience of Florida has been quite the \nopposite of their experience.\n  What I would like to do is to learn from them how I could help them \nbecause we are all citizens of the United States of America. I thank \nthem for bringing this issue to the attention of the Senate. I look \nforward, maybe perhaps this summer, to visiting in their respective \nStates of North Dakota and Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S796-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S796-S797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to state that since the \nHouse of Representatives, at 3 in the morning, passed the campaign \nfinance reform bill, I want to cast out some markers as the Senate will \nconsider this legislation and no doubt will pass this legislation, my \nvote included. However, we have to be concerned about the flow of money \nin politics.\n  Campaign finance reform is an attempt to try to get soft money out of \npolitics, but this campaign finance reform bill does not totally do \nthat. It comes close.\n  Soft money, for those who would like a refresher, is campaign \ndonations that are other than personal donations from individuals or \nfrom political action committees. For example, a corporate check would \nbe an example of a soft money contribution to a candidate. Under the \ncurrent law, soft money contributions can flow through the parties. \nThat is where we have seen a great deal of abuse.\n  The campaign finance reform bill intends to constrict the use of that \nsoft money. It does so by saying that it can't flow through the \nparties. It can't be coordinated by the campaigns or the campaign \ncommittees, such as our Democrat and Republican Senate campaign \ncommittees, but it can flow through independent groups with a message \nor with an issue advertisement which we know becomes just as effective \nfor or against a candidate, almost, as a direct campaign ad that says \nvote for or vote against candidate A, B, or C.\n  However, there was an important limitation in this bill I supported \nvigorously. That was that soft money could not flow through independent \ngroups for purposes of affecting an election through an issue ad 60 \ndays\n\n[[Page S797]]\n\nprior to a general election and 30 days prior to a primary election. \nThat is an important reform.\n  The caveat is that we created a severability clause that says that if \nthe courts strike any provision of the bill as unconstitutional, the \nwhole bill does not fall. It leaves us with the possibility that the \ncourts could strike the 60-day provision on independent groups.\n  I hope and pray that the courts will not, that they will see that \nthis is delicately balanced to meet the constitutional test the courts \nhave raised. But if they do, then what we are going to have is \nunlimited soft money in the future that is going to flow, not through \nthe parties, as we presently have had under current law, but a \nproliferation of independent groups are going to arise, and campaign \nsoft money affecting elections through the guise of issue ads is going \nto flow through those independent groups. And I continue to think many \nof us intend that to be the case. That is the caveat about which we \nmust be concerned. Ultimately, what we should do is try to figure out \nhow to lower the cost of elections.\n\n  The House of Representatives, unfortunately, struck the provision \nthat the Senate had included, which said that television time for \ncandidates has to be given at the lowest commercial rate--what is \ncurrent law but which has not been obeyed. This was to enforce that \nprovision. That was stricken last night as the House of Representatives \nconsidered campaign finance reform. That bill is going to be coming to \nus shortly. No doubt we are going to pass it.\n  I wanted to lay out these markers and these caveats as we look to a \nfuture of trying to clean up campaign finance with new campaign finance \nreform law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend our colleague from Florida, who \nhas had a longstanding interest in the subject matter. He brings a \nwealth of knowledge about the intricacies of these laws. As the person \nwho managed the campaign finance reform bill here on the floor of this \nbody, along with the help of my colleague from Nevada, there is a sense \nof parochial pride in the House action last evening in that the major \ncosponsor of the legislation, Chris Shays, is a longstanding friend of \nmine, a member of the Connecticut delegation, a House member for some \n15 years. He has been a dogged advocate of campaign finance reform. So \nthere is a sense in those of us and the overwhelming majority of my \nconstituents in Connecticut, as across the country, who support the \nnotion of trying to get a handle on the issue of campaign financing, a \nsense of pride in the work of Chris Shays and the job he did on behalf \nof the entire country, not just Connecticut.\n  As was said by others, this is not an end-all, a piece of legislation \nthat will solve all the problems. I express my regret that what I \nthought may have been one of the most effective pieces of legislation, \ndealing with the cost of media, was struck from the bill last evening. \nFor those of us in this Chamber who have to go out and raise money to \nengage in a campaign, the one single item that absolutely drives the \ncost of a campaign is the cost of media. About 80 cents on the dollar \ngoes to TV and radio advertising, but most of it is TV advertising. \nThere have been literally pioneers and visionaries in the media \nindustry at a local level who have found it in their own business \npractices to open up their media outlets for an open debate and \ndiscussion.\n  I think, particularly, of a gentleman who owns TV stations in \nMinnesota, who is a very effective leader in the television industry \nbut has, for years, made it possible for statewide candidates in that \nState to have some time around the news to express themselves on why \nthey would like to be elected to the office they are seeking. My hope \nis that we would adopt provisions that would make it possible for \ncandidates to have access.\n  The airwaves are public property. Maybe I am old school, but I was \nalways raised to believe that. It was a privilege that we extended to \npeople to use the public airwaves. So the idea that the public ought \nnot to have the opportunity to listen to people who are going to \nrepresent them, whether a Governor, Congressman, or Senator, is \nsomething I find disturbing, that they would object to the notion of \nhaving opportunities. I am sorry that was stricken. It is a very good \nbill over all, and I commend the other body for their leadership, and \nparticularly my friend from Connecticut. Congratulations to my \ncolleague from Wisconsin as well.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the hour of 10:15 having arrived, we are now \nto proceed to S. 565.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S797-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S797-S830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EQUAL PROTECTION OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 565, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 565) to establish the Commission on Voting \n     Rights and Procedures to study and make recommendations \n     regarding election technology, voting, and election \n     administration, to establish a grant program under which the \n     Office of Justice Programs and the Civil Rights Division of \n     the Department of Justice shall provide assistance to States \n     and localities in improving election technology and the \n     administration of Federal elections, to require States to \n     meet uniform and nondiscriminatory election technology and \n     administration requirements for the 2004 Federal elections, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Is there an amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to offer one shortly.\n  Mr. President, as Senator Dodd mentioned, he managed the bill that \nallowed us to send the campaign finance reform bill to the other body. \nI spent a lot of time with him on the floor during that period of time. \nI have to say, as I said after that debate and vote took place, it was \na masterful display of managing legislation.\n  As a result, a bill was sent over there that I think they had to \naccept. I say publicly that I look forward to the bill coming back over \nhere. I know that with the guidance of the chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, Senator Dodd, we will pass the legislation. There may be \nsome efforts to slow it down, but this is a steamroller.\n  I must say that that steam was generated over here in this Chamber. \nThere were many efforts to weaken or kill this legislation. I have to \ngive credit to Senator Dodd for managing it at that time.\n  Also present today is the Senator from Wisconsin, my friend, someone \nwho has lived campaign reform legislation. I can't say enough about the \nmoral aspect of this legislation. I remind people here that, in 1998, \nSenator Feingold was behind in his reelection efforts in Wisconsin. \nEveryone told him that he likely could win that election if he would \nallow the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to come to the State \nof Wisconsin and put money in that State and spend money on soft money \nissue ads. Senator Feingold is not an independently wealthy man. He, of \ncourse, is a fine lawyer, with a great educational background. But he \nhad nothing else to fall back on. He could not just go to a bank \naccount and write big checks. He stared his morality in the face during \nthat short period of time and said, ``No, I don't want that money. I \nwould rather lose the election than depend on something that I don't \nbelieve in.''\n\n  I say to the Senator from Wisconsin, not only did he not take the \nsoft money, he won the election. Not only did he win the election, he \ncame back with added vigor to work on this campaign finance bill. So I \nextend to the Senator the congratulations of the people of the State of \nNevada, and the people of this country, for being a person who stands \nfor what we all believe in, and that is good government. I think every \nperson in the U.S. Senate believes in good government. But it is not \noften that a book is written that will stand the test of time in the \nsense of the morality the Senator lends to this issue. I am very \ngrateful to the Senator from Wisconsin for what he has done on this \nlegislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2879\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S798]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Specter, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2879.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment is dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To secure the Federal voting rights of certain qualified \n                persons who have served their sentences)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                      TITLE V--CIVIC PARTICIPATION\n\n     SEC. 501. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of \n     citizenship and regaining the right to vote reintegrates \n     offenders into free society. The right to vote may not be \n     abridged or denied by the United States or by any State on \n     account of race, color, gender, or previous condition of \n     servitude. Basic constitutional principles of fairness and \n     equal protection require an equal opportunity for United \n     States citizens to vote in Federal elections.\n       (2) Congress has ultimate supervisory power over Federal \n     elections, an authority that has repeatedly been upheld by \n     the Supreme Court.\n       (3) Although State laws determine the qualifications for \n     voting in Federal elections, Congress must ensure that those \n     laws are in accordance with the Constitution. Currently, \n     those laws vary throughout the Nation, resulting in \n     discrepancies regarding which citizens may vote in Federal \n     elections.\n       (4) An estimated 3,900,000 individuals in the United \n     States, or 1 in 50 adults, currently cannot vote as a result \n     of a felony conviction. Women represent about 500,000 of \n     those 3,900,000.\n       (5) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact \n     ethnic minorities.\n       (6) Fourteen States disenfranchise ex-offenders who have \n     fully served their sentences, regardless of the nature or \n     seriousness of the offense.\n       (7) In those States that disenfranchise ex-offenders who \n     have fully served their sentences, the right to vote can be \n     regained in theory, but in practice this possibility is often \n     illusory.\n       (8) In 8 States, a pardon or order from the Governor is \n     required for an ex-offender to regain the right to vote. In 2 \n     States, ex-offenders must obtain action by the parole or \n     pardon board to regain that right.\n       (9) Offenders convicted of a Federal offense often have \n     additional barriers to regaining voting rights. In at least \n     16 States, Federal ex-offenders cannot use the State \n     procedure for restoring their voting rights. The only method \n     provided by Federal law for restoring voting rights to ex-\n     offenders is a Presidential pardon.\n       (10) Few persons who seek to have their right to vote \n     restored have the financial and political resources needed to \n     succeed.\n       (11) Thirteen percent of the African-American adult male \n     population, or 1,400,000 African-American men, are \n     disenfranchised. Given current rates of incarceration, 3 in \n     10 African-American men in the next generation will be \n     disenfranchised at some point during their lifetimes. \n     Hispanic citizens are also disproportionately \n     disenfranchised, since those citizens are disproportionately \n     represented in the criminal justice system.\n       (12) The discrepancies described in this subsection should \n     be addressed by Congress, in the name of fundamental fairness \n     and equal protection.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to restore \n     fairness in the Federal election process by ensuring that ex-\n     offenders who have fully served their sentences are not \n     denied the right to vote.\n\n     SEC. 502. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Correctional institution or facility.--The term \n     ``correctional institution or facility'' means any prison, \n     penitentiary, jail, or other institution or facility for the \n     confinement of individuals convicted of criminal offenses, \n     whether publicly or privately operated, except that such term \n     does not include any residential community treatment center \n     (or similar public or private facility).\n       (2) Election.--The term ``election'' means--\n       (A) a general, special, primary, or runoff election;\n       (B) a convention or caucus of a political party held to \n     nominate a candidate;\n       (C) a primary election held for the selection of delegates \n     to a national nominating convention of a political party; or\n       (D) a primary election held for the expression of a \n     preference for the nomination of persons for election to the \n     office of President.\n       (3) Federal office.--The term ``Federal office'' means the \n     office of President or Vice President, or of Senator or \n     Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, \n     Congress.\n       (4) Parole.--The term ``parole'' means parole (including \n     mandatory parole), or conditional or supervised release \n     (including mandatory supervised release), imposed by a \n     Federal, State, or local court.\n       (5) Probation.--The term ``probation'' means probation, \n     imposed by a Federal, State, or local court, with or without \n     a condition on the individual involved concerning--\n       (A) the individual's freedom of movement;\n       (B) the payment of damages by the individual;\n       (C) periodic reporting by the individual to an officer of \n     the court; or\n       (D) supervision of the individual by an officer of the \n     court.\n\n     SEC. 503. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.\n\n       The right of an individual who is a citizen of the United \n     States to vote in any election for Federal office shall not \n     be denied or abridged because that individual has been \n     convicted of a criminal offense unless, at the time of the \n     election, such individual--\n       (1) is serving a felony sentence in a correctional \n     institution or facility; or\n       (2) is on parole or probation for a felony offense.\n\n     SEC. 504. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Attorney General.--The Attorney General may bring a \n     civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain \n     such declaratory or injunctive relief as is necessary to \n     remedy a violation of this title.\n       (b) Private Right of Action.--\n       (1) Notice.--A person who is aggrieved by a violation of \n     this title may provide written notice of the violation to the \n     chief election official of the State involved.\n       (2) Action.--Except as provided in paragraph (3), if the \n     violation is not corrected within 90 days after receipt of a \n     notice provided under paragraph (1), or within 20 days after \n     receipt of the notice if the violation occurred within 120 \n     days before the date of an election for Federal office, the \n     aggrieved person may bring a civil action in such a court to \n     obtain the declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to \n     the violation.\n       (3) Action for violation shortly before a federal \n     election.--If the violation occurred within 30 days before \n     the date of an election for Federal office, the aggrieved \n     person shall not be required to provide notice to the chief \n     election official of the State under paragraph (1) before \n     bringing a civil action in such a court to obtain the \n     declaratory or injunctive relief with respect to the \n     violation.\n\n     SEC. 505. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS.\n\n       (a) No Prohibition on Less Restrictive Laws.--Nothing in \n     this title shall be construed to prohibit a State from \n     enacting any State law that affords the right to vote in any \n     election for Federal office on terms less restrictive than \n     those terms established by this title.\n       (b) No Limitation on Other Laws.--The rights and remedies \n     established by this title shall be in addition to all other \n     rights and remedies provided by law, and shall not supersede, \n     restrict, or limit the application of the Voting Rights Act \n     of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973 et seq.) or the National Voter \n     Registration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 1973gg et seq.).\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before we turn to our colleague, I am going \nto propound a unanimous consent request.\n  Let me pose this--I will not make the unanimous consent request so \nstaff can check with Members--I would like to get time boiled down, if \nwe can. I know my colleague from Nevada wants to accommodate this. I \nsuggest 45 minutes equally divided. Why don't we try that? If Members \nbelieve they can do it in a half hour, that would be even better.\n  We have a series of amendments, and the hope is--I will state it \nagain--I have been told; I am not going to speak for the leader; I will \nlet my colleague from Nevada speak for the leader or the leader can \nspeak for himself--I am told if we can get this bill done this evening, \nthere is a great possibility there will be no votes tomorrow and \nMembers can head for their States. Particularly Western Senators who \nmay have amendments, I urge you to offer your amendments so we can \ncomplete this bill today.\n  With that, I turn to my colleague from Nevada to see if we can \nconstrain time, and then the Senator from Wisconsin can speak.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Specter and I have moved on this \nlegislation. We have been wanting to do this for a long time. I \npersonally would like 20 minutes. I want to make sure Senator Specter, \nwho has not spoken, has all the time he wants. I certainly cannot speak \nfor Senator Specter. So I say to my friends, the two managers of the \nbill, I will be happy to agree to any time limitation, but I have to \nspeak to Senator Specter before I do that.\n  If it is in keeping with Senator McConnell's wishes, I yield to my \nfriend from Wisconsin for a period of 5 minutes without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                    PASSAGE OF THE SHAYS-MEEHAN BILL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first in light of Senator Reid's \ncomments about my personal financing, which were accurate, he is buying \nme dinner tonight. I thank him for the lovely remarks.\n  Senator Dodd and Senator Reid were absolutely critical to the McCain-\nFeingold bill getting through this body.\n\n[[Page S799]]\n\n They were the two Senators out here every day during those 2 weeks \ndoing an absolutely masterful job managing the bill. It was very \ntricky. I thank them again. We need your help one more time now that it \nis coming back to this body. I am grateful.\n  As we know, in light of the papers and the comments this morning, \nearly this morning the House of Representatives passed campaign finance \nreform. Thanks to the courageous leadership of Chris Shays, Marty \nMeehan, and Dick Gephardt, the House voted firmly in favor of reform. \nThe House had to weather a great storm--a storm of lobbying that rained \ndown from the opponents of reform.\n  Frankly, they tried every trick in the book to kill the Shays-Meehan \nbill. They tried everything. Mr. President, you saw similar attempts in \nthis House, and you helped us fight them every day.\n  The proponents of reform tried to love Shays-Meehan to death, they \ntried to make Members swallow poison pill amendments, and when all else \nfailed, they tried old-fashioned arm twisting to get supporters to back \ndown. But reform supporters did not back down. Instead, they were \ncourageous and they brought about a historic moment for campaign \nfinance reform. This was the time in the House when, as we all know, it \nreally counted. A lot of people said it would not happen because this \ntime, as some said, they were shooting with real bullets. But the House \ncame through, as they have done twice before.\n\n  This really was--and I think many Americans feel this way--a soaring \nmoment for democracy. Reform has now prevailed in both Houses of \nCongress. That is something for which all of us can be proud. With the \npassage of the Shays-Meehan bill in the House, both bodies have finally \nacknowledged the will of the American people, and that is that the \ncampaign finance system must be reformed. But passage in the House, \nhowever great an achievement, does not quite get the bill to the finish \nline, as we know. We need to pass the Shays-Meehan bill in this body, \nand to do that, we need to receive the Shays-Meehan bill from the House \nof Representatives.\n  It sounds like a mechanical thing, Mr. President, but as you may \nrecall, we had a little problem in this House with the McCain-Feingold \nbill being sent over to the House after it was passed. A majority in \nthis body is eager to take up Shays-Meehan, but we cannot pass the bill \nuntil we have it in hand.\n  I urge the House to send the legislation to us today without delay. \nWe cannot get this bill to the President's desk unless we can take it \nup and pass the legislation in this body. I urge the House to send us \nthe bill so we can get it to the President for his signature.\n  I also add--and I am grateful for this--I welcome the President's \nremarks yesterday morning through his spokesperson that the Shays-\nMeehan bill would ``make progress and improve the system.'' That is \nwhat the President's spokesman said. The President seeks a bill that \nimproves the system, and that is exactly what our bill does. I am \npleased and delighted the President has signaled his support for our \nlegislation which will finally end the corrupt soft money system once \nand for all.\n  I, of course, look forward to working with my friend and partner on \nthis, John McCain, to pass Shays-Meehan in this body and send it to the \nPresident. The American people will be watching, as they watched us \nlast year and as they watched the House this week. They want to know \nwhether we can finally do what is right. Can we finally close the door \non the soft money system that leaves us so vulnerable to an appearance \nof corruption? Can we finally say together as legislators, as \nrepresentatives of our people, the soft money system simply is not \nworth the risk?\n  It is time for us to show that we can live up to our role as stewards \nof this cherished democracy. We have the power to seize this moment for \nreform, and I really believe we will. We have had a decisive victory \nthis week, just as we had a decisive victory last year in the Senate. \nNow we have to get this legislation across the finish line so we can \nban soft money and begin to restore the people's faith in us and the \nwork we do.\n  I certainly look forward to working with my colleagues to do that. I \nam grateful for the time. I thank the Senator from Nevada, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from New York has indicated he \nwishes to speak. I will yield to Senator Schumer from New York for a \nperiod up to 5 minutes without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada for \nyielding. I first wish to give kudos and accolades to my friend from \nWisconsin for the great job he has done on this issue. It took a \nparticular kind of strength, a particular kind of courage to get this \nto happen, and he did. He had all of that, and he did. I salute him. \nThe Nation salutes him this morning as we saw what happened on the \nfloor of the House late last night.\n  I salute my House colleagues, not only, of course, Mr. Shays and Mr. \nMeehan and their band, and not only Minority Leader Gephardt, but also \nthe new whip, Nancy Pelosi, did a great job in making this happen.\n  I wish to make two other points. First, is this a cure-all? No. But \ndoes it get rid of something that has grown like Topsy and has made the \nsystem far worse than what was envisioned when it passed in 1974? \nAbsolutely. To not move forward would have been a mistake.\n  I join my colleague from Wisconsin in urging that the House send us \nthe bill quickly and that we pass the bill quickly without further \ndebate in the Senate. We all know how this bill has a unique and \npeculiar way of getting bogged down, for some reasons stated and some \nunstated. To send the House bill back to us and then we pass it is the \nway to proceed.\n  We are really close. We are on the 1-yard line. It has been a long \ngame, and we can declare victory if the House sends us the bill and we \njust pass it.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2879\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I recognize the work of Senators Dodd and \nMcConnell, and others. Certainly they are the ones who run this \ncommittee and are responsible for bringing forward the legislation that \nis before the Senate and for crafting bipartisan legislation.\n  The most fundamental premise of democracy--and that is one of the \nreasons we have this legislation before the Senate--is that every vote \ncounts.\n  The reality is that votes cast in wealthier parts of the country \nfrequently count more than votes cast in poorer areas because wealthier \ndistricts have better, more accurate, more modern, and less error-prone \ncounting machines than poorer precincts and districts. One can see in \nlooking at a State, those counties within a State that have more money \nhave more resources; they have better voting machines, more modern \nvoting machines. The same is true in Nevada.\n  Reality was thrust upon us, of course, during the 2000 Presidential \nelection after which many Americans justly questioned the \ntrustworthiness of our Nation's electoral process. But even though \nFlorida was beaten up very badly, if that same light had been shone on \nother States, the same problems would have been seen, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  In the last election I was involved in Washoe County, which is the \nsecond most populous county in the State of Nevada, a very good, well-\nintentioned worker in the county in the election department thought she \nwould save a little money and print their own ballots. They did that \nand saved some money. They did not go to the professional, the same \ncompany that sold them the voting machines.\n  Well, come election time, some of the votes were not counted. They \nwere off one-sixteenth of an inch or less, but the voting machine would \nnot pick up that paper. So thousands of votes had to be hand counted \nonce, twice, sometimes three times.\n  In that same county, I can remember very clearly, it was a close \nelection. I\n\n[[Page S800]]\n\nhad won the election, and I get a call a week or two after the \nelection--there is a recount going on. They found 3,000 ballots they \nhad not counted. When the election is going to be decided by a few \nhundred votes, that gets your attention.\n  The attention was focused on Florida, but it could have happened, I \nbelieve, in any of the 50 States. Florida may not have handled what \nthey came up with very well after the fact, but I think we have to be \nconsiderate and understand that election problems have been around in \nthis country for a long time. What this legislation will do is allow \nmore fair elections, and I think that is so important.\n  The United States is the oldest democracy in the world, but we can do \nbetter. We are an imperfect nation as I have said hundreds of times, \nimperfect but the best country, with the best of rules, by this little \nConstitution, best set of rules ever devised to rule the affairs of men \nand women.\n  The bipartisan legislation that Senators Dodd and McConnell have \ncrafted, while unable to address every single issue and every single \nproblem that was exposed in 2000, takes a giant step in that direction. \nSo I support the efforts of my colleagues from Connecticut and Kentucky \nand look forward to swift passage of this legislation, hopefully today.\n  The amendment I have sent to the desk, and I am pleased to recognize \nthat this is bipartisan legislation--I am very honored Senator Specter \nhas joined with me in this legislation--and this is an issue that has \nnot received the attention it deserves. Basically what this amendment \ndoes is ensure that ex-felons, people who have fully served their \nsentences, have completed their probation, have completed their parole, \nshould not be denied their right to vote.\n  When I am doing my morning run, I always listen to public radio. On \npublic radio this morning, they had something called Heart to Heart. It \nis Valentine's Day and they had examples of different organizations \ndoing nice things for people. I listened to these two law students, two \nwomen, who were counseling and trying to teach women who were in prison \nabout the law. They went through the Constitution and taught about the \nFirst Amendment rights and such things. Interestingly, during that \ninterview I heard this morning, the women said the one thing they \nwanted to talk about and the one thing that bothered them so much is \nthey did not know they would not be able to vote when they got out of \nprison, and they focused on that. That means so much to an American to \nbe able to vote.\n\n  We do not have the voter turnout that we should have, but still it is \na right that must be protected.\n  My parents were uneducated. They knew how important it was to vote. I \ncan remember my mother especially, there would be somebody on the \nballot and she would say: I know him; Glen Jones.\n  But she did not know Glen Jones. She had met Glen Jones at some \npolitical rally. But I thought she knew Glen Jones and she thought she \nknew Glen Jones. He was sheriff of Clark County.\n  Mr. President, I want to tell my colleagues . . . how I became \ninvolved in this issue. Some will say there are a lot more important \nthings to do, and maybe that is true. In Las Vegas, we have a radio \nstation KCEP, in a predominantly, African American part of Las Vegas. I \nwent there 1 day to spend an hour taking phone calls, and I made a very \nbrief statement. I took my first call and a woman said:\n\n       My brother committed a crime when he was a teenager. He \n     completed his probation and he is now a man in his fifties \n     and he cannot vote. He has never done anything wrong in his \n     life other than when he was a teenager. But, he cannot vote. \n     He supports his family. He pays his taxes. Why should he not \n     be able to vote?\n\n  And that one phone call started for an hour people calling in saying: \nSenator Reid, can't you do something about that? They would give \nexample after example.\n  I could give scores of examples. I cannot remember everybody who \ncalled me on that radio station, but I have an e-mail that was sent to \nme that perhaps illustrates what these radio callers were talking \nabout.\n\n       Dear Senator Reid: I heard on the news this morning that \n     you are working on some legislation regarding the voting \n     rights of convicted felons. I have a felony conviction from \n     the sixties. I did my time, learned my lesson, and have been \n     a responsible citizen since then. I moved to Las Vegas in \n     1982 and have lived here since that time. I have been \n     employed all that time. I currently make over $60,000 per \n     year. I own two houses in Las Vegas and 40 acres of land in \n     Utah. I pay my fair share of taxes, both local and Federal, \n     and yet I have no say in my government. I suppose I could \n     hire a lawyer and try to get my civil rights back, but it is \n     very confusing. I would first have to petition California \n     where the offenses occurred, and then petition Nevada.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Reid: I heard on the news this morning that \n     you are working on some legislation regarding the voting \n     rights of convicted felons. I have a felony conviction from \n     the sixties. I did my time, learned my lesson, and have been \n     a responsible citizen since then. I moved to Las Vegas in \n     1982 and have lived here since that time. I have been \n     employed all that time, currently I gross over $60,000 per \n     year. I own two houses in Las Vegas and forty acres of land \n     in Utah. I pay my fair share of taxes, both local and federal \n     and yet I have no say in my government.\n       I suppose I could hire a lawyer and try to get my civil \n     rights back. But it's very confusing. I would first have to \n     petition California where the offenses occurred and then \n     petition Nevada.\n       I registered here when I first came to Nevada and got my \n     ex-felon card. I also registered to vote. In California I was \n     allowed to vote and I though it would be the same here. I did \n     vote for over ten years here and then a few years ago out of \n     the blue I received notice that I no longer could vote. I was \n     devastated. First off I could not see where it even made \n     sense, I was a working property owner who payed taxes and \n     obeyed the laws. (In the past thirty years I have two traffic \n     tickets and that's all). I still feel that I should have the \n     right to vote. I hope that you can accomplish something that \n     will allow me to have some say about the future of this great \n     country.\n       I feel that it is not only the right of every American to \n     vote. It is also their duty.\n       Thank you\n                                         Melvin Douglas Miner, Jr.\n\n  Mr. REID. He closes by saying he has paid all his taxes and obeyed \nall the laws. The past 30 years he had two traffic tickets which he \npaid. He still believes he should have the right to vote. He says:\n\n       I hope that you can accomplish something that will allow me \n     to have some say about the future of this great country. I \n     feel that it is not only the right of every American to vote, \n     it is also their duty.\n\n  My constituent's name is Melvin Douglas Miner, Jr., and he is not \nembarrassed by the fact he has done this. He is rendering a service to \nthe people of this country by allowing me to use his letter to me.\n  There are examples after examples. A man came to me who is almost 80 \nyears old, a successful businessman in Las Vegas, with tears in his \neyes, and said: I am going to close up my business and turn it over to \nmy children.\n  He said: I cannot vote. Every time the election time rolls around I \nmake excuses to my children. I got married late in life. My children \nare asking me questions even today. I have been able to hide from them \nthe fact that I do not vote is because I cannot vote. Could you do \nsomething about it?\n  There are stories such as there all over. I don't condone people who \ncommit felonies, but I recognize that when people pay their debt to \nsociety we should make them part of society. I am not saying the day a \nperson gets out of prison they should be able to vote. But when he gets \nout of prison and has completed his parole and probation, let him vote.\n  The right to vote in a democracy is the most basic right of \ncitizenship. It is a right that may not be abridged or denied, by any \nState, race, color, gender, or position of servitude. It is a \nfundamental right. It is a glaring example of what our free society \nrepresents.\n  Think about Nelson Mandela. Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in prison. \nNelson Mandela as a young man spent his best years in prison. One would \nthink for a man who spent 27 years in prison, many of those years in \nvery squalid conditions, that the most important day of his life would \nhave been walking out of that prison after 27 years, or maybe it was \nthe day he became president of a post-apartheid South Africa. But that \nis not what he said. The great Nelson Mandela said the most important \nday of his life was the day he voted for the first time. Think about \nthat.\n\n[[Page S801]]\n\n  Millions of people in America cannot vote. They have completed their \ndebt to society. As elected officials who have been given the privilege \nto serve, we need to recognize the strength of a democracy depends on \nvoluntary participation of its citizens. Low voter turnout is not \nsomething we should be proud of; certainly we should not compound that \nby having people who have fulfilled their debt to society not be \nallowed to vote.\n  States have different rules as to when a person can vote if a person \ncommitted a felony. In 14 States, ex-felons who have served their \nsentence, including parole on probation, are denied a right to vote; \nthe 36 other States have various rules. But it adds up to hundreds of \nthousands and millions of people. Fundamental fairness dictates this \npolicy is wrong.\n  The amendment that the senior Senator from Pennsylvania and I have \nintroduced today aims to correct this injustice. In these 14 States and \nother States, the process by which individuals who have fully served \ntheir sentences and wish to regain their right to vote is often \ndifficult and cumbersome. Some may have to petition a board and get a \npardon. For others, Governors can give them the right to vote. In some \nStates, ex-felons who have completed their sentences must obtain a \nPresidential pardon. As every Member knows, very few people have the \nfinancial or political resources needed.\n  This disproportionally affects ethnic minorities. According to the \nSentencing Project, an estimated 13 percent of adult African Americans \nthroughout the United States are unable to vote as a result of varying \nState disenfranchisement laws. The rate is, unbelievably, seven times \nthe national average.\n  In some States, the numbers are more extraordinary. In Florida and \nAlabama, more than 31 percent of all African American men are \npermanently barred from ever voting in those States again. In six other \nStates, the percentage of African American men permanently \ndisfranchised is over 20 percent. Given current rates of incarceration, \nthe Sentencing Project estimates that up to 40 percent of African \nAmerican men may permanently lose their right to vote.\n  I want to make sure that not lost in this debate is the fact that \ncriminal activity is wrong and must be punished and punished severely. \nI am for the death penalty. I introduced, in the State of Nevada, \nlegislation that said if you are convicted of a crime and sentenced to \nlife without possibility of parole, that is what it should mean. It \nshould not mean a person gets out in 20 or 30 years. If a jury, with \nthe approval of a judge, sentences somebody to life without the \npossibility of parole, that is what it should mean.\n  I believe in strict enforcement of the law. However, I also believe a \nsentence is a sentence, and when a judge gives somebody 10 years and \nthey get out in 5 years, after 5 years of parole and any probation time \nthey should be able to be voters in the State of Nevada and the rest of \nthis country. Sufficient and appropriate sentences should be imposed \nupon those who violate our laws. We should not, however, disenfranchise \nthose who have fully completed their prescribed sentences.\n  We have a saying in this country: If you do the crime, you have to do \nthe time. I agree with that. But if you do the time, and do it \ncompletely, why should you have to do more time?\n  I have a number of editorials, one from October 3, 2000, in the York \nDaily Record, ``Voting Rights Too long Denied''; Philadelphia Inquirer, \nSeptember 21, ``A Vote for Fairness, Disenfranchising Ex-felons Was \nUnnecessary.'' I have an editorial from the Las Vegas Review Journal, \n``Felons and Voting Rights, Extended 'Second-class Citizenship' Is \nCounterproductive.'' I ask unanimous consent these editorials be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the York Daily Record, Oct. 3, 2000]\n\n                     Voting Rights Too Long Denied\n\n       Pennsylvania last week plucked some feathers from a Jim \n     Crow-like law that denied the vote to a disproportionate \n     number of voting-age black men.\n       Once common in the South, Jim Crow laws were designed to \n     deny blacks the vote. Jim Crow was a demeaning minstrel show \n     character, and it is in his dishonor the laws were named.\n       Pennsylvania's rules denying recent ex-felons the vote may \n     not have been written with racial intentions, but it had that \n     effect. And because of that effect, the Philadelphia NAACP \n     successfully sued to have the law set aside.\n       Commonwealth Court President Judge Joseph T. Doyle said he \n     found ``no rational basis'' for Pennsylvania's law. The \n     statute barred convicts from registering to vote for five \n     years after leaving prison with one major exception. Felons \n     who were registered before entering prison were allowed to \n     vote.\n       Strangely, the law even allowed them to run for office \n     while still serving their sentence. Former Republican state \n     senator Bill Slocum, fresh from a federal pen and on house \n     arrest, is campaigning for his old job on ``work release'' \n     while still wearing an electronic monitoring device. Mr. \n     Slocum has not yet finished his term, and voters should cast \n     their ballots accordingly.\n       But someone who has paid his debt to society should not be \n     stripped of a right of citizenship for five years, as was the \n     case in Pennsylvania.\n       Judge Doyle was right to issue a temporary order allowing \n     ex-felons to register to vote in the upcoming election. The \n     law itself should be struck down, and other states have \n     statutes even more in need of change. Those with felony \n     records face a lifetime disenfranchisement in Florida, \n     Alabama, Mississippi, Virginia, Iowa, Kentucky, Nevada, New \n     Mexico and Wyoming--that's 2 percent of all Americans and 13 \n     percent of adult black men.\n       The nation's war on drugs has claimed a disproportionate \n     number of people of color. Based on current rates of \n     incarceration, 28.5 percent of black males will likely serve \n     time in a state or federal prison for a felony conviction, a \n     rate seven times than for whites.\n       That doesn't mean African-Americans commit a \n     disproportionate number of crimes. It is necessary to look \n     beyond the surface statistics. Although blacks and whites \n     have about the same rate of drug use, for example, about a \n     third of those arrested for drug offenses are African-\n     Americans. Fifty-nine percent of those convicted are black, \n     and their sentences are almost 50 percent longer than for \n     whites.\n       Not being able to vote is among the least of the problems \n     in a system so fraught with injustice. But it needs to be \n     addressed.\n       About 14 million African-Americans had lost their right to \n     vote because of felony convictions. But those statistics will \n     have to be adjusted downward now that 40,000 black \n     Pennsylvanians have regained their right to vote.\n       State Attorney General Mike Fisher said he will not appeal \n     the court's decision. The newly enfranchised, as everyone \n     else, have until Oct. 10 to register to vote in the November \n     election.\n\n\n                         it's easy to register\n\n       If you didn't vote during the past two federal elections, \n     don't plan to vote on Nov. 4--unless you register to vote.\n       It's easy to register, there's no fee; and you still have \n     time. But not much.\n       Forms are available at the Voter Registration Office at 1 \n     Marketway West, at post offices, municipal buildings, from \n     political activists and at libraries. Or pick up your phone \n     and call the Voter Registration office at 771-9604. They'll \n     mail a form to you.\n       Just make sure the completed form reaches the Voter \n     Registration office by 4:30 p.m. Oct. 10. That's one week \n     from today.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Sept. 21, 2000]\n\n                          A Vote for Fairness\n\n\n               disenfranchising ex-felons was unnecessary\n\n       Goodness, what perils must lie in permitting convicted \n     felons to vote after their release from jail. After all, two-\n     thirds of the 50 states limit or even ban felons for life \n     from the voting booth.\n       Why, convicts might shed their prison blues and rush out to \n     the polls with all manner of wild ideas--like voting for any \n     candidate (should one ever appear) who opposes inhumane \n     prison conditions.\n       Just imagine the deplorable state of democracy if the \n     nearly 4 million people banned from voting now were allowed \n     to fulfill this duty of citizenship, while rebuilding their \n     lives.\n       Yeah, right\n       Disenfranchising felons who served their time is purely a \n     punitive measure. It's surely no deterrent to crime, imagine \n     a thug declining to stick up a convenience store because it \n     might jeopardize his voting rights.\n       One thing a voting ban might deter, though, is a \n     rehabilitated convict from feeling like part of the community \n     of the law-abiding and feeling a greater personal stake in \n     staying part of it.\n       Yet tough-on-crime state lawmakers love to mix voting bans \n     in with their mandatory sentencing statutes and the like. The \n     35 states that prohibit former inmates from voting include \n     Pennsylvania and New Jersey, with Delaware among the 14 with \n     lifetime voting bans.\n       Sadly, the message society conveys with such measure is \n     that we don't much believe in second chances, much less \n     redemption. That's why it's a relief--if likely temporary--to \n     see a Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court judge talk some sense \n     on this subject.\n       In a ruling filed Monday, Judge Joseph T. Doyle ruled \n     unconstitutional the 1995 Pennsylvania law that prohibits \n     convicted felons\n\n[[Page S802]]\n\n     from voting for five years after their release from jail.\n       The ban had ``no rational basis,'' Judge Doyle wrote, since \n     it applied only to felons not registered to vote when jailed. \n     For now, the law is dead. And good riddance.\n       While it might be irresistible for state Attorney General \n     Mike Fisher to appeal, or for Harrisburg lawmakers to attempt \n     constitutional repairs on the law, the best course would be \n     to let the ruling stand. And who knows? Other states might \n     follow that lead.\n       That's the hope of the Philadelphia NAACP, which aided ex-\n     felons suing over the Pennsylvania law. With African \n     Americans comprising a third of those disenfranchised, the \n     voting bans hit black communities especially hard.\n       Losing the right to vote while behind bars is an entirely \n     reasonable punishment, since voting is one hallmark of \n     freedom in a democracy. Once convicts have done their time, \n     though, it's in society's interest that they resume the \n     habits of responsible citizenship--such as voting--as soon as \n     possible.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Apr. 13, 2001]\n\n                        Felons and Voting Rights\n\n       Few would expect to find a photograph of Nevada Sen. Harry \n     Reid in the dictionary of slang next to the phrase ``pretty \n     fly for a white guy.'' Thus, there was some laughter in the \n     audience as Sen. Reid introduced NAACP President Kewisi \n     Mufume to a new conference at the MGM Grand on Monday, \n     asserting, ``He and I are soul brothers.''\n       Both gentlemen spoke of their ongoing efforts to restore \n     voting rights in federal elections to convicted felons after \n     they have served their sentences. Mr. Mfume said felon re-\n     enfranchisement is currently one of the NAACP's top five \n     priorities. Sen. Reid said he was inspired to push for the \n     reform after a Las Vegas mother told Sen. Reid her son can't \n     vote because of a crime committed 30 years ago.\n       The NAACP's involvement with this issue comes as no \n     surprise. Thanks to the drug war, a whopping percentage of \n     young black and Hispanic men will have some kind of serious \n     run-in with the law before they turn 30. The Sentencing \n     Project and Human Rights Watch reveals that 13 percent of all \n     African-American males are prohibited from voting.\n       Even a nonviolent offense can cripple a person's ability to \n     participate in his or her own government for the rest of his \n     or her life--hardly an incentive for good citizenship or \n     involvement in the community.\n       What is the justification for denying people who have paid \n     their debt to society the right to vote? After all, the \n     rights guaranteed by the Constitution are equal, inseparable \n     and take precedence over any subsequent enactments; they are \n     the highest law on the land. Would anyone assert a felon, \n     once released from prison and having successfully completed \n     parole or probation, has no right to attend a church or \n     temple--to exercise his freedom of religion--until those \n     specific rights are restored in writing by some executive \n     order? Of course not.\n       Likewise, no one would consider barring former prisoners \n     from writing books or letters-to-the-editor after their \n     release pending issuance of some document formally \n     ``restoring'' this First Amendment right.\n       This notion that Americans become second class citizens--\n     some of their constitutional rights selectively and \n     permanently impaired--even after they have ``done their \n     time,'' is anathema in a free country, because it accustoms \n     us to a dangerous precedent under which government \n     bureaucrats are empowered to decide which rights shall be \n     ``restored,'' and when.\n       If Sen. Reid and Mr. Mfume can succeed in restoring these \n     federal voting rights . . . more power to them.\n\n  Mr. REID. As I am sure the manager of the bill knows well, the State \nof Connecticut recently voted to guarantee all ex-felons on probation \nthe right to vote.\n  Nonetheless, the amendment Senator Specter and I have crafted is \nnarrow in scope. It does not extend voting rights to prisoners. Some \nStates do that. I don't believe in that. It does not extend voting \nrights to ex-felons on parole, even though 18 States do that. It does \nnot extend voting rights to ex-felons on probation, even though some \nStates do that. This legislation simply restores the right to vote to \nthose individuals who have completely served their sentences, including \nprobation and parole.\n  Finally, this legislation would only apply to Federal elections, but \nit would set an example for the rest of the States to follow what we do \nin Federal elections.\n  Even though we have delegated to the States time, place, and \nauthority, Congress has retained the ultimate authority with ample \nprecedent to set qualifications for Federal elections. We did that with \nmotor-voter registration and others.\n  The revolutionary patriot, Thomas Paine, said: The right of voting \nfor representatives is the primary right by which all other rights are \nprotected. To take away this right is to reduce a man to slavery, for \nslavery consists in being subject to the will of another, and he also \nhas not a vote in the election of representatives in this case.\n  We must do away with Thomas Paine's definition of slavery. People \nshould be able to vote when they have done their time. When Mr. Miner \nof Las Vegas wrote to me about the fact that he could no longer vote \neven though he has been a model citizen for 30 years, I am sure he felt \nand still feels as did Thomas Paine. Those people who called me at KCEP \nradio, know in their heart that something is wrong. They and their \nrelatives and friends have done their time. They have done enough. They \nshould be able to vote.\n  This bipartisan amendment, in many ways is similar to the bipartisan \ncompromise reached by Senators Dodd and McConnell. It does not go as \nfar as some people would like, but it is certainly a giant step in the \nright direction. I hope the Members of this Senate would rally around \nthis amendment and allow it to become law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleague \nfrom Nevada, this is an issue for the States, not the Federal \nGovernment. Voter qualification is generally a power the Constitution \nleaves within the prerogative of the States. The Constitution grants \nStates broad power to determine voter qualification. It is highly \ndoubtful that Congress has constitutional authority to pass legislation \npreempting the states with regard to this issue.\n\n  The Ford/Carter Commission agrees with this assessment. The \nCommission concluded, ``we doubt that Congress has the constitutional \npower to legislate a federal prescription'' on States prohibiting \nfelons from voting.\n  In 1974 the Supreme Court held that convicted felons do not have a \nfundamental right to vote, and that excluding convicted felons from \nvoting does not violate the Constitution. Federal courts have \nconsistently dismissed lawsuits aimed at letting prisoners vote. One \ncourt even concluded that the facial validity of felon voting \nrestrictions may be ``absolute.''\n  Only two States do not impose restrictions on the voting rights of \nfelons. In fourteen States, felons convicted of a crime may lose the \nright to vote for life. Congress should not interpose itself between \nthe States and their people. As the Ford/Carter Commission said in \ntheir report:\n\n       [W]e believe the question of whether felons should lose \n     their right to vote is one that requires a moral judgement by \n     the citizens of each state.\n\n  This proposed amendment frankly, should fail on the merits. When a \nperson is convicted of a felony, that person should lose their right to \nvote. Convicted felons have been denied various privileges granted to \nother citizens going all the way back to ancient Rome and Greece.\n  Voting is a privilege; a privilege properly exercised at the voting \nbooth, not from a prison cell. States have a significant interest in \nreserving the vote for those who have abided by the social contract \nthat forms the foundation of a representative democracy. We are talking \nabout rapists, murderers, robbers, and even terrorists or spies. Do we \nwant to see convicted terrorists who seek to destroy this country \nvoting in elections? Do we want to see convicted spies who cause great \ndamage to this country voting in elections? Do we want to see \n``jailhouse blocs'' banding together to oust sheriffs and government \nofficials who are tough on crime?\n  Those who break our laws should not have a voice in electing those \nwho make and enforce our laws. Those who break our laws should not \ndilute the vote of law-abiding citizens. Fundamentally, Mr. President, \nas a former Governor yourself, this is a decision made in each State by \nthe Governor, as to whether or not to restore the rights of convicted \nfelons. But in any event, it seems to me a Federal prescription in this \narea, just as the Ford/Carter Commission concluded, is not appropriate. \nSo I hope we will not seek to preempt this area of State law in the \ncourse of our action on election reform legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I know also Senator Sessions wishes to speak on this \nissue. I think he will be here shortly. I yield the floor and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S803]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the statement of the Senator from Kentucky \nis very typical of what happens in instances such as this. We have a \nsituation where we have now 36 States that allow felons the right to \nvote in various but limited ways. I went over some of them. This \nlegislation simply is to correct what I believe are some problems in \nthe law.\n  In Federal elections, people who have the same qualifications should \nbe able to vote. As I have said, 36 States already allow ex-felons to \nvote.\n  It is easy to talk about terrorists and rapists and all that. But the \npoint is that people who are convicted of crimes serve time. Sometimes \nthey serve a lifetime. Those people can't vote. Sometimes people serve \n30, 40 years. Sometimes they serve 10 years. Sometimes they are on \nparole for many years. Sometimes they are convicted and they never go \nto jail; they are on probation. Whatever the sentence, they should \nserve it completely. But when they have done so, these people should be \nable to vote.\n  It is easy to incite people, saying this is so terrible. Thirty-six \nStates allow ex-felons to vote right now. Is this such a wave-breaking \nissue?\n  I think it would be a terrible shame if we sent a message to millions \nof people in America today--people such as Mr. Miner, who in the 1960s \ndid something wrong, but has since been a good citizen. We have a lot \nof people who would be better citizens if they could vote.\n  Categories of felons disenfranchised under State law--some States \neven allow people in prison who are felons the right to vote. That is \nthe way it is today. Some States allow people to vote when they are on \nprobation. Some States allow people to vote when they are on parole.\n  I am not doing that. I am saying a person who has completed his \nsentence and has completed his probation and parole should be able to \nvote. So I think it is really out of line for my friend from Kentucky \nto raise all these irrelevant issues, suggesting this is some big new \ndeal that is going to cause problems. My amendment will allow millions \nof people to vote who deserve to vote.\n  It goes without saying that one reason this legislation has not been \nembraced much earlier is that some people are afraid--afraid of unfair \nand irrational statements made such as those by the Senator from \nKentucky. But the fact is all these bad people who are sentenced and \njailed shouldn't be able to vote. I said that. But let us not confuse \nthe issue. Once somebody is out of prison and they have completely \nfinished their parole and probation, let them vote. It's the right \nthing to do.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share some thoughts on \nan issue of some importance, both as it relates to the traditional role \nbetween the States and the Federal Government and with regard to the \nconstitutional role between the Federal and State governments, and then \nsome personal insight into the idea that people who have been convicted \nof felonies in this country should be mandated the right to vote by the \nFederal Government in States that may not agree with that idea.\n  Frankly, people who violate felony laws--this does not include \njuvenile crimes, it does not include traffic offenses, it doesn't \ninclude DUIs, and it doesn't include petty theft and small drug \noffenses. It deals with people who have felony convictions, many of \nwhom have served time in jail. Historically, we have referred to those \npeople as being outside the law or, in short, outlaws. All the way \nthrough the beginning of the United States of America, we have believed \nthat a person who violates serious laws of a State or the Federal \nGovernment forfeits their right to participate in those activities of \nthat government, that their judgement and character is such that they \nought not to be making decisions on the most important issues facing \nour country. Virtually every State in this country takes that position \nto one degree or another.\n\n  As a prosecutor for 15 years, I wonder about how those people I \nhelped put in the slammer feel about me. I do not care about them \nvoting on my election. Would it intimidate or discourage or diminish \nthe ability of judges who run for election? Or would a prosecutor who \nruns for election in some way not be as aggressive? Would it be a \nconcern to them? Would it allow votes to occur against a strong law-\nand-order candidate that might not otherwise occur? I do not know.\n  But, for a lot of reasons, our States have decided they do not want \nto give felons, people who have committed serious offenses in this \nNation, the right to vote. That is a common practice in virtually every \nState in America where they have some restrictions on it.\n  Sometimes what we do in this Chamber is argue about what we have the \npower to do. But the other question is, What ought we to do? I think \nthis Congress, with this little debate we are having on this bill, \nought not to step in and, with a big sledge hammer, smash something we \nhave had from the beginning of this country's foundation--a set of \nelection laws in every State in America--and change those laws. To just \nup and do that is disrespectful to them.\n  At this very moment, in States throughout America, legislatures are \ndiscussing under what circumstances felons should or should not be \nallowed to vote. Some are allowing them to vote in any number of \ndifferent ways, under certain circumstances, based on what crimes they \nmay have committed, how long they served in jail, how long they have \nbeen out of jail, whether or not they seek a pardon and get it, whether \nor not they have been rearrested. Whatever they decide to do, it is \ngoing on in those legislatures.\n  We have not had hearings, to my knowledge, on this subject.\n  I am on the Judiciary Committee, which normally deals with those \nissues. We have not had hearings. We have not had anything but an \namendment appear in this Chamber on this subject. It would be unwise \nfor us to presume, after such a short debate, that we ought to just \noverride the laws in every State in America. We should not do that out \nof respect for them.\n  Most Americans are familiar with President Ford's and President \nCarter's work together on any number of issues--a Republican President \nand a Democratic President. They have had some discussion about these \nissues. They had a commission that dealt with voting issues. They \nconcluded--I will quote from their report--``we doubt that Congress has \nthe Constitutional power to legislate a federal prescription'' on \nStates prohibiting felons from voting.\n  In other words, they doubt that this Congress has the constitutional \npower--not a question of deference or propriety--to do this.\n  That was a bipartisan commission with two of our elder statesmen for \nwhom people in this country have great respect.\n  The Supreme Court, in 1974, specifically held that felons do not have \na fundamental right to vote and that excluding felons from voting does \nnot violate the U.S. Constitution. That is clear law from the Supreme \nCourt of the United States in 1974, and it has not been altered since.\n  Another Federal court has even concluded that the facial validity of \nfelon voting restrictions may be ``absolute.''\n  So there may be one or two States that impose no restrictions on \nvoting, but the overwhelming majority do. And they have given thought \nto it. Each State has different standards based on their moral \nevaluation, their legal evaluation, their public interest in what they \nthink is important in their States. That is what I believe we should \ndo. We should follow that.\n  When we allow a brief moment of debate to alter State historic \nprinciples on issues of complexity such as this, we are really stepping \nbeyond our bounds.\n  I want to stay on the point a little bit about the propriety, about \nthe deference, about the respect this Congress\n\n[[Page S804]]\n\nshould give to States. Yes, there are certain steps we take when we \nbelieve it is in the overwhelming national interest--particularly when \nthere is a need to have uniformity in rules and regulations--to pass \nsome regulation for health or safety, such as for railroad width or \nwhatever we decide to do. Those things are justified.\n  But it ought not to come up with some last-minute vote without in-\ndepth hearings, without hearing from secretaries of States around the \ncountry, without hearing from State legislators who may have voted on \nit last month or may have voted on it last year and discussed these \nvery issues and debated them within their States. And we come in now, \nand we are going to tell them: We do not care what you think. We do not \ncare about your debates. We have not had debate here, but we are going \nto change our mind. We are going to change the law of America. And \nanybody who committed acts of murder, burglaries--whatever they did--\nserious drug offenses, drug dealing, they can all vote now in America.\n  I am not for that. Somebody else may be. That is a good matter to \ndebate. The question is, Where should it be debated? I say it should be \ndebated where it has always been debated: In the States of America. \nThey have set the voting qualifications for our voters, except for \ncertain major requirements that the Constitution places on them and \nFederal law requires. But this should not be an expansion now into this \ncategory of voting. I strongly oppose it. I think it is a big-time \nmistake. It is a rush job. It is disrespectful to the hundreds, \nthousands of State legislators who deal with these issues regularly.\n  We have not had any serious suggestion, to my knowledge, that the \nvoting process is being gummed up over this rule. It seems to be \nworking well. Each State has its own system for identifying felons and \ninforming them that they are not qualified to vote. To change that now \non this bill would be a terrible step. It is something we would regret. \nIf you believe President Ford and President Carter in the commission \nthey established, it would be reversed by the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States as being unconstitutional.\n  When we pass legislation in this Chamber, we have sworn to uphold the \nConstitution. If we have evidence that it is unconstitutional, we ought \nnot to pass it on that basis, also. So as a matter of policy, respect, \nand constitutional law, it ought not to be voted for.\n  Frankly, I do not think the American debate and American policy is \ngoing to be better informed if we have a bunch of felons in this \nprocess as opposed to them not being in this process. That is my 2 \ncents' worth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nsupport of legislation which has been offered by the Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid, and myself. Carefully and narrowly crafted, it would \nauthorize ex-felons who have served any prison sentence--for \nmisdemeanors as well--who have fully served their prison sentence, and \nany parole or probation, to have the right to vote in Federal \nelections.\n  The statistics are that there are only 15 States, and the District of \nColumbia, that have a prohibition limiting all felons from voting. The \nbalance of the 50 States have various provisions that allow ex-convicts \nto vote in a variety of circumstances. Four States--Utah, Vermont, \nMassachusetts, and Maine--even allow felons to vote while they are in \nprison; 14 States, and the District of Columbia, only prohibit felons \nfrom voting when in prison; 32 States prohibit felons from voting while \non probation and/or on parole.\n  This amendment would authorize ex-convicts who have fully paid their \ndebt to society to vote in Federal elections, leaving the matter for \nState elections to be determined by the State.\n  It is my view that this provision would aid ex-convicts in being \nreintegrated into society and would be a fair provision on the basic \nproposition that these people have fully paid their debt to society. I \nsay this with some experience in the field, having been in the \nprosecution line for some 12 years--8 years as district attorney of \nPhiladelphia, and 4 years before that as an assistant district \nattorney. In those positions--especially in my early days as an \nassistant district attorney--having had the opportunity to interview \nmany individuals incarcerated in jail, the first job I received as \nchief of the appeals, pardons, and parole section of the Philadelphia \ndistrict attorney's office was interviewing inmates who were under the \ndeath penalty, where an application had been made for commutation.\n  Candidly, it was quite an experience to go to death row and talk to \nmen and women who were under the death penalty--to talk about the \noffenses for which they had been convicted, talk about what they had \ndone in prison, what they had done by way of trying to rehabilitate \nthemselves, their reasons for believing they were worthy of having the \njudgment of sentence of death changed.\n  In the prosecutor's office, it seemed to me that our criminal justice \nsystem was not directed in the most efficient way at protecting the \npublic, and that would be to provide for life sentences for career \ncriminals. If you found somebody who was a career criminal--by that, I \nmean someone convicted of three or more serious offenses--then they get \na life sentence. If, on the other hand, you deal with everybody else \nwho is going to be released from jail--and that would be especially \njuveniles, but anybody else who is released from jail and comes back \ninto society--there, with the rates of recidivism, repeat offenders, \nsociety is at risk.\n  It seemed to me--and I worked on this while being district attorney \nof Philadelphia, and since in the Senate--we needed to provide what I \ncall realistic rehabilitation. By that, I mean literacy training and \njob training. If we had this division between career criminals, who \ncommit about 70 percent of the crimes, and the other individuals who \nare going to be released into society, and made a real effort at \nrehabilitation with job training and literacy training so they can \nreenter the community, my professional judgment is that we could reduce \nviolent crime in America by some 50 percent.\n  I think giving an ex-convict who has paid his or her debt to society \nthe right to vote would be of significant and material assistance to \nreintegrating that person into society. When somebody comes out of \njail, it is obviously a tough line to make it on the outside, and there \nis a matter of self-worth. There is a matter of where the person stands \nin society, if society says to that individual, You have paid your \ndebt; we want you to come back and be a law-abiding citizen, and one \nfacet of recognition of your having paid your debt to society is that \nyou are restored in your citizenship the right to vote.\n\n  Some have said: What if you are dealing with a rapist? Or what if you \nare dealing with a terrorist? Or what if you are dealing with a \nmurderer? What if you are dealing with somebody who has had a bad \nrecord of violence?\n  The criminal justice system has evaluated that person. That person \nhas gone through a trial, and that person has been adjudicated guilty. \nThat is the verdict. Then there has been a sentence. Sometimes the \nsentence is the death penalty. We are seeing more and more people who \nhave been sentenced to death or for long periods of imprisonment being \nexonerated through DNA tests.\n  Whatever the procedure is, however the person has been adjudicated by \nthe criminal justice system, once that person has served the sentence \nand is out of jail, once that person has served probation or parole, as \nfar as the criminal justice system is concerned, that individual has \npaid his or her debt to society.\n  Having paid the debt to society, which is the common parlance term, \nthat individual owes nothing more to society. That person, I believe, \nought to have the right to vote.\n  The amendment has been crafted so that it covers only Federal \nelections, and I think that is a sensible distinction because the \nCongress of the United States controls voting procedures in Federal \nelections.\n\n[[Page S805]]\n\n  The election reform bill we have before us today is a very \nsignificant bill. It will address the concerns we had after the \nelections in the year 2000 when we had the question of the chads and \nwhat were people's intent to vote, and try to produce an electoral \nsystem which is calibrated and calculated to reflect the intent of the \nvoters when they do vote.\n  The bill also seeks to deal with widespread problems of fraud where \nsome people vote in more than one polling place; some people are not \nentitled to vote. When I was district attorney of Philadelphia, that \nwas a particular problem I had. Philadelphia is a rough, tough city, \nprobably challenged only by Chicago, IL--that might attract the \nattention of the Presiding Officer. Chicago and Philadelphia have had, \nI think, unique problems with voter fraud. As DA, I worked on that a \ngreat deal, and I am glad to see this bill seeks to address that \nproblem.\n  The amendment I am addressing has a specific focus on people who have \npaid their debt to society. It makes sense. I think they are entitled \nto vote, to have their civil rights restored, and it could be very \nsignificant in reintegrating that person into society, saying to that \nperson: You have paid your debt; we recognize you as a law-abiding \ncitizen; you have a duty to remain a law-abiding citizen; we will try \nto assist on the rehabilitation, try to avoid your repeating a crime, a \nrecidivist, and this is reintegration into society.\n  I am pleased to join the distinguished Senator from Nevada as being a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can from this place in the Chamber, I \nextend my appreciation to my friend from Pennsylvania and also \nrecognize the fact that a good part of his professional life was spent \nputting people in jail. He was a very successful prosecutor who sent \nscores of people to prison for long periods of time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may interrupt my distinguished colleague, scores is \na vast understatement. We had 500 homicides a year in Philadelphia. We \nhad some 30,000 cases a year. When I left the DA's position in January \nof 1974, I had 165 assistant DAs. We put people in jail in enormous \nnumbers--robbers, rapists, murderers. I tried a good many of those \ncases myself, 4 years as an assistant DA. I was in the trial courts and \nappellate courts while DA. I prosecuted murder cases and rape cases.\n  The problem of violence in America today is overwhelming. In a city \nlike Philadelphia, it is an overwhelming problem. It is also an \noverwhelming problem in a city like Chicago. I know Las Vegas is a more \nlaw-abiding town, and Reno, NV.\n  We have to tackle head on this problem of violent crime. I would like \nto see us address more of our attention between dividing career \ncriminals, who commit 70 percent of the crimes, and throw away the \nbook--they ought to be in jail for life; I wrote the armed career \ncriminal bill which passed the Senate providing for life sentences for \ncareer criminals caught in possession of a firearm--and the balance of \nrealistic rehabilitation, job training, literacy training, and \nrecognizing them as citizens.\n  I thank my colleague from Nevada for being the originator of this \nidea of giving them the right to vote, to help them be reintegrated.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Pennsylvania, the \nreason I mentioned this, historically he is one of the prosecutors we \nknow about in this country. I say that because the two sponsors of this \nlegislation are not people who are soft on crime. I, personally, as I \nstated earlier today, when I was in the State legislature, introduced \nlegislation to make life without the possibility of parole mean what it \nsays; that if you are sentenced to life without the possibility of \nparole, that is what it should be.\n  I want the record to be spread with the fact that Reid and Specter \nare for tough sentencing. We will do everything we can to put people in \nprison and jail who deserve to be in prison and jail. They should \ncomplete their sentences, but after that has been done and they have \npaid their debt to society, shouldn't they have the right to vote? That \nis what it is all about.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my distinguished colleague from Nevada for those \nkind remarks. It surprised me. When I complimented him earlier, I did \nnot know he was in the Chamber. I would have been just as effusive in \nmy compliments, but to have him on the Republican side and to find him \non the back bench is a surprise.\n  I will be glad to work with Senator Reid on this amendment. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nVirginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2858\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, we are now debating the issue of voting \nrights. Let's put it in perspective. Yesterday evening, an amendment \noffered by Senator Allard of Colorado, which I cosponsored, was \nadopted. It is a very good amendment. It improves and clarifies the \nlaws surrounding voting by those who serve in the military.\n  Senator Allard's amendment is certainly needed. We saw in the 2000 \nelection that some voters in our armed services were not able to \nparticipate or have their votes counted; in effect, not being able to \nvote for their prospective Commander in Chief.\n  The issues we are discussing today are very important, but one of the \nmore important improvements was addressing the needs of our military \nvoters. These are people who honorably serve our country, and we want \nto make sure the votes they cast for their elected officials are \ncounted. Indeed, their service to protect our freedoms should not \ndiminish their rights to participate in representative democracy.\n  Senator Allard's amendment is an effort to make sure those votes are \ncast. Some of the postmark problems make no sense when people are \noverseas and on ships. It also makes sure State and local jurisdictions \nare better informed of performing their important duties in \nadministering elections fairly.\n  All of this recognizes the important role of the localities and the \nStates in making sure the elections are administered fairly and, \nindeed, making sure those who serve overseas can exercise their \nconstitutional right to vote in Federal elections.\n  Who does the Allard amendment apply to? It applies to over 2.7 \nmillion members of the military and their families who are stationed \naway from their home today in service to the people and the principles \nof our Republic.\n  Many of these men and women are residents of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, the birthplace of American liberty and indeed home of the \nfirst legislative body in the western hemisphere which was formed in \n1619, long before this body was formed.\n  I was proud to lend my name and my voice to Senator Allard's \namendment because it ensures that those who serve our country honorably \nand with distinction have their voices heard, not just in Virginia but \nin every State of the Union.\n  We go from protecting those who honorably serve to a debate on this \npending amendment, which advocates undesirable Federal meddling into \nthe so-called voting rights of convicted felons. Indeed, throughout the \nSenate, our colleagues care about people across the spectrum of \nresponsibility, from those citizens who are more responsible to even \nthose who are less responsible.\n  I refer my colleagues to an article recently published in the \nFredericksburg Free Lance-Star on February 5 of this year which deals \nwith the issue of voting rights for felons in Virginia and has been \nmentioned by both its proponents and its opponents. The various States \nhave differing approaches to the restoration of voting rights or any \nrights to those who have been convicted of felonies.\n  Now I will say that in Virginia--before I get to this article--having \nbeen Governor of Virginia, I took the responsibility very seriously \nwhen reviewing the petitions of those who had been convicted of \nfelonies. It struck me in a very interesting way. In the midst of a \ncampaign, I was down in Buchanan County, which is far southwestern \nVirginia. It is on the Kentucky/West Virginia border. It is a coal \ncounty. I was campaigning early in my campaign for Governor at this \ncountry store called Pentley's, which, sadly, has since closed down. At \nany rate, I went in there shaking hands, handing out cards. It was such \na memorable event in that Mrs. Pentley, the lady who ran the store, \nthought it was wonderful\n\n[[Page S806]]\n\nthat a candidate for statewide office actually came to her store, in \nBuchanan County. She said: You are the most famous person who has come \nhere since the guy who invented 10,000 flushes came here, because he \nwas on TV and we did not have enough money at the time to be on TV.\n  As I left that store all charged up because she put my little card \nup, there was a fellow leaning up against the drink machine where the \nice is kept, and he said: I like you. You are a good guy.\n  I said: Well, thank you. I hope you will vote for me.\n  He said: Well, I cannot.\n  I said: Well, why not? Are you not registered?\n  No, I am not registered.\n  I said: Why not?\n  He said: I cannot get registered.\n  I said: Of course you can. What is your excuse? What are you, a \nconvicted felon?\n  He said: Yes.\n  I said: Okay. Well, talk to your friends and neighbors and folks you \nmight influence.\n  With this, I left and I told this story all around Virginia.\n  Fortunately, I was elected by the good people of Virginia to serve as \nGovernor, and I thought it was always important to take the Governor's \noffice to the people, so I said: Let's go back to Pentley's Store and \nthank Mrs. Pentley for all her inspiration. Mrs. Pentley does not know \nhow much I would talk about her.\n  We were in an RV. As we got out of the RV--this was 2 or 3 years \nlater--there was this same fellow who looked as if he had grown some \nteeth and had a nicer shirt, one that did not have a hole in it. He \nsaid: Do you remember me?\n  I said: I sure do. I do remember you. You are looking good today.\n  He said: I voted for you.\n  When you win an election, everyone says they voted for you.\n  I said: I do remember you. You told me you were a convicted felon. I \nknow you could not have voted for me.\n  He said: But I did.\n  I said: What happened? Did Governor Wilder restore your voting \nrights?\n  He said: Yes, he did, and I voted for you.\n  That is a personal story about treating everyone with dignity and \nrespect. Who would have known that Governor Wilder, who is not in the \nsame party I am, would have restored this gentleman's right to vote \nbefore the election and he voted for me?\n  In Virginia, I would look at these situations very seriously, not \njust because of this gentleman in Buchanan County but because those who \npetitioned me would talk about their sacred right to vote.\n  Let's look at how Virginia is compared to other States. Virginia is 1 \nof 10 States that permanently prevent--and this is according to the \nFredericksburg Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg--ex-felons from \nvoting. Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, \nNevada, New Mexico, and Wyoming are others. Maryland cuts it off for \nsecond-time felons. That does not mean their rights can never be \nrestored. Their rights can be restored.\n  In Virginia, this is not an issue of first impression. It is being \ndebated now as it has been for many years. In fact, in 1982, in \nVirginia, there was a referendum asking voters to let the State \nlegislature, rather than the Governor, restore the voting rights of \nfelons. The people of Virginia voted on whether or not to ease this \nprocess, which I will say is fairly cumbersome and it failed by nearly \n300,000 votes.\n  This amendment, if it were to become law, would abrogate the express \nwill of the people of Virginia and also the will of many other States, \nwhether it is by a referendum or by their elected State legislatures.\n  In the Commonwealth of Virginia, the legislature recommended \nstreamlining the petition process for nonviolent felons who did their \ntime, finished probation, and waited another 5 years. It would have \nallowed the local circuit court to restore those rights, taking that \nburden off the Governor.\n  Of course, many ex-felons did get their rights back. There is the \nrecord of my successor, he restored the rights of 210 people during his \n4-year term. That is less than half of what was restored during the \nprevious three administrations. While I was Governor, I restored 459 \nex-felons' rights to vote.\n  The understanding of who is best in a position to administer these \nlaws and determine when ex-felons ought to have their rights restored, \nclearly lies with the States. This amendment, if passed, would preempt \nthe States with regard to this important function.\n  The Ford-Carter Commission agrees with this assessment. The \nCommission concluded: We doubt Congress has the constitutional power to \nlegislate a Federal prescription on States prohibiting felons from \nvoting.\n  Virginia allows ex-felons to petition for restoration of voting \nrights 5 years after they have completed all of their probation or all \nof their parole. If they have been convicted of a drug offense, it is 7 \nyears, because there are people who not only commit crimes, but they \nrepeat crimes. Also, if the offense is related to drugs, you want to \nmake sure they are completely off their addiction to drugs.\n  The things most Governors would look at, regardless of party, is what \nkind of life has the ex-felon led since serving their time? I would \nconsider whether or not they were involved in wholesome community-based \nactivities, or just leading the life of a law-abiding citizen and not \ncommitting any crimes.\n  Governors will want to see what kind of a positive life the person \nhas led since leaving prison. The petitioner would oftentimes write to \nme explaining why they wanted their rights restored. As Governor I \nconsidered that in my assessment of each individual case as well.\n  Another thing missing from this amendment is the issue of restitution \nand court costs. I always looked at restitution and court costs in my \nassessment.\n  In Virginia, I cared a great deal about restitution and court costs. \nWith regard to some of these folks, you would say, well, these are not \nimportant crimes. But embezzlement, to the extent there can be \nrestitution, that is usually ordered by a judge in sentencing. You \nwould want to see if restitution has been made. You would want to see \nif they have paid back their court costs. If it were a robbery or a \nburglary, you would want to see if restitution has been made. There are \ncertain situations where, as a condition of probation or suspension of \na sentence, they want medical costs associated with the rape or \nmalicious wounding to be paid.\n  None of that is in this amendment. It is only probation and the \nparole. But restitution and the payment of court costs ought to be \nconsidered. At least I considered it as Governor.\n  The reason why people want rights restored is interesting. Generally, \nthere are three categories. One is they want to feel like a full-\nfledged citizen again. They have led a good life. They want to be part \nof the community. Some of it was job-related. They have not had their \nrights restored. They wanted their kids to feel better about \nthemselves.\n  A second reason they want to vote is to participate in elections. The \nthird reason, as often as the rest, is to go hunting. When you lose \nyour rights, you lose your right to carry a firearm. I suppose you \ncould throw rocks at deer, but usually people want a shotgun or a rifle \nto go deer or duck hunting.\n  Now the Federal Government in this amendment is saying that the \nStates will have to restore rights, notwithstanding the will of the \npeople, notwithstanding the prerogatives of their duly elected \nrepresentatives in the legislature. For Federal elections only, you \nwill have to allow them to vote.\n  In the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and \nmaybe a few other States, our State elections are different than \nFederal elections. You will need two sets of registration for the State \nelections and local elections. To keep the laws in place in Virginia or \nany other State, there are dual roles for registered voters that would \nbe a cost to the States and localities.\n  In Virginia, where Federal elections do not run at the same time as \nState elections, this is probably not too big of an issue. But imagine \nin the States where Federal elections and State elections are conducted \nat the same time. That is undoubtedly true in over 40 States. There \nwill be two sets of ballots for people to use when they vote. If\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\nthey want to keep their rights and prerogatives and reflect the desires \nof the people of their State, two ballots will be needed. When you have \nFederal and State elections, there are names of Presidential \ncandidates, candidates for Congress, maybe the Senate, along with State \nlegislators, Governor, Lieutenant Governor, whoever else is being \nelected. We will need a separate ballot for those who have the right to \nvote in State and Federal, and a separate ballot for those only in \nFederal elections. In effect, what we would need at the polling place \nis a separate voting booth.\n  I guess we would have an ex-felon voting booth where they would only \nvote in Federal elections, while the vast majority of the other voters \nwould vote in the others.\n  This causes a great deal of unnecessary cost and imposes many \nimpractical problems on the State. The goal of the bill is to help \nvoting fairness in the States, respecting the rights of States, not \nputting on unfounded mandates as has been done previously. This \namendment will cause consternation and confusion.\n  Most importantly, understanding the basic jurisdiction, I object to \nthis amendment in that it usurps the rights of the States. It usurps \nand preempts and dictates contrary to the will of the people not only \nof the Commonwealth of Virginia but it exceeds the scope and breadth of \nwhat the Federal Government should be involved in.\n  I hope my colleagues will allow this issue to be properly debated in \nthe way the framers of our Constitution thought it should be debated \nand decided. That is, in the State legislatures, as opposed to meddling \nfrom the Federal Government.\n  We care about the voting of military personnel overseas. I don't see \nwhere we have any business meddling in trying to get ex-felons the \nright to vote.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I missed part of the Senator's remarks. \nI ask the Senator from Virginia, I believe he raised the issue, how \nthis would work in a year in which there were both Federal candidates \non the ballot and State candidates on the ballot. Did the Senator from \nVirginia discuss that issue?\n  I am having a hard time figuring out how it could possibly work. Does \nthe Senator from Virginia have any thought about that?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to the Senator from Kentucky, my good friend from \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky, born in Virginia, formerly a part of the \nCommonwealth of Virginia and voluntarily seceded, as well as the \nPresident's State of Indiana, regardless, the States, for a variety of \nreasons, have State elections different from Federal elections. So not \nto have undue Federal influence or national issues affecting issues \nthat matter most to people in those communities and localities, you \nwould still have a problem. Over 40 States run Federal elections at the \nsame time as they run State and local or perhaps even municipal \nelections.\n  In the event that the people in the States who are perfectly capable \nof debating and deciding this issue as they see fit for people who have \nraped, murdered, robbed, or maliciously wounded individuals in their \nStates and been convicted in their State courts. In the event they want \nto keep their law in effect, what will have to happen is you will have \nto have a role of registered voters for Federal elections only and a \nrole of voters who are registered for all elections.\n  Then when you go into that election, assuming the States--once you \nactually conduct the election on election day--want to keep their rules \nwhere restitution is important, in a period of years to show they are \nleading a good life. Whatever the reasons, they want to do what they \nthink is right, as opposed to what people in Washington think is right \nfor them. Assuming they want to do it, you have to have a separate \nvoting booth. The ballots in those States, where you have Federal and \nState elections the same year, all the names on there--Members of \nCongress, a President in Presidential year, as well as, the Governor, \nState representatives, and so forth--so you will need a separate voting \nbooth.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So it will be a voting booth for felons?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Ex-felons. I don't think the proponents want to go so far \nas felons but ex-felons, which would be, I think, a nightmare and \ninsulting, as well.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Whereas under the current system, is it not true, I \nask the Senator and former Governor, there is a procedure for getting \nthe rights restored, which many people who have served their time go \nthrough, and is it not typically the case that Governors review those \nand restore rights from time to time based upon the record?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, and I \nexpect the President may have done this, as well when he served as \nGovernor of Indiana, as Governor, at least in our State, you get many \npetitions. Some are to restore rights, and also some to say that they \nnever committed a crime and they want an absolute pardon.\n  Every Governor has a conscience to do his or her duty properly. Those \ngovernors have the record of the individual telling what he or she has \ndone since the time of serving.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is true in every State there is an opportunity for \nsomeone who has served their time to get those rights restored?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Through a petition.\n  Mr. ALLEN. In some States, it is not by the Governor. In Virginia, \nthey amended the laws, and nonviolent felons can go to the circuit \ncourt for petitioning to have their rights restored.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There is a procedure, so it is not hopeless.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Absolutely, there is a procedure.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is not a hopeless situation.\n  Mr. ALLEN. It is not a hopeless situation. Sometimes it can be \ncumbersome, and it is time consuming for the Governor as well as those \nin the Secretary of the Commonwealth's office, the attorney general's \noffice, the Governor's staff and others to assemble this information, \nand also for the petitioner, as well.\n  That is part of the price one pays when they commit a felony and they \nare convicted beyond a reasonable doubt by a judge and a jury of that \ncrime. This is one of the many rights one gives up. I heard this being \ncompared to slavery. It is not like slavery. Slavery is wrong and the \nworst thing that has ever occurred in this country. It is a willful \nact. Many of the felony cases were vile, premeditated, deliberate acts \nto commit a felony--not a misdemeanor, a felony--and this is one of the \nprices and penalties that one pays. A person loses their liberty, \nobviously, while incarcerated. To get all of their liberties and rights \nback, they have to demonstrate good behavior. In each State, that \ndemonstration may be slightly different.\n  But these are State laws being violated. It is a proper role of the \npeople in the States to determine when these rights should be restored, \nas well as, under what conditions and circumstances the rights are \nrestored.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, as a former Governor, for adding his unique perspective on \nthat. I say unique; there are other Governors who have had similar \nexperiences, but I think that does help us understand what I hope will \nbe the conclusion on this amendment. I know it is well intentioned, but \nit seems to me it should be defeated. I thank the Senator from Virginia \nfor his support and contribution to this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I think we are about to vote on this \namendment. I believe the Senator from Nevada is going to ask for a \nrecorded vote.\n  I happen to agree with the thrust of the amendment of my dear friend, \noffered with the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter. When people \nhave paid their dues to society, they have completed their probation \nand whatever else is required of them, the restoration of their rights \nis something we ought to embrace and encourage. I think it may \ncontribute, in fact, to the rehabilitation of people who may otherwise \nbecome recidivists and rejoin the criminal element.\n  The fact that 36 States have already, to one degree or another, \nembraced that concept, some more so than others, is an indication of \nthe direction in which the country is clearly heading\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\nwhen it comes to how we treat former felons, even those who commit \ncrimes that are highly objectionable, to put it mildly, to any average \ncitizen of the country.\n  I have made an appeal to my good friend from Nevada. We have worked \nvery hard on this bill. One of the features of this bill that I like, \noffered by my friend and colleague from Kentucky, is the establishment \nof a permanent commission on elections. We do not attempt to resolve \nevery issue in the election lexicon in this bill. I know there are, \namong my colleagues, some who feel strongly about having a holiday for \nelection day. Others would like to see election day occur on a weekend. \nThere are good arguments. Some would like to just keep it as it is. We \ndo not attempt, in this bill, to deal with that.\n  It seems to me we have taken on a lot with this bill. To try to move \nthe process forward I am, therefore, going to urge colleagues, under \nthis circumstance, to put this issue aside for another day.\n  I urge that the commission itself take a look at the very provisions \nthe Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Pennsylvania have raised; \nthat is, how we might do a better job of restoring the rights of people \nwho have paid their dues to society.\n  I will be very blunt with my colleagues. My fear is that the adoption \nof this amendment would provide those who do not like what we have done \non all the other parts of the bill a justification for undermining the \nsignificant improvements in the election laws of our country. Again, 36 \nStates are moving in that direction; 14 are not doing anything. Some \nStates still make it rather difficult. But it seems to me the trend \nlines are pretty good for moving in that direction.\n  My fear is, as I say, from a purely rhetorical standpoint, that I can \nhear the arguments of people who do not like the minimum standards on \nprovisional voting, statewide voter registration, dealing with access \nfor the disabled community, the right to review your ballot when \novervotes occur, establishment of the commission, dealing with some of \nthese other broad provisions. These are major accomplishments and ones \nI know my friend from Nevada thoroughly endorses.\n  So I am in a very awkward position because I am attracted to the \nthrust of what he wants to do, with Senator Specter. But my fear is, if \nthis were to be adopted on this bill it would make it very difficult \nfor my friend from Kentucky and I and others to convince people who \nmight otherwise vote for the bill to do so.\n  With that expression of my thoughts, I will oppose the Reid \namendment--not because I disagree with what he is trying to do, but I \nthink this is not the right place for us to be dealing with that idea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to support the felony voter \nre-enfranchisement amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from \nNevada, Senator Reid.\n  The American people have long recognized voting and participating in \nelections as one of our greatest rights and responsibilities as \ncitizens. Over the course of our Nation's history many Americans have \nstruggled for this right. African Americans, women, the uneducated, and \nthe poor have all, at some time or another, been excluded from the \nvoting population. Our Nation looks back at these dark times in our \nhistory with great embarrassment. All of these groups are now included \nin our country's great democratic process. But we continue to exclude \none other group of American citizens--rehabilitated felons.\n  In 13 States, a felony conviction can result in disenfranchisement \nfor life. Other States have procedures by which a rehabilitated felon \ncan regain his right to vote. Those procedures, however, often have \nmany hurdles. Several States require a pardon before a person who has \nserved his or her sentence is able to regain the right to vote. Many \nformer felons do not have the financial, legal, or educational \nabilities to pursue the restoration of their rights.\n  It is time to eliminate this disparity and to ensure equality in \nfelony voter laws. It is time to create a level playing field so that \npeople who serve their time for felony convictions can regain their \nright to vote in Federal elections. Senator Reid's amendment would re-\nestablish this fundamental right for persons who have fully served \ntheir time in prison, and who have completed their probation or parole. \nSenator Reid's amendment would appropriately restore this basic right \nof citizenship to those who have paid their debt to society.\n  According to the Americans for Democratic Action Education Fund, an \nestimated 4.2 million Americans, or 1 in 50 adults, have currently or \npermanently lost their voting rights as a result of a felony \nconviction. A majority of these Americans are no longer incarcerated. \nOne million four hundred thousand Americans are ex-offenders who have \nfully completed their sentences. Another 1.5 million of the \ndisenfranchised are on parole or probation. Only 1.2 million of the \ndisenfranchised are actually still serving their sentences. With the \nincreasing number of persons who are entering our criminal justice \nsystem, the number of disenfranchised voters is growing as well.\n  There are many reasons why this amendment makes sense. Over 95 \npercent of prisoners will return to our communities after serving their \nsentences. We return rehabilitated felons to our communities because \nAmericans expect that they will reintegrate themselves as productive \ncitizens. Yet, without the right to vote, rehabilitated felons are \nalready a step behind in regaining a sense of civic responsibility and \ncommitment to their communities. If we want rehabilitated felons to \nsucceed at becoming better citizens, who both abide by the law and act \nas responsible individuals, then our country needs to restore this most \nfundamental right.\n  State disenfranchisement laws also disproportionately impact ethnic \nminorities. Approximately 13 percent of the African-American adult male \npopulation is disenfranchised. This reflects a rate of \ndisenfranchisement that is seven times the national average. More then \none-third, 36 percent, of the total disenfranchised population are \nAfrican-American males. In 10 States, more than 1 in 5 black men are \ncurrently disenfranchised. As a result of the current rates of felony \nconvictions and incarceration, it is estimated that in the next \ngeneration of black men, 30 to 40 percent will lose the right to vote \nfor some or all of their adult lives. Thirty to forty percent. That is \nboth an astonishing and deeply troubling figure. Constitutional \nprinciples of fundamental fairness and equal protection require us to \naddress this discrepancy.\n  Denying the right to vote should not be a continued punishment for \npeople who have served their sentences. When people are convicted and \nsentenced for felony crimes, they are expected to serve their time. The \ndisenfranchisement of felons who have completed their court-imposed \nsentence serves only as a continuing punitive measure.\n  Given the importance to our democracy of an actively participating \ncitizenry, it should be of great concern to our country that so many \ncitizens are losing one of their most basic rights as Americans: the \nright to participate in our political process. Rehabilitated felons, \nwho have served their sentences to completion and have paid their debt \nto society, should be able to exercise this right. Basic constitutional \nprinciples of fundamental fairness and equal protection require an \nequal opportunity for United States citizens to vote in Federal \nelections. Felony disenfranchisement laws that deny the right to vote \nto people who have served their sentences run counter to these \nprinciples. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Reid's amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is no one in the Chamber--not only in \nthe Chamber, in the Senate--for whom I have more respect than the \nSenator from Connecticut, but I must disagree with my friend. We are \nasking people who deserve the right to vote to wait. They have been \nwaiting for too long.\n  As Thomas Paine said:\n\n       The right of voting for representatives is a primary right \n     by which all other rights are protected. To take away this \n     right is to reduce this man to slavery for slavery consists \n     of being subject to the will of another, and he who has not a \n     vote in the election of representatives is in this case.\n\n  Sure, 36 States have done something. But how many of the people who \ncalled me on KCEP radio can go to a circuit judge and get their right \nto vote? How many can obtain a pardon from the Governor or the \nPresident? Very, very\n\n[[Page S809]]\n\nfew. Does this mean that everything that is not in this bill is going \nto kill the bill? I think it is really a shame that someone who has \nbeen convicted of a crime, who has served the sentence, whether 1 year \nor 100 years, after that person gets out he can't vote.\n  This affects millions of people. Who is affected more than anyone \nelse? Minorities. Unfair practices have been established in many \nStates, most of the time, making it extremely difficult if not \nimpossible for these people to vote. In a Federal election in the \ngreatest country in the world, what are we trying to prove?\n  I had a letter printed in the Record earlier today, and I could enter \nin the Record scores of these letters. This is a communication from a \nman in Las Vegas who was convicted of a crime in the 1960s. He makes a \nlot of money now. He wants to be able to vote. He can't vote because he \nwas convicted of a crime when he was a young man.\n  With all due respect to my friend from Connecticut, he is going to \noppose this legislation because it is going to affect this bill? This \nwill improve the bill.\n  I have been approached by several people today, and in the past--\nmembers of my staff, other Senators--saying: Don't have us vote on \nthis. It is a tough vote.\n  Sure it is a tough vote. We vote easy all the time around here. We \nhave very few tough votes. Let's have a tough vote.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2879. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico Mr. \nDomenici), the Senator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), the Senator from \nColorado (Mr. Campbell), the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Smith), the \nSenator from Alaska (Mr. Stevens), and the Senator from Utah (Mr. \nHatch) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 31, nays 63, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 31 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--31\n\n     Akaka\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--63\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                            NOT VOTING --- 6\n\n     Bennett\n     Campbell\n     Domenici\n     Hatch\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n  The amendment (No. 2879) was rejected.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, again, I will request of Members who have \namendments to come and talk to staff. I understand the Senator from \nArizona has an amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I believe the junior Senator from \nArizona is here and he has an amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the next amendment be the one \noffered by the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me urge Members to come over and to \nplease speak with the staffs, Senator McConnell's and mine. Many of the \namendments are just technical in nature, and we can move this bill \nalong. Some will require votes. But if we can at least get the numbers \ndown pretty quickly, there is no reason we can't deal with the \noverwhelming majority of the amendments that look to be fairly \nstraightforward and acceptable. Some are actually duplicates, where \nthey have offered the same idea with slight variations. Perhaps we can \ncombine them and reduce the number.\n  Hope springs eternal, Mr. President, that we might actually get this \nbill done. I realize that may get harder as the afternoon wears on. I \nurge Members, if they have amendments, don't wait until 5 or 6 o'clock \nto come over. Bring them over and we will try to clear them or work \nthem out and accept them. If we can't, we will try to arrange for a \ntime for you to consider the amendment and vote on it.\n  My colleague from Arizona is ready.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2891\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2891.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To permit the use of social security numbers for the purposes \n           of voter registration and election administration)\n\n       On page 68, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. USE OF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS FOR VOTER \n                   REGISTRATION AND ELECTION ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       Section 205(c)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     405(c)(2)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(I)(i) It is the policy of the United States that any \n     State (or political subdivision thereof) may, in the \n     administration of any voter registration or other election \n     law, use the social security account numbers issued by the \n     Commissioner of Social Security for the purpose of \n     establishing the identification of individuals affected by \n     such law, and may require any individual who is, or appears \n     to be, so affected to furnish to such State (or political \n     subdivision thereof) or any agency thereof having \n     administrative responsibility for the law involved, the \n     social security account number (or numbers, if such \n     individual has more than one such number) issued to such \n     individual by the Commissioner of Social Security.\n       ``(ii) For purposes of clause (i), an agency of a State (or \n     political subdivision thereof) charged with the \n     administration of any voter registration or other election \n     law that did not use the social security account number for \n     identification under a law or regulation adopted before \n     January 1, 2002, may require an individual to disclose his or \n     her social security number to such agency solely for the \n     purpose of administering the laws referred to in such clause.\n       ``(iii) If, and to the extent that, any provision of \n     Federal law enacted before the date of enactment of the Equal \n     Protection of Voting Rights Act of 2002 is inconsistent with \n     the policy set forth in clause (i), such provision shall, on \n     and after the date of the enactment of such Act, be null, \n     void, and of no effect.''.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2892 to Amendment No. 2891\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \nKyl amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2892 to amendment No. 2891.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To permit the use of social security numbers for the purposes \n           of voter registration and election administration)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n       (b) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed \n     to supersede any privacy guarantee under any Federal or State \n     law that applies with respect to a social security number.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am aware of the second-degree amendment. I \nwill speak to it in a moment. I want to describe this amendment. It is \nvery\n\n[[Page S810]]\n\nstraightforward. It authorizes--it does not mandate--that Social \nSecurity numbers may be used by States to validate voter registration. \nI believe that there are currently seven States that do this. Because \nof the way the Privacy Act was enacted several years ago, those States \nwere grandfathered. Other States don't have that ability. This would \nprovide that ability. It can prevent duplication and fraud.\n  Current law allows State officials access to a person's Social \nSecurity number for a variety of identification-related purposes. We \nare all familiar with that. This would simply add to that list of items \nverification for voter registration purposes.\n  The amendment is important to resolving a widespread problem in \nelection administration which is, of course, the problem of verifying \nthe identity of the person registered to vote. While the Social \nSecurity number is not an absolute guarantee, it is deemed to be good \nenough for a variety of other purposes for which we need \nidentification, and it would provide a much more accurate voter \nidentification, which, of course, is key to an honest and fair \nelection.\n  We all know that the rationale for that most sacred of our democratic \nrights, the right to vote, is that our vote counts 100 percent, that it \nis not diluted by virtue of other people's votes that were cast \nfraudulently, diluting that 100 percent vote that we have. So we want \nto make sure there is not fraud in the election process--that people \nwho should not be voting, in fact, are not permitted to vote. That is \nwhy validating the registration with the Social Security number is \nimportant.\n  This is a unique number that is issued by the U.S. Government, which \nis precisely why the Federal, State, and local governments use the \nSocial Security number to identify individuals for a variety of \nprograms and services. I will remind my colleagues of what some of \nthese are. While they are all important, I submit that none is more \nimportant than our sacred right to vote. If you want to check into a \nVeterans Administration hospital, you have to show your Social Security \nnumber. If you want to receive food stamps, you must show it. In many \nStates, you need to show it to apply for a driver's license and \nregister a motor vehicle. Certainly, you need your Social Security \nnumber to register for the draft and to register for Medicaid. You need \nit to apply for a student loan and to donate blood. You need it to \nreceive unemployment compensation. You need it to apply for a passport \nor a green card. You need it to purchase certain U.S. savings bonds. \nYou need it to apply for Federal crop insurance. Many States require \nthis to apply for professional licenses. One that I found interesting \nis, if you are a boxer seeking to register with the State boxing \ncommission, you have to show your Social Security number. These are \nsome of the countless ways in which governments have ensured the \nidentity of people by requiring validation through their Social \nSecurity number.\n  As I said, while the integrity of these processes is very important, \nI don't think we would argue that any is more important than \nmaintaining the integrity of our sacred right to vote. If the election \nofficials can positively identify the voter with a Social Security \nnumber, then two protections are codified: First, the integrity of the \nelection is protected because duplicate registrations can be removed. \nSecondly, full access to the election by all of those registered is \nensured.\n\n  I will repeat that because this will be very important to my friends \non the other side. Social Security number verification will help \nprevent the wrong person from being removed from voter lists when those \nlists are checked against felony citizenship records.\n  Without the certainty Social Security numbers provide, election \nofficials have no foolproof way to differentiate among voters with same \nor similar numbers.\n  As a means of voter identification, this has been approved by Federal \ncourts. Current law provides an element of protection against the \npublic disclosure of those Social Security numbers. The second-degree \namendment of the Senator from Kentucky is a further guarantee of that \nprivacy protection. Frankly, I support the Senator's amendment because \nwe don't want there to be any doubt that privacy is protected here, \nthat those numbers cannot be disclosed other than for this purpose. \nThis amendment restates those guarantees. The second-degree amendment \nwill restate it a second time in a more specific way.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If the Senator will yield for a question, this is not a \nmandate. States could use Social Security numbers as a means of \nidentification. Could a State, under the ambit of this amendment, \nrequire that it be a Social Security number? In other words, I don't \nknow about the privacy parts of it yet. But the crux of it is I want to \nmake the right to vote as broad as possible, as unencumbered as \npossible. So adding another way that people could choose to identify \nthemselves is fine but if some State, under the ambit of this law, said \nyou must have a Social Security number, or if you have one, only these \nthree ways of identification are allowed, that might be restrictive.\n  I guess the question is--I understand it is voluntary within the \nState; the State doesn't have to use the Social Security number--but \nwhat about the other side? Could the State require the Social Security \nnumber as a means of identification?\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the answer to that question is yes. There are \nseven States that currently do this. This would simply authorize other \nStates to do the same.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I may elaborate so I get this clear, so under this \namendment a State could say you must identify yourself by a Social \nSecurity number; other means of identification would not work?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New York, that is \ncorrect. This is for voter registration, I want to reiterate that.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I understand. I thank the Senator for his direct and \ncandid insight.\n  Mr. KYL. I point out there are cases--in fact, one case in the \nVirginia system was invalidated because it did not provide adequate \nprotection in the use of these Social Security numbers. Clearly, our \nauthorization of this does not put a stamp of approval on any \nparticular system. It is going to have to withstand any kind of \njudicial or legal attack that it is too restrictive, that it does not \ncontain adequate protections, the number itself or any other number of \nchallenges that might be issued.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me continue. Incidentally, if there are \nany concerns along those lines my colleagues would like to address, I \nam happy to work with them on it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Certainly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I was listening to what he said. I do \nnot know if the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, has left the \nChamber or not. I think the Senator said also it prevents people from \nbeing wrongfully removed from a list. I hope the Senator from New York, \nwho obviously is concerned about the broader franchise, listened \ncarefully to what the Senator from Arizona had to say: that it would \nalso prevent wrongful removal. Did I hear that correctly?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, to the Senator from Kentucky, that is exactly \ncorrect. I tried to repeat myself. I noticed there was conversation \ngoing on, so I am not sure my colleagues did pick up on that. \nObviously, that can be used for any of the legitimate purposes for \nregistration, including preventing wrongful removal. It is a good voter \nprotection. I am not sure we need to talk a lot more about it. I am \nhappy to do that if my colleagues would like.\n  To reiterate, it is voluntary, not mandatory. It allows for use of \nSocial Security numbers as one additional element of which the States \ncould take advantage. It does have a privacy protection, but with the \nsecond-degree amendment of the Senator from Kentucky, it provides an \nadditional element of privacy protection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. NELSON of Nebraska). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we will take a further look at the amendment \nand discuss this with the Senator from Arizona.\n  Let me raise the concern my colleague from New York has already \nexpressed. Senator Bond said it; he really gets credit for coining this \nphrase. Others of us have repeated this over the\n\n[[Page S811]]\n\nlast number of months. And that is, what we are trying to achieve with \nthis bill is to make it as easy as possible for people to cast a ballot \nin America, to exercise their most fundamental right, and \nsimultaneously make it hard to cheat the system.\n\n  My concern with the amendment of the Senator from Arizona is that it \ncould set up a situation where, while it is protecting a voter, to some \ndegree, from being unceremoniously denied the right to vote, it could \nmake it much harder for that individual to actually register to vote \nbecause a State may decide that this is the only way you can register \nto vote.\n  There are literally millions of people in this country who do not \nhave a Social Security card. If that were the case, they could be \ndenied in that State the opportunity to register. I do not think any of \nus want to do that.\n  I understand if they make this one of the criteria, but we could have \nother criteria. That would be one set of circumstances. But as the \nSenator from Arizona very candidly--and I appreciate it--said in \nresponse to the Senator from New York when asked the question, Could a \nState then mandate this is the only criterion? we would then create a \nhurdle while we are trying to diminish the hurdles as much as possible.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if the Senator understood me to say a State \ncould mandate this as the only method of identification, that is not \ncorrect. If I said that, I certainly did not mean to say it. It is not \ncorrect.\n  Let me again read the language because it is very important. If you \ndo not have a Social Security number, they cannot force you to present \na Social Security number as the means of identification. The language \nof the amendment that ``the Social Security account number issued to \nsuch individual by the Commissioner of Social Security. . . .''\n  If you do not have a Social Security number issued, there is nothing \nin the amendment that authorizes the State to require you to have one, \nand there is nothing in the amendment that authorizes the State to \nmandate as the only method of identification the presentation of a \nSocial Security number.\n  If I may reiterate what I thought the Senator from New York was \nasking--perhaps I misunderstood--it was, Can a State mandate that an \nindividual must present a Social Security number for his registration \nvalidation? And the answer to that is, a State could pass a law that \nused the Social Security requirement for voter registration. But would \nthat mean they could require somebody who does not have a Social \nSecurity card to present one? Not under the wording in the amendment.\n  Does it say it is the only way you can validate your identification? \nAbsolutely not; that is not what this says.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator--I guess the Senator from Connecticut \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. May I ask the Senator from Arizona a question. I am \npersonally reading the amendment for the first time. It does not seem \nto say actually yes or no. I understand what the Senator from Arizona \npointed out, but that just talks about presenting the Social Security \ncard if you have it.\n  If the intent of the Senator from Arizona is not to allow a Social \nSecurity number to be considered the only way to identify yourself but, \nrather, be an additional way then maybe we can make sure the language \nis clear about that, and that will help the amendment.\n  If that is acceptable to the Senator from Arizona, I will be happy to \nwork with him, the Senator from Connecticut, and the Senator from \nKentucky to try to make that happen.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Connecticut has the \nfloor. I am happy to sit down and work out additional language right \nnow, discuss it further, or go on to other business. I am not sure what \nthe pleasure of the bill managers is. I am willing to dispose of this \nas quickly as we can.\n\n  Mr. DODD. We are not going to be able to have recorded votes until \nafter 2 o'clock because of the conference lunches. I suggest we lay it \naside temporarily and see if there are amendments to be offered and try \nto work out language that may make this an acceptable amendment.\n  The Senator understands the problem. He identified the problem area \nfor us. My suggestion to the Senator from Kentucky is to try to do \nthat.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think temporarily laying aside the \nKyl amendment is a good idea. I ask unanimous consent that the Kyl \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. We have \nto round up another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am holding this loose-leaf binder in my \nhand. These are all amendments that various Members have suggested they \nwould like to offer. Many of them I think we can accept, but I cannot \naccept them if they do not come over and offer them. So I am making an \nappeal. We have an hour when we are not going to be able to vote \nbecause of the lunches that are occurring, but if there are Members who \nwould like to be heard on this bill, I am urging them to please come \nover and offer their amendments. We cannot vote on it right away, but \nthey can explain the amendment. They can submit it. We could lay it \naside and go through a number of these and then try to work them out, \neither accept them or set up the time for recorded votes or vote on \nthem, but we cannot get through the bill if we lose an hour or so \nsitting in a quorum call.\n  I appeal to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come to the \nChamber and offer their amendments if they have gone to the extent of \ndrafting an amendment and going to legislative counsel. Many of the \namendments are very good ideas and I think would strengthen and make \nthis a better bill, but I need to have them offered.\n  So as I am sitting in the Chamber, I will wait for Senators to take \nthe time and come over in the next few minutes and we will consider \ntheir proposals.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, what is the current state of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendments, McConnell and Kyl, \nhave been laid aside.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes \non the pending bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the 2000 Presidential election \ndemonstrated the need to improve the instruments of voting and the \nmeans of electing our Federal officeholders. Protecting and enhancing \nthis basic right to vote fairly, clearly, and easily is both critical \nand necessary.\n  Early last year, Senator Schumer, Senator Torricelli, Senator \nMcConnell, and I worked on a compromise bill to observe three key \nobjectives: Respect for the primary role of the States and localities \nin election administration; second, establishing an independent, \nbipartisan commission appointed by the President to provide nonpartisan \nelection assistance to the States; third, to enforce strong antifraud \nprovisions.\n  Supporting this bipartisan effort was a diverse group of \norganizations, such as Common Cause and League of Women Voters, because \nthe issue is bipartisan. In crafting the compromise bill, we were \nmindful of the fact that both rural and urban areas have unique \ndifficulties not only with accessibility but funding improvements to \ntheir voting systems. Heavily rural States such as mine or that of the \nPresiding Officer have issues relating to voting procedures that are \ndifferent than those faced by large urban areas. For this reason, any \ncompromise effort must not impose an unfunded election mandate upon the \nStates or, in the alternative, give State flexibility to determine how \nit can use the funds.\n\n[[Page S812]]\n\n  I am quite pleased that the chairman and the ranking members of the \nRules Committee were able to preserve all three of the elements in the \nsubstitute to S. 565. I think the Dodd-McConnell Bill is a thoughtful, \nbipartisan attempt to provide grant moneys to States to implement \nalternative means and instruments of voting that provide swifter and \nmore accurate results and are less susceptible to partisan interference \nand difference of opinion.\n\n  However, I continue to have concerns regarding the degree to which \nStates are given enough flexibility to implement the changes they \nbelieve are best for them. I look forward to working on an agreement \nthat will accommodate reasonable changes in this respect.\n  As I think a number of people have noted in speaking on this issue, \nthere is a lot of difference between a large urban area and a rural \narea. In rural areas in my State, some of the voting is done far \ndifferently from the urban areas, but they are able to do it quickly \nand accurately. We need to work to make sure we provide options to \nlocalities to be able to implement this in a way that is most useful to \nthem.\n  Under the legislation, a new election administration commission will \nbe established, composed of four Members recommended by the Senate \nmajority leader, the Senate minority leader, the House Speaker, and the \nHouse minority leader. This commission will begin implementation of new \nvoting requirements starting in 2006. These requirements will permit \nvoters to verify their ballot choice and correct errors before ballots \nare cast, and allow notification to voters if there is more than one \nchoice made on ballots, among others.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes $3.5 billion for grant and matching \nprograms to allow States and localities to meet the voting requirements \nunder the bill. The grants will be administered by the Attorney General \nin consultation with the FEC, until the new election commission is \noperating.\n  The grants will be used to buy new voting equipment, train poll \nworkers, implement various other recommendations, or make other \nimprovements approved by the commission. In order to receive funding, \nStates and localities will have to demonstrate compliance with the \nVoting Rights Act and other civil rights laws, institute provisional \nballoting and other safeguards to assure accuracy during the transition \nto new systems, establish poll worker training, voter education \nprograms, provide disabled voters with the opportunity to vote under \nthe same conditions of privacy and independence as the nondisabled.\n  Again, however, I must mention a concern I have for rural States such \nas mine, Kansas, and the Presiding Officer's, Nebraska, that would be \nat a disadvantage under a competitive bidding process as is \ncontemplated in the Dodd-McConnell bill. I hope a formula process can \nbe worked out that will make the grant-making process fairer for rural \nStates such as my own.\n  I am pleased to see one of our key requirements was adopted by the \nSenate that assures all military and overseas votes are counted. I \nbelieve this is important legislation that will instill confidence in \nour voting system. Not only should we do everything possible to ensure \nthat every qualified American is able to vote, but that we are able to \ndo so with certainty, accuracy, and confidence.\n  Again, I commend the chairman and the ranking member for their \ntireless efforts in regard to this bill. I am hopeful we can get \nthrough a good, bipartisan piece of legislation that will improve our \nability to vote in this country, will shorten the timespan for us to \nget an accurate vote taken. Clearly, in this age where we have rockets \ngoing all sorts of places in outer space, surely we can find a way to \ncount votes quickly and accurately. This bill will help move us forward \nin that regard.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Nevada, \nMr. Reid, and myself are cosponsoring an amendment that I think will be \nagreed to because it is merely a study. Our hope is to try to change \nthe day the elections are, so as to really promote campaign reform\n  In my experience over the years, the first Tuesday after the first \nMonday in November is just an arbitrary choice of the middle of the \nweek, whereby we have less than half of our electorate actually \nparticipating.\n  For industrialized countries, you might say we have the least. The \nonly other countries I have been able to find that have a middle-of-\nthe-week election day are the Dominican Republic and Belize. The \nindustrialized countries all have far greater participation by the \nelectorate.\n  Right to the point, it is really inconvenient to hold an election on \na workday. It is not a holiday. People come early in the morning, \nbefore going to work, and already there is a long line. So they leave, \nand the next thing you know they go to work and say they couldn't get \noff in time at night to go and vote.\n  The Senator from Nevada and I are convinced we can select a better \nday. We all thought, of course, of Saturday. But our religious friends \nwho do not participate in civic activities on a Saturday would have \nsome misgiving about that particular selection. Similarly, people would \nhave misgivings with respect to the selection of a Sunday, which is the \nday used in many industrialized countries.\n  The bottom line is, I think perhaps Veterans Day, which is already a \nholiday, could be an alternative. The whole idea is to get a day that \nis a holiday. No one wants to add another holiday to the calendar year. \nBut if we put it on Veterans Day, veterans couldn't have any better \ncelebration than participating in democracy. They have given their \nlives to preserve democracy in wars overseas. What better way to \ncelebrate, in addition to Veterans Day parades and other kinds of \ncelebrations, than to also celebrate by going to the polls and voting. \nTake that particular day--Armistice Day, November 11--and open the \npolls. Of course, the idea here is to proclaim a day, other than \nSaturday or Sunday, so as not to get into the same problem.\n  This year, for example, I think election day is November 5, and then \nNovember 11 is Veterans Day, which is the next Monday.\n  I hope, given a deliberate study and consensus being developed, we \ncan very promptly put in this particular reform. It is not just \nmachines and chads and other things down in Florida that causes \nelection problems. The problem is the working population. In many \ninstances, they do not want to irritate their bosses by taking time off \nto vote.\n  The attitude is developed by us in public life that there is \nsomething wrong in participating in politics. That has to be changed. \nOne quick way to change it and one quick way to really enhance the \nparticipation of our electorate in these elections is to have it a \nholiday and perhaps select Veterans Day. It could be the study would \nrecommend another approach on Saturday or Sunday or whatever, but the \nimportant thing is that we do have a day off so we can participate in \nthe most important function of our entire democracy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its proper filing with our distinguished chairman of the Rules \nCommittee and the principal author of our election reform bill, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me inquire--the Kyl amendment has been \ntemporarily laid aside. Is my colleague filing this or is he offering \nit?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No, filing it for your consideration because I have \nbeen working with Senator Specter--it is a study, not an actual \nrequirement.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say, in the absence of my colleague from Kentucky--\nhe will be back shortly--there are a number of our colleagues who \nexpressed the same interest as the Senator from South Carolina. I think \nSenator Boxer from California has expressed an interest in the same \nsubject\n\n[[Page S813]]\n\nmatter. There may be others who will want to take a look at this. I \nthink the Senator from South Carolina is making a very fine suggestion. \nThis is a legitimate issue.\n  I heard some of his comments as I was making my way up here. The \npoint he makes is a worthwhile one. There are people who, because of \ntheir work obligations, find it difficult. Other countries have tried \nthis. We can learn from others who have been able to increase voter \nparticipation by making the time available to them. There are a lot of \ndifferent ideas.\n  As he pointed out, there is the holiday idea, using existing \nholidays, weekends. There are objections people raise to almost any \nidea you bring up as well. But I think it will be worthwhile. With the \nestablishment of this permanent commission, they can gather information \nand come back in 6 months or a year and make a recommendation to us and \nlet us deal with this issue. It really ought to be confronted. It is \nlong overdue, and I commend him immensely for raising the idea and \nturning it over to the commission for their analysis and reporting back \nto us.\n  I hope many of our colleagues on the other side would agree with this \nproposal and we can accept the amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. I heard the comments of my friend from Kansas, Senator \nBrownback, talking about the bill and one of his concerns that has to \ndo with the issue of how the $400 million authorizing grant money would \nbe allocated.\n  Again, Senator Jeffords, I think maybe Senator Reid, certainly \nSenator Brownback, and maybe others, have raised the issue of having \nsome floor so every State would have an opportunity to receive some of \nthe grant money to modernize their election equipment. That is a very \nfine suggestion. Let me say that those Members who are interested--\nSenator Collins of Maine, I think, as well, is interested in a similar \nidea--I think we could very quickly put together a proposal that will \nbe accepted by both sides as a way to guarantee that every State would \nqualify for some of this assistance so it wouldn't all be absorbed by \njust large States.\n  There are four amendments that will be very similar. If they come \nover, we can accommodate them.\n  I see my friend from Illinois is here, and I know he has a number of \nideas he wants to raise on this bill. I yield to him.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2895\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself and Mr. \n     Nelson of Florida, proposes an amendment numbered 2895.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To eliminate the special treatment of punchcard voting \n              systems under the voting systems standards)\n\n       Beginning on page 3, line 9, strike through page 5, line \n     14, and insert the following:\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the voting \n     system (including any lever voting system, optical scanning \n     voting system, direct recording electronic voting system, or \n     punchcard voting system) shall--\n       (i) permit the voter to verify the votes selected by the \n     voter on the ballot before the ballot is cast and counted;\n       (ii) provide the voter with the opportunity to change the \n     ballot or correct any error before the ballot is cast and \n     counted (including the opportunity to correct the error \n     through the issuance of a replacement ballot if the voter was \n     otherwise unable to change the ballot or correct any error); \n     and\n       (iii) if the voter selects votes for more than 1 candidate \n     for a single office--\n\n       (I) notify the voter that the voter has selected more than \n     1 candidate for a single office on the ballot;\n       (II) notify the voter before the ballot is cast and counted \n     of the effect of casting multiple votes for the office; and\n       (III) provide the voter with the opportunity to correct the \n     ballot before the ballot is cast and counted.\n\n       (B) A State or locality that uses a paper ballot voting \n     system or a central count voting system (including mail-in \n     absentee ballots or mail-in ballots) may meet the \n     requirements of subparagraph (A) by--\n       (i) establishing a voter education program specific to that \n     voting system that notifies each voter of the effect of \n     casting multiple votes for an office; and\n       (ii) providing the voter with instructions on how to \n     correct the ballot before it is cast and counted (including \n     instructions on how to correct the error through the issuance \n     of a replacement ballot if the voter was otherwise unable to \n     change the ballot or correct any error).\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me at the outset commend my colleague, \nSenator Dodd. This was an amazingly difficult issue to tackle because \nwhen he decided to tackle it, America was in flames over the last \nPresidential election. There were strong feelings among Democrats and \nRepublicans about the outcome of that election and the decision of the \nSupreme Court. In America, it seemed for weeks that there were abuses \nof the election, and we heard charges and countercharges. Frankly, I \nthink the Senator stepped in where angels fear to tread and came up \nwith an excellent piece of legislation which I am more than happy to \ncosponsor. In fact, I am proud to cosponsor it.\n  I commend the Senator because I know this piece of legislation \ndoesn't embody everything he wants nor everything the cosponsors want. \nBut it is his best good-faith effort to put forward a bill which will \nsignificantly change and significantly improve elections across \nAmerica. For that, I not only commend him but I think he has done a \ngreat public service to this Nation. The fact that several Republican \nSenators have stood up in support of this effort--I hope there will be \nmany who will vote for it--is evidence that we can solve problems in \nAmerica. And certainly the Senate should be in the forefront of solving \nthe problem and basically making certain that the right of Americans to \nvote is protected.\n  The preamble to the bill we are considering today I really think says \nit all. The first finding of this bill says the right to vote is a \nfundamental, incontrovertible right under the Constitution. It goes on \nto spell out exactly what that means in terms of Congress's obligation \nonce we have acknowledged that fundamental, incontrovertible right \nunder the Constitution.\n  I think this bill in so many ways addresses that. It creates a \ncommission to try to find more efficient and modern ways for fraud-free \nvoting and that serve the American people.\n  The amendment I bring to the floor addresses an issue which I hope my \ncolleagues will consider. The issue is this: If you decide to exercise \nyour civic duty, you have listened to all the people exhorting you to \nget out and vote, that your vote counts, and you believe it in your \nheart and are willing to make a sacrifice of your time, and perhaps to \nleave your family or your job to go to the polling place and vote, the \nbasic question in my mind is whether or not we are going to help in \nthat circumstance, make certain that people have their chance to \nexpress their political will or whether we are going to put obstacles \nin their paths. There are already obstacles in the system. You have to \nregister to vote. We want to try to eliminate as much fraud as possible \nwhen it comes to voter registration.\n  Of course, you have to follow the rules of voting when you turn up at \nthe polling place or apply for your absentee ballot, which I did a few \nminutes ago at my desk here in Washington for our primary election in \nIllinois on March 19th. You have to follow the rules when it comes to \nvoting and then put your ballot, as instructed, in the appropriate \nreceptacle for it to be counted. That is the basic system for paper and \npunch card ballots, and a number of other systems do it differently.\n  But there was language added to this bill which troubles me greatly. \nThe provision says when it comes to overvoting--in other words, when it \ncomes to a situation where you have made a mistake, you have spoiled \nyour ballot, you have voted, for example, twice for the same office--\noriginally it was my intention and hope that we would say to a voter in \nthat circumstance, if you made a mistake, to err is human; we will give \nyou another chance to vote.\n\n  But language was inserted--the Senator from Missouri, Republican \nSenator from Missouri offered it--which says that we will make an \nexception when it comes to those errors and those mistakes in punchcard \nsystems.\n  I need not remind you what punchcard systems are all about. With the\n\n[[Page S814]]\n\nphrase ``hanging chad,'' all the lexicon of the last election comes to \nmind immediately. In my home State of Illinois, in all but a few \ncounties we use punchcard systems--not only in the city of Chicago but \nall across the State.\n  So you walk in there, and they give you this card that has all of \nthese little windows on it. You go into your polling booth and put the \nmatrix on top, which is the ballot. Then you punch the hole next to the \ncandidate of your choice. I have come to learn, having been a lawyer in \nthe State capitol for years and watching election contests, that when I \nfinished voting I always lifted that ballot up to look for hanging \nchads to make sure that the numbers I punched corresponded with the \nnames on the ballot. I think that is an extra effort, but I want my \nvote to count. I believe every American thinks the same way.\n  But when it came time to compromise on this bill, language was \noffered which said if you make a mistake in your voting in a punchcard \nprecinct in America, we are not going to tell you about it; we are not \ngoing to notify you; we are not going to inform you. So the net result \nof that is a person who in good faith is trying to exercise their civic \nduty and their constitutional right to vote is discriminated against \nwhen it comes to whether they will be notified of mistakes.\n  We included paper ballots in this exception. I can understand the \npractical reason for that. If you have made a mistake on a paper \nballot, you have to manually count the whole ballot in a polling place. \nYou can't do that and preserve ballot confidentiality. That is not \npractical. That is not going to work. I understand that exception.\n  We also made an exception, primarily for the States of Washington and \nOregon, and said because you have a system where everybody mails in \ntheir ballots, how in the world can we receive the ballots, count them, \nand send back the ones that are in error? It is practically impossible \nto make that work.\n  But look at the rest of the world and the rest of the United States. \nAt least thirty-four percent of voters in America use the punchcard \nsystem. For the vast majority of those voters, we are saying if you \nhave over-voted and spoiled your ballot, it is going to be thrown out \nand not counted, and we are not going to tell you. It is a ``gotcha'': \nYou went in and did your best. But you didn't do good enough. Sorry. Go \nhome and try again in 2 or 4 years.\n  I do not buy that. The premise of this bill is that the right to vote \nis a fundamental and incontrovertible right under the Constitution and \nwe should do everything in our power to assist voters in exercising \nthat right. How important is that?\n  There is a study I have had a chance to look at by Caltech and MIT \ncalled the Voting Technology Project. They go into an analysis of \nvoting systems and people who have spoiled their ballots where they are \nnot counted.\n  I will tell you that the No. 1 voting system for spoiled ballots in \nPresidential elections in America is the punchcard system, the very \nsystem for to which this bill creates an exception. Here we know that \nthe most problematic voting system is the punchcard system, and we \nhave said in this bill, that has pledged itself to protect the right of \nAmerican's to vote, that we are not going to tell you in a punchcard \nsystem if you make a mistake: That's your problem, buddy; come around \nnext year. I don't think that is right. Not only is it not right, but \nit destroys confidence in the process.\n\n  Let me give you some statistics which you might be interested in. \nThis comes from the same study to which I am making reference.\n  Punchcards lose at least 50 percent more votes than optically scanned \npaper ballots. Punchcards have an average residual vote--a spoiled \nballot--of 2.5 percent in Presidential elections and 4.7 percent for \nother offices. Over 30 million voters in America used punchcards in the \nyear 2000 election. Had those voters used optical scanning, there would \nhave been 300,000 more votes recorded in the 2000 Presidential \nelection. In addition, 420,000 more votes would have been counted in \nSenate and gubernatorial elections.\n  Let me tell you that this strikes close to home. One hundred and \ntwenty thousand of my constituents in the State of Illinois in the \nCounty of Cook went to the polls and cast their ballots in the November \nPresidential election of 2000 and had those ballots thrown out. They \nmight as well have stayed home. They didn't vote for anybody. They \nthought they did. They took the time. They registered. They went to the \npolling place. They deliberated the candidates' names and made their \nchoices, but they made a mistake. How can you make a mistake on a \nballot? You saw the butterfly ballot in Florida. We all know what that \nlooked like. Try to look at the right place to punch on that ballot. A \nlot of voters testified afterwards that they were totally confused by \nthat ballot, and they have been prohibited and banned from use ever \nsince. They might have voted for the wrong candidate. But in some \nsituations, you would have someone come in to vote for Mr. Gore, or Mr. \nBush, and would mistakenly write in their names in the write-in space \nat the bottom of the ballot, and the ballot would be tossed out. Any \nmistake in the process disenfranchises the voters.\n  That is why I hope this amendment will be accepted, because we are \nsaying with this amendment that we value your vote however you vote in \nAmerica. We understand the paper ballot problem. We understand the \ncentral-count, mail-in voting that occurs in Washington and Oregon. But \nfor that situation, we are going to stand behind the voters and help \nthem vote.\n\n  How big a problem is this in America? As I said, one of three voters \nis faced with a punchcard system, and that is what they have to live \nwith. Also, how difficult is it to notify me that I have overvoted on \nmy ballot? There is a simple little machine--we are going to have some \nof them in our State in the next election--called the PBC-2100. With \nthese machines--no larger than a typewriter--you would finish voting on \nyour punchcard, you would walk out of the booth, and in your own \nprivacy, without the world looking in, push your ballot into the \ntabulating machine, and it would tell you whether you have a spoiled, \nvoided ballot that is illegal and cannot be counted. You can then make \na decision. You can say to the election judge: I did something wrong \nhere. Tear this one up, and let me try again before I leave the polling \nplace.\n  That is reasonable, and most States say: That is our standard. We do \nnot want to trick people. We want to give them a chance.\n  But if you decide, for whatever reason--it is a spoiled ballot--I \ndon't have time, I don't care, take it. That is your choice, too. But \nwhat we should do is let people know rather than putting them in this \ntrick bag situation.\n  The thing that troubles me is that the jurisdictions that rely \nheavily on punchcards are jurisdictions which have had these systems in \nplace for decades. In Illinois, I think it has been almost 40 years \nwith a punchcard system. This was the state of the art back in the \n1960s, the IBM punchcards. Well, the world has changed, but a lot of \nelection jurisdictions do not have the money to change with it. So they \nare using the old system.\n  So where do you find these punchcard systems? You find them \noverwhelmingly used in, for example, inner-city areas, such as the city \nof Chicago, the city of St. Louis, Kansas City, and others. I should \ncorrect my statement. I am not certain that St. Louis and Kansas City \nhave them. I can certainly speak for Illinois.\n  In these situations, you find that the overwhelming majority of \nAfrican-American and Hispanic voters use punchcard systems, systems \nthat are antiquated. As we know from Florida, with even the best of \nintentions, you may not get the result you want using a punchcard \nsystem.\n  So if you do not tell these voters they have made a mistake, you are \nbasically disenfranchising them, or, to put it more moderately, you are \nstacking the deck against them, and not doing it for other election \nsystems. That, to me, is unfair.\n  Let me just tell you the lay of the land in Illinois so you \nunderstand where I am coming from. We have a court order in Cook County \nwhich says that we will, in fact, look at all the punchcards to make \nsure, if there is an overvote, the voter is notified. I think that is \nfair. But, frankly, it should be fair across the board.\n  Cook County leans Democratic. We should say to the 101 other counties \nin\n\n[[Page S815]]\n\nIllinois, the same rules apply, the same law applies. Whether you are \nvoting in a Republican-dominated county downstate or in a Democratic \ncounty, such as Cook County, the same rules should apply. That is what \nthis amendment would say: Punchcard systems, whether in rural \nRepublican areas or in Democratic inner-city areas, should be systems \nwe can trust and count on.\n  We should accept our responsibility under this law to help the voter, \nnot to make it more difficult. That is why I have offered this \namendment.\n\n  I sincerely hope my colleagues following this debate will stop and \nreflect on what happened in America with the last Presidential \nelection.\n  I can recall a cabdriver in Chicago. I asked him where he was from. \nHe said: Africa.\n  I asked him: What do you do for a living besides driving a cab?\n  He said: I am an engineer. I am trying to make a living here in the \nUnited States.\n  We were in the middle of the Florida recount.\n  I asked him: What do you think about all this?\n  He said: In my home country, people would be killed in the streets \nover the dispute you are having in this Presidential election.\n  Thank God that never happened, and I hope it never does. But we know \nthat, though there might not have been lives taken in the streets, a \nlot of people left that November 2000 Presidential voting experience \nwith a bitter taste in their mouth. They thought the system of voting \nin America was not a friendly system, it was not a system dedicated to \nwhat we have called this ``incontrovertible constitutional right to \nvote.'' They thought it was a system that was designed to catch you if \nyou didn't play by every single rule and go by every single \ninstruction. If it caught you, it would disenfranchise you.\n  This amendment gets us back to establishing confidence again in a \nsystem that I think will say to all Americans: If you are in punchcard \njurisdictions--and one out of three Americans is in a punchcard voting \njurisdiction--we are going to help you make a decision so your vote \nwill count. That is so basic. I think it really reflects the intention \noriginally of the sponsor, Senator Dodd, in this legislation, that we \nmake this commitment to the system.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. CARNAHAN). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. First of all, Madam President, I commend my colleague and \nfriend from Illinois for his support on the underlying bill. I am very \ngrateful to him for helping us craft this proposal and lending his name \nas a cosponsor of the bill. He has been tremendously helpful.\n  The Senator from Illinois makes a compelling case. We have tried, in \nthis legislation, to strike a balance. I suppose it is a painful lesson \nwe all have to learn from time to time. But we would like to write our \nown bills. We all have our own ideas of exactly what we would do if we \ncould just write the bill ourselves.\n  Coming to the floor with a bill that is endorsed and cosponsored by \nthe chairman and the ranking member of the Rules Committee, and others, \nobviously did not happen miraculously. It happened through the work of \ntrying to offer proposals and negotiating out provisions that will \nallow people to achieve a level of comfort with a product to which they \nare willing to lend their names, and to be able to present it to our \ncolleagues for their overall support.\n  That is where we find ourselves and where I find myself with this \nparticular proposal. Again, I am one who believes, wherever possible, \nwhere the equipment allows, that people ought to be able to know if \nthere is an overvote. The Senator from Illinois makes an irrefutable \ncase for it, in my view.\n  While memories fade a bit, and other events have overtaken the events \nof 14 months ago, it is not that hard for people to remember how \ndistraught this country was over the fact that we could not seem to get \na Presidential election straight.\n\n  We discovered--obviously, not just in Florida, and it was not just \nfor this race--that all across the country there were serious problems \nwith the election systems and that voting systems were outdated. \nDepending on what community you lived in--how affluent it was--you \nmight have better equipment than other communities. There have been all \nsorts of problems that have been identified by every single study and \ncommission that has looked at election processes in the country.\n  What the Senator from Illinois has proposed is that when we are \ntalking about punchcard systems--and there is a machine that can \nindicate over-votes on a punchcard. Under our bill, we provide grant \nmoney to States and localities to help them acquire equipment. The $3 \nbillion is there for that purpose. You can actually buy a voting system \nthat does exactly what the Senator from Illinois would like to see \ndone.\n  When I wrote the bill with Senator Bond and Senator McConnell, there \nwere tradeoffs. I had to give up on some things I did not like giving \nup on--and this is one of them--in order to get support for other \nprovisions of the bill. I am not going to speak for my colleagues from \nMissouri and Kentucky, but there were things they did not want to \nparticularly give up on. So we struck an agreement on this overvote \nissue that presently does not require as a matter of national law that \npunchcard systems must report an overvote.\n  But let me also say, there is nothing in this legislation which \nprohibits any State from doing exactly what my friend from Illinois \nwants to do. In fact, I think the State of Illinois does require that \nthere be an overvote requirement--or there is a court order pending \nthat----\n  Mr. DURBIN. In Cook County.\n  Mr. DODD. In Cook County, excuse me--that is requiring they do just \nthat.\n  So I say to people who are wondering about this issue, while we do \nnot go to the extent that my colleague from Illinois would like us to \nin this bill, by requiring, as one of the minimum standards in this \nlegislation, national standards that every jurisdiction in the country \nthat uses a punchcard system must use a punchcard system that would \nallow the voter to be able to determine whether or not an overvote has \noccurred. We say nothing in this legislation that would, in any way, \nrestrict a State from requiring exactly what the Senator from Illinois \nis seeking. In fact, I would encourage States to do it, to use the \ngrant funding and acquire them because I think it is a great service to \nbe able to provide for your voters, and to avoid exactly the situation \nthe Senator from Illinois describes.\n  We all remember, very vividly, the pictures every night on television \nof people holding up these butterfly ballots where to say it was a \nconfusing situation was a mild description of those ballots. And there \nwere the punchcards that were also very difficult to read. People were \nholding them up to the light and showing hanging chads and the like.\n  So the Senator's point is an excellent one.\n  It is not a point with which I disagree. But anyone who has ever had \nto manage a bill on the floor, where you have 99 other colleagues and \nyou are trying to put together a compromise bill that includes some \nvery important changes and advances in the law, then you know how \ndifficult that can be. This is exactly one of those points.\n  I agree with what my colleague wants to do, but I also know in \nputting this bill together, the decision was made to allow States to do \nthat but not require in the punchcard system that it be done. I am in \nan awkward position because I agree with my colleague, but I am in a \ntough position because I am trying to work out a bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me counsel my friend and colleague from Connecticut \nto follow his heart.\n  Is it not true in this bill with the Bond exception that we do say to \njurisdictions across America that we want them to tell people if they \nhave overvoted and spoiled their ballot, if they have cast other than a \npaper ballot, a punchcard ballot, or a mail-in central counting system, \nlike Washington or Oregon? So for other methods of voting, the optical \nscan, the standard lever machines, the direct recording electronic, \nthis bill says: We want to save you from making a mistake. We\n\n[[Page S816]]\n\nwant you to have your vote count. Isn't that true? We have said for \nthose systems that we really want to have this protection, but not the \npunchcard system.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Illinois is exactly correct. That is \nexactly what the bill does. As I said before, he urges me to follow my \nheart. I would be very much inclined to do so. He also is a very \naccomplished legislator and knows how difficult it is. In fact, he has \nbeen in this very chair I now find myself in where he has been \nconfronted with not dissimilar proposals where his heart said one thing \nand, as he tried to cobble together a piece of legislation that enjoyed \nthe bipartisan support I am seeking with this bill, he was torn between \ntrying to produce an underlying bill and agreeing with the proposal \nthat one of his dear friends offered.\n  I have no argument whatsoever with the proposal, but he knows the \nquandary his friend is in.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask my friend and colleague from Connecticut, if you \ncan't follow your heart, can you at least take a walk?\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Illinois. Again, I urge Members \nto follow what he has proposed here. He said it very well. We do \nrequire in this bill that there be overvotes, not undervotes. I don't \nknow if my colleague from Illinois made that distinction. There is \nnothing in this bill that requires that a person be notified of an \nundervote. Senator McCain, in fact, raised this issue with me. I \nthought he brought up a very good point. There are many of us--we can \nall identify with this--who have gone in to vote and there were some \npositions where we just did not know the people. We did not know \nanything about them whatsoever. So from time to time, we do not cast a \nballot on those particular races. We make the conscious decision not to \ncast a ballot.\n  We don't want to necessarily be notified that we have not voted for \nthe deputy sheriff in some place. So we have excluded any reference to \nundervote references, only to overvote where, again, everyone wants to \nbe notified if they voted for two candidates for President or two \ncandidates for Senate, or Governor. The overvote issue is extremely \nimportant.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have spoken to the ranking minority leader on the \nSenate Rules Committee, Senator McConnell. Once again, I make this \noffer on the floor. If there are any who wish to speak for or against \nthis amendment, I want to give them ample opportunity to do so at this \nmoment. But if there are no requests for debate, in the interest of \ncompleting the bill today, I will ask for the yeas and nays. But I will \nwithhold that in the interest of having a free and open debate on this.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Regretfully, I am going to join Senator Dodd in \nopposing this amendment. We had a carefully crafted compromise on this \nwhole issue of whether or not to, by either direction or indirection, \nrequire certain voting machines in jurisdictions. I think that is, in \neffect, what this does. We don't want to dictate to any State what form \nor what kind of machine they choose to take. This was a significant \npoint of negotiation between the five principals on this bill, who were \nSenator Dodd, myself, and Senators Bond, Torricelli, and Schumer.\n  This would mandate a certain kind of punchcard machine, one that \nnotifies the voter of overvotes. This is a decision which the five of \nus concluded should best be left to the States. In crafting this bill, \nwe were careful to avoid mandating any particular system out of \nexistence, and that, in effect, is what this amendment would do. Our \nbill seeks to address the Senator's concerns. It does it in such a way \nthat we don't eliminate any system.\n  Regretfully, I join the chairman of the committee in saying if this \namendment is approved, I think it takes away any argument we can make \nin opposing any other amendment if somebody says you think you ought to \nuse this kind of machine or that kind. Regretfully, I, too, have to \noppose the amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In response to the Senator from Kentucky, if he would \nlike to engage me in dialog, I invite him to do it.\n  In your bill, as currently written, it says if people have overvoted \nand spoiled their ballots, we will notify them in jurisdictions that \ndon't have paper ballots, that don't have punchcards and in States such \nas Washington and Oregon where there are mail-in ballots. I say to my \nfriend from Kentucky, you are, in this bill, already establishing a \nstandard of care for every voting system but three. Why do you make an \nexception for a punchcard system where one out of three Americans vote \nwith that system, a system we saw in Florida that was rife with \nproblems, where people voted with the best of intentions, and where we \nlost 120,000 voters in Cook County, IL? Why would you say, if you \nhappen to have an optical scanning system, you have to notify voters if \nthey spoiled their ballots? If you have a lever machine, you have to \nnotify people. If you have an electronic device, you must notify \npeople. But when it comes to the punchcard system, the oldest one, the \none fraught with more problems than any others, you have carved out an \nexception. Why do you make that distinction?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. More Americans voted on punchcards than any other way \nin 2000. So if we want to start mandating certain kinds of punchcard \nvoting systems, we are going to have to pay if you want to have funded \nmandates and not unfunded mandates; we are going to have to pay, in \neffect, to replace, apparently--most places except Illinois--all of \nthese punchcard machines. I suspect that is a simple answer to the \nquestion of the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I may be mistaken, but I thought this bill not only \ncreated a commission, but created a Federal grant system to do just \nwhat we are talking about, to modernize election systems across America \nso they are more trustworthy and consistent with this so-called \nincontrovertible constitutional right to vote.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. You can't overvote on a lever machine, and you can't \novervote on these optical touch-screen voting machines. So it is really \nnot a problem with those kinds of machines.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If you accept the premise of the bill you brought to us \nthat this is an incontrovertible constitutional right, think about what \nyou have just said. Is this really equal justice under the law, that we \nhave a slot machine culture when it comes to voting? If you happen to \nbe in the right jurisdiction with the right machine, we will correct \nyour mistakes; but if you happen to be one of those poor people with a \n40-year-old punchcard system, good luck. If your vote doesn't count, \ntry it again in 2 or 4 years from now.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. One short answer to the Senator's concern is that of \nthese millions of people who voted on punchcards, almost nobody \ncomplained except in Florida. Nobody demanded a recount. Nobody went to \ncourt. The practical effect of what the Senator is suggesting here is \nthat we mandate a certain kind of punchcard voting system. It seems to \nme that clearly wrecks the fundamental concept of the bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. With all due respect to my colleague, if I have cast a \nspoiled ballot, they don't give me a call or send me a note in the \nmail. I never know it. Those 120,000 people, who thought they had done \nthe right thing and performed their civic duty, went home proudly after \nvoting in Cook County, and 300,000 who voted across America went home \nand said to their kids: This is what you have to do, you have to vote. \nTheir ballots were tossed because they were punchcard voters who got \ncaught in hanging chads and a system that was over 40 years old.\n  Are we really serious about giving people their constitutionally \nprotected, incontrovertible right to vote, or is this going to be a \nhaphazard system? I hope not.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator from Illinois yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I bring to this debate the \nvery painful experience we had in Florida. Because of the trouble with \nthe punchcard ballots, the Florida legislature has wisely eliminated \npunchcard ballots for the future, but many other places in the country \nstill have punchcard ballots.\n  I would never want voters in other places to have the confusion, \nmystification, and belief that their constitutional right of being able \nto vote\n\n[[Page S817]]\n\nhad been taken away by virtue of having realized after the fact that \ntheir ballot had been punched twice, because of incorrect instructions, \nor incoherent instructions, or an incoherent way in which the ballot \nwas designed that confused, not intentionally, but had the bottom line \nresult of confusing the voter.\n  If it is so easy with technology to notify a voter that they have, in \nfact, overvoted, why should we not give that almost God-given right--\ncertainly, that American right of the ballot --to notify them that \ntheir ballot isn't going to count because it has been overpunched?\n  So I lend my voice, having been borne out of the painful experience \nof the Presidential election in Florida in 2000, in support of the \nSenator from Illinois and his amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Graham of Florida be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, I thank him for his \nleadership. I ask the Senator if he agrees, and maybe he doesn't; I \ndidn't confer with him. But we really ought to be in the position of \nsaying that States and local voting jurisdictions in a Federal election \nsimply can't use punchcards. I think we ought to get rid of them all. I \nam proud that my State of Iowa, 28 years ago, got rid of the punchcards \nfor the very reason that too many people were making mistakes. That was \n28 years ago. I am very proud of that. I think this is an old \ntechnology, fraught with all kinds of errors. I don't care what anybody \nsays, they ought to be done away with. Again, I suppose we are not in a \nposition to do that here, but at least we can do it in the Senator's \nState of Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Iowa. The fact \nis, the highest incidence of spoiled ballots in Presidential elections \nin America is on punchcard systems. It makes the point of the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Look at the last Presidential election, what a handful of votes would \nhave meant in one State or another, and to have a report that over \n300,000 more votes should have been recorded in that Presidential \nelection that were lost to punchcards. This bill, which is supposed to \nbe about election modernization and election reform, turns a blind eye \nto the voting system used by one out of every three Americans. I do not \nthink that is consistent. I do not think you can say it is an \nincontrovertible constitutional right and ignore one out of three \nvoters when it comes to saving them from a mistake.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, will my colleague yield? I want to make a \npoint. I said to my colleague, I certainly do not disagree with what he \nwants to do. Let me make the case again. One is, nothing in this \nlegislation, in fact, prohibits any State from making a decision \nrequiring this equipment and notifying voters of an overvote. In fact, \nin Cook County there is a court order that requires that very result. \nOther States may do the same.\n  Again, I make the point to my colleagues, this was putting together a \nbill with a lot of different features to get a bipartisan product. \nUnlike the other body, the Rules Committee in the Senate does not \ncontrol the debate and whether there are no amendments. They just bring \nthe product out and you vote for or against it. Here we have already \ndealt with seven or eight amendments, and I have a book thick with \namendments people may offer on this issue.\n  Senator Bond, Senator McConnell, and myself tried to work something \nout that will move us along on some very important underlying \nprovisions.\n  Again, this equipment is not inexpensive. States can apply through \nthe grant program to get the money to buy this equipment. They can put \nit in place. There is nothing here that prohibits people from doing \nthat whatsoever. In fact, I encourage them to do exactly that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If we accept what the Senator has said, that it is really \nup to every State to modernize their system and to make it a more \ntrustworthy system, I have two questions for Senator Dodd: First, why \ndid he preface this bill by saying this is an incontrovertible right \nunder our Constitution; and second, why did the Senator include any \nreference at all in the bill requiring that you permit the voter to \nverify the votes selected by the voter, and go on to say provide the \nvoter with the opportunity to change the ballot or correct any error?\n  If it is the Senator's belief that this is about States rights, then \nwhy does he have any language in this bill regarding standards?\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, we do, but it is about balance. No \none has claimed perfection. We are trying to strike a balance where the \nFederal Government, for the first time, becomes a better partner with \nour States and simultaneously saying, in exchange for that partnership, \nthere are certain minimum requirements--certain ones, not every one I \nwould like, not every one one might imagine, but certain ones on which \na majority--hopefully a large majority--of Democrats and Republicans, \nwith very different points of view on this issue, can find common \nground. That is what we try to do when we legislate, and that is what I \ntried to do with this bill.\n\n  I could think of 20 more minimum Federal requirements I would write \ninto this bill if I were king. But I am not king, yet. So I am working \nwith my friend from Kentucky. If he were writing this bill, he would \nhave a very different set, I presume, and it would be the same with my \ncolleague from Missouri.\n  I say to my friend, this is not easy, I admit. It is complicated, and \nwe are not writing this bill in tablets. We have established a \ncommission so there will be an ongoing process. We do not have to wait \nanother 40 years to talk about changes to be made in the system.\n  I urge States to do this. If I were writing the bill alone, I would \nhave written exactly the provision my friend from Illinois has \nsuggested, but in trying to cobble together provisions that will allow \nus to take a major step forward in improving the election system of \nthis country, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment without \nrejecting the idea.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Given the experience we had in Florida, what \ncould any of the three Senators have as an objection to notifying \nsomeone that they had overvoted on a punchcard ballot? What is the \nobjection?\n  Mr. DODD. The bill does not prohibit that.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Given what we went through.\n  Mr. DODD. What my colleagues are requesting is that we mandate that \nin this bill. There is nothing in this legislation that says Florida is \ngoing to insist--the State of Florida has abandoned their punchcard \nsystem, but in the case of Illinois, which is a live example, under a \ncourt order, the State has said you must notify voters of an overvote. \nThat is fine. No one here is suggesting in this bill that the State of \nIllinois should not be able to do that.\n  What is missing, what the Senator from Illinois would like, is that \nwe absolutely require in every jurisdiction where a punchcard system is \nlocated that that system notify the voter of that overvote. I do not \ndisagree with him in that sense, but understand in putting this bill \ntogether, I was not able to get that far. We had to compromise.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I understand the Senator's discomfiture. It \njust seems to me it is common sense to assure a person's right to have \ntheir ballot counted given the awful experience we had in the State of \nFlorida on ballots not being counted. I just do not understand the \nopposition.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield the floor. Does the Senator from Missouri want to \nbe heard?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I stated earlier and I restate--I ask the Senator from \nMissouri to stay in the Chamber. I hope we can reach an agreement that \nthose in opposition have ample opportunity to speak and I have a few \nminutes to close, and we can bring this to a vote at a specific time. \nIf I can have a suggestion from the ranking member or the Senator from \nMissouri as to how much they would like to have, I would like to \npropound that unanimous consent request.\n\n[[Page S818]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. May I make a suggestion? How much time does Senator Bond \nneed?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, since most of the discussion has occurred \non the other side, I think we need at least 15 minutes more on this \nside to discuss what I think are some alternatives. Some good questions \nwere raised by the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Florida. \nI would like to have a chance to speak about them. I hope I can have at \nleast 15 minutes for that. I do not know how much time the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky will need in addition to that.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri, or his designee, be recognized for \n15 minutes; that the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, be recognized \nfor 5 minutes; that the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, be \nrecognized for 5 minutes, and that the vote occur on or in relation to \nthis amendment at 10 of 3, with no other amendments in order to this \namendment, with no intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I know there are many concerns about \nvoting. We cannot solve all of them in this bill. I think we have \nreached a workable position where we will provide assistance to States \nand localities to improve their voting system. If a State wants to \nchange its voting machine, or if it wants to add a new kind of machine \nto check punchcards, it can do that.\n  If the system does not work in Chicago, or if it does not work in \nIllinois, there is money in this bill to allow them to change it. If it \nworks in Missouri, why should we be told we have to spend money on a \nwhole raft of new supplementary equipment or new machines?\n  There is $3.5 billion in this bill. We hoped when we put this money \nin that it would provide enough money for at least every polling place \nto have a machine which was accessible to the visually impaired. We \nwant to make sure this money goes to provide equipment that serves \nspecial needs people. That is one of the strengths of this bill.\n  I see no reason why we ought to tell States what kinds of general \nmachines or systems they use. If it works, do it. If it does not work, \nfix it.\n  St. Louis County, which I represent, is one of the largest voting \njurisdictions in the country with 650,000 registered voters. St. Louis \nCounty uses punchcards. Its error rate in the November 2000 election \nwas 0.3 percent, the lowest in the country for large jurisdictions. St. \nLouis County is a microcosm on the United States, across the \ndemographic and socioeconomic scale. This county manages to do it quite \nwell, and I have not heard any concerns elsewhere in our State \nregarding punchcards. We vote with a punchcard. Know what you can do? A \npunchcard is not something where it is in the machine once you have \ncast the ballot. You can take the punchcard out and look at it before \nyou put it in the box. You could look at that punchcard and see what \nyou punched out.\n  Now, there is new equipment to put different colored lines on that \npunchcard or any other system that one wants on that card, so when you \nwalk out of there, you can hold it up. We expect some basic competence \nof the voters. There is no guarantee somebody will not go in and vote \nfor the wrong person. A total electronic ``hoo-ha'' machine is not \ngoing to prevent somebody who goes in to vote for candidate A from \ncasting a mistaken ballot for candidate B. There is no constitutional \nright to say that one cannot make a mistake, but with a punchcard you \ncan hold it up and look at it.\n  Certainly, after what we saw in Florida, I would imagine people could \nlook up to see if there is a hanging chad or if there are two holes \npunched next to each, then that person can say they over voted or if \nthere is no hole punched they can say they missed it.\n  The Ford-Carter Commission reviewed error rates of the 40 most \npopulous voting jurisdictions in the country. Twenty-six of those \njurisdictions had an error rate below the national average. Nine of \nthem were punchcard counties. St. Louis County, King County, Orange \nCounty, CA, all had error rates less than 1 percent. Clark County, NV, \nhome of Las Vegas, Sacramento County, Santa Clara County, San \nBernardino County and San Diego County all used punchcard and had an \nerror rate less than 2 percent. In fact, punchcards are much better \nrepresented than electronic machines. Only three of those jurisdictions \nthat fell below the national average used electronic machines.\n  To conclude that punchcards are out of date and therefore responsible \nfor the high error rates we saw in Palm Beach County is simply wrong. \nIn Florida, there were 15 other counties that used punchcards and had a \nlower error rate than Palm Beach County. The problem is not punchcards. \nThe problem was in the voting booth with the voters in Palm Beach \nCounty.\n  Whatever the issue, whatever the reason, whatever the problem, the \npeople of Palm Beach, their elected officials, had the opportunity to \nreview the problem and correct it. There are a number of ways they \ncould do it. If they want to use money that is available to buy a \nchecking machine, they can do that. If they want to put up signs and \ntell the people, look at the ballot, we are going to put lines on the \nballot that show which are color coded so each office has a color code, \nthey can do that. The fact that they need to do that in Palm Beach \nCounty, or in Cook County, IL, is not a reason why the dollars that are \ngoing to improve the voting system in our State or any other State \nshould be required to get some kind of fancy machine that they do not \nhave or buy equipment that they do not need.\n  The performance of voting machines is affected by many factors that \ngo beyond the equipment. Some of that is the skill and training of poll \nworkers. Mistakes made by the individual voters do occur. Some voters \nchoose not to cast a ballot.\n  I have pointed out in my discussions that one time when I ran, my \nopponent and I, in a large suburban county, received less votes than an \nuncontested candidate for Congress received. Now, were those under \nvotes? I regret to say that I cannot claim they were under votes. I \nthink maybe the voters chose to say they did not want either one of us. \nThat is one of the choices that voters make.\n  There are some administrators I have talked to who say that dollar \nfor dollar you can get more and better results in assuring voters \nreally cast the vote they want to cast with voter education and poll \nworker training. Machines do not solve all human problems. We are going \nto make machines available for those who have conditions that require \nspecial needs. We are going to provide assistance to those States and \nthose areas where they think they need to use a different kind of \nmachine.\n  The punchcards serve specific local needs. With a punchcard machine, \neach voter needs a blank punchcard. With an optical scan, they need a \nseparate ballot. With this bill, we expand the language requirements of \nnew voters in very large jurisdictions with many offers and \npropositions. It may be to provide the punchcard makes more sense than \nother technologies. Why should they not be able to use it?\n  I believe that we are on the right track by providing assistance. \nWhere local jurisdictions find they have problems, where they do not \nfeel a need or for some reason or another punchcards do not work, we \nare providing some money and they ought to step up to the plate and put \nin some of their own money and get something they think would work. I \nstrongly object to saying we are in this bill going to mandate that \neverybody uses a certain kind of machine or has a certain kind of check \nand balance. We have already gotten into the business of local \nelections on a grand scale and, frankly, I do not think most of us who \nhave had experience in elections want to see the Federal Government \ntake over the function totally. We are making money available for those \njurisdictions and those States which think they ought to have a \ndifferent system.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, we all know, regrettably, we are \ngoing to be spending the Social Security surplus in this year's budget, \nand this amendment, in effect, would require us to spend some of the \nSocial Security\n\n[[Page S819]]\n\nsurplus to buy new voting machines. It seems to me that is a \nparticularly inappropriate use of the Social Security surplus, which \nis, in fact, going to be spent this year on such items as fighting the \nwar abroad and homeland security.\n  I want to echo the comments of Senator Kit Bond. There are 64,337 \nprecincts in America that use punchcards. Nearly 50 million voters vote \non punchcards. The practical effect of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Illinois is to replace the vast majority of those with some \nsystem, which is why the Senator from Connecticut, the chairman of the \ncommittee, who would otherwise be in favor of this amendment, has \nstated that this begins to unravel the bill.\n  If we mandate a particular voting system in this way, there will be \nlots of other amendments coming in mandating other kinds of methods of \nvoting. So I hope this amendment will be defeated. I think it is a path \nwe do not want to go down if we are serious about trying to enact this \nlegislation. I know the chairman of the committee and I are certainly \nserious about it. We think it would be a step in the right direction \nand an appropriate step to take. We have managed to get together on the \nbipartisan basis and we hope we can keep that bipartisan spirit \ntogether and move this bill toward passage.\n  I am unaware of any other debate. Did Senator Bond reserve the \nremainder of his time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Then I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining under the \nunanimous consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 5 minutes. The \nSenator from Missouri has 6 minutes. The Senator from Kentucky has 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't know if the Senator from Missouri wants \nadditional time. I thought we were aiming for 10 minutes to 3.\n  Mr. DODD. There is nothing in the Constitution that prohibits the \nSenator from yielding back time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have not used the last 5 minutes. I thank the Senator \nfor his always valuable advice.\n  The Senator from Missouri, in all fairness, was not here at the \nopening of my comments about the system. I want the Senator to reflect \nfor a moment on some of the things he said and some of the things which \nwe know to be true. The Senator undoubtedly points to St. Louis County \nwhich has an excellent record on the punchcard system. But the simple \nfact according to the Caltech-MIT study is that nationwide the No. 1 \nvoting system which voided ballots cast for President in the year 2000 \nwas the punchcard system. There was no other system as bad as the \npunchcard system for taking away a person's right to vote for President \nin the year 2000. That is a fact. They conclude 300,000 Americans went \nto vote for President and their votes were not counted on punchcard \nsystems, but would have been on other systems such as optical scan. \nPunchcard systems didn't work as well. They spoiled their ballots.\n  To suggest there is no problem defies the obvious statistical \ninformation in evidence we have been given.\n  The Senator from Missouri also said you can check out your ballot \nbefore you leave the punchcard voting place. He is right. I have done \nit. It is no small feat. Remember those pictures of the judges in \nFlorida staring at the little holes in the cards, trying to figure out \nwhich hole had been punched, what was hanging, what was pregnant, what \nwas gone, what was here, what was there?\n  If we are going to turn voting in America into this kind of bunco \ngame to see how we can stop someone from exercising their right to \nvote, we ought to mandate punchcard systems. We know that is the system \nthat takes the vote away for President of the United States, whether \nyou are a Democrat or a Republican.\n  I know what it means to check the ballots, the punchcard ballots. \nBetter have good eyesight and patience to match up every hole in the \ncard to the number next to it on the ballot in front of you.\n  There has been lots of talk about Federal mandates. I didn't write \nthe compromise substitute amendment before the Senate. I believe the \nSenator from Connecticut, the Senator from Kentucky, and even the \nSenator from Missouri had a voice in this. I refer Members to the \nopening of this amendment. Here is what the amendment the Senator is \nprepared to support, the substitute bill, says: Each voting system used \nin an election for Federal office shall meet the following \nrequirements.\n  Like it or not, that is a mandate.\n  Among the requirements is to have a system that notifies voters of \novervotes, and to give the voter the power to verify votes and the \npower to correct errors. That is a mandate currently in the law.\n  Senator Bond's amendment said we will make an exception for punchcard \nmachines for one out of three voters. This Federal requirement to make \nsure people's votes count will not apply in a punchcard system.\n  I don't think that is fair. I don't think it is fair to voters across \nAmerica who have little voice in the process as to what kind of voting \nmachine they will face on election day.\n  What I think makes sense is to treat voters as fairly as possible, \nwhether they live in St. Louis County, St. Louis city, or in rural \nMissouri. The same thing is true in Illinois.\n  What I am doing, some can say, is not to my advantage. Cook County \nhas a court order saying we will check the punchcards to make sure \npeople get a chance to vote correctly. This amendment will apply to the \nwhole State, the Republican rural areas as well as the inner-city \nDemocratic areas.\n  Make no mistake, the people most likely disadvantaged by the weakness \nof the punchcard system are people living in cities that are \noverwhelmingly minority and low-income people. Once again, when it \ncomes to voting in America, if you happen to have enough money and live \nin the right place in America, you are not going to have a problem on \nelection day. But if you happen to be a hard-working, blue-collar \nperson who comes in to vote and is stuck with a punchcard system, the \ndeck is stacked against you. And this bill doesn't help you one darned \nbit.\n  If we are going to do anything fair across America to help the \nsituation in Florida and ourselves, for goodness' sake, give every \nAmerican an opportunity to have their vote counted.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, with all due respect, I agree with much of \nwhat my colleague said, but I want to make a couple of corrections. The \n$3.5 billion, we are told, is the number if every single precinct in \nthe country decided to change every voting machine. It has to be the \nmost sophisticated equipment you can buy. The number we have put in \nthis bill is not drawn out of thin air. This is a number that should \naccommodate virtually every jurisdiction to make changes. Obviously \nthat will not happen in every jurisdiction. But the money will be \nthere, provided the Appropriations Committee supports what the \nPresident asked for in this budget and what we included.\n  Second, I make the case again, this bill gives people the right to be \nable to verify how they have voted and to have the right to ask for \nthat check to occur. It says nothing in here to prohibit that. In fact, \nthe resources are going to the States, and in this particular case, so \nthey can get the equipment that Illinois will have in Cook County, to \nbe able to update its punchcard system or whatever else it wants to \nhave.\n  These are very significant steps forward that come closer to \naddressing the problem that the Senator from Illinois identified. Not \nas comprehensively as he would, I add, with his amendment; his \namendment goes much further than that. I am not really disagreeing \nexcept to the extent I try to present to this entire Chamber a bill \nthat would enjoy the support of an overwhelming majority of Democrats \nand Republicans. That is not an easy task when it comes to election \nreform.\n  I have great respect for my colleague from Illinois, and I urge our \ncolleagues to vote their conscience, although on this issue I happen to \ndisagree.\n  If there is no further requests for time, I urge we get to a vote on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S820]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I concur with the Senator from Connecticut \nwe should move along as quickly as possible.\n  There were a number of items raised. Apparently, there was a \nmisunderstanding. The Senator from Illinois claimed I said some things \nI didn't say. I didn't say there were no problems. I didn't say they \ndidn't have a problem in Cook County. They have a court order. \nApparently, they do have a problem. They may well have a problem in \nPalm Beach County.\n  I said we provide some money that can assist them in curing their \nproblem. We want to see elections honestly and fairly conducted and do \neverything we can to assist the voter to make the right choice and be \nable to cast their ballots as they wish. There is no requirement in \nthis bill that if you have a paper ballot you have to have a machine to \ncheck it. If you have a mail-in ballot, you don't have to send it back \nif it is overvoted or undervoted. If you have an optical scan, there is \nno way to check it.\n  On these things where there is a piece of paper, optical scan or a \npunchcard, we say we are putting money for voter education to tell \nvoters how to do it. It is not like the poor people trying to come up \nwith ideas about what is a hanging chad or what is a pregnant chad. \nWith a little voter education you can tell them, if you are not sure \nafter you punched the ballot, you look at it. If you do not think you \ngot it right, you can get another one and do it right.\n  There is an obligation on the voter and there are all different kinds \nof voting equipment and systems to make sure he or she makes the right \nchoice. As I said, part of that is making sure if you want to vote for \ncandidate A, you vote for candidate A. This is not a big brother nation \nwhere we go in and guarantee everybody is going to make every right \nchoice. There are lots of errors.\n  As a matter of fact, some of the most expensive equipment we have, \nthe DRE equipment, a whiz-bang machine, the error rate is equal to the \nerror rate on punchcards. By the way, the studies that have been done \nshow there is no link whatsoever between the kind of system or the \ntechnology available and the economic status of the voting area. That \nis what I would call a red herring.\n  St. Louis County, MO, has some of the wealthiest and some of the \npoorest voters in our State. They all get to use a punchcard.\n\n  In Audrain County, MO, we don't have a lot on the high end. We have a \nlot in the low end. We have a lot in the middle. We use a punchcard. I \ndon't think we ought to be saying that because folks in Cook County or \nPalm Beach have had problems with punchcards--given the fact that our \ncounty clerk in Audrain County makes the system work for the people who \nvote there, we should not have to go back and tell them: Whoa, you have \nto spend some money, take the available Federal resources, match it, \nbecause you need to have a different kind of equipment to check the \npunchcard. Most of the folks back home at the coffee shop would say, \nafter all this whoop-de-la in Florida, they are going to look at the \nballot and make sure they punched the things out that they wanted to \npunch out.\n  I do not believe we need to intrude further on the management of \nelections by saying you can't use a punchcard machine unless you have \nanother form of device. I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank, again, the Senator from Missouri for his \ncontributions to this debate and reiterate that the key to this is \nvoter education, as Senator Bond pointed out, and with the punchcard \nthere is an opportunity to correct.\n  Assuming the amendment of the Senator from Illinois is agreed to, \nthis is going to use up close to $1 billion of the $3.5 billion \nauthorized in this bill. Then I wouldn't be surprised to see other \nSenators coming over, offering amendments to mandate other kinds of \nvoting machines.\n  So I think this amendment should be opposed. I think it begins to \nunravel the bill. I hope our colleagues will not support the Durbin \namendment.\n  Is all time yielded back?\n  I reserve the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the debate we just heard is probably a \nreplay of many arguments over the Voting Rights Act of 1965: It is a \nmatter of States' rights. It isn't the Congress's responsibility. This \nis too big a job.\n  But we decided in the 1960s that the accident of birth or color would \nnot deny you your right to vote in America. Today, by turning down this \namendment, we would say the accident of the voting machine that you \nface wherever you happen to be registered can turn away your right to \nvote, can deny you this basic constitutional franchise.\n  One out of three voters will not have the protection of this law \nbecause the compromise legislation doesn't provide for notification in \npunchcard systems.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would like my colleagues to understand that voting \nfor the Durbin amendment means spending Social Security surplus to buy \nvoting machines--spending Social Security surplus to buy voting \nmachines. I hope that is a step we will not take, and I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has time remaining.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, briefly, this is not, as has been \ncharacterized, a replay of the basic Voting Rights Act. We assure \neveryone has a right to education. We are just not mandating a new \nmachine be purchased in every jurisdiction, whether they need it or \nnot. They work in many jurisdictions. If they do not work, let those \njurisdictions fix them. We are not going to mandate that everybody \nspend money on them.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

That would be a first, Madam President.\n  How much time does the Senator from Montana want on his amendment?\n  Mr. BURNS. I don't think it is going to take much more than 15 \nminutes. If you had somebody scheduled in front of me, I say to the \nSenator from Connecticut, I would facilitate that.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate the Senator's consideration. What we might do \nis proceed with the Senator from Connecticut, then the two Senators \nfrom Florida--they need a very short amount of time on their proposal, \nand it may be accepted--then the Senator from Montana. We will try to \nget some time agreements and see if we can't get some other Senators to \ncome forward. We will move these things in order. We will move in that \nfashion, if that is all right.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I might suggest, we just had an amendment \nfrom your side. If this amendment could be handled in 15 minutes, why \ndon't we work on getting time agreements, go back and forth to the \nextent that we have an equal number of amendments?\n  Mr. DODD. I am prepared to do that as well. In the meantime, my \ncolleague from Montana very graciously has offered to wait because I \ndid make a commitment to my colleague from Connecticut. You don't want \nto get me in trouble in Connecticut. Let me turn to my colleague from \nConnecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2889\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut, the distinguished chair and manager of this very critical \npiece of legislation. I thank Senator Dodd and Senator McConnell for \nthe bipartisan agreement they have that brings forth this historic \nreform legislation.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows well, I have a particularly personal \nand poignant series of memories related to the election of 2000, most \nof them really quite good until post-election day. As my mother, if I \nmay quote her in this great Chamber, said: There must have been a \nreason that happened.\n  Maybe one of the reasons was to lead to the election reform proposal \nthat is before this Chamber which I think will take significant strides \nforward in making sure that if we ever have a national election as \nclose as the one in 2000 again, there will be a series of laws and \nprocedures in place, an ongoing commission in place that will make \ncertain, one, that the right of citizens to vote is not just the right \nto cast their ballot but the right to have that vote counted, of which \nmillions were not counted throughout the country, and that there be a \nmore orderly process for determining, without resort to courts, what \nthe result of that election was.\n  Bottom line: I thank Senator Dodd and Senator McConnell for bringing \nthis bill forward.\n  I call up amendment No. 2889, which I have placed at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself \n     and Mr. Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 2889.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for full voting representation in Congress for the \n  citizens of the District of Columbia, to amend the Internal Revenue \n   Code of 1986 to provide that individuals who are residents of the \nDistrict of Columbia shall be exempt from Federal income taxation until \n such full voting representation takes effect, and for other purposes)\n\n       On page 68, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Madam President, this is an amendment that I am \nintroducing and will then withdraw. I thought it was important to put \nthis issue before the Chamber while we are considering comprehensive \nelection reform legislation because in our country the right to vote is \na sacred right. The vote is a civic entitlement of every American \ncitizen. We believe the vote to be democracy's most essential tool. Not \nonly is the vote the indispensable sparkplug of our democracy, the vote \nis the sine qua non of democracy and equality because each person's \nvote is of equal weight, no matter what their wealth is or their \nstation in life--or is it?\n  That is the question this amendment poses. As we engage in this \ndebate to remedy the voting problems that arose in the election of \n2000, we have to acknowledge the most longstanding denial of voting \nrepresentation in our country, and that is the denial of voting rights \nto the citizens who live right here in our Nation's Capital. The nearly \n600,000 people who live in the Nation's Capital are denied voting \nrepresentation in the Congress of the United States. Citizens of DC \nhave a nonvoting delegate in the House who may vote in committees but \nnot on the House floor. DC citizens--our fellow citizens--are not \nrepresented in this body at all. Yet, as we speak, residents of the \nDistrict of Columbia are engaged abroad and at home in the current war \nagainst terrorism alongside other Americans.\n  The people who live here in our Nation's Capital have always met each \nand every obligation of citizenship. They have fought and died in all \nof our wars, often in greater numbers proportionately, and even \nabsolutely, than larger States. In fact, sadly, the casualties of \nDistrict residents in our wars have been increasing.\n  In World War I, the district suffered more casualties than three \nStates. In World War II, it suffered more casualties than four States. \nIn Korea, it suffered more casualties than eight States. And in \nVietnam, more residents of the District of Columbia were casualties \nthan in 10 States.\n  I am the sponsor of legislation before the Finance Committee at this \npoint which is called the No Taxation Without Representation Act. Its \nname is taken, of course, from our own revolution because our forebears \nwent to war rather than pay taxes without being represented. Citizens \nof our Capital believe in the principles of the Nation's revolutionary \nheroes established as a result of our own revolution. Today, they are \nusing the only tools of democracy available to them to secure voting \nrepresentation in Congress. They are seeking redress of their \nlegitimate grievances from us in Congress.\n  Madam President, despite the bill's title--No Taxation Without \nRepresentation Act--the people of the District seek voting \nrepresentation, not exemption from taxes. I must admit there are \nemployees of our office who are residents of the District who have been \ntempted to have the exclusion go the other way. The tax provision is in \nthe bill for effect--perhaps an ironic effect--to remind us of the \nAmerican principle that gave birth to the Nation--that no man or woman \nshould be required to pay taxes to a government until represented by a \nvote on what that government does or requires.\n  No other taxpaying Americans are required to pay taxes without \nrepresentation in Congress. Indeed, residents of the District of \nColumbia are second per capita in taxes paid to the Federal \nGovernment--comparing them to all the States of the Union. Tax issues, \nof course, are some of the most contentious issues that come before the \nCongress. We cannot even begin to contemplate how our own constituents \nwould react if we could not vote one way or another on pending tax \nlegislation that would have so personal an effect on them.\n\n  I support voting rights for District residents for the same reason I \nsupport the historic election reform bill before us today. The great \nprinciple of voting rights is riding on both bills. I know the American \npeople believe their national credo requires that no taxpaying \nAmericans are to be excluded from voting representation in Congress. A \nnational public opinion poll suggests as much. The majority of \nAmericans believe that DC residents already have congressional voting \nrights. When informed that they do not, 80 percent say, around the \ncountry, that DC residents should have full representation.\n  Like the bill before us, our No Taxation Without Representation Act \nseeks to vindicate the precious right of voting representation. As I \nsaid at the outset, I do not intend to press for a vote on this \namendment at this time. That is a decision that I have made in \ncooperation with those in the District who most advocate voting rights, \nincluding Eleanor Holmes Norton. I raise voting rights for the citizens \nof our Capital during this discussion because these rights are a \nrelated issue of great importance to our country.\n  Last year was the 225th anniversary of the American Revolution, and \nthe 200th anniversary of the establishment of the Nation's Capital. The \nrevolutionaries who fought to establish our country, and later the wise \nFramers who wrote our Constitution, did not intend to penalize and deny \nbasic rights to the citizens who settled and built our Capital into a \ngreat American city. The city had not yet been established or come \nunder congressional jurisdiction when the Constitution was signed. In \nfact, the first DC residents continued to vote in Maryland and \nVirginia, the States from which the land for the District was ceded, \nfor 10 years following the ratification of the Constitution.\n  In placing our Capital under the jurisdiction of the Congress, the \nFramers intended to pass to us the responsibility, I believe, to assure \nthe rights of the citizens of the Capital once the city was \nestablished.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has failed to meet this obligation for more \nthan 200 years.\n  So I intend to withdraw this amendment. As I do, I ask that we \nreconsider the denial of voting representation to the citizens of our \nNation's Capital, those who live here at the heart of our democracy. \nThe time has long since passed for Congress to extend voting \nrepresentation to those who live where we do the people's business. I \nhope we will find a way to remedy this wrong soon.\n  I want to state that Senator Feingold is my cosponsor and, at the \nappropriate time, we will submit a statement for the record in support \nof this amendment. I now withdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Before he does that, I want to be added as a cosponsor as \nwell.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am honored to do it.\n  The amendment (No. 2889) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. DODD. There have been a number of proposals such as this \nthroughout the years for the District of Columbia to have \nrepresentation. It is one of the great travesties, in my view. Many \npeople live here. It has the population of many States, and they don't \nhave a vote or a voice in the Senate. They have a voice, but no vote, \nin the House of Representatives.\n  I appreciate the fact that we are not going to press the issue on \nthis bill. I commend the Senator for raising the issue, for \narticulating the point of view that I think many Americans, when \nconfronted with the facts, embrace. I think they are shocked to see \nthat this many people are excluded from representation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, there is no value we can attach to the \nmost basic right of every citizen living in a democracy. The right to \nvote is much more than dropping a ballot in a box. The right to vote \nsymbolizes freedom, equality, and participation in the government that \ncreates the laws and policies under which we all live. This is why I \nrise today, in support of Senator Lieberman's D.C. voting rights \namendment.\n\n[[Page S823]]\n\n  Under our representational democracy, every American is entitled to a \nvoting voice in Congress, a voice that seeks to speak for their \ninterests and present their needs, unless you live in the District of \nColumbia.\n  When the District of Columbia was created as the United States \nCapital 200 years ago, its residents lost their right to congressional \nrepresentation. It is time for us to right this wrong.\n  District of Columbia residents serve in the U.S. armed forces, and \nsome of them are currently overseas fighting in our war on terrorism. \nD.C. residents fought and died in the Vietnam war. They keep our \nFederal Government and capital city running, day and night. They pay \nFederal taxes. And yet they have no voice. We fail to give them a say \non even basic administrative matters that other states and cities \ndecide for themselves. D.C. residents can fight and die in the name of \ntheir country, but they can't implement a local budget without the \napproval of Congress.\n  What makes this inequity particularly egregious is that District of \nColumbia residents, like all Americans, pay Federal taxes. So while the \nrest of the Nation benefits from our victory in the Revolutionary War, \nthe voice of D.C. residents continues the rallying cry, ``No taxation \nwithout representation.'' This founding principle of our Nation, which \nso vigorously carried us to our Nation's independence, has still not \nbeen honored for this group of Americans.\n  There are approximately 490,000 Americans living in the State of \nWyoming. Residents of Wyoming have three voting voices in Congress. \nThere are 550,000 Americans living in Washington, D.C. These Americans, \nhowever, purely due to the location of their residence, have no \nrepresentative with full voting authority in either the House or \nSenate. D.C. has one delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, but she does not \nenjoy the same right to participate in decision-making as her \ncolleagues. And, of course, D.C. has no representation in the Senate. \nThis is not equal representation. It is unequal representation. It is \nwrong. It is un-American. And it should end.\n  Virtually every other nation, from Albania to Zimbabwe, grants the \nresidents of their capital cities equal representation in their \nlegislature. It is simply an embarrassment that in these modern times, \nwe, as the world's most powerful democracy, are denying suffrage to \nhalf a million Americans.\n  Since the ratification of the Constitution in 1788, the United States \nhas forged its own suffrage history, overcoming the denial of access \nand extending voting rights to all Americans regardless of race, \ngender, wealth, marital status, or land ownership. Through our \ninterpretation of the one-person/one-vote doctrine, we have made great \nstrides in overcoming inequality and underrepresentation. There \nremains, however, this suffrage hurdle: the disenfranchisement of \n550,000 District of Columbia residents.\n  This hurdle has been recognized by Republicans and Democrats alike. \nIn 1978, Congress debated and passed a Constitutional amendment \ngranting D.C. voting representation. Then-Senator Bob Dole said:\n\n       The Republican party supported DC voting representation \n     because it was just, and in justice we could do nothing else.\n\n  The 1976 Democratic and Republican platforms were almost identical on \nthis issue, the Republican platform stating:\n\n       We support giving the District of Columbia voting \n     representation in the U.S. Senate and House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  The Democratic platform echoed:\n\n       We support full Home Rule for the District of Columbia, \n     including full voting representation in the Congress.\n\n  Unfortunately, since 1978, the Senate has not considered this \nimportant issue.\n  President Lincoln spoke of a ``government of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people.'' This guiding principle has sustained \nAmerica throughout some of her most trying times. Shouldn't the people \nwho work and reside in the presence of this former president's \nmonument, and who have contributed so much to making our Nation the \ngreat nation that it is, have the right to live by this ideal?\n  It is time to address this injustice. At a time when the Senate is \ndebating election reform and reflecting on issues like antiquated \nvoting machines, the Senate should also address one of the oldest and \nmost egregious violations of the fundamental right to vote--the lack of \nfull voting representation in Congress for D.C. residents.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman for offering this important amendment, and \nI urge my colleagues to join our effort to allow D.C. residents to \nenjoy the full rights and privileges of American citizenship.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut for his kind words and for his leadership.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment offered by Senator Burns \nbe set aside for a moment so I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, is this another amendment?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thought that the Senator from Montana \nwas going to be able to go after the first amendment. I had an \namendment on the death tax and small business depreciation. We were \ntrying to expedite the procedure. I ask how long this amendment will \ntake.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. My statement will take, at most, 10 minutes. I think \nthe understanding, I say through the Chair, is that I would make a \nstatement on behalf of DC voting rights and withdraw it and then \nproceed to an amendment, which may engender debate on the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2890\n\n  Madam President, I have amendment No. 2890 at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2890.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, this amendment will address one of the most critical \nproblems in our electoral process. It is consistent with the overall \npurpose of the bill, and that is the pressing need for more trained and \nable poll workers to serve during Federal elections.\n  Obviously, our democracy is run by a cast of millions of voters who \ndeserve to cast their ballots in the full confidence that they will be \ncounted. This landmark legislation will provide much needed funding to \nStates and localities to improve voting systems and standards, to \ncreate computerized statewide voter registration systems, to improve \naccessibility for voters with disabilities, and it will provide \nprovisional voting so that all eligible voters who go to the polls can \nbe assured they can cast their vote.\n  These are all very important improvements, the fruit of constructive, \nbroad-ranging, and bipartisan discussion on election reform that has \nbeen conducted over the last 14 months and led with great purpose and \nability by my friend and colleague from Connecticut.\n  However, comparatively little attention has been paid to solving \nanother problem that affects our electoral process, and that is the \ndifficulty that local jurisdictions have in recruiting and training \nenough people to work at the polls on election day.\n  We need an army of trained, responsible, reliable, experienced people \nto work at the polls on election day to ensure that the laws we adopt, \nincluding the one before us, are implemented fully and that the \nelections are conducted efficiently and fairly. Right now, from all \nthat the experts tell us, that army of poll workers is without \nsufficient support. There are not enough troops to carry out \nthe responsibilities that they have. In fact, the General Accounting \nOffice, the National Commission on Election Reform, which was chaired \nby former Presidents Carter and Ford, and a host of others who have \nexamined the whole question of the way we cast our votes, have \ndocumented the extent of this problem of inadequacy of numbers of poll \nworkers.\n\n  In most locations, the recruiting and training of qualified poll \nworkers is one of the most crucial, yet difficult, tasks that election \nofficials face. Fifty-seven percent of local election officials \nresponding to a GAO mail survey said they encountered major problems in \nconducting the 2000 election.\n  GAO estimated that more than half of the election jurisdictions \nencountered problems finding a sufficient number of poll workers. I \nrepeat that. GAO estimated that more than half of the election \njurisdictions in the United States in the 2000 Presidential election \nhad problems finding a sufficient number of poll workers.\n  There are many reasons why local jurisdictions have had these \ndifficulties. Obviously, the hours are long, the pay is low, and \nfunding for training workers is in short supply. That is a particular \nproblem given the fact that advanced new voting systems that will be \nunfamiliar to many voters will soon be deployed in many jurisdictions \nas a result of the difficulties in the 2000 election and, in fact, \nhopefully as a result of the funding and requirements established and \nprovided for in this bill.\n  Many poll workers are now drawn from the ranks of senior citizens and \nretirees. This legislation already addresses some of these issues by \nproviding States with additional funding and holding them accountable \nfor improving management of the polling place, but we can and should do \nmore.\n  We often lament how voter turnout rates have fallen in our democracy. \nI regret today that given our shortage of poll workers, if our dreams \nof civic participation were to become true and voter turnout were to \nsurge upward, it would present a logistical nightmare in many \njurisdictions because the poll workers are stretched, stressed, and \nstrained as it is, and they need their ranks to be bolstered.\n  I support such efforts as those in the legislation passed by our \ncolleagues in the other body to encourage students to become active in \npolitics and work at the polls. However, I do not think that is enough. \nWe need to do more.\n  Fortunately, there is an able reserve force of civic-minded people. I \nam speaking of Federal employees. I am convinced many are ready to \nspring into action if they are encouraged to do so by a law and their \nagencies. I believe the Federal Government should welcome its \nemployees' service on the front lines of our democracy.\n  This amendment would allow Federal civil servants, not political \nappointees, to take time off with pay for training and then to work as \nnonpartisan poll workers in Federal elections. We are not talking about \nelection workers for either party but nonpartisan poll workers. Most \ncivil servants demonstrate daily they have the temperament and maturity \nnecessary to serve citizens at the polls.\n  Moreover, because many Federal employees are bilingual, they would be \na particular asset to foreign-language-speaking voters, addressing yet \nanother problem facing many jurisdictions as they organize elections.\n  I stress that this amendment would authorize civil servants to be \npaid by their agency only to work in nonpartisan capacities. Anyone who \nwants to serve in a partisan capacity must do so on their own time at \ntheir own expense.\n\n  I am also not proposing in this amendment that we establish a general \nelection day holiday for all Federal employees. That is a separate \nquestion which we are not touching in this amendment.\n  Under the amendment, employees who want to participate would be \nallowed to do so unless their absence would impede the agency's ability \nto accomplish its mission. That is an exception written into the \namendment which would be exercised by their supervisors.\n  Employees' service at the polls would have to be substantiated in \nwriting by election officials and would be limited to up to 3 days with \npay in any single calendar year. The Office of Personnel Management \nwould be required to draft regulations to provide guidance to agencies \nand employees on how to fulfill the intent of this amendment and to \nreport to Congress on how they are doing.\n  It is important to note that there is some precedent for this idea. \nFederal employees under law are now serving in nonpartisan capacities \nas examiners and observers under a provision of the 1965 Voting Rights \nAct. During fiscal year 2000, the Office of Personnel Management \nprovided some 550 observers and 40 examiners, either current or retired \nemployees, to work in 10 States. They worked in areas where there were \nallegations of racial or ethnic discrimination in the voting process or \nin areas where jurisdictions have not provided the required language \nassistance or ballot translation. So there is a precedent for what I am \nproposing.\n  There is no way to predict with any degree of certainty how many of \nthe 2.8 million Federal civilian employees who live and work in \njurisdictions across the country would be willing to receive training \nand work at polls under this amendment, but Los Angeles County\n\n[[Page S825]]\n\nhas already implemented a similar program for its employees, and the \nresults have been very encouraging. In fact, because of those results, \nthe State of California passed legislation encouraging its employees to \nserve as poll workers as well.\n  If the Federal Government leads by example and implements this \namendment, I am hopeful we will see the same thing happen across \nAmerica, and State and local governments, perhaps even private \nemployers, will follow suit to strengthen the implementation of our \nelection laws, their fairness, and the health of our democracy.\n  I believe we would be remiss in passing this excellent broad \nlegislation aimed at improving our election system without also \nproviding a way to have an influx of new, trained, experienced workers \nto implement the rights we are securing with this proposal.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. First of all, let me again commend my colleague from \nConnecticut for a very helpful proposal. I do not know if we are going \nto adopt this today. I do not know how the votes would come out on all \nof this, but I think the idea of making elections more accessible and \nmaking available the opportunity for people to participate more is a \ngood idea. As the Senator pointed out, Congressman Hoyer in the House-\npassed version of this bill has a provision that actually encourages \nthe participation of college students in the electoral process, \nvolunteers.\n  Our colleague from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes, has a similar proposal \nhe intends to offer at some point before final passage of this bill, as \nwell as Senator Hollings and Senator Boxer. I can think of several \nothers who have proposed the idea. Senator Byrd has had a strong \ninterest in the idea of a holiday or a day other than the first Tuesday \nafter the first Monday as a way to increase citizen participation in \nelections.\n  What the Senator from Connecticut has offered is, of course, a way in \nthe interim period for people who will be able to take time away from \ntheir jobs to deal obviously with Federal elections and to be \nvolunteers. So I am very attracted to his proposal.\n  What I am going to recommend is we might set aside this amendment \nwhile we consider two or three other amendments, and then ask for these \nvotes, if the Senator so insists on a recorded vote, to occur at a time \nwe can determine shortly after we consider the Burns amendment, the \nNelson and Graham amendments, maybe those three, as a way of trying to \ndeal with some amendments en bloc.\n  My colleague from Connecticut and the Senator from Missouri may want \nto respond, or the Senator from Kentucky, to the amendment of the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  In the interim, let me say it is about 10 minutes of 4 p.m. I urge \nMembers to come or send staff over. We have a long list of amendments. \nI have shown the list before. There are Senators who have indicated \nthey may be interested in offering amendments. I also know they may not \nbe interested. But at 5 p.m., if I have not heard from Senators, I am \ngoing to draw the conclusion that they are not necessarily interested \nin offering it at this time or on this bill. So Senators have an hour \nto let us know whether or not they intend to move forward so we can \ncome up with a list of amendments, maybe settle on some times and \nresolve many of them.\n  I think we can probably come to agreement on some of the amendments \nwithout votes in order to move this product along. So by 5 p.m., if I \nhave not heard from Senators, I am going to assume that their amendment \nwould not be offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague from Connecticut. I would turn over \nthe time arrangements to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, who \nis the ranking member and is responsible on this side for managing the \nbill, but I wanted to comment on a few items.\n  My good friend from Connecticut, the other Senator from Connecticut, \nhas raised some points. I come at it from a very different perspective. \nI want to share that very briefly.\n  No. 1, I wholeheartedly agree that many of the problems we have in \nelections today arise from the lack of dedicated, partisan poll workers \nand watchers looking over each other's shoulders in the election booth. \nThis is where a lot of the problems can be cleaned up.\n\n  I am most interested and will look with a great deal of interest on \nany recommendations where we can get the young college Democrats and \nRepublicans to be involved in the elections because what elections need \nare partisans who are aggressive and informed and will provide a check \non each other to make sure the voter hears both sides and makes sure \nnobody who may vote for one side or another is not given full \ninformation.\n  Precisely for that reason, I question whether we ought to be \nreleasing a whole group of Federal employees, who have important \nresponsibilities serving us on a day-to-day basis, from their \nresponsibilities to be nonpartisan poll workers. I want the biggest \npartisans in the world.\n  We had a mess in Missouri, as I have described, when I ran for \nGovernor in 1972. I vowed to clean it up. I got the meanest Republicans \nI could find to serve on the election board as my representatives in \nthe major metropolitan areas. I went to my friends who were the \nDemocratic leaders of the Missouri General Assembly and I got them to \nnominate for me some of the meanest partisan--well, they were nice \npeople but some of the very toughest, most committed partisan \nDemocrats. They watched each other, and the system worked. That is how \nthe system works. It is the partisans.\n  I think there is a great role, and I respect those who are totally \nnonpartisan, but I do not want them looking out for my interests in the \npolling booth. So I have real reservations about trying to put \nnonpartisans into partisan elections.\n  One other thing: We have so many of the folks back in the country \nwhere I am from who, if they thought Federal employees were coming in \nto their local elections, would think of civil disturbances because \nthis would not sit well in a few areas of my State, and I perhaps would \nsuggest Montana might find that to be a bit objectionable.\n  So I commend the Senator from Connecticut for his idea, but I think \nit is searching for a question rather than a solution to the problems \nwe have.\n  I turn it over to the managers to determine any arrangements that \nneed to be made, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, in response to my friend from \nMissouri, I suppose I should start by saying I admire his respect for \nchecks and balances, and there are some partisan workers at polling \nplaces, but the problem highlighted by the GAO study and by the \ncommission headed by Presidents Carter and Ford was the simple \ninability for a lot of local jurisdictions around the country to find \nan adequate number of people to staff the polls, not partisan \npositions, and there is a way in which there is enough political \nbattle, partisan battle, that goes on to excess that when one gets to \nthe polling place, they would like to believe there were some people \nthere whose responsibility simply was to protect their right to vote \nand make sure their vote was counted, and those are the nonpartisan \nofficials in every election jurisdiction across this country. So that \nis what these Federal employees would be able to do.\n  I assure my friend from Missouri this is not going to be a Federal \ninvasion of the local election process. This is very much a voluntary \nissue, which is, if local election officials want someone living in \ntheir town, their neighbor presumably, maybe even their friend, though \na Federal worker, perhaps even a trusted friend, to work in the polling \nplace, then that would give the Federal employee the opportunity to \ntake the day off with pay. They would not receive any pay from the \nlocalities. This would actually be a help to the local governments. \nThey would get not only first-class, nonpartisan poll workers but would \nnot have to pay for them. That is what this is all about.\n\n  I thank Senator Dodd for the time he has given me. I will move in a \nmoment to set the amendment aside, but I do want a recorded vote, so I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S826]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment now be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, we have been talking about poll workers, \nand we would be remiss if we did not point out, because there are \nliterally thousands of people across this country every election day, \nnot just on the first Tuesday after the first Monday but also referenda \nthat occur in our States and communities all during the year, that \nthese are dedicated volunteers. It is really a remarkable thing, \ndespite the shortcomings in the process today, that from the beginning \nof our Nation's history it has been voluntary citizens who have offered \ntheir time at all the polling precincts across the country to \nparticipate in the election process of the country.\n  I would not want the day nor the discussion to end and not point out \nthat we have great respect and admiration for these people throughout \nthe years who have given so much of their time and effort to see to it \nthat the election process works in this country.\n\n  The Senator from Connecticut, my colleague, made a wonderful \nsuggestion for expanding the ranks of people who would like to do this. \nSenator Sarbanes, I believe, will offer an amendment to encourage young \npeople in college to get involved. We ought to applaud the efforts \nwhile we simultaneously thank those who have given so much.\n  I urge Members--and I think my colleague from Kentucky will do the \nsame--if Members have amendments, get them over here and talk to our \nstaffs to shorten the list and complete the bill, hopefully.\n  I yield 20 minutes to my colleague from Montana, and I ask unanimous \nconsent to consider the amendment of the Senator from Montana, with the \n20 minutes equally divided on both sides, pros and cons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2887\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my good friend from Connecticut. I call up my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. BURNS. This is a simple amendment that allows clerks and \nrecorders and election directors in each of the counties to purge their \nlists. I am sure all States have college towns with a transient \npopulation. In Missoula County, there are currently 86,266 registered \nvoters. What is noteworthy about that is, of the 86,266 registered \nvoters, there are only 76,067 eligible voters. We have over 10,000 \nvoters, 1 out of 8 registered, that our election officials are required \nto keep on the list but who cannot vote in the county. That is only one \ncounty in one State across this Nation.\n  If we are going to suggest changes in the way we cast our votes on \nthe national level, it makes sense to allow election administrators to \npurge their lists in less than 8 years. Right now, the legislation \ncalls for that purge every other Presidential election, or every 8 \nyears. I suggest in my amendment we do it after two Federal elections \nto make sure the list they have is accurate and it is not outdated. Not \npurging leads to mischief, it invites fraud, but it also jeopardizes \nthe integrity of one of our basic fundamental rights; that is, the \nright to vote. It is a simple amendment. It is an amendment that needs \nto be implemented.\n  We have counties that have a population of only 1,800 people with \n2,500 square miles in the county, and we cannot purge those lists in \nthose counties.\n  We have some polling places that have no electricity.\n  Everybody found that sort of humorous. Imagine the migration from the \nrural areas to cities, which is quite evident in my State. Some old \ncountry schoolhouses have been maintained but have no electricity. The \nonly heat is an old potbellied stove. But they become a polling place \nduring elections. There is no telephone, no electricity, and they are \nlit by lantern. It works very well. We do not want to change that.\n\n  This amendment calls for the purge of the lists after every other \nFederal election is held, meaning it would be purged after 4 years. And \nthat is a long time. It makes good sense. It is common sense that we do \nit this way. It helps out in handling the expenses of counties in \nconducting elections.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 16 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my good friend from Montana, with whom all Members \nenjoy a wonderful relationship, a basic problem is not only should the \npeople have the right to vote, they should all have the right not to \nvote. If people decide they do not want to vote--we would like them to \nvote, we hope they do, but citizens from time to time decide, for \nwhatever reason, they do not want to participate in an election or two. \nThat should not automatically result in their being purged from the \nlist in the community in which they reside.\n  We worked hard in this bill to come up with a centralized, statewide \nvoter registration system, which is going to be a major step, as the \nSenator from Missouri has pointed out, in dealing with fraud. As part \nof that, we drafted a uniform standard for purging those lists so we \nhave the same standards to apply around the country. Obviously, we know \nthere are differences in the country from one place to the next.\n  This is not an onerous burden at all, in our view. It is a provision \nthat took a lot of time to work out. This would flip motor-voter on its \nhead and allow jurisdictions to purge voters for not voting. That has \nnever been the intent.\n  With a great deal of respect for my colleague from Montana, I urge \nthe defeat of this amendment. I think this would be a major setback for \na carefully crafted bill. I point out to my colleagues, we tried to \ncraft a piece of bipartisan legislation. In so doing, it means we have \nto accept provisions that you might not have written yourself, and you \nfight to have provisions you care deeply about to be included. That is \nwhat this legislation reflects. To change the purging requirements on \nthis basis would be a major setback in that effort.\n  For those reasons, I urge the rejection of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has consumed \napproximately 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. If the Senator from Connecticut would yield me 1 minute, \nMadam President, as the Senator mentioned, this is one of the \nprovisions on which we worked long and hard. I advocated greater \nflexibility for purging. But at the same time, I was asking for more \ncontrols over mail-in registrations, making sure we had live people \nvoting once, not dead people, not dogs. We came to a compromise in our \nnegotiations that obviously went further than the other side would like \non verifying mail-in registration and didn't go as far as I would like \non the punching.\n  I will vote with my friend from Connecticut, although I believe and I \nam quite confident that the Senator from Montana has pointed out some \nreal problems. I hope perhaps we could in conference continue the \ndiscussion to make sure we keep the voting lists clean. That is not \njust a problem for preventing fraud, that is a problem for assuring \nthere is not unnecessary hassle or delay with the people who want to \nvote.\n  Clean, adequate, statewide registration rolls make it easier to vote \nand tougher to cheat. I hope we can have further discussions in this \narea to make sure we provide the best tools possible to the State and \nlocal officials while maintaining the basic goals of the Federal \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I think this gets down to where we really \nwant to be in cleaning up this situation on voting lists, \nregistrations, and everything that goes with elections. Whenever you \nhave a list that is inaccurate, whether it be by address or by name or \nby whatever, and there is a huge list of names on the inactive list, \nthis absolutely invites fraud and mischief. It also invites the \nsituation where, if you are a voter and you want to vote and that list \nis inaccurate, you may not be able or allowed to vote.\n  That is why the purge of the list at least every 4 years is \nnecessary. I am adamant on this because I come out of county \ngovernment. I was just a little, old county commissioner, but I \nunderstand the challenges one has putting on elections. I also \nunderstand the cost. I also understand what it costs to\n\n[[Page S827]]\n\nmaintain a database that is accessible and easy to change as the times \nor the circumstance would suggest.\n  This may be a part of our problem in facing the challenges of \nelections, trying to keep ``one vote, one person'' and making sure that \nperson is on the list and can vote.\n  I ask support of my amendment. I understand the work the managers \nhave done on this legislation. I fully understand that and I fully \nunderstand where they come from. But as we move forward, if we have \ndifficulties and we see the difficulties of maintaining the lists, then \nwe can also reconsider this at a later time.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of the managers, and my good friend from \nConnecticut, and I will yield the remainder of my time, but first I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back my time as well. I ask unanimous consent the \namendment of the Senator from Montana be temporarily laid aside so we \ncan stack some votes. We will turn now to my colleague from Florida to \noffer another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2904\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk. This is an amendment offered by Senator Graham and me.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for himself and Mr. \n     Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 2904.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Attorney General to submit to Congress reports \non the investigation of the Department of Justice regarding violations \n       of voting rights in the 2000 elections for Federal office)\n\n       On page 68, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REPORTS ON VOTING RIGHTS \n                   VIOLATIONS IN THE 2000 ELECTIONS.\n\n       (a) Status Reports.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than the date that is 60 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, and each 60 days \n     thereafter until the investigation of the Attorney General \n     regarding violations of voting rights that occurred during \n     the elections for Federal office conducted in November 2000 \n     (in this section referred to as the ``investigation'') has \n     concluded, the Attorney General shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the status of the investigation.\n       (2) Contents.--The report submitted under subsection (a) \n     shall contain the following:\n       (A) An accounting of the resources that the Attorney \n     General has committed to the investigation prior to the date \n     of enactment of this Act and an estimate of the resources \n     that the Attorney General intends to commit to the \n     investigation after such date.\n       (B) The date on which the Attorney General intends to \n     conclude the investigation.\n       (C) A description of the measures that the Attorney General \n     has taken to ensure that the voting rights violations that \n     are the subject of the investigation do not occur during \n     subsequent elections for Federal office.\n       (D) A description of any potential prosecutions for voting \n     rights violations resulting from the investigation and the \n     range of potential punishments for such violations.\n       (b) Final Report.--Not later than the date that is 60 days \n     after the date of the conclusion of the investigation, the \n     Attorney General shall submit to Congress a final report on \n     the investigation that contains a summary of each preventive \n     action and each punitive action taken by the Attorney General \n     as part of the investigation and a justification for each \n     action taken.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, Senator Graham and I are \noffering an amendment which would require the Attorney General to \nreport to Congress on the status of the Justice Department's \ninvestigation into alleged voting rights violations during the 2000 \nelection.\n  The Attorney General promised to deliver this information during his \nSenate confirmation, but 1 year later we are still in the dark. We have \nnot been getting these reports. Senator Graham and I have sent letters. \nThat did produce a meeting with Justice Department officials.\n  We asked that a report be sent to us monthly. It has not. One or at \nmost two reports out of 12 months have been sent to us.\n  I regret this legislation is necessary, but the Department has left \nus with no other option. Senator Graham and I have repeatedly asked the \nVoting Rights Office to fulfill the Attorney General's promise, and \neach time we have requested this status report the Voting Rights Office \nhas promised to comply, yet we have received almost nothing over a 12-\nmonth period. That is not the way government is supposed to work.\n  So we come to the Senate today to ask that the Department's behavior \nchange. We think it is unacceptable. It directly contravenes the \nSenate's ability to exercise its oversight authority over these \ninvestigations.\n  As we have discussed earlier today on the election reform bill, our \nState is certainly riveted to the subject matter that we are discussing \ntoday and particularly now the amendment Senator Graham and I offer. \nThe people of Florida deserve answers about what went wrong in that \n2000 election, and we want to get some answers.\n  Basically, we want to know, how is the Justice Department \ninvestigation going? We want a status report. In our bill, we are \nasking for one every 2 months. Then we say, after the Attorney \nGeneral's office concludes their own investigation, that within 60 days \nthey report that to the Congress.\n  I express my support for the underlying bill and my thanks to \nSenators Dodd and McConnell for crafting a bill that will greatly \nimprove the election process. Nothing is more fundamental than the \nright to vote. We saw in the experience in Florida that there were some \nflaws in the system.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri, the ranking member, Senator \nMcConnell, and Senator Dodd for bringing such an important piece of \nlegislation to the floor.\n  I yield to my colleague from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we are here this afternoon largely because \nof the events which surrounded the election in November of 2000. Had \nthere not been the degree of turmoil and controversy and allegations, \nit is unlikely there would have been the public momentum that led to \nthe development of this very constructive national legislation that I \nhope we are about to adopt.\n  There have been other arenas which have been touched by the events of \nNovember 2000. Many of our State legislatures have adopted new \nprocedures, including voting machines, means by which voters will have \nan opportunity to have second ballot checks, and other methods, all of \nwhich are intended to assure that Americans will have the maximum \nopportunity within the law to participate in our democracy.\n  There is another forum, as my good friend and colleague has \nindicated, which has not been functioning as it indicated it would. \nThat is the executive responsibility.\n  In the past, this Congress has adopted a set of laws which represent \nthe national standards for elections. They are particularly sensitive \nto those voters who, maybe in the past, had a history of not having \nfull access to voting rights. As part of that process, if there are \nallegations of irregularities, they are referred to the Department of \nJustice for a review and then what action that review indicates is \nappropriate.\n  Florida was not the only State that was affected by the turmoil of \n2000. But because we happen to be the last State to have its turmoil \npacified, we received a particular amount of national attention. So \nthis issue is one especially deeply felt by the citizens of our State.\n  There is concern about what has happened to these allegations of \nirregularities that were submitted to the Department of Justice that \nhave not yet come to closure. As Senator Nelson has indicated, we have \nmade requests on a number of occasions to try to get an indication of \nwhere these reviews were and how close we were to getting a final \nresolution of these matters, and we have largely been rebuffed. I am \ndisappointed, frankly, that we have to offer this amendment which will \nrequire that in all of the areas where there is still an outstanding \nunresolved allegation of violation of Federal standards of election, \nand where the Department of Justice has not come to final closure, \nthere be, on a 60-day clock basis, a report to the Congress\n\n[[Page S828]]\n\nwhich wrote these laws that the Department of Justice is supposed to be \nenforcing, as to what is happening, and how close we are to getting to \na completion of this review.\n\n  This is intended to be a means by which the Congress can carry out \nits oversight responsibility and protect its laws--laws that, as I \nsaid, were particularly designed to protect the voting interests of all \nAmericans, especially those Americans who in the past have not had \nequal access to our democratic system.\n  I believe this is an appropriate congressional request for \ninformation which I hope will have the result of motivating the \nDepartment to complete its review, come to closure, and let us close \nthe chapter on the executive responsibility for the election. And I \nhope the Congress is soon going to, by adoption of this legislation, be \nclosing the chapter on our responsibility for this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, for the life of me, I cannot \nunderstand. I have just spoken to one of the floor managers of the \nbill. I thought this was an amendment that was noncontroversial. It is \nmy understanding that there is some objection to it.\n  Senator Graham and I have had a meeting with the staff of the \nDepartment of Justice. They have promised us on several occasions that \nthey would report to us on the status of the investigation as to \npotential voting rights violations in the Florida 2000 election.\n  The Department of Justice has not come through or followed up on this \npromise to report to us. The report was to be monthly. They haven't \neven reported to us in the last 6 months. It is about as \nnoncontroversial as anything.\n  Senator Graham and I are utilizing this vehicle to try to send a \nmessage that the executive branch of Government, when it makes a \npromise, has got to come through and honor their promise. This doesn't \nhave anything to do with partisan politics. It has to do with us \nwanting to know that, in fact, the investigation is being conducted and \nthat they are not sitting on their hands; that when they render their \nconclusions, they would deliver those conclusions to the Congress.\n  That can't be controversial. I don't want it to be controversial.\n  I am somewhat mystified that someone would put a partisan cast on \nthat.\n  If the manager of the bill is not going to be willing to accept what \nis on its face a noncontroversial amendment, then my statements have \nbeen very mild and very nonpartisan.\n  What we are trying to do is make government work. The executive \nbranch has a duty to respond to us in our oversight capacity. The two \nSenators from Florida have an interest in knowing that the \ninvestigation is continuing and that they are not sitting on their \nhands and report to the Congress once the conclusion is reached. We \ndon't say how long they have to do it. All we do in our amendment is \nsay every 2 months give a status report to the Congress. Then we say \nthat at the end of their investigation when they draw their conclusion, \nsend that report to the Congress.\n  I hope this is something that we don't have to spend time on. I ask \nthe Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Kentucky to please \nrecognize the bipartisan spirit in which this amendment is being \noffered and not have us go through a harangue here. I urgently plead, \nplease accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have worked hard and long on a bipartisan \nbasis to try to fix a lot of problems we saw in the past without going \nback to look at the problems that arose in the 2000 election, the 2001 \nelection in my State, and others.\n  Frankly, there is some concern on this side of the aisle. The \namendment is designed with the likelihood of reigniting a controversy \nthat we thought we put aside. I agree 100 percent that Congress has a \nright, in its oversight responsibilities, to ask for reports from every \nagency of the executive branch. Frankly, that is what oversight \nhearings are for in the authorizing committees. That is what oversight \nhearings are for in the Appropriations Committee.\n  I have asked very difficult questions of agencies, both under \nDemocratic and Republican Presidents. I think, frankly, in the last 8 \nyears I didn't get a heck of a lot of answers. But I don't think that \nwe bring the oversight fights to this body and try to get the body on \nrecord with what has been in the past a very political controversy.\n  Frankly, the Department of Justice has under consideration the \nallegations of criminal activity engaged in by the Gore-Lieberman \ncampaign in both St. Louis and Kansas City. We pointed out that in \nthose two areas, almost identical petitions were filed within 14 \nminutes of each other. Fortunately, the lawsuit was thrown out in \nKansas City. But the judge initially ruled in favor of Gore-Lieberman \nin St. Louis. That is the time we found out that the person who was \nalleged to have been denied a right to vote had been dead for 15 \nmonths, which was probably a slightly greater impediment to him voting. \nThat matter has been referred to the Department of Justice.\n  I don't think we need to go down the path of making a formal \nlegislative finding that they should report on that. I am disappointed \nthat we seem to be getting back into this battle by opening up the \ncontroversies of the 2000 election.\n  I urge my colleagues to ask in oversight committees when the \nrepresentatives of the Department of Justice are there to speak for \nthemselves, what the status is or why there is no report. I think we \nshould not burden the bill that we are fighting to keep a bipartisan \nbill with something that smells to some on my side as an effort to \nreinject a partisan battle. This is all very partisan, I know, when it \ngets to elections. I believe you need to have good Republicans and good \nDemocrats on both sides.\n  I just hope the distinguished Senators from Florida, for whom I have \ngreat admiration, would use the oversight hearings to ask the questions \nof the Department of Justice.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't believe in negotiating in public. \nThis is not just an intellectual exercise for our colleagues from \nFlorida because the entire world inhabited their State for a number of \nweeks, and the entire world watched on an excruciating basis, hour \nafter hour of voting precincts, what they went through. It was a \ntremendous ordeal that the State of Florida went through.\n  My colleagues are being mild in their expression of the frustration \ntheir constituents felt.\n  I also understand the point my friend from Missouri raised. We said \nover and over again that this bill is about the future and not about \nthe past. We are trying to deal with not only the situation in Florida, \nor one election, but, rather, a condition that has grown over the years \nof a corroding and deteriorating condition of the election process in \nAmerica, that was reflected by what happened in the year 2000 but not \nexclusively so. We wanted to get away from the notion of examining, \nthrough this vehicle anyway, what had happened last year.\n\n  I think there is some frustration that my colleagues feel, however, \nabout whether or not the Department of Justice is going to respond to \ninquiries they have made.\n  I recommend that maybe there ought to be a willingness to sign onto a \nletter asking them to give answers, rather than getting involved in a \ndebate, and a vote, however it breaks down on party lines, inviting \nmore action.\n  We all know the frustration in asking an agency of the Government to \nrespond to us, and they do not do it. If that has been the case here, \nthen maybe our colleagues, as coequals, deserve to be heard. If they \nare not responding to our colleagues, that is wrong. Whatever the \nresults may be, they deserve answers. I think that is what they are \nasking; to be heard from and given answers.\n  So I might suggest that maybe a letter could be crafted, on a \nbipartisan basis, which we could sign and get to the Department of \nJustice, and ask for those answers to come back to our two colleagues. \nIf any of our States went through what they went through, we would want \nnothing less. So it is a way of maybe getting away from this particular \nprocess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as usual, the Senator from Connecticut\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\nhas found a reasoned way to resolve this issue and avoid some of the \nconcerns that the Senator from Missouri expressed.\n  As we mentioned during the conversation we had in the Senator's \noffice about 10 days ago, Senator Nelson and I are very supportive of \nthe underlying legislation. We do not want to be, in any way, an \nobstacle to its successful passage.\n  We do have this issue. I might say, Florida is not the only State \nwhere there are unresolved allegations of irregularities.\n  Mr. DODD. No.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The amendment we offered was not State specific. We are \nrequesting wherever there is yet an open file of an allegation of \nirregularity in the Department of Justice, the Department periodically \nreport as to how they are progressing so that eventually there will be \nclosure. We do not want to get to 2004 and still have open cases from \nthe year 2000 election.\n  The Senator's committee is the committee that has jurisdiction over \nthese issues. Witness the fact you produced this excellent piece of \nlegislation. So if your committee could accomplish what, frankly, \nSenator Nelson and I have been frustrated in our efforts to do for the \nlast several months, which is to get a status report--I would hope you \nwould be asking for all States, but we would particularly urge that you \ndo it for our State--that would satisfy our goal, which is to get to \nclosure, not to do so in a particular process, whether it is \nlegislation or otherwise.\n  The Senator has suggested a process that seems very reasonable. If \nyou think you would be willing to do so, we will be pleased to accept \nthe Senator's generous offer and leave.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate my colleague's comments.\n  I turn to my colleague from Kentucky for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut, \nthe chairman of the committee, for an excellent suggestion.\n  I also thank the Senators from Florida for being willing to take this \nparticular path. It certainly simplifies our lives and hopefully gets \nthe response the Senators are seeking as well.\n  I have talked to Senator Bond. He also agrees.\n  So it seems to me that is a good solution to the issue.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2904 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw the amendment based on the representations by the Rules \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. What we are looking for are some answers. We \nthank you for helping us achieve that.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, they have every right to those answers. We \nwill do everything we can to craft a request to see to it they get \nthose answers.\n  Mr. President, the pending amendment is the Kyl amendment, as I \nunderstand it. And we made a request earlier that Senator Kyl of \nArizona come to the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Lieberman \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Lieberman is pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Connecticut, we may be in a \nposition to dispose of the Kyl amendment. I am sure that Senator \nLieberman would not mind if we set his amendment aside in order to \nachieve that.\n  I understand Senator Kyl is on his way and should be in the Chamber \nmomentarily.\n  Mr. DODD. Why don't we wait for Senator Kyl to come. He is going to \nbe here shortly.\n  I would like to engage in a colloquy with him about some concerns \nabout his amendment, ones I think he may be able to address in a \ncolloquy. We might be able to then accept that amendment and then go to \nthe Lieberman amendment and then the Burns amendment and vote on those. \nI think that is where we would be at that point. We would have cleaned \nup at least existing matters.\n  We still obviously have outstanding issues. I made the point earlier, \nand would ask my colleague from Kentucky to join me in this request to \nour colleagues, please bring over or have your staff bring over \namendments, if you care about them.\n  We have a long list. It may be that you have decided you do not \nparticularly want to offer your amendment, but I have it here. If I do \nnot hear from you by 5 o'clock, I am going to assume you decided you \nwill wait for another day.\n  We can get a list made up so that either tonight--we may not have \nvotes after 5:30, 6 o'clock, but that will be up to the leaders, but at \nleast we will be able to dispose of some amendments that we can get an \nagreement on, or set up a schedule tomorrow, very early, so we might be \nable to dispose of this bill. I still hope that is possible. I realize \nthat diminishes as each hour passes, but that may be the case.\n  So unless you feel a burning, overwhelming desire to bring your \namendment up--and if that is the case, please let us know immediately--\nwe are going to assume that you have decided to defer to another time.\n  My colleague may want to join me in that request while we are waiting \nfor Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes. I say to my friend from Connecticut, we \noriginally hoped we would finish today. That may be fading on us, but \nhope springs eternal, and I suppose the possibility of having the \nrecess begin tomorrow is not completely over but looking unlikely.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Lieberman \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. What is the pending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The McConnell second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me describe what I think may occur. One is to accept \nthe McConnell amendment to the Kyl amendment, first of all. That would \nbe routine. Then I would like to engage my friend from Arizona in a \ncolloquy about his amendment and what it does--there was some confusion \nabout what the effect of the amendment would be in the earlier debate--\nand to raise some issues which he and I have already discussed in \nprivate around this amendment. He is very sensitive to these questions.\n  My intention is to accept this amendment with the McConnell second-\ndegree amendment and then have a colloquy as to what the effect of this \namendment would be, with the further understanding that between now and \nthe completion of this bill, we may not be able to get all the answers \nwe would like from the Social Security Administration of their views on \nthis and what the effect of it could be. We will try and do that before \nwe get to conference. If there are problems we can't identify at this \nmoment that may emerge, we will try to address those in conference. \nThat is really the gist of what I want to get to.\n  Let me turn to my colleague to once again briefly describe his \namendment. We will have a colloquy, and then we can move to accept \nthat, my hope is, and then have the two recorded votes on the Lieberman \nand Burns amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2891\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the comments of the \nSenator from Connecticut. I will describe again what we intend this to \ndo. The language does do it, especially with the second-degree \namendment that has been accepted that the Senator from Kentucky \noffered.\n  This amendment allows what 11 States currently are allowed to do and \n7 actually do do, which is to use Social Security numbers to validate \npeople for voter registration purposes. When the Privacy Act was \nadopted, those States were grandfathered. The other States were \nprohibited from doing this. There are several States that request\n\n[[Page S830]]\n\nSocial Security numbers but don't require them. This would simply allow \nbut not mandate States to request or to require Social Security numbers \nas one of the methods of identification.\n  To the two specific points Senator Dodd raised, it is our intention, \nI reiterate--it is clear in the amendment language--that this is \nvoluntary, not mandatory. No State would have to do this. And, of \ncourse, any State that did do it would have to meet all constitutional \nrequirements, could not violate any privacy requirements, and so forth.\n  Secondly, it is not our intention that this would be in any way an \nexclusive method of identification and that States should not, as a \nresult, use Social Security numbers as the only way of validating the \nidentity of the person being registered or the person whose name is \nbeing expunged from the rolls or for whatever purpose they would use \nit.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is correct in his understanding. I think \nthe language is clear. We need to work with the Social Security \nAdministration or others during the continued progress of this bill. It \nis certainly our intention to do that to ensure that this intention is \ncarried out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona. I have \nsaid it already--he has repeated it--but just to clarify, there is \nnothing in this amendment that would mandate the use of the Social \nSecurity identification number by any State; is that correct?\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator from Connecticut is exactly correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Secondly, any State that would use only a Social Security \nnumber as a means of identification would also be prohibited under the \nlaw; is that not correct?\n  Mr. KYL. It would be our intention to ensure that is the case, with \nonly one caveat. The seven States that currently do this legally, I am \nnot sure exactly what their laws say, and it is not our intention here \nto deal with those one way or the other. Those are all grandfathered \nin. I suspect they at least require an address, if not something else. \nThe State should require something else.\n  It is our intention, at least prospectively, with our amendment, that \nthey should and would.\n  Mr. DODD. If we look at this, maybe if it is in conference or before \nthe conclusion of the bill, with a technical amendment to accomplish \nwhatever it may be, I ask my colleague if he would be willing to accept \nsuch language in order to clarify that.\n  Mr. KYL. For that explicit purpose, yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for his answers to those questions.\n  I point out, the Social Security Administration doesn't like the \nSocial Security card being used for identification purposes. I know \npeople do it, but it makes them nervous. Obviously, there are a lot of \nproblems with it. I gather my colleague from Arizona, before coming \nover to the floor, was engaged in a hearing dealing with the issue of \nstolen Social Security numbers, the problem of 9-11 where people \nactually voted in the last election who, I am told, at least in some \ncases may have been terrorists themselves who were using Social \nSecurity identification numbers.\n\n  There are real problems with this. We have tried to solicit from the \nSocial Security Administration why they have, beyond what I have \nexpressed, reservations about the use of the Social Security \nidentification. I can understand from the secretary of state's \nstandpoint why this identifier is attractive. It is there. It is one \nthat is easily used. It is national in scope. But there are concerns \nabout it.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, as we solicit from the Social \nSecurity Administration what these additional concerns may be, that we \nwill certainly take that into consideration in conference as we craft a \nfinal version of this bill. And if there are some reasons with which I \nam not familiar, I would say we would certainly be amenable to \nlistening to those concerns to modify this amendment so as to \naccommodate, to the extent possible, if it is reasonable, the Social \nSecurity Administration's concerns.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, obviously, we will listen to those concerns. \nI need to go back and mention one thing I mentioned when I introduced \nit earlier. There is a long list of things for which the law permits us \nto use Social Security numbers precisely because the Federal Government \ndoes need to verify identity. If you apply for food stamps, if you \napply for Medicaid, if you apply for a green card, a passport, a lot of \nthings that the Federal Government and in some cases State governments \ndo, we really need to be sure that the person who is applying for the \nbenefit or applying for the activity involved is in fact who he says he \nis.\n  We don't have a national ID card, and the card that has more closely \napproximated a government identifier than anything else of uniform use \nis the Social Security card. That is why the Federal Government does in \nfact require it. Obviously, our right to vote is one of our most \nsacred. We don't want that diluted by people who should not be voting. \nWe want to ensure that people who are voting are in fact who they say \nthey are. This is one of the better ways of doing it, through the \nSocial Security card.\n  It can be stolen. There are fraudulent Social Security cards in \ncirculation, to be sure. It is not a perfect identifier. The Social \nSecurity Administration is concerned that the more uses there are to \nwhich the Social Security card is put, the more incentive there is to \nsteal cards or make invalid cards. Until we have a different kind of \nidentifier, perhaps one that involves biometric data or some other way \nto ensure that the person appearing before the Federal agency \nrequesting the benefit is in fact the person he says he is or she says \nshe is, the Social Security card is about the best thing we have.\n  If nothing else, this points up the fact that the Government, for all \nkinds of purposes, needs to know who people really are. We need to \nconsider what kind of identifier would work best.\n  The argument is not that we should not have it, it is what will be \nthe best one. For our purposes today, about the best we can do is the \nSocial Security card. Some States already use it. We want to make that \nopportunity available to the other States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut \nfor agreeing to accept the amendment and say to the Senator from \nArizona, when the secretaries of state were asked what is the single \nmost effective thing they could be given to combat fraud and to pare \ndown lists and remove from those lists people who are not supposed to \nbe there, they said the Social Security number. So while the Social \nSecurity Administration may have some reservations, the secretaries of \nstate have no reservations.\n  They think it would be an extraordinary step in the right direction. \nI commend the Senator from Arizona for offering the amendment. I thank \nthe Senator from Connecticut for accepting it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we have the McConnell second-degree \namendment, which we are going to accept, and then we are accepting the \nKyl amendment, as amended, by the McConnell amendment. How do you want \nto proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the second-degree \namendment of Senator McConnell?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2892) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on the----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, before we go to the pending amendment, I \nhave some comments.\n  These will be the last two votes of the evening. I wanted to give \nample opportunity for our colleagues to spend some time with their \nspouses tonight and wish them a happy Valentines Day.\n  We will be in session tomorrow, of course. There will be no votes on \nMonday when we come back. I am not sure what day that is. But on Monday \nwe will not have votes.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S831-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S831-S832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S831]]\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, after consultation with the Republican \ncolleagues, there is a unanimous consent request I wish to propound \nprior to this vote, if I may.\n  Last night, late, the House passed the campaign finance reform bill. \nWe are very appreciative of the tremendous work done by so many of our \ncolleagues on the House side and are very pleased now that we are at a \npoint where, hopefully, we can take this bill to the Senate floor and \nthen send it off to the President. My hope is that we can do it with a \nminimum amount of additional debate, given the fact that the bill is \nvirtually the same one we passed in the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader, after consultation \nwith the Republican leader, may, at any time after the Senate has \nreceived the bill from the House, turn to the consideration of H.R. \n2356, the campaign finance reform bill; that there be 4 hours of debate \nequally divided between the two leaders or their designees; that no \namendments or motions be in order to the bill; that upon the use or \nyielding back of the time, the bill be read the third time and the \nSenate vote on final passage of the bill, the preceding occurring \nwithout any intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I \nwill object--I just wanted to say to the majority leader, and \nparticularly to Senators McCain and Feingold, I congratulate them for \ntheir success to date on this issue. There was certainly an \noverwhelming victory in the House yesterday. But, as we all know, this \nlegislation kept being rewritten during the night. It finally passed at \n3 a.m.\n  We have people on my side of this issue who did not prevail in the \nHouse yesterday, and they would like to have an adequate time to read \nthe legislation. Fortunately, we are not in session next week, which \ngives everybody on both sides an opportunity to look at the fine print, \nbecause at this stage, I say to my friend from Arizona, we are shooting \nwith real bullets. This could well become law. I don't think any harm \nis done by simply leaving the majority leader in the same position he \nwould be in a week from Tuesday, to propound a similar unanimous \nconsent request.\n\n  For the moment, pending a thorough scrutiny of the legislation that \npassed at 3 o'clock this morning, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I hope everybody will take the time to \nlook at the legislation with whatever care they wish to use in \naddressing the concerns raised by the Senator from Kentucky. It is my \nintention to bring this to the floor as quickly as possible when we \nreturn. I will accommodate requests for additional time if the 4 hours \nisn't adequate. We can move to a longer period of time. But I do hope, \ngiven the fact that we had good and very healthy debate almost a year \nago, given the fact now that the House has adopted virtually the bill \nthat we passed in the Senate, we can have a debate without indefinite \ndelay. So I hope we can reach some unanimous consent request when we \nreturn. I will propound another one as soon as we return. But I \nappreciate the involvement of our colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky and \ncomment again that he has fought a good fight. The opponents of this \nbill have fought tenaciously, honorably, and I believe they certainly \nhave a right to examine legislation that was passed as late as 3 \no'clock in the morning.\n  I want to point out also that, of the 140 bills that have become law \nduring the 107th Congress, only 19 necessitated conference committees \nbetween the 2 Houses of Congress. Eighty-six percent of the bills that \nbecame law during the 107th Congress did not require a conference \ncommittee between the Houses.\n  Some of these bills, obviously, are not of great importance. Some are \nof great importance, such as the Victims of Terrorism Tax Relief Act \nand the Railroad Retirement and Survivors Act. There are many very \nimportant pieces of legislation that did not require a conference. I \nbelieve that, upon examination, my colleagues will see that the bill is \nbasically the same as the one that was passed by the Senate, with the \nexception of the Torricelli amendment, which had to do with the lowest \nunit rate requirement for the purchase of television ads.\n  Frankly, in the interest of straight talk, I have never seen any way \nyou can emerge victorious over the broadcasters. The broadcasters have \n$70 billion worth of spectrum. They win no matter what. If anybody \nthinks we can beat the broadcasters, I would like to interest you in \nsome desert land in Arizona.\n  Aside from that amendment, the bill is really in its original form as \npassed by the Senate. Again, I want to say not only to my colleagues in \nthe Senate but to those in the other body, this has been a very \nemotional, spirited debate. A great deal is at stake. As the Senator \nfrom Kentucky said, we are shooting with real bullets here. The \nPresident's spokesperson said the President would sign this bill if it \nwas passed by both Houses. It has been passed by both Houses, and I \nlook forward to the opportunity of seeing it pass. We did have several \nweeks of debate and amendments on the floor of the Senate. So I am not \nsure it would show any particular improvement by further debate and \nvotes because we have been over this ground pretty thoroughly.\n\n  Again, I thank the majority leader for his attention and priority of \nthis issue. I will point out, I think the Senator from Kentucky knows \nthe effective date is November 6, rather than the date of enactment as \npassed through the Senate. There are a number of reasons for that, but \nprimarily we are so late in the campaign season, it would be very \ndifficult to sort out moneys that are spent and obligated. There would \nbe a lot of court challenges and questions as to the whole financing \nstructure of the campaign of 2002. So I thank the majority leader.\n  I yield to my colleague from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Arizona, I don't know whether \nwe will end up not having these annual dances we have had over the last \ndecade or so. But if in fact that is the way it is, I have enjoyed the \ndebates we have had over the years. If it ends up that we don't have \nthese anymore, I will sort of miss them in a perverse sort of way.\n  I want to say that, with regard to the hard money issue, which the \nSenator from Arizona knows I care deeply about--and he has been \nsupportive of that as well--I think great progress has been made on \nthat subject in the bill of which the Senator from Arizona was a \nprincipal sponsor, which left the Senate and passed the House. Both \ncandidates and parties have been operating under hard dollar limits set \nat a time when a Mustang cost $2,700. We did a study of the cost to \ncandidates over a 6-year term, and for the typical candidate in America \nover a 6-year term, the cost of running the same campaign he ran 6 \nyears before is up 40 percent. So certainly that is a good feature in \nthe bill.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from Arizona for his steadfast interest \nin this issue, and he has been a great competitor.\n  I admire him greatly. We will be prepared to deal with this issue \nafter the recess.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Kentucky for his kind words. I do \nwant to say, I may not miss it at all.\n  (Laughter.)\n  My friend from Wisconsin is here. We shared the very wonderful moment \nlast night with our colleagues in the House and Congressman Meehan and \nCongressman Shays. It was quite a remarkable time. I am glad to have \nbeen able to be a part of this process.\n  I say again, the opposition has been principled, honorable, and \nferocious. That is in the tradition of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I spoke this morning of the great \nvictory of campaign finance reform in the House last night and the \nimportance of taking up a bill quickly in the Senate so we can send it \nto the President. I expressed concern that games might be played by the \nHouse leadership in transmitting the bill to the Senate so we can \nconsider it. I was pleased by the announcement this afternoon by\n\n[[Page S832]]\n\nSpeaker Hastert that the bill should come over to us in a matter of \ndays. That is good news, and I am pleased to hear it.\n  I, too, thank the Senator from Kentucky. He was very gracious in his \nremarks today. Whether or not we miss this process in the future is one \nissue. Certainly that has been the nature of the experience over these \nmany years, and I sincerely thank him for that.\n  The possibility of delay still exists in this body. I sincerely thank \nthe majority leader for his tremendous commitment today to bring up the \nbill in the Senate as soon as it comes over and to lead us in fighting \nthrough whatever procedural hoops might be placed in our path to try to \nstop the Senate from acting on the bill.\n  We had a long, fair, and good debate last year on this legislation. \nAny effort to prevent the Senate from acting on the bill I think will \nsimply delay the inevitable; it would frustrate the will of the Senate \nand the will of the American people.\n  Yesterday's strong bipartisan vote in the House after marathon debate \ndemonstrates once again the time has come to pass the bill. As much as \nsome tried to deny or rationalize it, the soft money system taints all \nof us in this body, and it truly undermines our credibility with the \nAmerican people.\n  There does come a time when we have to say enough. That time is now. \nAs soon as the bill comes to us from the House, let's take it up; let \neveryone say a final word about their positions, and then send it to \nthe President to be signed into law.\n  Again, I thank the majority leader. I thank my good friend, Senator \nMcCain. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin and the distinguished Senator from Arizona for their \nincredible leadership. History will be written, and when it is, these \ntwo outstanding Senators will be acknowledged for the tremendous \ncontribution they have made to the improvement of our political system.\n  Once again, and not for the last time, I acknowledge their leadership \nand appreciate very much the effort they have made to get us to this \npoint.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S832-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S832-S835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        EQUAL PROTECTION OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to make sure that I clarify \nsomething. Just because we are not having additional votes does not \nmean Senators could not come over and offer additional amendments. \nSenator Dodd has indicated a desire to stay here for as long as there \nare those who have amendments. We may be able to obtain a finite list. \nI hope we can continue to chip away at those amendments tonight and \ntomorrow.\n  I want to accommodate Senators who have dates with spouses and \nsignificant others, but there may be those who have neither and would \nbe more than willing to come over and talk about election reform. If \nthat is the case, we are ready. I know Senator McConnell is every bit \nas interested in moving this legislation along.\n  I applaud our managers and thank them for their willingness to stay \nhere and continue this effort. Please, if Senators have amendments, \ncome to the floor. We will do these two votes and we are interested in \ndoing more, even though we will not have additional rollcall votes \ntonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 2891, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Apparently one of the pages of the amendment was \ninadvertently left off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To authorize administrative leave for Federal employees to \n           perform poll worker service in Federal elections)\n\n       At the end of title IV, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 402.

Mr. President, very briefly, this amendment responds \nto a problem that exists with implementing the election laws of our \ncountry which will be greatly strengthened if we pass the bill that is \nbefore the Senate now. That problem is the shortage of nonpartisan poll \nworkers, documented by the GAO and the commission headed by Presidents \nCarter and Ford. This amendment builds on a successful program started, \nat least one I know of, in Los Angeles County and in the State of \nCalifornia to allow civil servants--not political appointees but civil \nservants--to take election day off at the request of local election \nofficials, to work as nonpartisan poll workers while continuing to be \npaid for their Federal employment, receiving no compensation from the \nelection officials of local jurisdiction.\n  I have the feeling I have sufficiently described what I believe is a \nvery meritorious amendment. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. With all due respect to my friend from Connecticut, he \nis not talking about election officers; every State has an equal number \nof Democrats and Republicans who put on the election and keep it \nhonest. What my friend from Connecticut is talking about is poll \nworkers; in other words, workers who will go work for one candidate or \nanother. We know Federal employees are overwhelmingly Democratic, \nFederal employee unions are overwhelmingly on the Democratic side.\n  In effect, what the Senator from Connecticut is suggesting is that \nFederal union employees be given a paid holiday by the taxpayers of the \nUnited States to go out and work for Democratic officials on election \nday. I strongly urge this amendment be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the modified \namendment of the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, No. 2890.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I understand there is a minute on each side \non the Burns amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my good friend.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is pretty simple. It allows the \ndirector of elections in each county or the secretary of state to purge \nthe list every 4 years, or every other Federal election.\n  Right now, they cannot purge it but every other Presidential \nelection. So you are carrying dead weight for 8 years. It costs \nMissoula County $16,000 just to maintain these big lists. It also makes \na lot of people ineligible to vote even though they are on the list.\n  This is strongly supported by the secretaries of state of your \nStates. I ask for your support. This makes more sense. This is where \nthe mischief is in elections.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nRight now, the voter lists have to be purged every 8 years. The Burns \namendment would conflict with the motor-voter law; furthermore, many \npeople would be needlessly purged. People who did not vote in two \nelections would be purged from the list and would have to reregister\n  In a bill where we are trying to make it easier for people to vote, \nthis takes\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\ntwo steps backwards and makes it harder.\n  We have taken care of this in the bill.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To establish a residual ballot performance benchmark)\n\n       Beginning on page 8, line 19, strike through page 9, line \n     3, and insert the following:\n       (5) Error rates.--\n       (A) In general.--The error rate of the voting system in \n     counting ballots (determined by taking into account only \n     those errors which are attributable to the voting system and \n     not attributable to an act of the voter) shall not exceed the \n     error rate standards established under the voting systems \n     standards issued and maintained by the Director of the Office \n     of Election Administration of the Federal Election Commission \n     (as revised by the Director of such Office under subsection \n     (c)).\n       (B) Residual ballot performance benchmark.--In addition to \n     the error rate standards described in subparagraph (A), the \n     Director of the Office of Election Administration of the \n     Federal Election Commission shall issue and maintain a \n     uniform benchmark for the residual ballot error rate that \n     jurisdictions may not exceed. For purposes of the preceding \n     sentence, the residual vote error rate shall be equal to the \n     combination of overvotes, spoiled or uncountable votes, and \n     undervotes cast in the contest at the top of the ballot, but \n     excluding an estimate, based upon the best available \n     research, of intentional undervotes. The Director shall base \n     the benchmark issued and maintained under this subparagraph \n     on evidence of good practice in representative jurisdictions.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to do two things. The first is to \nthank my colleagues, Senators Dodd and McConnell. I thank my colleagues \nfor the extraordinary work they have done in crafting an election \nreform bill that will significantly improve our Federal election \nsystem.\n  I am very pleased that in this legislation we call for national \nstandards for voting systems. I appreciate greatly the call for \nnational standards for voting systems, provisional voting, and \nstatewide voter registration lists in all voting systems used in \nFederal elections. I believe these national standards are critically \nimportant because the rights of citizens in one State to exercise their \nconstitutional right to vote should not be any greater or lesser than \nthe rights of a citizen in any other State.\n  In considering and passing this bill, we are also making a statement \nof our values and, in a direct way, repudiating those who attacked our \ncountry on September 11 because of our commitment to a free and \ndemocratic system that we would like to see replicated in every nation \nof the world. But the only way we can demonstrate to the rest of the \nworld that we put our values into practice is if each and every \nAmerican has faith that our election system is the best and fairest.\n  I rise to offer an amendment that will provide a greater assurance \nthat the rights of voters to vote and have their votes counted in \nFederal elections will not vary widely from State to State.\n  As we know, the bill we are considering requires by 2006 that all \nvoting systems used in Federal elections have an error rate that does \nnot exceed the standards established by the Director of the Office of \nElection Administration. That refers to the rate that voting machines \nmake mistakes in reading ballots.\n  This standard is important because it means that by 2006 all voting \nsystems used in Federal elections will have to use technology and \nequipment that does not result in more than a minimum percentage of \nvotes being discarded.\n  Yet as important as this standard is, it deals with only one of the \ntwo pieces of the problem of discarded ballots because this standard \nconcerns votes uncounted due to mechanical errors of the voting system, \nbut it does not address at all the major problem of residual votes \nwhich are overvotes, undervotes, or spoiled votes that are discarded \ndue to unintentional human error.\n  Residual votes, not mechanical errors, are by far the most common \nreason why ballots are discarded and not counted and why, therefore, \nvoters who thought they were doing the right thing ended up being \ndisenfranchised.\n  Over the past four Presidential elections, the total rate of residual \nvote errors has been slightly more than 2 percent. This translates into \nmore than 2 million voters in these elections not having their votes \ncounted. The percentage of residual votes is even higher in Senate \nelections.\n  With respect to last year's Presidential election, the Caltech-MIT \nvoting technology project reports that voting ballot problems led to an \nestimated 2 million votes never being counted because ballots were \nambiguous, spoiled, or unmarked. Though 500,000 of these ballots \nrepresented abstentions, the remaining 1.5 million ballots represented \nvotes where the voters actually believed they had recorded a vote for \nPresident even though their votes were ultimately discarded.\n  In addition to the Caltech-MIT study, the U.S. Commission on Civil \nRights found that in some precincts as many as 20 percent or more of \nthe ballots were discarded.\n\n  Other researchers and media analysts found the same results, and many \nof these discarded votes were actually what we call residual votes.\n\n[[Page S835]]\n\n  For these reasons, the Election Reform Commission, chaired by our \ndistinguished former Presidents, President Carter and President Ford, \nthe so-called Carter-Ford Commission, recommended unanimously that we \nfocus not just on machine errors in improving our election system, but \non these unintentional human errors as well.\n  The Commission members from both parties from all regions of the \ncountry did so because they knew that focusing only on mechanical \nerrors was not good enough; that only by measuring residual votes will \nwe be able to assess effectively whether the voting process as a whole \nis giving citizens an equal opportunity to have their votes counted.\n  The bottom line is that there is no dispute that residual votes are a \nmajor problem. The question is, What are we going to do about it?\n  The amendment I have offered provides a fair, reasonable, and \neffective answer. This amendment calls upon the Office of Election \nAdministration to establish a national performance benchmark for \nresidual votes, measured as the percentage of residual errors at the \ntop of the ballot, excluding an estimate based upon the best available \nresearch of intentional undervotes.\n  Like the other benchmarks in the bill, voting systems used in Federal \nelections would have to meet it. This amendment mirrors the language \nalready in the bill that calls upon the Office of Election \nAdministration to set a benchmark with respect to mechanical error \nrates. The amendment, however, puts in the final piece of the puzzle \nfor requiring this benchmark for residual votes as well.\n  For any who might be concerned that the benchmark is measured by \nsubtracting an estimated number of intentional undervotes, that is not \nthe case.\n  In considering this particular issue, the Carter-Ford Commission \nnoted there has been considerable progress in determining how often \nintentional undervotes occur. We can take this data from the National \nElection Studies, from the Voter News Service, and we can then use it \nfor the determination as to how we consider this remaining problem.\n  The Caltech/MIT study, for example, said exit polls suggested \napproximately 30 percent of residual votes, less than 1 percent of all \nvotes, are intentional. Individually and collectively, therefore, we \ncan estimate these intentional undervotes and knock them out and only \nfocus on the unintentional where someone thought they were actually \nmarking the ballot.\n  I hope when we establish these national standards, we recognize this \nis an important issue. Yes, we need to take care of those mechanical \nerrors but we also have to take care of the unintentional human errors. \nWe have learned in election after election, not just in 2000 but in \nmany of our elections, that hundreds of thousands of our fellow \nAmericans have gone to the polls believing they were exercising the \nmost fundamental of their constitutional rights. They cast their \nballots and they never knew their ballots were not counted and their \nvoices were never heard.\n  I hope the Senate will consider this problem and will favorably act \nupon my amendment so we can, at the end of this process, say clearly \nand unequivocally to all Americans we have put into place the best \npossible system we can to ensure every vote truly counts and that our \nelection system matches our values.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, yesterday we completed action on the farm \nbill. The bill is a victory for the American farmers and ranchers who \nwill benefit from the improved commodity programs in the bill. It is a \nvictory for families in need who will benefit from broad nutrition \nprograms in the bill. It is a victory for rural communities\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\nwhich will benefit in the economic revitalization provided in the bill. \nFinally, it is a victory for the environment which will benefit from \nthe significant increase of funding new programs to help restore \nwildlife habitat, reduce water pollution, and resolve conflicts over \nwater.\n  Together with Senator Leahy, I spent a lot of time working on the \nconservation provisions of the bill. It was only part of this massive \nbill which was led by Senator Harkin of Iowa. The bill is over 1,000 \npages. It has separate titles dealing with commodity programs, \nconservation, trade, nutrition, credit, rural development, research, \nforestry, and energy. Countless amendments were drafted to the bill, \nand many were offered. Work on the bill began in earnest more than a \nyear ago.\n  When we complete a bill of this size, we often thank our staff for \nthe work they put into such an effort, and rightfully so. Chairman \nHarkin, ranking member Senator Lugar, Senator Daschle, and Senator \nLeahy's staff, in particular, put in a tremendous amount of work on \nthis bill.\n  Sometimes, though, we forget to thank people who are essential to the \nsuccess of this legislation. That is the Senate legislative counsel. \nThey do tremendous work. The bill we passed is a product of numerous \ndrafts, revisions, alternates, and many amendments. Our legislative \ncounsel were responsible for ensuring that all those many drafts and \namendments captured our interest. They had to do so under constant time \npressure. They were a great help to me and my staff on the conservation \nprovisions and on the water provisions in particular.\n  It may surprise some to know that only 5 attorneys were responsible \nfor all the work that went into the 1,000-page bill. I personally would \nlike to thank them, not only on my behalf but on behalf of the majority \nleader, Senator Daschle, Senator Leahy, and Chairman Harkin, for the \ngreat work on the bill. Gary Endicott and Darcie Chan were extremely \nhelpful to me and my staff in drafting the important new provisions of \nthis bill, provisions that have never been in a farm bill before. \nTogether with Tom Trushel, Janine Johnson, and Heather Flory, they put \nin countless hours on the bill and have worked nearly around the clock \nsince September as the pace of deliberations quickened.\n  Many also handled drafting for energy, environment, and Indian \naffairs at the same time. They were assisted by David Grahn and Pia \nRuttenberg, attorneys for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of \nGeneral Counsel. Mr. Grahn and Ms. Ruttenberg helped ensure the \nprovisions we drafted would be interpreted and implemented by the \nDepartment as we intended.\n  I have lawyers on my staff, and I am an attorney also. But I can say, \nwithout the help of the people I have just mentioned, we would have \nbeen in very difficult shape to accomplish what we did.\n  I particularly spread across the record of this Senate the tireless, \ncountless hours that Lisa Moore spent on this legislation. We are so \ndependent as Senators on our staff. I have had the good fortune of \nbeing able to serve in the House of Representatives. In the House of \nRepresentatives, one's jurisdiction is much more limited. One is much \nmore in tune with one's jurisdiction. We in the Senate have wide-\nranging jurisdiction. We do not represent one party of our State, we \nrepresent our whole State, from the southern tip of the State of Nevada \nto the northern frontiers of the State of Nevada, one representing \nfamous Las Vegas, the other representing places such as Gerlach and \nother small places that have totally different interests than Las \nVegas. But I represent them all. I become a jack of all trades; some \nsay a master of none.\n  That is the way the Senate is. We have to depend on our staff. I am \nso grateful for the work Lisa Moore put in on this case. Not only does \nour staff work a lot of time doing the things that have to be done, but \nthey believe in these things in their heart. They convey their emotions \nto us. That is one reason I worked so hard on this and why I am so \nfortunate I was able to pass it. I would not want to disappoint Lisa, \nwho worked so hard on this legislation.\n  We, too often, blame our staff for the things that go wrong. We take \ncredit for the things that go right. Most of the time, it should be \njust the opposite. On this occasion, I make sure I express my \nappreciation to Lisa Moore and the many other people I mentioned who \nwere so important in passing this legislation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dodd).

Mr. President, voting is an essential and indispensable \nright\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\nof citizenship in a democracy. Throughout our Nation's history, a task \nof the Senate and the House has been to remove the barriers to this \nright to vote. We have made great progress beyond gender exclusion, \npoll taxes, literacy tests, and other historical barriers. Yet our \nsociety is ever changing, and this work is never complete. I applaud \nthe authors of this legislation, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member \nMcConnell, and Senator Bond for their excellent leadership and their \nhard work to bring this important bipartisan legislation before us \ntoday. They have performed a great service to our Senate and to our \nNation.\n  In our national election of the year 2000, only 51 percent of \nAmerica's voting age population participated. Although this \nparticipation rate was a 2 percent improvement over the previous \nnational election, it remains very troubling that only half the \neligible citizens in our country took the time and made the effort to \nhelp choose their leaders.\n  I am always curious when people say their vote does not count. When \npossible, I like to ask, ``Your vote counts one, the same as everyone \nelse's. How much do you think your vote should count?'' A democracy is \na democracy because every person's vote counts the same as everyone \nelse's. How much do you think your vote should count? They miss the \nessential point, that a democracy is a democracy precisely because \nevery person's vote counts the same as everyone else's. When a society \nreaches a point where some people's votes start counting more than \nothers, either officially or unofficially, a country is usually sliding \ntoward rule by a political and economic elite. When only one person's \nvote counts, it is a dictatorship.\n  However, there are still real reasons why some people cannot vote. In \nEly, MN, the City Clerk, Terry Lowell, recognized a problem which \nsenior citizens and people with disabilities sometimes encounter. A \nmail-in ballot is frequently the only way a home-bound citizen can \nexercise the right to vote. Yet, something as simple as a postage stamp \ncan stand in the way. While the cost of mailing a ballot may seem \nsmall, it can also become a matter of practicality--when a person has \ndifficulty getting out of bed or going to the kitchen, just ``running \nout to get a stamp'' is not a simple task as for most of us.\n  There are also many senior citizens in Minnesota, and probably \nelsewhere, who literally watch every penny they must spend. With the \ncosts of their prescription medicines ever rising beyond their control, \nthey have not enough money left for food and utilities. Every \nadditional expenditure, of any amount, is perceived as a burden.\n  Plus, the way they look at it and the way I look at it, it is a \nmatter of principle. Voting should be free. Voting is free for able-\nbodied citizens. It should be free for everyone else, as well.\n  My amendment would create a one-time, pilot project in the 2004 \nnational election, to be designed and implemented by the Postal Service \nwith consultation with the Federal Election Commission. Postage-free \nabsentee ballots would be provided in one State for that one election. \nThis pilot project will measure the effect of postage-free absentee \nballots on voting participation by elderly, disabled, and other \ncitizens. We can then consider whether it would be worthwhile to expand \ntheir use in future elections.\n  This amendment's passage will also demonstrate that a citizen, \nanywhere, can have a good idea and through an elected representative, \nactually see that idea turned into law. For that, I salute Terry \nLowell, in Ely, MN.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend the Presiding Officer who has just \noffered his pilot project amendment.\n  First, I commend him on the creativity in suggesting a pilot program. \nI know his concern would be--the question is obvious--the cost of this \nand how well it will work. I think by running a pilot program we can \nanswer a lot of those questions.\n  I think the point he made in his remarks deserves repeating. We try \nto make, as Senator Bond said so often--I have repeated it, Senator \nMcConnell said the same thing on many occasions--voting easy, as user \nfriendly as we possibly can in this country. Every eligible person who \nhas the right to vote can walk into that polling place, whether it be \nin rural or urban America or poor or suburban communities, walk into \nthat polling place on election day and know he or she is being \nreceived, encouraged and offered the means by which they can cast their \nballot to choose the President of the United States, down to a local \ncommissioner or board person in their own hometown.\n  That wonderful right we have that is so unavailable to billions of \npeople on the face of this Earth still is something we need to make as \neasy as possible, as user friendly as possible. Of course, there are \nmillions of Americans who are homebound, who are overseas, who are in \nthe military. To make this as free and accessible to them as possible \nis something all of us ought to embrace. Therefore, the idea of making \nabsentee ballots, by which millions of Americans cast their votes, as \nfree as possible, is something I think is deserving of support, \nparticularly as a pilot program.\n  Had the Senator offered this to require it in perpetuity, across the \ncountry, I would have some reservations about what the implications of \nthat could be. But I think the framing it in a pilot program idea for \nthe 2004 election is an idea that is worthy of support.\n  I have submitted the amendment to my friend from Kentucky and his \nstaff to take a look at it. They are going to be reviewing it. We don't \nhave an answer yet. My hope is we can accept this and come to some \nagreement. I congratulate my friend from Minnesota for offering this \nidea to our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am going to proceed to offer three \nindividual amendments, and I will be asking to lay them aside. But this \nway they can be debated tomorrow or Monday when we come back on the \n25th. They may be accepted or end up being part of a managers' \namendment but disposed of somehow in order to have them before the \nSenate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2912\n\n  The first amendment is an amendment offered by Senator Harkin, No. \n2912. I offer that amendment on behalf of Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2912.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide funds for protection and advocacy systems)\n\n       On page 28 of the amendment, after line 23, add the \n     following:\n       (c) Protection and Advocacy Systems.--\n       (1) In general.--In addition to any other payments made \n     under this section, the Attorney General shall pay the \n     protection and advocacy system (as defined in section 102 of \n     the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights \n     Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 15002)) of each State to ensure full \n     participation in the electoral process for individuals with \n     disabilities, including registering to vote, casting a vote \n     and accessing polling places. In providing such services, \n     protection and advocacy systems shall have the same general \n     authorities as they are afforded under part C of the \n     Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act \n     of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 15041 et seq.).\n       (2) Minimum grant amount.--The minimum amount of each grant \n     to a protection and advocacy system shall be determined and \n     allocated as set forth in subsections (c)(3), (c)(4), (c)(5), \n     (e), and (g) of section 509 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \n     (29 U.S.C.\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\n     794e), except that the amount of the grants to systems \n     referred to in subsections (c)(3)(B) and (c)(4)(B) of that \n     section shall be not less than $70,000 and $35,000, \n     respectively.\n       On page 30, strike lines 23 through 25, and insert the \n     following:\n       (b) Protection and Advocacy Systems.--In addition to any \n     other amounts authorized to be appropriated under this \n     section, there are authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000 \n     for each of the fiscal years 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, and \n     for each subsequent fiscal year such sums as may be \n     necessary, for the purpose of making payments under section \n     206(c).\n       (c) Availability.--Any amounts appropriated pursuant to the \n     authority of this section shall remain available until \n     expended.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Harkin \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2913\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Harkin and Senator McCain and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] for Mr. Harkin, for \n     himself and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 2913.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress that curbside voting \n      should be only an alternative of last resort when providing \n                  accommodations for disabled voters)\n\n       At the end add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. VOTERS WITH DISABILITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n     12101 et seq.) requires that people with disabilities have \n     the same kind of access to public places as the general \n     public.\n       (2) The Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and \n     Handicapped Act (42 U.S.C. 1973ee et seq.) requires that all \n     polling places for Federal elections be accessible to the \n     elderly and the handicapped.\n       (3) The General Accounting Office in 2001 issued a report \n     based on their election day random survey of 496 polling \n     places during the 2000 election across the country and found \n     that 84 percent of those polling places had one or more \n     potential impediments that prevented individuals with \n     disabilities, especially those who use wheelchairs, from \n     independently and privately voting at the polling place in \n     the same manner as everyone else.\n       (4) The Department of Justice has interpreted accessible \n     voting to allow curbside voting or absentee voting in lieu of \n     making polling places physically accessible.\n       (5) Curbside voting does not allow the voter the right to \n     vote in privacy.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the right to vote in a private and independent manner is a \n     right that should be afforded to all eligible citizens, \n     including citizens with disabilities, and that curbside \n     voting should only be an alternative of the last resort in \n     providing equal voting access to all eligible American \n     citizens.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2914\n\n  Mr. DODD. Lastly, Mr. President, I offer an amendment on behalf of \nthe Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for Mr. Schumer, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2914.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To permit the use of a signature or personal mark for the \n purpose of verifying the identity of voters who register by mail, and \n                          for other purposes)\n\n       Beginning on page 18, line 20, strike through page 19, line \n     24, and insert the following:\n       (2) Requirements.--\n       (A) In general.--An individual meets the requirements of \n     this paragraph if the individual--\n       (i) in the case of an individual who votes in person--\n\n       (I) presents to the appropriate State or local election \n     official a current and valid photo identification;\n       (II) presents to the appropriate State or local election \n     official a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, \n     Government check, paycheck, or other Government document that \n     shows the name and address of the voter;\n       (III) provides written affirmation on a form provided by \n     the appropriate State or local election official of the \n     individual's identity; or\n       (IV) provides a signature or personal mark that matches the \n     signature or personal mark of the individual on record with a \n     State or local election official; or\n\n       (ii) in the case of an individual who votes by mail, \n     submits with the ballot--\n\n       (I) a copy of a current and valid photo identification;\n       (II) a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, \n     Government check, paycheck, or other Government document that \n     shows the name and address of the voter; or\n       (III) provides a signature or personal mark that matches \n     the signature or personal mark of the individual on record \n     with a State or local election official.\n\n       (B) Provisional voting.--An individual who desires to vote \n     in person, but who does not meet the requirements of \n     subparagraph (A)(i), may cast a provisional ballot under \n     section 102(a).\n       On page 68, strike lines 19 and 20, and insert the \n     following:\n       (a) In General.--Nothing in this Act may be construed to \n     authorize\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Schumer \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will not go into describing these \namendments. We will leave that for the Members themselves when they \nfind the time, probably either tomorrow or Monday on the 25th, to come \nand explain them.\n  In the meantime, again, I am going to suggest to Members that with \nthe finite list of amendments we now have from both the minority and \nmajority sides, we are going to make an effort to accommodate as many \nof these amendments as we can, to try to see if we can accept them or \nsuggest maybe modifications that would make the amendments acceptable; \nor if that is not possible, then certainly provide the time on Monday, \nthe 25th, or tomorrow, for these amendments to be debated, with \nTuesday, the 26th, being the day on which amendments would be voted \nupon, those that had not been resolved or accepted or made part of a \nmanagers' amendment.\n  That is the idea. That is the goal, so to speak, we are trying to \nachieve with all of this.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I do not know if I have any additional \namendments at this point to submit. That being the case, I note the \npresence of my friend and colleague from Nevada. I see he has some big, \nwhite cardboard pieces in his hands, which usually indicate a chart and \na speech. So I think we are going to hear some words.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. First of all, I say to my friend from Connecticut, what a \ngreat job you have done on the bill today. We have made tremendous \nprogress. We have a list of amendments. I will be happy to work with \nthe Senator tomorrow, and the days after that, and, hopefully, we can \npass this bill Tuesday. That would be a great mark for the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S838-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S838-S840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR DODD'S BABY\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, discussions about the state of our \ndemocracy too often focus on what is wrong with our political system.\n  Experts bemoan low turnout; they say young people are turned off by \npolitics; they say grassroots campaigns no longer can work in the age \nof 30-second television ads.\n  But Americans cherish their democracy. Political participation allows \nus to express our deepest held beliefs. When we fight for something we \nbelieve in we are true participants in our democracy. I know this is \ntrue because I saw it myself. Missourians during the last election, \neven in the face of grief, went to the polls to make their will known. \nThe 2000 election, however, revealed a number of flaws in our electoral \nmachinery.\n  Far too many Americans were being disenfranchised without their \nknowledge. Too many voters left the polling places in confusion; too \noften registration lists had not been properly maintained.\n  The promise of American democracy is that everyone has the right to \nvote without regard to their individual circumstance. It is our job to \nmake that promise a reality.\n  The Constitution calls for a decentralized system that puts states in \ncharge of elections. But since States hold elections for Federal \noffices, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to encourage and \nempower States to improve the voting process. I believe this bill does \njust that and I am pleased to support it.\n  I congratulate the sponsors and those who have put many hours of hard \nwork to bringing this consensus bill to the floor.\n  This bill is framed around two basic premises: Those who are not \nproperly registered to vote are not allowed to cast a ballot, but for \nthose who are properly registered, we should make it as easy as \npossible for them to go to the polls, vote, and have their vote \ncounted.\n  To those who say we need additional steps to eliminate voter fraud \nand punish those who abuse the system, you are correct. We must work \nharder to put systems in place that will adequately update voter rolls. \nMany States and local registrars are plagued by insufficient \ntechnology, and thus an inability to maintain databases that are \ncurrent. There must also be adequate voter education so that our \ncitizens understand what steps they must take to register properly. And \nwe must make sure that poll workers receive the appropriate training so \nthat we can reduce any potential issues at the polling places.\n  To those who say we must live up to the promise of our Constitution \nand do all within our power to bring more people into the process, I \nsay your call must be heard.\n  This Nation's history is built on the fight for suffrage. To place \neven the lowest hurdle before someone seeking to exercise the right to \nvote is an affront to our democracy. This bill ensures that we go the \nextra mile to protect the rights of those populations most vulnerable \nto disenfranchisement: the elderly, the disabled, those who are not \nfluent in English, ethnic and racial minorities, and members of the \narmed services who are serving overseas.\n  Perhaps the most significant reform in this bill is that States will \nbe required to implement a system of provisional voting. From now on, \nif someone's eligibility is challenged at the polling place, they will \nhave the right to cast a vote. If it turns out that the voter was \nproperly registered, his or her vote will be counted.\n  The bill will also prevent disenfranchisement by updating voting \ntechnology. In the future, voters will know if they unintentionally \nselected more than one candidate for a single office, or if their \nballots are not otherwise properly marked, and they will have a chance \nto correct their ballots, and make sure their vote is counted. It is \ncommon sense that when a system is broken, we must mend it.\n  When this system concerns a fundamental and cherished right, it is \nnot only common sense, it is vital to the health of our Nation.\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\n  Our efforts today to empower voters remind me of the words of \nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt, who said:\n\n       Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an \n     alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are \n     not a President and senators and congressmen and government \n     officials, but the voters of this country.\n\n  Let us renew the promise of our great Nation and enact legislation \nthat will promote fairness, enhance participation, and increase our \nfaith in the greatest democracy in the history of the world.\n\n\n                     north dakota voting procedures\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. As my colleague from Connecticut knows, North Dakota \ncurrently operates a unique voting system in that we have no \nregistration system whatsoever for our State. This is a very open \nsystem that I believe is very much in line with the intent of your \nlegislation to ensure the maximum amount of openness and accessibility \nin our Nation's voting system. Am I correct in reading the language of \nsubparagraph 103(a)(1)(B) of the substitute amendment to allow North \nDakota to continue operating a registration-less voting system for \nFederal elections in our State?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, the clear text of this provision exempts states \nwithout a registration requirement for its voters from having to \nimplement such a computerized system consistent with section 103. Put \nsimply, the exception provided in 103(a)(1)(B) exempts North Dakota \nfrom all provisions of the bill concerning a computerized statewide \nvoter registration system. We simply did not want any of this bill's \nprovisions, either directly or indirectly, to interfere with North \nDakota's ability to continue operating its commendably open and \naccessible registration-less system of voting.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis aid in understanding this exemption. I also have a question with \nregard to Section 102 of the bill--the provisional voting section. I \nwould like to describe the way North Dakota currently operates its \n``voter challenge process'' to get my esteemed colleague's perspective \non whether our State currently satisfies the requirements of this \nsection.\n  In North Dakota, the members of an election board or poll challengers \nmay challenge the right of anyone to vote whom they know or have reason \nto believe is not a qualified elector. A poll challenger or election \nboard member may request that a person offering to vote provide an \nappropriate form of identification to address any voting eligibility \nconcerns, such as age, citizenship, or residency requirements. If the \nidentification provided does not adequately resolve the voter \neligibility concerns of the poll challenger or election board member, \nthe challenged person can execute an affidavit before the election \ninspector affirming that the challenged person is a legally qualified \nelector of the precinct. The affidavit must include the name and \naddress of the challenged voter and the address of the challenged voter \nat the time the challenged voter last voted.\n  If the election inspector finds the affidavit valid on its face, the \nchallenged person is allowed to vote as any other voter does and his or \nher voted ballot is deposited in the ballot box with the rest of the \nvoted ballots from the precinct and counted by a canvassing board, or \nin the case of a recount by the recount board, in exactly the same \nmanner as a ballot cast by non-challenged voters. In other words, the \nchallenged person's voted ballot is not segregated or designated in any \nspecial way for further or future inspection by election officials, \ncanvassing officials, recount officials, or legal authorities.\n  I ask my distinguished colleague the Senator from Connecticut whether \nthis current system satisfies the requirements of section 102 of his \nbill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I again commend the State of North Dakota's \nopen and accessible voting system. Our intent in drafting section 102 \nwas to require that voters who were challenged, but felt that they had \nthe legal right to vote, were given the opportunity to cast a ballot \nand then have that ballot set aside and verified. North Dakota's system \ngoes beyond this intent by being even more voter-friendly. Based on my \nunderstanding of your description of North Dakota's system, North \nDakota should be able to continue operating its more voter-friendly \nvoter challenge system.\n  For example, paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of section 102 requires \nelection officials to verify the written affirmation of that voter's \neligibility before the ballot is counted. Under North Dakota State law, \nas you have represented it to me, verification happens upon the \nexecution of a written affidavit. The fact that the verification by the \nelection official that is required under this bill occurs prior to the \nballot being cast instead of after the ballot is cast is a function of \nNorth Dakota's registration-less system. It therefore satisfies all of \nthe requirements of section 102(a).\n  I should point out that under subsection 102(a)(5), the individual \nwho voted via affidavit will need to be provided written notification \nat the time he casts his or her ballot that he or she will not receive \nany further notification--because as a matter of state law, that \nperson's vote has been counted. This could easily be done by handing \nout a generic form to each voter who votes via affidavit.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate the Senator from \nConnecticut taking the time to answer my questions about his bill. I \nalso want to take this time to commend the Senator for his terrific \nleadership and work on the very important issue of election reform.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S840-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S840-S841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             YUCCA MOUNTAIN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today the Secretary of Energy recommended to \nthe President that Yucca Mountain, Nevada should be the site for \nstoring all of America's nuclear waste, all 70,000 tons. This \nrecommendation came despite the objections of all the credible \nindependent experts who have reviewed the project. I will name just few \nof them. There are many others, but the credibility of those I will \nname cannot be refuted. These experts all say that the science is not \nsound.\n  The General Accounting Office is the watchdog of Congress and the \nwatchdog for the American people. The GAO has been an important part of \nour Government for many decades and is noted for its independence and \nveracity. The General Accounting Office has stated that making a \ndecision now regarding the Yucca Mountain project is neither \n``prudent'' nor ``practical.'' That is pretty direct.\n  The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board is an independent agency \nestablished to review what is going on with nuclear waste from a \ntechnical standpoint. It is chaired by the former dean of the Forestry \nSchool at Yale University, who is now the president of Carnegie-Mellon \nin Pennsylvania and is one of the foremost scientists in America. The \nNuclear Waste Technical Review Board says that the scientific review \nthat has been conducted at Yucca Mountain is ``weak.'' That is pretty \ndirect.\n  The Inspector General of the Department of Energy stated that because \nthe law firm giving advice to the Secretary of Energy on Yucca \nMountain, Winston and Strawn, was the same law firm that was giving \nlegal advice to the Nuclear Energy Institute, the umbrella for the \nnuclear utilities in this country, there was a clear conflict of \ninterest. That too is pretty direct.\n  No one can challenge the credibility of this all-star team of \nindependent experts: The Inspector General, the General Accounting \nOffice, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. No one can challenge \ntheir credibility.\n  Secretary Abraham has made a hasty, poor, and really indefensible \ndecision. Now the question of whether a high-level nuclear waste dump \nwill be built in Nevada lies with the President of the United States.\n  It is time for President Bush to fulfill the commitment he made to \nthe people of Nevada and to the country; that is, that he would not \nallow nuclear waste to come to Yucca Mountain unless there was sound \nscience justifying such a decision.\n  The General Accounting Office, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard, and the Inspector General have all said that science does not \nexist.\n  The President should demand sound science--peer-reviewed scientific \nevidence of the highest caliber--and wait\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\nuntil he receives it before making a decision about Yucca Mountain. The \nPresident has the responsibility and the authority to fulfill the \npromise he made to this Nation as a candidate regarding nuclear waste.\n  I urge President Bush to exercise that authority and show the Nation \nhe is a man of his word. We are depending on him.\n  Mr. President, this visual aid represents the proposed routes that \ntrucks and trains would travel to Nevada carrying 70,000 tons of toxic \nmaterial. One hundred thousand truckloads of nuclear waste will be \nhauled on these roads. And 20,000 trainloads of nuclear waste will be \nhauled along the railways we see here on this map.\n  The Department of Energy has refused to do an environmental impact \nstatement assessing the effects of transporting all of this deadly \nmaterial. Why? Because they cannot explain how it would be possible to \nsafely haul 70,000 tons of nuclear waste over the highways and railways \nof this country.\n  Since September 11, we know that terrorists are waiting for targets \nof opportunity. We know now not only that they are waiting for targets \nof opportunity but also that they are capable of hitting their targets. \nThe tragic events of September 11 demonstrated that in such a dramatic \nfashion. It would be reckless and dangerous to provide terrorists with \nmore than a hundred thousand additional targets, which the trucks and \ntrains carrying nuclear waste would become.\n  So, Mr. President, I say to you, and the rest of America, we are \ndepending on the President of the United States, George W. Bush, to be \na man of his word and not allow nuclear waste to travel across this \ncountry until there is sound science. There is not sound science, as \nseparate reports prepared by the General Accounting Office, the \nInspector General of the Department of Energy, and, of course, also by \nthe Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board all make clear.\n  The President should wait until he has credible evidence and a sound \nscientific basis to support a plan for storing nuclear waste at Yucca \nMountain and allowing it to travel across the country.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Secretary of the Treasury, \n     prior to audit or settlement by the General Accounting \n     Office, shall make payments to the State in accordance with \n     such certification by transfers from the extended \n     unemployment compensation account, as so established (or, to \n     the extent that there are insufficient funds in that account, \n     from the Federal unemployment account, as so established) to \n     the account of such State in the Unemployment Trust Fund (as \n     so established).\n\n     SEC. 6. FRAUD AND OVERPAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--If an individual knowingly has made, or \n     caused to be made by another, a false statement or \n     representation of a material fact, or knowingly has failed, \n     or caused another to fail, to disclose a material fact, and \n     as a result of such false statement or representation or of \n     such nondisclosure such individual has received any temporary \n     extended unemployment compensation under this Act to which \n     such individual was not entitled, such individual--\n       (1) shall be ineligible for any further benefits under this \n     Act in accordance with the provisions of the applicable State \n     unemployment compensation law relating to fraud in connection \n     with a claim for unemployment compensation; and\n       (2) shall be subject to prosecution under section 1001 of \n     title 18, United States Code.\n       (b) Repayment.--In the case of individuals who have \n     received any temporary extended unemployment compensation \n     under this Act to which such individuals were not entitled, \n     the State shall require such individuals to repay those \n     benefits to the State agency, except that the State agency \n     may waive such repayment if it determines that--\n       (1) the payment of such benefits was without fault on the \n     part of any such individual; and\n       (2) such repayment would be contrary to equity and good \n     conscience.\n       (c) Recovery by State Agency.--\n       (1) In general.--The State agency may recover the amount to \n     be repaid, or any part thereof, by deductions from any \n     regular compensation or temporary extended unemployment \n     compensation payable to such individual under this Act or \n     from any unemployment compensation payable to such individual \n     under any Federal unemployment compensation law administered \n     by the State agency or under any other Federal law \n     administered by the State agency which provides for the \n     payment of any assistance or allowance with respect to any \n     week of unemployment, during the 3-year period after the date \n     such individuals received the payment of the temporary \n     extended unemployment compensation to which such individuals \n     were not entitled, except that no single deduction may exceed \n     50 percent of the weekly benefit amount from which such \n     deduction is made.\n       (2) Opportunity for hearing.--No repayment shall be \n     required, and no deduction shall be made, until a \n     determination has been made, notice thereof and an \n     opportunity for a fair hearing has been given to the \n     individual, and the determination has become final.\n       (d) Review.--Any determination by a State agency under this \n     section shall be subject to review in the same manner and to \n     the same extent as determinations under the State \n     unemployment compensation law, and only in that manner and to \n     that extent.\n\n     SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act, the terms ``compensation'', ``regular \n     compensation'', ``extended compensation'', ``additional \n     compensation'', ``benefit year'', ``base period'', ``State'', \n     ``State agency'', ``State law'', and ``week'' have the \n     respective meanings given such terms under section 205 of the \n     Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 \n     (26 U.S.C. 3304 note).\n\n     SEC. 8. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       An agreement entered into under this Act shall apply to \n     weeks of unemployment--\n       (1) beginning after the date on which such agreement is \n     entered into; and\n       (2) ending before January 6, 2003.\n\n  The bill, H.R. 3090, as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, for the knowledge of Senators, this is the \nsame language for unemployment insurance extension that we had passed \nearlier. There is no change. I wanted to make that clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I concur with the distinguished \nRepublican leader in making that assertion as well. This is exactly the \nsame language that 7 days ago we sent to the House. My only reason for \nrenewing the request today is because, unfortunately, I think we are \ngoing to be getting a much more comprehensive package back from the \nHouse, a package that clearly doesn't today enjoy the 60 votes that it \nwould require to move not only unemployment compensation but all the \nother issues that are attached.\n  On a bipartisan basis, both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate \nare clear and on record in support, at the very least, of an extension \nof the unemployment benefits, and for good reason. Every day, about \n11,000 people are pushed off the unemployment compensation rolls. About \n77,000 of these workers have been made ineligible for unemployment \ncompensation just since we passed this resolution 7 or 8 days ago. Our \nproposal is simply to give the House an opportunity to take up this \nsimple extension with an expectation at some point later that we could \nentertain economic stimulus legislation as well.\n  I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. Again, this sends a \nclear message. We are very hopeful we can do something to help these \nunemployed workers prior to the President's Day recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for no more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S843-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S843]]\n            PRESIDENT BUSH'S NEW APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this afternoon President Bush outlined a \nnew approach to climate change for this Nation, and I believe for the \nworld.\n  The President has thoughtfully tackled the emotionally charged issue \nof climate change and focused us in a pragmatic way. I believe this is \na demonstration of leadership.\n  He has thoroughly considered the existing scientific evidence, which \nremains inconclusive, and determined that a slow and cautious approach \nto stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions is the most prudent policy.\n  I and many of my colleagues in the Senate have worked hard for years \non this challenging issue and wholeheartedly concur with the \nPresident's decision.\n  The President's determination to aggressively pursue answers to many \ncritical scientific questions and his concern about the effects of \naction on American jobs and our economy are well balanced.\n  The proposed actions in the President's plan will be effective in \ngiving us the change we need. The voluntary nature of these proposals \nprovides needed flexibility to achieve substantial reductions in \nemissions.\n  The President has outlined a strategy that incorporates incentives \nand opportunity for creative ways to achieve those reductions.\n  The President's plan also thoughtfully addresses the critical need to \nactively engage developing countries.\n  I have stated in the past that American policy should recognize the \nlegitimate needs of our bilateral trading partners to use their \nresources and meet the needs of their people.\n  For too long the climate policy debate has been fixated on assigning \nblame and inflicting pain. The President clearly recognizes that this \nis harmful and counterproductive.\n  His plan will make our best technology available to developing \ncountries and will refocus American research activities on developing \ncountry needs as well as our own.\n  During this Congress and the last I, along with many of my \ncolleagues, worked diligently to construct a framework for national \nconsensus on this issue. The legislation that I and several of my \ncolleagues introduced was organized around the central notion of ``risk \nmanagement.''\n  The President's approach is fully consistent with that notion.\n  It develops a ``long-term'' strategy;\n  It quantifies risk by improving scientific research programs;\n  It develops tools to improve energy efficiency and find ways to \nsequester carbon by funding a comprehensive R program;\n  It removes disincentives by removing barriers to deployment of energy \ntechnology; and\n  It encourages a global solution by aggressively pursuing \ninternational technology transfer programs.\n  The benefits of the President's approach are broad-based, as they \nmust always be.\n  It employs a least-cost path to emissions goals by using energy \ntechnology and incentives;\n  It yields real emissions reductions by improving the emission \nreduction registry currently monitored by the DOE;\n  It strengthens the hands of U.S. negotiators by implementing \nsignificant domestic action;\n  It is more than just CO2--it encourages reductions of emissions of \nmethane and other more powerful greenhouse gases;\n  It focuses on more than just the electric power sector by including \nthe agriculture, forestry, transportation industries;\n  It sends the right market signals by focusing on innovation, \ninvestment in new technology--not prescriptive regulation; and\n  It maintains policy flexibility--our future policy response can \nrespond to changing knowledge on technology, understanding of climate \nimpacts and risk.\n  President Bush, I believe, has offered us leadership, and I thank him \nfor it, by setting for our Nation a safe, prudent, and responsible path \ntoward resolving this issue.\n  I hope all of my colleagues in the Senate, especially those who have \nshown great concern about climate change, join with me and seize the \nopportunity that our President has given us to move constructively, \nwithout rancor, to offer up the best technology, the best science, and \nto bring our country together--not to divide our country--and to \ncontinue to progressively achieve, in a recognizable and measurable \nway, reduction in greenhouse gases as we have done over the last \ndecade, and to do so without damaging our economy.\n  I believe that is what President Bush has laid before this Nation \ntoday, and the world: A pragmatic and realistic challenge of leadership \nas it relates to addressing the question of climate change in an \nunderstandable fashion and a manageable approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S843-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S843-S845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I call to the attention of my colleagues \nthe fact that the President announced his plan related to global \nwarming. The plan appears to endorse some of the energy efficiency and \nclean energy incentives that were reported out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee last evening. Obviously, I think all of us welcome White \nHouse support for those initiatives.\n  I hope we can get the same level of support from the White House for \nthe other critical elements in the energy bill that relate to this \nimportant issue of global warming.\n  Unfortunately, the rest of the plan that the administration unveiled \ntoday appears to be little more than business as usual. The President's \nstatement earlier today referenced the voluntary reporting program for \ngreenhouse gas emissions which was established by Congress in 1992 as \npart of the Energy Policy Act.\n  The intent of that program at that time was to encourage the energy \nsector to begin to pay attention to greenhouse gas emissions. It was \nnot to drive serious reductions in emissions. It was a decade ago when \nthat legislation was passed, and we know much more now about global \nwarming and the threat that it could pose to us.\n  According to a year 2000 report by the Energy Information \nAdministration entitled ``Emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the United \nStates,'' U.S. energy intensity--that is the energy consumed per each \ndollar of gross domestic product, and that is sort of the measure the \nPresident referred to--fell by an average of 1.6 percent per year from \n1990 to the year 2000.\n  At the same time that energy intensity was falling, the carbon \nintensity of energy use has remained fairly constant. It is the use of \nless energy per unit of economic output that has kept emissions from \ngrowing at the same rate as the economy is growing, and the rate of \ncarbon emissions per unit of energy is not decreasing--or is decreasing \nvery little, certainly not enough.\n  Our economy has become increasingly oriented toward the service \nsector, toward intellectual, high technology sectors. We are less \nfocused on heavy industry and manufacturing, and we are using less \nenergy per dollar of gross domestic product, which is to be expected as \nour economy has evolved.\n  Yet as the population has grown and affluence has increased, we are \nusing more and more energy without reducing the emissions per unit of \nenergy consumed.\n  Clearly, climate change is an energy issue. We need to address it as \npart of this energy policy debate that we are going to have when the \nCongress returns after next week.\n  The United States committed under the framework convention on climate \nchange that was ratified in the Senate that we would take action to \nreduce emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. Under the plan \nannounced today, the U.S. emissions will be 30 percent above 1990 \nlevels by the year 2012. Continued reliance on these voluntary actions, \nwhich is what the President is urging, without an overall policy \nframework, without specific goals, will not lead to any serious \nreductions in domestic emissions of greenhouse gases.\n  I have to ask why we would sell our technological and entrepreneurial \ningenuity so short. The American people believe climate change is a \ncritical issue. They also believe we can innovate our way to solutions \nto these problems. With the administration approach to addressing \nclimate change, I fear we are communicating to the\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\nworld we no longer have confidence in our technological ability to \nsolve these problems.\n  The energy bill we are going to debate when we return from the recess \nincludes concrete energy policy provisions that will reduce carbon \nintensity in the energy sector. It includes increased vehicle fuel \neconomy and provides incentives to commercialized cutting-edge vehicle \ntechnologies. It gives consumers greater information about emissions \nfrom the energy they use so they can make deliberate decisions to \ncontrol their own contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. It \nincreases the mix of technologies for power generation, including a \nmuch greater role for renewables and more efficient fossil generation \ntechnology.\n  The renewable portfolio standard, for example--and that is a \nprovision in the bill we will be debating--is a market-driven approach \nthat will force renewable projects to compete against each other for a \nshare in the electricity market. To shift to a greater investment and \ncombine heat and power systems could more than double the efficiency of \ncoal-fired generation while dramatically cutting emissions.\n  There are many creative and thoughtful people in the private sector \neager to move forward with these types of projects. The right energy \npolicies can unleash the competitive creativity that will meet our \nenergy needs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We need to agree on a \nframework that removes impediments to efficiency and market \ncompetition, that provides incentives for cleaner energy strategies \nthat will reduce emissions, and a framework that empowers consumers to \ncontrol their energy choices and manage their own environmental impact.\n  When I talk to students in my State--and I am planning to do that on \nseveral occasions this next week--they express great interest in energy \nand environmental issues. They want to know what they can do to affect \ngreenhouse gas emissions. They have a much greater stake in the future \nthan those of us here do, in fact. We need to be sure that 10 years \nfrom now we have not left them with a problem that is out of control. \nWe need to be responsible and prudent now and not wait until 2012 to \nmake hard decisions on this very difficult issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, in the last few days, I have spoken in \nhonor of two prominent Winter Olympians from Vermont, Kelly Clark and \nRoss Powers. They are extraordinary snowboarders and athletes. They \nhave performed miracles in the air and snow in Salt Lake City.\n  I want Vermonters and all Americans to enjoy the Winter Olympics here \nand elsewhere for the foreseeable future. They bring out the best and \nnoblest elements in human nature.\n  Today, the President is announcing his administration's policy to \ndeal with the global warming that threatens the reliability of winter \nand therefore the enjoyment of winter sports. Unfortunately, from what \nI understand, this policy will do nothing to significantly reduce the \ngreenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to global warming.\n  Obviously, this is a very serious matter to Vermonters who love to \nsnowboard, ski and skate, and depend on predictable winters and snow. \nIt is also a serious matter to the mayor of Salt Lake City, whose city \nis taking actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase \nenergy efficiency. Further, I would note that the mayor and the city of \nBurlington, like other progressive State and local leaders and \ncommunities across the Nation, are taking similar actions to fill the \nvoid of Federal leadership on this important issue.\n  I don't mean to be selfish, but I would like to be certain that \nVermonters can continue to win Gold Medals in the Winter Olympics for \ngenerations to come. That means taking credible action on global \nwarming now so winter is around long enough every year for training, \ncompeting, and busting huge air, as the snowboarders say at Suicide Six \nSki Area in Woodstock, VT.\n  Clean air is a major issue in Vermont. We want to stop acid rain, and \nother public health and environmental damage. So, I am glad that the \nPresident has finally put forward his multi-pollutant proposal. We have \nbeen waiting for it since he took carbon dioxide off the table about a \nyear ago. Perhaps the administration will actually work with Congress \non this issue constructively.\n  I hope the administration sends the proposal up the Hill right away \nin legislative form as was promised. That will speed our committee's \ndeliberations and Senate passage.\n  The details are not clear yet, but I hope that it will not entertain \nreducing any existing Clean Air Act protections. That is a crucial \nquestion that Vermonters will ask, from the skiers and snowboarders to \nthe hikers.\n  Unfortunately, real carbon reductions appear to have completely \nfallen off the table in this climate policy. In fact, all we are \ngetting are some crumbs. Some of them even appear to be recycled crumbs \nthat Congress never passed and probably wouldn't have worked anyway.\n  A year ago, the President sent several Senators a unilateral ``Dear \nJohn'' letter rejecting carbon dioxide reductions at power plants and \nformally rejecting the Kyoto Protocol. Today's new climate policy is \nlike delivering the final divorce papers to the public and the world. \nAnd it is divorced from the reality of global warming. Maybe you could \ncall it a love letter to the status quo and the polluting past.\n  The Framework Convention, or the Rio Agreement, that the U.S. Senate \nratified under former President Bush commits us to adopting policies \nthat will achieve 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions. That is our \ncommitment to the world.\n  This policy breaks that commitment. And it fails to acknowledge that \nwe are responsible for emitting 25 percent of the world's greenhouse \ngases. Under this policy our share would continue to grow. There would \nbe no real reduction in our total emissions.\n  I have faith that American ingenuity can develop cleaner, greener and \nmore efficient technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But, \nwithout a hard target to aim at, the arrow of progress is severely \nblunted. Our technology edge, instead of our exports, will pass to \nEurope, China, and other countries.\n  Finally, as I told Governor Whitman yesterday, the administration's \nmulti-pollutant bill has to improve air quality faster and better than \nbusiness as usual to be really credible. We will be asking for that \nkind of proof in the coming days.\n  We will need details on how fast their bill reduces acid rain impacts \nin the Northeast and how quickly it saves lives being lost or damaged \nfrom particulate pollution. Every day of delay hurts the environment \nand public health.\n  I hope their numbers can help move us forward and don't drag us \nbackward.\n  But, I must say, without real carbon dioxide reductions, this \nproposal comes up short. You don't win a race with a three-legged \nhorse, you don't drive a car with three wheels and you don't get lucky \noff a three-leaf clover.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a Washington Post \neditorial by Mayor Anderson from February 8, 2002.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 8, 2002]\n\n                          Winterless Olympics\n\n           (By Ross C. ``Rocky'' Anderson and Bill McKibben)\n\n       Salt Lake City.--When the Winter Olympics opens tonight, \n     both of us will be standing on the sidelines and cheering--\n     one as mayor of the host city, the other as merely a rabid \n     fan of Nordic skiing. But for all the hoopla and speed and \n     elegance, we also are both aware that the future of the \n     Winter Games is in danger, because winter itself is in \n     danger.\n       The world's scientists have issued strong warnings about \n     climate change in the past few years, and their computer \n     models show clearly that, of all seasons, winter may change \n     the most. Across the West, snow levels are expected to climb \n     hundreds of feet up the mountains. In the East, according to \n     a recent assessment by scientific researchers, the cross-\n     country skiing and snowmobile industries ``may become \n     nonexistent by 2100.''\n       The majority of sub-Arctic glacial systems are now in rapid \n     retreat. Sea ice in the Arctic is thinning quickly, and \n     winter measured by dates of first and last freeze, is now \n     almost three weeks shorter across North American latitudes \n     than it was in 1970.\n       Such changes have practical implications. The weakening of \n     winter will, for instance, mean less water stored in mountain\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\n     snowpacks for summer irrigation. The ski industry is already \n     fearful of the economic losses from shortened seasons.\n       As you watch the world's finest athletes glide across your \n     TV screen for the next two weeks, consider, too, how sad it \n     will be to lose much of that part of the year when you can \n     glide across ice or race down a slope.\n       This doesn't have to happen. We've already locked in some \n     global warming from our profligate use of fossil fuels in the \n     past, but it's not too late to take serious action to slow \n     climate change. Indeed, though Washington is still in the \n     grip of the fossil fuel lobbyists, state and local \n     governments are beginning to lead the way to clean energy \n     now.\n       Here in Salt Lake City people are committed to cutting \n     emissions of carbon dioxide 7 percent or more, meeting the \n     targets of the Kyoto Protocol, to which all industrialized \n     nations except the United States (under the Bush \n     administration) have voiced commitment.\n       How will it be done? By reducing energy consumption, \n     preserving large tracts of open space and creating new \n     guidelines for ``high performance buildings.'' Salt Lake City \n     is changing development patterns, expanding its mass \n     transportation system--in short, it's growing smart.\n       Salt Lake City is not alone. The Seattle City Council last \n     fall pledged that the city would meet or beat the targets of \n     the Kyoto treaty on global warming, and promised that its \n     municipal utility would soon be ``carbon-neutral,'' \n     generating power without contributing to the greenhouse \n     effect. Voters in San Francisco last fall passed, by a wide \n     margin, an initiative that commits the city to buying large \n     amounts of solar power. And the governors of the New England \n     states, prodded by new computer models showing that Boston's \n     climate could resemble present-day Atlanta's by century's \n     end, have also committed to reductions in CO2 \n     output.\n       Elsewhere, local governments are experimenting with \n     electric cars and windmills, with gas-guzzler taxes and prime \n     parking spaces for high-mileage cars, with new rapid transit \n     incentives and old utility phase-outs.\n       All of this would be easier and more effective with \n     committed leadership and backing from the federal government. \n     In the meantime, others have to take the lead.\n       Municipalities are good competitors. Every four years, \n     mayors around the world vie with each other to land the next \n     Olympics. If we spent the same effort and creativity on \n     redesigning our cities for energy efficiency, we might do \n     more than determine who wins the next Winter Games.\n       We might actually save winter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S845-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE BIODIESEL PROMOTION ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced S. 1942, the \n``Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002,'' to provide tax incentives for the \nproduction of biodiesel from agricultural oils. I was pleased to be \njoined by Senators Dayton and Johnson as original co-sponsors of my \nbill.\n  I was also pleased yesterday to be joined by Senator Grassley in \noffering S. 1942 in amendment form to the Senate Finance Committee \nEnergy Tax Incentives legislation. My amendment was included in the \nlegislation with an overwhelmingly favorable vote of 16 to 5. The \namendment differs from S. 1942 only in the length of authorization of \nthe program. Due to budget constraints, the amendment authorizes the \nprogram for three years as opposed to the bill language of a ten-year \nauthorization.\n  S. 1942 is a start, but we must make sure that these incentives are \nnot just a flash in the pan. We must ensure that biodiesel becomes a \ncentral component of this nation's automobile fuel market.\n  S. 1942 will provide a partial exemption from the diesel excise tax \nfor diesel blended with biodiesel. Specifically, the bill provides a 1-\ncent reduction for every percent of biodiesel blended with diesel up to \n20 percent.\n  The bill also provides for reimbursing of the Highway Trust Fund from \nthe USDA Commodity Credit Corporation, (CCC). I believe this procedure \nwill protect the Trust Fund from lost revenues due to the biodiesel \nincentive while providing a much-needed boost to our nation's biodiesel \nindustry. The cost to the CCC would be offset at least initially by the \nsavings under the marketing loan program.\n  Biodiesel, which can be made from just about any agricultural oil \nincluding oils from soybeans, cottonseed, or rice, is completely \nrenewable, contains no petroleum, and can be easily blended with \npetroleum diesel. A biodiesel-diesel blend typically contains up to 20 \npercent renewable content. It can be added directly into the gas tank \nof a compression-ignition, diesel engine vehicle with no major \nmodifications. Biodiesel in its neat or pure form is completely \nbiodegradable and non-toxic, contains no sulfur, and it is the first \nand only alternative fuel to meet EPA's Tier I and II health effects \ntesting standards.\n  Biodiesel also has many environmental and operational benefits. One I \nwould like to highlight is the fuel's lubricating characteristics. Even \nat very low blends, biodiesel contributes operational and maintenance \nbenefits to diesel engines by continuously cleansing the engine as it \nruns. This is even more significant when using ultra-low sulfur diesel. \nWith the EPA's new rule to reduce the sulfur content of highway diesel \nfuel by over 95 percent, biodiesel stands ready to help us reach this \nrequirement.\n  Farmers in my State of Arkansas and across the country began \ninvesting in the development of biodiesel because of the economics of \nthe farm industry. Producing biodiesel from farm commodity oils will \nprovide a ready new market for our farm products. Currently, \nagricultural oils are widely produced for use in our food markets. \nHowever, large supplies of vegetable oils in the world market have \nresulted in depressed commodity prices in the domestic market.\n  More than a decade ago, soybean growers recognized that the \ntraditional approach of riding out a depressed market by storing \nsurplus soybean oil until better times would no longer work. The \nindustry had to do more. It needed a proactive and aggressive plan to \ndevelop new markets and expand existing ones. Biodiesel is one of these \nnew markets identified with true potential for displacing large \nquantities of soybean oil.\n  For cotton, the cottonseed is presently about 20 percent of the value \nof the crop. Biodiesel will open new value-added uses for the \ncottonseed oil at a time when new uses and markets are extremely \nimportant because of these hard economic times. And for our rice \nfarmers, biodiesel will provide additional incremental increases in \nvalue to our rice crop and open up a new outlet for the co-product of \nrice bran oil.\n  A Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture study has shown \nthat biodiesel yields 3.2 units of fuel product energy for every unit \nof fossil energy consumed in its life cycle. By contrast, petroleum \ndiesel's life cycle yields only 0.83 units of fuel product energy per \nunit of fossil energy consumed. Such measures confirm the ``renewable'' \nnature of biodiesel.\n  Even after years of research and market development, biodiesel is not \nyet cost-competitive with petroleum diesel. In order to be so, market \nsupport and tax incentives are needed. I believe the provisions \nprovided in this bill will help in leveling the field for biodiesel \nblends and help jumpstart this exciting new industry.\n  The time is right for this investment. It is right for our rural \neconomy, for our environment, and for our national energy security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S845-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S845-S846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SHE FLIES WITH HER OWN WINGS\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I commemorate the \nanniversary of Oregon's statehood, which was secured this day in 1859. \nOregon became the 33rd State to join the Union, and did so as a free \nState. At the time, there was no room for Oregon's new Senators in the \nCapitol, and construction immediately began on the Chamber we find \nourselves in today. One hundred and forty-three years later, there \nseems to be plenty of room in the Congress for Oregon and the 17 States \nthat followed her.\n  From ``fifty-four forty or fight!'' to my State's current motto, \n``She flies with her own wings,'' Oregon has always been emblazoned \nwith the spirit of independence. Inaugurated by the arrival of Lewis \nand Clark at Fort Clatsop in 1805, this spirit of self-determination \nbrought forth the pioneers from across the plains and over the snowy \npeaks of the Rockies and into Oregon Country. It is the marrow of the \npioneers with their axes who forged high into Oregon's forested \nmountains to fell the timber needed to build an empire, and the farmers \nin the emerald valleys who pulled their plows through the soil to grow \nthe crops that feed a nation.\n  The economy that grew from those natural resources stood strong for a \ncentury, during which time we learned to build fish hatcheries and to \nreplant\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\nour trees to ensure a sustainable bounty from the land and the water. \nWhen the hydropower system was built on the Columbia River, rural \nOregon was electrified and the agricultural products of the ``inland \nempire'' were launched into the world. It was at the dedication of \nBonneville Dam in 1937 that President Roosevelt aptly described the \ngrowing challenge of balanced economic growth between urban and rural \nareas. He said that the healthiest growth of urban areas ``actually \ndepends on the simultaneous healthy growth of every smaller community \nwithin a radius of hundreds of miles.''\n  The current economic downturn in my state echoes Roosevelt's \nchallenge. Whether it is in the Silicon Forest or the Doug Fir Forest, \nOregon is learning that entire industries must no longer be pitted \nagainst one another, or rural economies exchanged for urban ones. We \nneed them all, and we have to create an environment for them to \nflourish. Not long ago, Oregon was the Nation's leader in high-tech and \ntimber. Now, Oregon leads the Nation in unemployment and hunger.\n  The wings by which Oregon flies are heavily burdened, and much of the \nweight falls from the Federal Government. Congress has failed to \nproduce a stimulus package to relieve small businesses, families and \nthe unemployed. But federal failures like this are not new to Oregon. \nThe government is still in default on its promise to timber communities \naffected by the Northwest Forest Plan. So, too, are answers due to \nfarmers in the Klamath Basin whose livelihoods were held captive by \nshoddy science.\n  Ironically, Oregon needs both ``more'' and ``less'' of the federal \ngovernment. Oregon needs the federal government to be less burdensome \nto commerce, less capable of wiping out resource-based communities, and \nless eager to carry out grand political experiements on Oregon soil. \nBut it also needs the government to be more honest in its dealings, \nmore accountable for its actions, more targeted in its assistance, and \nmore respectful of local approaches to local problems. It is only in \nsuch a world that Oregon's farmers and ranchers can truly thrive, her \nbusinesses flourish, and her economy survive. On the 143rd anniversary \nof Oregon's statehood, I know this because I know that no bird flies \ntoo high if she flies with her own wings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S846-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S846-S849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      AGRICULTURE, CONSERVATION, AND RURAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the farm bill the Senate passed yesterday.\n  I want to commend Senator Harkin for this bill. Through his \nleadership, the Senate has passed a Farm Bill that will establish a \nbetter economic safety net for many farmers, bolster conservation \nefforts, improve nutrition and food security for our poorest citizens, \nand encourage new opportunities in rural communities. The bill also \nmakes critical investments in agricultural trade and research.\n  I will talk about the long-term policy changes in a moment, but I \nwant to mention a critical amendment sponsored by Senator Baucus. The \nBaucus amendment provides assistance to farmers and ranchers who have \nbeen hard hit by drought and other weather events in the last year. I \nworked with Senator Cantwell to include $100 million in market loss \nassistance for apple growers in the amendment. I am very pleased the \nSenate voted 69-31 in favor of the amendment, and I will work to keep \nit in the final bill.\n  This Farm Bill passed by the Senate today will restore an effective \nsafety net for many of our Nation's farmers.\n  For the last several years, I have heard concerns from farmers in \nWashington State who grow wheat, barley, dry peas, lentils and \nchickpeas. They believe, as I do, that the 1996 Farm Bill failed to \nmeet the needs of producers and rural communities. The strongest \nproponents of the 1996 Farm Bill argued that if we gave producers more \nflexibility, created the best agricultural research system in the \nworld, and opened foreign markets, our farmers would thrive in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  I strongly supported more flexibility in our commodity programs. And \nI have strongly supported efforts to improve our research \ninfrastructure and expand and open foreign markets.\n  But our actions were not enough. Congress could not wave a magic wand \nand create a rational world market for agricultural products. The \ncommodity title of the 1996 Farm Bill was written for a world that \nsimply did not, and does not, exist.\n  This year, in this Farm Bill, Congress has the opportunity to write a \ncommodity title that works. And Senator Harkin and the Senate \nAgriculture Committee did just that. Wheat and barley producers in \nWashington State will benefit from a strong safety net that includes a \ngood balance between higher loan rates, fixed payments, and \ncountercyclical payments when market prices fall below target prices.\n  In addition, the bill includes a new marketing assistance loan \nprogram for dry peas, lentils, and chickpeas. I applaud this provision \nin the bill. It will help restore market-based decisions and make it \neconomical for producers across the northern-tier States to grow these \nimportant rotational crops. I have been pleased to work with my dry \npea, lentil, and chickpea growers in Washington State on this important \nissue. I believe it is critical, and I urge, the conferees to retain \nthis provision in the final bill.\n  The Senate Farm Bill makes critical investments in conservation. The \nconservation title creates new opportunities to conserve resources on \nprivate lands while helping farmers and ranchers with their bottom \nlines.\n  The conservation title of this bill gradually increases funding for \nthe Environmental Quality Incentives Program from its existing \nauthorization of $200 million a year to $1.5 billion each year. EQIP is \nan effective and flexible tool. It provides technical, financial, and \neducational assistance to producers to build animal waste management \nfacilities, improve irrigation efficiency, or enhance wildlife habitat. \nThe EQIP funding included in this bill will help us improve water \nquality and salmon habitat in the Pacific Northwest.\n  The bill also includes commonsense increases for the Conservation \nReserve Program and the Wetlands Reserve Program. While I recognize \nthere are some concerns in farm country with expanding these programs, \nI believe the CRP and WRP provisions in this bill are reasonable.\n  The bill includes a new water conservation program within CRP. I \nbelieve this program will lead to new opportunities to protect fish and \nwildlife, while respecting the rights of our farmers and ranchers. As \nthe bill goes to conference, I look forward to working with interested \norganizations on this issue.\n  Finally, the conservation title expands our investments in the \nFarmland Protection Program, the Wildlife Habitat Improvement Program, \nthe Resource Conservation and Development Program, establishes a new \nConservation Security Program, and improves forestry initiatives.\n  The conservation changes made in this bill are particularly important \nto States like Washington. The farmers in my State produce \napproximately 230 commodities. However, only a fraction of these \ncommodities have a direct income or price support relationship with the \nFederal Government.\n  Without new investments in the Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram, the Conservation Reserve Program, and the Conservation \nSecurity Program, many farmers and ranchers would not receive the \nfinancial help they need to make the conservation investments the \npublic is demanding. This bill creates a win-win situation for the \nenvironment and for farmers and ranchers.\n  I believe Congress also has a responsibility to create a win-win \nsituation for our farmers and ranchers with respect to trade. One way \nwe can do this is to invest in trade promotion programs that will help \nour farmers build marketshare in foreign countries.\n  In 1999, and again in 2001, I introduced the Agricultural Market \nAccess and Development Act. My legislation would increase funding in \nthe Market Access Program to $200 million and enhance funding for the \nForeign Market Development Program. I was joined on that legislation by \na bipartisan coalition of members.\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\n  The Senate Farm Bill includes substantial new investments in the \nMarket Access Program and the Foreign Market Development Program, and I \nwas pleased to be the leading advocate in the Senate to enhance these \nprograms.\n  Congress also has a responsibility to allow all commodity groups to \nparticipate in our foreign food aid programs. I worked to include a \nsmall provision in the Farm Bill that requires the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture to issue a report on the use of perishable commodities, \nlike potatoes and apples, in foreign food aid programs. Specifically, \nmy amendment requires USDA to report to the Congress on transportation \nand storage infrastructure problems and funding problems that have \nprevented greater participation in the programs by specialty crops.\n  Just recently, 110,000 boxes of apples arrived in Vladivostok, \nRussia. This is the first time USDA has funded a shipment of perishable \ncommodities through our foreign food aid programs. I believe our fruit \nand vegetable producers deserve an opportunity to participate in these \ninitiatives, and I believe this report will be an important first step \nin improving access to these programs.\n  The Farm Bill includes additional provisions that I believe will help \nour farmers and ranchers.\n  The first would require country-of-origin labeling for fruits and \nvegetables, meat, and farm-raised fish and shellfish. We require our \nfarmers and ranchers to meet environmental and food safety standards \nthat are far above many of our competitors. Country-of-origin labeling \nwill give consumers additional information with which to make a \ndecision on the food they buy.\n  The second provision would allow the Federal Government to guarantee \nprivate loans to Cuba for the purchase of U.S. agricultural products. \nFor too long, the United States has used food as a weapon against the \nCuban people. The only person that has benefitted from this policy is \nFidel Castro. I strongly support the Committee's bill with respect to \nCuba, and I was pleased to join with my colleagues in defeating an \namendment to eliminate these new financing tools.\n  Trade is critical to the long-term future of our agricultural \nproducers. One other long-term investment we need to make is in the \narea of agricultural research.\n  In my home State, we are fortunate to have an excellent working \nrelationship between our State universities and the USDA Agricultural \nResearch Service. Through these partnerships, our universities and USDA \nhave been able to leverage limited resources to create new varieties of \ncrops, enhance food safety and improve conservation. This research \nbenefits farmers, consumers, and the environment.\n  I am pleased that this Farm Bill strengthens our research \ninfrastructure and increases funding for priority research initiatives. \nOne program that is of particular significance to researchers in \nWashington State is the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food \nSystems, and I am pleased the Senate bill includes additional funding \nfor it.\n  The Farm Bill goes far beyond agriculture and conservation. It is a \ncritical vehicle for helping communities and the poor.\n  Senator Harkin has always been a leader in rural development, and \nthis Farm Bill shows how seriously he takes this issue.\n  Included in the managers' amendment is a provision I authored on \nrural telecommunications planning. It would simply modify the broadband \ntelecommunications grant program in the bill to add a small planning \ncomponent. I will work to include this and other rural \ntelecommunications provisions in the final bill.\n  I would like to complete my remarks by commending Senators Harkin and \nLugar for their efforts in writing a strong nutrition title in this \nFarm Bill. Both the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee have \nan outstanding record on these issues. During debate on the Farm Bill, \nI was pleased to support amendments that further strengthened the food \nstamp program changes included in the bill.\n  The underlying bill made significant improvements to the food stamp \nprogram. It provides three more months of transition food stamps for \nfamilies moving off welfare. It simplifies the program for State \nadministrators and participating families. It helps benefits keep up \nwith inflation and addresses the needs of the poorest families. And it \nrestores eligibility for low-income working legal immigrants and their \nfamilies.\n  The Senate also passed amendments by Senators Durbin, Dorgan, and \nMcConnell that expanded the nutrition title. The Durbin amendment \nhelped restore food stamp benefits to legal immigrants who have lived \nin the United States for five years. The Dorgan amendment expanded \naccess to food stamps for families with children and modified the \nexcess shelter expense deduction. The McConnell amendment expanded \naccess to food stamps for low-income disabled families.\n  I was pleased to support final passage of this legislation. I believe \nit is the right bill at the right time for rural America, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues as the bill goes to conference.\n\n\n                    TRIBAL FORESTRY IN THE FARM BILL\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on two tribal \nforestry amendments that were included in the Farm Bill that passed the \nSenate yesterday. I was pleased to work on these amendments with \nSenators Inouye, Daschle, Cantwell, Baucus, and Wellstone.\n  The purpose of these amendments is to improve coordination between \nthe United States Forest Service and Native Americans in managing and \nprotecting our natural resources.\n  The Forest Service owns millions of acres of forests and grasslands \nthat share borders with land owned by tribes and by individual Native \nAmericans. It is in the national interest for the Forest Service and \ntribes to coordinate their efforts to protect and manage these \nresources. It is also the Federal Government's fiduciary responsibility \nto assist tribes in managing trust lands and to ensure that tribal \ntreaty rights on Forest Service lands are upheld. While over the years \nthe Forest Service has adopted many policies regarding relationships \nwith tribal governments, these policies have not been implemented \nconsistently.\n  In 1999, the Chief of the Forest Service created a National Tribal \nRelations Task Force to make recommendations to strengthen policies and \nimprove coordination. The Task Force, which included representatives \nfrom the Forest Service, the Intertribal Timber Council and the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs, BIA, found that, ``Specific legal authorities, \nauthorizing legislation, regulations, manuals, and handbooks, must be \nmodified to expand the foundation necessary to build long-term working \nrelationships with Indian Tribes.''\n  These amendments build upon the recommendations made by the Task \nForce. The first amendment expands the Cooperative Forestry Assistance \nAct to include a section creating four programs for tribal governments. \nCurrently, tribes are eligible to participate in the Forestry \nIncentives and Forest Stewardship programs created by the Act, but \nthere are significant barriers to tribal involvement in these programs, \nwhich were designed primarily for state governments.\n  This amendment would allow the Secretary to facilitate tribal \nconsultation and coordination on issues related to tribal rights and \ninterests on Forest Service land, management of shared resources, and \ntribal traditional and cultural expertise. It would also authorize the \nSecretary to provide assistance with: conservation awareness programs \non tribal forest land; technical assistance for resources planning, \nmanagement and conservation; and tribal acquisition of conservation \ninterests from willing sellers.\n  The second amendment to the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act would \ncreate an Office of Tribal Relations within the Forest Service. The \npurpose of this Office is to provide advice to the Secretary on Forest \nService policies and programs affecting Native Americans, to ensure \ncoordination between the Forest Service and tribes and to administer \ntribal programs set up by the Forest Service. The amendment also \nrequires the Office to coordinate with other agencies within the \nAgriculture Department, as well as with the BIA and the Environmental \nProtection Agency. Finally, the amendment requires the Office to create \nan annual\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\nreport on the status of these efforts to increase partnerships between \nthe Forest Service and Native Americans.\n  There is widespread support for these amendments authorizing greater \ncollaboration between the Forest Service and Native American tribes. \nThe Department of the Interior is in favor of these amendments, and the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture has signed off on them as well. I have \nheard from several Washington state tribes asking me to be an advocate \nfor these additions to the Forestry Title of the Farm bill. I am \nespecially grateful for the Makah Tribe and the Intertribal Timber \nCouncil, which brought these ideas to me last year. Also, I greatly \nappreciate the assistance I have received from Senators Daschle, \nInouye, Cantwell, and Baucus in working on these amendments. I also \nappreciate help I received from Senators Harkin and Lugar so these \namendments could be included in a manager's package of amendments to \nthe Farm Bill. On behalf of the numerous tribes with forest and \ngrasslands bordering Forest Service lands.\n\n\n     ENDORSEMENT OF AMENDMENT TO BAN PACKER OWNERSHIP OF LIVESTOCK\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to call to the attention of \nmy colleagues an editorial which appeared in the Huron, SD Daily \nPlainsman entitled ``We Need Action, Not Another Study.'' This \neditorial provides a strong endorsement of the bipartisan amendment \nthat Senator Grassley and I had included in the Senate version of the \nfarm bill to ban the ownership of livestock by packers.\n  This newspaper recognizes the importance of my amendment and \nunderstands the real motivation behind the lobbying efforts to replace \nmy language with a study on vertical integration--to kill it.\n  This editorial speaks clearly to the importance of having a farm bill \nthat goes after concentration and replaces government checks with \ndollars from a true, competitive marketplace.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial published \nin the Huron Daily Plainsman on February 10, 2002, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Huron Daily Plainsman, Feb. 10, 2002]\n\n                   We Need Action, Not Another Study\n\n       An amendment to the Senate farm bill being offered by Sen. \n     Tim Johnson, D-S.D., that would ban packer ownership of \n     livestock 14 days prior to slaughter is running into rough \n     resistance from the packing industry.\n       The latest is an amendment that would replace Johnson's \n     proposal with a study.\n       Passing a farm bill that generously hands out taxpayers' \n     dollars to producers who are caught in the mire of low \n     services caused by corporate concentration in the \n     agricultural industry isn't the idea. More important is a \n     farm bill that attacks concentration and replaces government \n     checks with dollars from the marketplace that are generated \n     from true market competition.\n       The Johnson-Grassley amendment is a step in that direction. \n     If Congress decides to study it some more, all that will do \n     is to allow the big boys to get even bigger and continue the \n     economic depression that has staggered rural South Dakota the \n     last five years.\n       Smithfield Foods, which owns the John Morrell plant in \n     Sioux Falls, recently placed ads in South Dakota newspapers \n     criticizing Johnson's amendment. The ad said that if the \n     amendment becomes law, Smithfield Foods would not rebuild the \n     Sioux Falls plant, or build a new plant in South Dakota or \n     make any further investment in South Dakota or any other \n     state where public officials are hostile to their company.\n       The ad has been called economic blackmail and politically \n     motivated. It appeared only in South Dakota newspapers, even \n     though Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, is a co-sponsor of the \n     amendment and Smithfield owns a plant in Iowa. Johnson, who \n     has championed a number of bills, such as the ban of packer \n     ownership of livestock and a meat-labeling law, that brought \n     the ire of the meat-packing industry down on him, is facing a \n     tough re-election bid against Rep. John Thune.\n       But the motivation of the Smithfield ad is clear and \n     simple--further control and dominance of the livestock \n     industry.\n       It must be remembered that Smithfield is the company that \n     bought out the Dakota Pork plant and then promptly closed it \n     down, abruptly putting about 800 people out of work. At the \n     time, Dakota Pork was John Morrell's main competition for \n     South Dakota hogs.\n       In the Smithfield ad, not only did the company criticize \n     Johnson's amendment, but it also said Amendment E was a \n     restrictive law that was responsible for diminishing the \n     supply of South Dakota hogs to its Sioux Falls plant.\n       But what has caused the decline of the hog industry in \n     South Dakota was not the law that banned corporate hog farms \n     in the state, but the vertical integration business practices \n     of companies such as Smithfield Foods that seek to dominate \n     the industry from the gate to the plate.\n       The ``it's either our way or no way'' business philosophy \n     of giant agricultural corporations seeks to industrialize the \n     agricultural industry at the expense of independent farmers \n     and ranchers and rural communities.\n       Smithfield, which is already the world's largest producer \n     and processor of hogs, also reflects a corporate philosophy \n     that is troubling to independent producers and rural \n     communities.\n       Grassley recently spoke of a conversation he had with the \n     head of Smithfield, Joe Luters, when Luters said that the \n     average farmer isn't sophisticated.\n       ``I wish we could remember the exact words because it was \n     very denigrating to the family farmer, not being smart enough \n     to run his operation,'' Grassley said.\n       The objectives of this amendment are to increase \n     competitive bidding, choice, market access, and bargaining \n     power to farmers and ranchers in livestock markets.\n       Now, does that sound like that would destroy the pork and \n     beef industry? Or does it sound like it would threaten large \n     corporations in their bid to decrease independent producers' \n     ability to have competitive bidding, choice, market access, \n     and bargaining in livestock markets?\n\n\n        PLANNING GRANTS FOR RURAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased that Chairman Harkin and \nSenator Lugar accepted my amendment on rural telecommunications to the \nFarm Bill that passed the Senate yesterday.\n  My amendment simply adds a small planning component to the scope of \nacceptable activities for grants in the bill to help rural communities \nget connected to broadband telecommunications services.\n  Specifically, my amendment would provide access to broadband planning \nand feasibility grants to rural communities, with a maximum of $250,000 \nfor statewide grants and $100,000 for regional grants. The total \nresources would be no more than $3 million per year for this purpose. \nState governments, regional consortia of local governments, tribal \ngovernments, cooperatives, and State and regional non-profit entities \nwould be eligible to receive the grants.\n  As small and rural communities across the country try to get \nconnected to advanced telecommunications services, they need help in \nthe planning stage. And this amendment will give them the help they \nneed.\n  Three years ago, I formed several working groups in my state to \nidentify the primary needs of our rural communities and to find ways \nthat our government can help meet those needs. We learned that many \nrural communities don't have access to advanced telecom services, like \nhigh speed Internet access. That lack of access is hampering their \neconomic development and quality of life.\n  So I developed another working group to look for ways to help \ncommunities get connected to advanced telecommunications services. The \nmembers of my Rural Telecommunications Working Group held forums around \nthe state that attracted hundreds of people. We tapped the ideas of \nexperts, service providers and people from across the State who are \nworking to get their communities connected.\n  They found that while urban and suburban areas have strong \ncompetition between telecommunications providers, many small and rural \ncommunities are far removed from the services they need.\n  We must ensure that all communities have access to advanced \ntelecommunications like high speed Internet access. Just as yesterday's \ninfrastructure was built of roads and bridges, today our infrastructure \nincludes advanced telecom services.\n  Advanced telecommunications can enrich our lives through activities \nlike distance-learning, and they can even save lives through efforts \nlike telemedicine. The key is access. Access to these services is \nalready turning some small companies in rural communities into \ninternational marketers of goods and services.\n  Unfortunately, many small and rural communities are having trouble \ngetting the access they need. Before areas can take advantage of some \nof the help and incentives that are out there, they need to work \ntogether and go through a community planning process.\n  Community plans identify the needs and level of demand, create a \nvision for\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\nthe future, and show what all the players must do to meet the telecom \nneeds of their community for today and tomorrow.\n  These plans take resources to develop. This amendment would provide \nthose funds.\n  Providers say they're more likely to invest in an area if it has a \nplan that makes a business case for the costly infrastructure \ninvestment. Communities want to provide them with that plan, but they \nneed help developing it.\n  Unfortunately, many communities get stuck on that first step. They \ndon't have the resources to do the studies and planning required to \nattract service.\n  So the members of my Working Group came up with a solution: have the \nFederal Government provide competitive grants that local communities \ncan use to develop their plans.\n  I took that idea and put it into a bill that I introduced in June \n2001, S. 1056, the Community Telecommunications Planning Act of 2001. \nThe basic structure of that amendment was incorporated into the Farm \nBill.\n  When you think about it, it just makes sense. Right now the Federal \nGovernment already provides money to help communities plan other \ninfrastructure improvements, everything from roads and bridges to \nwastewater facilities.\n  The amendment would provide rural and underserved communities with \ngrant money for creating community plans, technical assessments and \nother analytical work that needs to be done.\n  With these grants, communities will be able to turn their desire for \naccess into real access that can improve their communities and \nstrengthen their economies. This amendment can open the door for \nthousands of small and rural areas across our state to tap the \npotential of the information economy.\n  I will work to ensure this provision is included in the final bill \nalong with the other critical telecommunications initiatives that \npassed the Senate yesterday.\n\n\n                           butter/powder tilt\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, \nsets a price for the purchase of non-fat dry milk and the economic \nimpact of USDA's decision is very important to California dairy \nfarmers. On May 31, 2001, USDA made a decision to drop the price at \nwhich it will purchase non-fat dry milk as part of the dairy price \nsupport program.\n  USDA did not provide the dairy industry with an opportunity to \nprovide information or comment on the Department's recommended \ndecision. There was no advance notice or public hearings.\n  USDA conducted an economic analysis and all of the options may have \nbeen analyzed. But this information has not been released to the \npublic, even though it was requested under the Freedom of Information \nAct.\n  In the first 6 months after USDA's decision to lower the price for \nnon-fat dry milk took effect, California's dairy farm families lost \ntens of millions of dollars. In meetings with USDA, California farmers \nlearned that another drop in the price is under consideration, which \nwould result in millions more lost to dairy farmers. California \nproduces 40 percent of the nation's supply of non-fat dry milk and so \nCalifornia could be hit hard yet again.\n  Transparency is a critical part of a fair and equitable decision-\nmaking process and it does not currently exist in the USDA process for \nsetting the non-fat dry milk price. The Secretary is currently required \nto make a decision that includes factors such as cost reduction to \nUSDA. The Secretary also must consider other factors that the Secretary \nconsiders appropriate. I believe additional steps should be taken \nduring the conference to assure tranparency in the Secretary's \ndecision-making process.\n  Factors that may be important to a decision to change the prices for \nbutter and non-fat dry milk include: whether the decision will result \nin an intended change in milk production, whether the change will \nactually reduce government purchases and related costs, whether it will \nchange producer milk prices, and whether other market factors, such as \nimports, have an effect.\n  Milk Protein Concentrate, MPC, is of particular concern. A recent GAO \nstudy documented significant increases in MPC imports that may be \ndisplacing domestic milk protein products. Since USDA is not releasing \nits economic analysis, we cannot know whether this important issue is \nbeing properly considered.\n  I would like to ask the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nSenator Harkin, if he would be willing to work with me on additional \nlanguage to address this issue during the conference?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be pleased to work to address the concerns of the \nSenator from California regarding USDA procedures for the dairy support \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S849-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PRESIDENT BUSH'S CHINA VISIT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, later this month President Bush will be \nvisiting the People's Republic of China. Clearly this is going to be an \nimportant visit. The issues the President will discuss with China's \nleaders are among the most important of our national agenda, including \nthe following:\n  The war on terrorism, where we need China's continued support and \ncooperation.\n  The global economy and our bilateral economic relations with the PRC, \na new member of the WTO.\n  Security relations in Asia where both of our countries have important \ninterests and long-standing and close ties to other regional powers.\n  Among all these issues, though, one that will undoubtedly be raised \nby the PRC is Taiwan. It is a pretty safe bet that the PRC's leaders \nwill try to use the President's visits to win some concessions on \nissues relating to Taiwan. They will probe for any signs that the \nUnited States is willing to compromise some of our interests in a \nstrong U.S.-ROC relationship in exchange for real or promised \nstrengthening of our ties with Beijing.\n  I know the President will be ready for this gambit, and will be fully \nprepared and determined to turn back any such efforts by Beijing. The \nPresident has already made it clear how important our ties with Taiwan \nare to the United States, and he has made it equally clear that he will \nnot compromise our interest in regard to Taiwan in any way.\n  I am confident he also knows that as he pursues this strong, \nprincipled and sensible stand, he will have the full backing of the \nU.S. Senate. He will not stand for any Beijing attempts to undermine \nU.S.-ROC relations, and he knows the Senate of the United States won't, \neither.\n  The fact is, the Republic of China is one of our best friends in the \nregion. It is also one of the region's strongest economies and most \nvibrant democracies. We have extensive ties to Taiwan, which are both \narticulated and protected in the Taiwan Relations Act. We are not going \nto do anything to compromise those ties.\n  I know I speak for all Senators when I express the wish that the \nPresident's visit to the PRC will be productive and advance our \ninterests in Asia and the world, and when I express the confidence that \nU.S.-ROC relations will continue to be strong and to prosper, even as \nour relations with Beijing evolve.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in keeping with my policy on public \ndisclosure of holds, today I placed a hold on further action on the \nClean Diamond Trade Act, legislation reported out by House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Although this bill is very important to the continent of Africa's \nefforts to rid itself of rebels that use the sale of rough diamonds to \noverthrow legitimate governments, the measures in this legislation fall \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  The proposed legislation calls for prohibiting diamond imports and \nshould be discussed thoroughly before any rash decisions are made. With \nthis in mind it is necessary for this bill to be referred to the \nFinance Committee to be heard and debated by our members before we send \nthis legislation back to the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S849-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S849-S850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NATIONAL DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as we commemorate National Duchenne \nAwareness Week, I express my gratitude to my colleagues and to the Bush \nadministration for their support late last year in passing H.R. 717, \nthe Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance Research and Education Act.\n\n[[Page S850]]\n\n  Sadly, at this time, there is no cure for DMD. Little boys with DMD \nare most often not diagnosed before the age of 2 or 3 years. Most boys \nwith DMD walk by themselves later than average, and then in an unusual \nmanner. They may fall frequently, have difficulty rising from the \nground, or experience difficulty going up steps. Calf muscles typically \nlook over-developed or excessively large, while other muscles are \npoorly developed. Use of a wheelchair may be occasional at age 9, but \ntotal dependence is usually established in the teen years. Most boys \naffected survive into their twenties, with relatively few surviving \nbeyond 30 years of age.\n  I have heard from the parents and family of two little boys in Maine \nwho have DMD. Their names are Matthew and Patrick Denger, and their \nfamily members are desperately hoping for a cure so they don't have to \nwatch their sons suffer the long-term impacts of this debilitating \ndisease. While we are far from finding a cure for DMD, I am hopeful \nthat the MD CARE Act, signed into law by President Bush on December 18, \n2001, will help Matthew and Patrick and the thousands of other young \nboys suffering from DMD. Specifically, the act authorizes the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services to expand and increase coordination of the \nactivities by the National Institutes of Health with respect to \nresearch on muscular dystrophies, including DMD.\n  Efforts to improve the quality and length of life for thousands of \nchildren suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy are valuable beyond \nmeasure, and I commend all of my colleagues and all of the families who \nhave worked so hard to raise awareness about this devastating disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S850-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr President, I rise to speak in support of the President \nBush's Clear Skies proposal that he announced earlier today. The \npresident's proposal is a plan that would use our nation's greatest \nresource, the ingenuity of our private industries, to ensure our \nchildren and grand children can inherit, not just a healthy \nenvironment, but a healthy economy as well.\n  The President has made this possible by giving industries a clear \ntarget to reduce emissions but will allow them to find the means and \nthe method to reach those targets without following the traditional \ncommand and control environmental policies that have proven to be such \na big failure in the past.\n  The goals are not going to be easy to reach. His proposal to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 18 percent over the next ten years is going \nto require Industry stretch if it is going to measure up to the \nPresident's yardstick. But the goals are attainable, and, more \nimportantly can be reached without bankrupting rural communities that \nrely on energy development, or by hurting those people who will suffer \nmost by rising energy prices--people like seniors or low income \nfamilies who could be forced to chose between paying their heating \nbills or buying food.\n  I also want to applaud the President for his willingness to reach out \nto developing nations to help work with them in developing a truly \nglobal effort to address global warming.\n  I have had the privilege of representing the United Senate at a \nnumber of Global Warming Conferences, starting with Kyoto, Buenos \nAires, Seattle and more recently at the Hague. Those meetings provided \nme an opportunity to meet with global warming experts and \nrepresentatives from other nations to discuss the role of the U.S. \nSenate in ratifying any treaty signed as a result of the United Nations \nnegotiations.\n  Based on a 1997 Byrd-Hagel resolution, that passed the Senate on a \nfinal vote of 95 to 0, my message at each conference has included two \nimportant mandates that the Senate feels must be present in any global \nagreement affecting the United States. First, developing countries \ncurrently excluded from the framework protocol must be included in any \nfinal agreement; and second, the agreement could not result in serious \nharm to the United States' economy.\n  This is an issue that I have also been privileged to work on in my \nnew capacity as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nwhere last year we passed an amendment proposed by my distinguished \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, to the Department of State \nReauthorization Act that encouraged the President to do exactly what he \nhas done today. The President's new proposal reengages the United \nStates as major player in the international global warming debate, this \ntime not as the country that will bank roll all of the programs, but as \na leader that will show other nations the way to improve the \nenvironment without destroying the economy.\n  Under the President's proposal, US companies will be able to invest \nin technologies to offset greenhouse gas emissions without fearing that \nthey will not get credit for their innovations, or that they will have \neven greater or more difficult requirements imposed on them because of \ntheir voluntary effort. They will no longer have to worry that they \nwill be penalized for having done the right thing.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I applaud the President Bush for his \nproposal and for his vote of confidence in the people of the United \nStates. American know-how and ingenuity has fueled the technological \nadvances we are already using today to make steady improvements in air \nand water quality. The President hit the nail right on the head when he \nsaid that it is our strong economy that makes it possible for us to \nmake those necessary technological advances.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S850-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S850-S851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          TRIBUTE TO BOB KRICK\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

Mr. President, Since it is Valentine's Day, I \nwould like to offer a few brief comments on the heart health status of \nour nation. It is a serious concern in my state of Oklahoma and all \nacross the country. Today over two thousand Americans will die from \nsome form of cardiovascular disease, and in my state of Oklahoma, \nalmost 45 percent of all deaths this year will be from cardiovascular \ndisease. Heart disease is the number one leading cause of death in \nOklahoma and in America. This is a sad state of affairs.\n  Although some children are born with heart conditions, and others may \nhave a genetic tendency toward developing cardiovascular disease, there \nare many people suffering who could have prevented the onset of heart \ndisease. A healthy diet and regular cardiovascular exercise can prevent \nhigh blood cholesterol levels, obesity, and high blood pressure, all of \nwhich are risk factors for heart disease.\n  I appreciate the work of the American Heart Association and others in \nraising awareness of the risk factors, warning signs, and preventative \nlifestyle behaviors that are crucial in our fight against this type of \ndisease. This year the focus of Heart Month, which we celebrate every \nFebruary, is Being Prepared in a Cardiac Emergency. I encourage all of \nmy fellow Americans to take a CPR class, and I urge parents to teach \ntheir children how to call 9-1-1 in an emergency. Taking just a few \ncautionary steps can save lives.\n  Heart-shaped cards and candies inundate us this week and especially \ntoday. When we see these playful reminders of Valentine's Day, let us \nbe reminded of how we must take care of our heart health and continue \nto fight the tragedy of heart disease in our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S851-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO STAMFORD'S FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN POLICE OFFICER\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

The 366th Wing of MHAFB deployed three of their \nflying squadrons during this recent and ongoing operation, which \nincluded the 389th Fighter Squadron of F-16Cs, the 391st Fighter \nSquadron of F-15Es, and the 34th Bomber Squadron of B-1Bs. During their \ntime in and around Afghanistan the 389th flew daily sorties attacking \nTaliban vehicles, facilities, and cave complexes. The 391st added to \ntoppling the Taliban and al Qaeda by dropping a majority of the 500 \npound precision-guided munitions. And finally, the 34th were the lead \nbombers of the campaign and accounted for a majority of the Air Force's \n14 million pounds of munitions in the first 95 days of the air \ncampaign.\n  Without these squadrons' support, justice might still have been \nserved in Afghanistan, but it would not have been served forcefully, \nwith authority, and with accurate and deadly precision. This was a \ntremendous accomplishment which demonstrated to potential evil-doers \nthat aggression against the United States will provoke a response from \nMountain Home Air Force Base and other United States entities.\n  While the 389th, the 391st and the 34th received well-deserved \nattention, let us not forget the efforts of MHAFB here at home \nprotecting the United States. In addition to its efforts abroad, MHAFB \nis playing a significant role in defending our nation as part of \nOperation Noble Eagle. Currently, the 726th Air Control Squadron is \nprotecting our interior air space twenty-four hours a day. And as I \nspeak, the 726th is monitoring the air traffic over and around Salt \nLake City ensuring the Olympics continue without interruption. Also \nhelping support a safe Olympics is the 22nd Air Refueling Squadron of \nMountain Home, which is flying air refueling missions for the combat \nair patrol fighters around Salt Lake.\n  Once again, I want to thank all of our men and women in uniform for \ntheir efforts and I especially want to take this opportunity to salute \nMHAFB. As the motto of the 366th Wing says, ``Audentes Fortuna Juvat,'' \nFortune Favors the Bold. I am proud that Idaho is the home of the bold \nmen and women of Mountain Home AFB, and I wish them good fortune in all \ntheir future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S851-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S851-S852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMEMORATING THE RETIREMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL WILLIAM A. MOORMAN\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to bring to your \nattention today the exemplary work and most commendable public service \nof one or our country's outstanding military leaders, Major General \nWilliam A. Moorman, the Judge Advocate General of the United States Air \nForce. General Moorman will be retiring after an especially \ndistinguished military career on May 1, 2002.\n  General Moorman entered the Air Force in 1971 through the Air Force \nReserve Officer Training Corps program. His early assignments included \nRichards-Gabaur Air Force Base, Missouri, Yokota Air Base, Japan, \nHomestead\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\nAir Force Base, Florida, Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, and at the \nPentagon here in Washington, D.C. He later served as the Staff Judge \nAdvocate for 12th Air Force and U.S. Southern Command Air Forces, \nBergstrom Air Force Base, Texas; as the first Staff Judge Advocate of \nU.S. Strategic Air Command, Offut Air Force Base, Nebraska; Staff Judge \nAdvocate U.S. Air Forces in Europe, Ramstein Air Base, Germany; \nCommander Air Force Legal Services Agency, Bolling Air Force Base, \nWashington, D.C.; Staff Judge Advocate Air Combat Command, Langley Air \nForce Base, Virginia; and finally his current position as The Judge \nAdvocate General of the United States Air Force, where he serves in the \nPentagon.\n  General Moorman was born and raised in Chicago, and his father and \nmother, James and Mary Moorman, still reside in its suburbs. General \nMoorman earned a Bachelor's degree in history and economics at the \nUniversity of Illinois, and then went on to attend the University of \nIllinois College of Law. He is a graduate of Squadron Officer School, a \nDistinguished Graduate of Air Command and Staff College, Maxwell Air \nForce Base, Alabama, and a graduate of the National War College, Fort \nMcNair, Washington, D.C. General Moorman is admitted to practice before \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the United States \nDistrict Court for the Seventh Circuit and the Illinois State courts. \nHis military decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal, the \nLegion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, the Defense Meritorious Service \nMedal, the Meritorious Service Medal with four oak leaf clusters, and \nthe Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for his service in Panama during \nOperation JUST CAUSE. General Moorman was also recognized as the \nOutstanding Young Judge Advocate of the Air Force in 1979, winning the \nAlbert M. Kuhfeld Award, and as the Outstanding Senior Attorney of the \nAir Force in 1992, winning the Stuart R. Reichart Award.\n  Since 1999 General Moorman has served as The Judge Advocate General \nof the Air Force. In that capacity, he led and inspired an organization \nof over 3,000 military and civilian lawyers, paralegals, and support \npersonnel. General Moorman's dynamic leadership, sound judgment, \npersonal and professional integrity and unwavering devotion to duty \nwere instrumental in the successful resolution of numerous difficult \nissues facing the JAG Department and the Air Force. At the same time, \nhe was a key and trusted advisor to two Air Force Chiefs of Staff who \nrelied on his sound, timely and cogent advice in resolving a host of \ncomplex legal and policy issues they encountered as the military \nleaders of the Department of the Air Force.\n  A visionary leader, Bill Moorman's tenure as The Judge Advocate \nGeneral was marked by innovation and an unwavering focus on serving the \nneeds of his Air Force client, wherever and whenever the mission \nrequired. From the outset of his assignment as the Judge Advocate \nGeneral, he set about to leverage technology, particularly the use of \nelectronic media and communications capabilities, and focus the efforts \nof his Department on a common vision for its evolution in the coming \nyears. He drew upon the collective expertise of his most knowledgeable \nsenior leaders to create several cornerstone publications, including \nthe first ever judge advocate doctrine, and the ``TJAG Vision for the \n21st Century.'' These documents articulate a common understanding of \nthe unique and increasingly critical capabilities military legal \nprofessionals bring to bear in support of air and space operations and \nwill ensure the momentum his efforts generated continue beyond his \ntenure.\n  Another hallmark of General Moorman's leadership was his sustained \ninitiative to maintain the high levels of skill and competency of the \nlegal professionals who comprise the Department. His efforts were \ninstrumental in enactment of legislation authorizing continuation pay \nfor judge advocates, a measure that is reversing a perennial recruiting \nand retention problem by ameliorating spiraling student loan financial \nburdens that previously had prevented many of our best and brightest \nlaw school graduates from electing to serve in the nation's armed \nforces.\n  Perhaps General Moorman's greatest legacy will be his commitment to \nensuring the Air Force Judge Advocate General's Department operates in \na fashion that seamlessly merges its diverse, traditional fields of \npractice into the Expeditionary Aerospace Force model. He orchestrated \nnumerous programs to ensure judge advocates are skilled in advising \ncommanders on the application of air and space power across the \nspectrum of military conflict and also oversaw the creation of a \ncomprehensive guide covering the application of air and space power \nacross the full range of combat and noncombat operations.\n  In the midst of the tragedy of September 11, his first thoughts \nturned to care for the injured at the Pentagon. He used his personal \nvan as an ambulance and drove a wounded civilian employee to Arlington \nHospital. He then returned to duty and led the remarkable effort to \nconsider the unique legal issues involved in our homeland defense and \nthe global war on terrorism. His efforts during and after the Pentagon \nattack underscore the force multiplying effect reliable legal counsel \nwill bring to armed conflict in the 21st century.\n  I ask that you join me, our colleagues and General Moorman's many \nfriends and family in saluting this distinguished officer's many years \nof selfless service to the United States of America. I know our Nation, \nhis wife Bobbie, and his family are extremely proud of his \naccomplishments. It is fitting that the United States Senate honors him \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S852-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n       At 1:24 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, \n     delivered by Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced \n     that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 2998.

A bill to provide for the merger of the bank and savings \nassociation deposit insurance funds, to modernize and improve the \nsafety and fairness of the Federal deposit insurance system, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce S. 1945, the Safe and \nFair Deposit Insurance Act of 2002, together with my good friends and \ncolleagues, Senator Hagel, Senator Reed and Senator Enzi. This \nimportant legislation would help to ensure that deposit insurance, \nwhich is the bedrock of our banking system, maintains its strength even \nwhen faced with economic weakness.\n  S. 1945 is the culmination of many years of my involvement in the \nissue of deposit insurance reform. I would like to recognize the \nbanking community in South Dakota for their critical role in the \nprocess, from explaining how elements of the current system endanger \nlocal banks throughout that great State, to helping to craft solutions \nthat make sense to the average American depositor.\n  The current deposit insurance system is dangerously pro-cyclical, and \nin a softening economy, banks are at real risk of having to absorb \nsevere insurance premiums when they can least afford them. In the last \nmonth alone, four banks have failed, putting pressure on the insurance \nfunds.\n  In addition, deposit insurance coverage was last adjusted in 1980, \nand its real value has eroded over the decades. S. 1945 proposes an \nincrease in coverage, and ensures that in the future, coverage keeps \npace with inflation through periodic indexing. We also increase the \nlevel of coverage for our municipalities' deposits, to reduce the risk \nthat a bank failure will wipe out a town's financial base, as happened \njust last week in Ohio, and also to free up much needed capital to lend \nto cash-starved communities.\n  Our bill pays special attention to the needs of our retirees. We \npropose that retirement savings be covered up to $250,000, to allow our \nretirees to keep their money safe without being forced to search for a \nbank outside of their trusted communities.\n  So many of our retirees have spent their lives saving to make sure \nthey can remain independent in their later years, especially given some \nuncertainty about the long-term health of Social Security. Many have \nput those savings to work in a variety of investments through tax-\ndeferred accounts and have watched those balances mount.\n  Over the last few months, however, we have been reminded that while \nequity markets can provide unparalleled opportunities for economic \ngrowth, those opportunities come with volatility. And while many \nyounger investors have enough time to ride out ups and downs, those of \nus who are closer to retirement age have to make sure we have enough \nsavings in secure investments to provide for a comfortable retirement.\n  Our bill also merges the two deposit insurance funds, and gives the \nFDIC additional flexibility to manage the fund balance through regular \ninsurance premiums. Since 1996, 93 percent of all insured depositories \nhave paid nothing for their insurance coverage, which simply doesn't \nmake sense. Under the bill, the FDIC would be permitted to resume \npremium assessments; however, they would also be required to keep the \nfund ratio within a range, with a goal of minimizing sharp swings in \nthose assessments. FDIC is also charged with the task of building the \nfund up in good times, so in bad times, banks will avoid the economic \npressure of steep charges that could precipitate a downward spiral.\n  Finally, we provide a one-time assessment credit so that institutions \nthat have paid their fair share into the insurance funds don't end up \nsubsidizing new entrants and fast growers. The credit will also defer \npremium payments for up to several years in some cases.\n  Before I close, I would like to comment on the remarkable bipartisan \nprocess that has allowed this bill to take shape. Partisan politics has \nno place in discussions of deposit insurance reform, which is so \ncritical to America's economic foundation. Senators Hagel, Reed, Enzi \nand I have worked together on S. 1945, and I am proud of the results of \nthis teamwork. This is just one more example proving that the best laws \nare those that are built on solid principles by bipartisan teams.\n  Finally, I thank FDIC Chairman Don Powell for his leadership on this \nissue. He has recognized the importance of reform, and it has been a \npleasure working with him and his talented team at the FDIC.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for Mr. Campbell (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n        Bingaman, and Mr. Allard)):\n  S. 1946. A bill to amend the National Trails Systems Act to designate \nthe Old Spanish Trail as a National Historic Trail; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to designate the Old Spanish Trail for addition to the \nNational Trails System.\n  In 1995, I worked to commission a study of the Old Spanish Trail to \nassess its historic significance and determine whether it should be \nincluded in the National Trails System. That recently published study \ndiscussed the Trail in great detail, recognizing it as a benchmark of \nthe Old West.\n  I would like to commend the Department of the Interior and National \nPark Service's scholarship in producing the ``National Historic Trail \nFeasibility Study and Environmental Assessment'' of the Old Spanish \nTrail.\n  The Old Spanish Trail has been called the ``longest, crookedest, most \narduous pack mule route in the history of America.'' Linking two quaint \npueblo outposts, Villa Real de Sante Fe de San Francisco, now known as \nSanta Fe, and El Pueblo de Nuestra Senora La Reina de Los Angeles, \npresent day Los Angeles. This 1,200 mile route was a critical \ncrossroads in trade and culture 150 years ago.\n  American Indians lived for thousands of years throughout the American \nSouthwest, carving out a network of trade and travel routes. The Utes, \nPaiutes, Comanches, and Navajo peoples used what was known as the Old \nSpanish Trail.\n  The Old Spanish Trail played a crucial role as a crossroads for the \ndiverse cultures in the West. Indian Tribes, Spaniards, Mexicans, Anglo \nsettlers, including the Mormons, and other immigrants used the route \nextensively.\n  The traded commodities along the Trail were as diverse as those who \nused it. The Old Spanish Trail supported the fur, mule, horse, sheep, \nand textile trades. Demand for sheep grew dramatically in California \nafter the Great Gold Rush. In 1849, a gold-seeker named Roberts bought \n500 sheep in New Mexico for $250, and sold them in California for \n$8,000.\n  Beyond traditional commerce, Old Spanish Trail traders also traded in \nAmerican Indian slaves. Tribes would raid weaker tribes and sell \ncaptives to the Spanish, and later to the Mexicans. The Indian slave \ntrade continued as late as the 1860s.\n\n[[Page S855]]\n\n  The trail's rich history marks important events in our nation's \nwestward expansion. For example, in 1848, Lt. George B. Brewerton \nrecorded his journey over the Spanish Trail and the northern branch. \nThe young lieutenant accompanied a party of thirty men including the \nnoted scout, Kit Carson. Carson was carrying mail from Los Angeles to \nthe East Coast. The party left Los Angeles on May 4 and reached Santa \nFe via Taos on June 14, forty-one days later. Carson proceeded east, \nreaching Washington, DC in mid-August, bringing news of the discovery \nof gold in California. Carson's news effectively fired the starting gun \nfor the great gold rush.\n  The study includes numerous accounts of other expeditions, \nexperiences, and events marking our Nation's history. Thanks to a \nvariety of public and private partnerships, we are learning more about \nthe history of the Trail and the region everyday.\n  In Colorado, the Bureau of Land Management has worked on documenting \nand interpreting the route with local communities, such as Mesa County \nand the City of Grand Junction. Interested private groups have sprung \nup to recognize the significance of the Trail and work to preserve it \nfor generations to come. One such group, the Old Spanish Trail \nAssociation, founded in Colorado, studies the trail to raise the \npublic's awareness of our country's diverse cultural heritage in the \nregion. The association has already located wagon ruts and other \nvestiges of the trail's heyday.\n  The time has come to acknowledge the national historical importance \nof the Old Spanish Trail.\n  This bill designates the Old Spanish Trail for addition to the \nNational Trails System to promote the recognition, protection and \ninterpretation of our history in the West. By introducing this \nlegislation today, we pay tribute to the cultures of the West that have \nenriched our nation and to an important period in American history.\n  I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this legislation.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill is as follows:\n\n                                S. 1946\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Old Spanish Trail \n     Recognition Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       Section 5(a) of the National Trails System Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1244(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating the second paragraph (21) as paragraph \n     (22); and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(23) Old spanish national historic trail.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Old Spanish National Historic Trail, \n     an approximately 3,500 mile long trail extending from Santa \n     Fe, New Mexico, to Los Angeles, California, that served as a \n     major trade route between 1829 and 1848, as generally \n     depicted on the map contained in the report prepared under \n     subsection (b) entitled ``Old Spanish Trail National Historic \n     Trail Feasibility Study'', dated July 2001.\n       ``(B) Map.--A map generally depicting the trail shall be on \n     file and available for public inspection in the office of the \n     Director of the National Park Service.\n       ``(C) Administration.--The trail shall be administered by \n     the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of \n     the National Park Service (referred to in this paragraph as \n     the `Secretary').\n       ``(D) Land acquisition.--The United States shall not \n     acquire for the trail any land or interest in land outside \n     the exterior boundary of any federally-managed area without \n     the consent of the owner of the land or interest in land.\n       ``(E) Consultation.--The Secretary shall consult with other \n     Federal, State, local, and tribal agencies in the \n     administration of the trail.\n       ``(F) Additional routes.--The Secretary may designate \n     additional routes to the trail if--\n       ``(i) the additional routes were included in the Old \n     Spanish Trail National Historic Trail Feasibility Study, but \n     were not recommended for designation as a national historic \n     trail; and\n       ``(ii) the Secretary determines that the additional routes \n     were used for trade and commerce between 1829 and 1848.''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, last year I introduced a bill that would \nhave designated the Old Spanish Trail as a National Historic Trail. \nWhen I introduced that bill, we were waiting for the Administration to \ncomplete its work on a final study. Additionally, Senator Campbell \nwrote a personal note to me asking that I work with him on a new bill \nthat incorporates the new study. Today, we introduce that bill. As with \nmy original bill this legislation will amend the National Trails System \nAct and designate the Old Spanish Trail; which originates in Santa Fe, \nNew Mexico and continues to Los Angeles, California as a National \nHistoric Trail.\n  Today, more than 150 years after the first settlers embarked on their \nwestern journeys via the Old Spanish Trail, we honor its historic \nsignificance and recognize its importance to our past, present and \nfuture. I am proud to introduce legislation that will help preserve the \nroute of the trail--much of which has remained relatively unchanged \nsince the trail period.\n  The United States of America has a rich history and an exciting part \nof that is the movement of civilization westward. Citizens who settled \nin the West came from all walks of life and have deep rooted cultural \nand historic ties to land throughout the west. Since 1829, The Old \nSpanish Trail has served many, from trade caravans to military \nexpeditions. For twenty plus years the Old Spanish Trail was used as a \nmain route of travel between New Mexico and California.\n  The Old Spanish Trail is also a vital part of Native American \nhistory. We know that numerous Indian pueblos were situated along the \nOld Spanish Trail serving as trading forums for the trail's many \ntravelers. The majority of these pueblos are still occupied by \ndescendants whose ancestors contributed to the labor and goods that \nconstituted commerce on the Old Spanish Trail.\n  The Old Spanish Trail is a symbol of cultural interaction between \nvarious ethnic groups and nations. Further, it is a symbol of the \ncommercial exchange that made development and growth popular, not only \nin the West, but throughout the country.\n  The National Trails System was established by the National Trails \nSystem Act of 1968 ``to promote the preservation of, public access to, \ntravel within, and enjoyment and appreciation of the open air, outdoor \nareas and historic resources of the Nation.'' Designating the Old \nSpanish Trail as a National Historic Trail would allow for just what \nthe act has intended, preservation, access, enjoyment and appreciation \nof the historic resources of our Nation.\n  The Old Spanish Trail has been significant in many respects to many \ndifferent people and its rich history is something that should be \nincluded in our National Trails System. The intent of this legislation \nis to protect this historic route and its historic remnants for public \nuse and enjoyment indefinitely.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CARNAHAN:\n  S. 1947. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nclarify the circumstances under which a hold harmless provision does \nnot exist with respect to a broad-based health care related tax; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, in late October, I came to the Senate \nfloor to address a dispute between the state of Missouri and the Health \nCare Financing Agency, now known as the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, or CMS. I felt compelled to discuss the matter \nbecause of what was at stake, the future of Missouri's Medicaid \nprogram.\n  Medicaid is a partnership between the Federal Government and the \nStates to provide healthcare services to our most vulnerable citizens--\nlow-income children and seniors. Unfortunately, the Federal partner, \nCMS, is behaving irresponsibly.\n  Since I last spoke about this issue on the Senate floor, CMS \nAdministrator Tom Scully escalated the dispute to an unprecedented \nlevel. Not only unprecedented, but dangerous.\n  On November 29, he sent a harshly toned letter to Governor Holden \nthat called Missouri's tax on hospitals illegal and threatened to \nwithhold $1.6 billion from the State.\n  I am here today to call attention to an agency that is out of \ncontrol. At a time when States are struggling to maintain service due \nto the recession, this agency has threatened to devastate Missouri's \nhealth care safety net. At a time when States and the Federal \nGovernment should be working for the common good, CMS is ignoring its \nown laws and regulations.\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\n  After our delegation appealed to top Administration officials, \nfinally negotiations began on a long-term solution to the Medicaid \nfunding issue. But just this weekend, reports emerged that CMS expects \nto pressure Missouri into accepting changes to the program due to its \nthreatened legal action. I am all in favor of negotiations. But I want \na bargaining table to be completely level. Our State should be free to \nact in the best interest of Missouri's citizens without a $1.6 billion \nlawsuit hanging over its head. That is why I am also introducing \nlegislation today that seeks to put an end to this dispute once and for \nall.\n  Governor Holden has stated that one of his top Federal priorities is \nto clarify that Missouri's provider tax is fully consistent with \nFederal law. That is what my bill does.\n  Before I explain my legislative proposal, I want to describe the \nevents that have brought us to this point in time. The subject of the \ndisagreement is Missouri's provider assessment program, which is a tax \non hospitals. States use the money generated from these taxes as their \n``match'' for Federal Medicaid dollars. Over ten years ago, Congress \nbecame concerned that States were using provider taxes improperly to \nincrease the Federal contributions to Medicaid programs. In response, \nCongress enacted a law in 1992 that placed limitations on provider \nassessment programs.\n  One specific limitation is that a provider assessment must not \ncontain a ``hold harmless'' provision. This means that States may not \nguarantee that a hospital will receive back from Medicaid the amount of \nfunds it paid to the State in provider taxes.\n  In 1992, under the leadership of Governor John Ashcroft, now the \nAttorney General, Missouri complied with the federal law by enacting \nthe Federal Reimbursement Allowance Program law. This law created a tax \non hospitals, but contained no ``hold harmless'' provision. Governor \nAshcroft signed the bill into law. Governor Carnahan continued the \nprogram, and Governor Holder is continuing it.\n  For almost a decade, the program has been operating under the \nauspices of HCFA, now CMS. During this time, 100 percent of the \nrevenues generated by the tax have been dedicated to Missouri's \nMedicaid program. The program has made Missouri a national model for \nusing Federal, State, and private resources to provide health care to \nas many needy citizens as possible. This long-standing legal tax has \nassisted Missouri in creating a strong healthcare safety net for its \nchildren, pregnant women, and most vulnerable seniors.\n  Much of Missouri's success can be attributed to expanded enrollment \nof eligible citizens in Medicaid. During the 1990's, the number of \nMissourians covered by Medicaid more than doubled, increasing from \n364,000 in 1990 to 839,000 in 2001. The number of children enrolled in \nMedicaid has grown at an even faster rate, increasing from 180,000 in \n1990 to 474,000 in 2001.\n  An important step in covering more children was the enactment of the \nstate's Children's Health Insurance Program, also known as MC Plus. \nUnder the leadership of Governor Carnahan, MC Plus was designed to \ncover children up to 300 percent of the poverty level. It is a national \nmodel. Due to MC Plus, uninsured working parents could secure this \nprevious health coverage for their children. The MC Plus program has \nmade a difference in the lives of 75,000 children in Missouri.\n  This combination of initiatives has sharply reduced the number of \nMissouri citizens that lack health insurance. In 1999, Missouri had the \nfourth lowest percentage of uninsured citizens in the country.\n  These tremendous accomplishments, however, could be completely \nundermined because of a bureaucratic crusade to overturn Missouri's \nprovider tax, a crusade that is not based on law.\n  Let me explain. The letter CMS Administrator Scully sent to Missouri \non November 29 was significant for several reasons.\n  First, it was the first formal declaration from CMS that the agency \nfound Missouri's State provider tax impermissible.\n  Second, the letter included a draft audit that outlined the agency's \ncase and claimed that it would seek to take back $1.6 billion from the \nState.\n  Third, the letter opens the door for CMS to actually try to take back \nthe money.\n  Until this the draft audit was sent, CMS had only threatened action \nagainst the state. Now, this letter has made it abundantly clear that \nthe CMS case is based on a flawed legal theory.\n  The Federal statute says that there is a hold harmless provision with \nrespect to the provider tax if the Secretary can determine that, and I \nquote from the statute: ``The State or other unit of government \nimproving the tax providers--directly or indirectly--for any payment, \noffset, or waiver that guarantees to hold taxpayers harmless for any \nportion of the costs of the tax.''\n  In the draft audit, Mr. Scully asserts that Missouri indirectly holds \nhospitals harmless. This leads one to ask the question, how is an \n``indirect guarantee'' defined under the law? The answer exists, but \nunfortunately Mr. Scully's letter does not include it. You can find the \nanswer in the Federal regulations that govern how the Federal provider \ntax law should be implemented.\n  On September 13, 1993, almost ten years ago, the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services issued final regulations for the new law. The \nregulations established an objective test to determine whether a \ngovernment had an indirect guarantee. The regulations provide that if \nthe tax on health care providers is less than 6 percent of the \ntaxpayer's revenues, ``the tax or taxes are permissible.''\n  Missouri's provider tax on hospitals has always been less than 6 \npercent. Case closed.\n  The bill that I am introducing today essentially codifies this \nregulation into law. If CMS were willing to abide by its own \nregulations, then this bill would not be necessary. But I am concerned \nfrom the actions the agency has taken and its responses to my inquiries \non the subject, that CMS is pursuing an ideological agenda, not fair \neven-handed enforcement of the law.\n  There is nothing wrong with the State law former Governor Ashcroft \nsigned a decade ago. There has been no ``indirect guarantees'' to \nanyone. CMS should back off and allow Missouri to do what it has been \ndoing well for over a decade, providing healthcare to its citizens.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a close look at my bill and support \nits passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. \n        Dayton):\n  S. 1948. A bill to establish demonstration projects under the \nMedicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act to reward \nand expand the number of health care providers delivering high-quality, \ncost-effective health care to Medicare beneficiaries; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague and \ndear friend from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, in introducing a \n``Medicare Fairness'' package of bills that will ensure that the \nMedicare system rewards rather than punishes states like Maine and \nWisconsin that deliver high-quality, cost-effective Medicare services \nto our elderly and disabled citizens.\n  The good people of Maine pay the same payroll taxes to Medicare, and \nour seniors pay the same premiums, deductibles and copayments as \nMedicare beneficiaries in other parts of the country. Yet Maine's \npatients, physicians, hospitals and other providers receive far less \nfrom the program in return when it comes to Medicare payments.\n  According to a recent study published in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association, Maine ranks third in the Nation when it comes to \nthe quality of care delivered to our Medicare beneficiaries. Yet we are \n11th from the bottom when it comes to per-beneficiary Medicare \nspending.\n  The fact is that Maine's Medicare dollars are being used to subsidize \nhigher reimbursements in other parts of the country. Maine's Medicare \npatients receive, on average, $3,856 worth of Medicare services per \nyear, far below the national average of $5,034. By way of contrast, in \nthe District of Columbia, Medicare patients receive about $15,620 in \nMedicare payments a year. Moreover, these dramatically higher payments \nhave not bought any better\n\n[[Page S857]]\n\ncare for the District's Medicare beneficiaries. According to the \nJournal of the American Medical Association, the District is ranked \n34th out of 52, in the bottom third, when it comes to quality.\n  This simply is not fair. Medicare's reimbursement systems have \nhistorically tended to favor urban areas and failed to take the \nspecial needs of rural States into account. Ironically, Maine's low \npayment rates are also the result of its long history of providing \nhigh-quality, cost-effective care. In the early 1980s, Maine's lower \nthan average costs were used to justify lower payment rates. Since \nthen, Medicare's payment policies have only served to widen the gap \nbetween low and high-cost states.\n\n  As a consequence, Maine's hospitals, physicians and other providers \nhave experienced a serious Medicare shortfall, which has forced them to \nshift costs on to other payers in the form of higher charges. This \nMedicare shortfall is one of the reasons that Maine has among the \nhighest health insurance premiums in the nation. Small businesses, for \nexample, are facing increases of 20 to 30 percent, jeopardizing their \nability to provide coverage for their employees.\n  Moreover, the fact that Medicare underpays our hospitals and nursing \nfacilities has significantly handicapped Maine's providers as they \ncompete for nurses and other health care professionals in an \nincreasingly tight labor market.\n  As a recent study by Dr. John Wennberg of the Dartmouth Medical \nSchool points out, more Medicare spending does not necessarily buy \nbetter quality health care. According to the Dartmouth study, Medicare \nbeneficiaries in high-cost states don't live any longer or enjoy better \nquality care. High cost states simply provide more care. They rely on \ninpatient and specialist care more than outpatient and primary care, \nand they tend to treat the chronically ill and those near death much \nmore aggressively, with possible adverse effects on their quality of \nlife. According to the Dartmouth study, this pattern of practice is \ndriven not by medical evidence, but instead by community practice \npatterns and the availability of hospital beds.\n  The legislative package we are introducing today will reform the \ncurrent Medicare reimbursement system by reducing regional inequities \nin Medicare spending and providing incentives to hospitals and \nphysicians to encourage the delivery of high-quality, cost-effective \ncare.\n  The first bill, the Physician Wage Fairness Act of 2001, will promote \nfairness in Medicare payments to physicians and other health \nprofessionals by eliminating the outdated geographic physician work \nadjustor in the physician fee schedule that has resulted in a \nsignificant differential in payment levels to urban and rural health \ncare providers.\n  We are concerned that the current formula does not accurately measure \nthe cost of providing services. As a consequence, Medicare pays rural \nproviders far less than it should for equal work. We also don't think \nthat it makes sense to pay physicians more for their work in areas like \nNew York City, which tend to have an oversupply of physicians, and pay \nphysicians less for the same services in areas that are more likely to \nexperience shortages. Eliminating the georgraphic physician work \nadjustor will bring an estimated $1 million a year in Medicare payments \nto physicians and other providers in Southern Maine and $3 million more \nto providers in the rest of Maine.\n\n  The second bill, the Medicare Value and Quality Demonstration Act of \n2002, will authorize a series of demonstration programs to encourage \nhigh-quality, low-cost health care to Medicare beneficiaries. These \nprograms would reward hospitals and physicians who deliver high quality \ncare at a lower cost. It would also require that the states chosen for \nthe pilot projects create a plan to increase the number of providers \nwho deliver high-quality, cost-effective care to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  A third bill, the Graduate Medical Education Demonstration Act, will \nallow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use existing \nGraduate Medical Education funds to create a program to encourage \nhospitals in underserved areas to host clinical rotations to encourage \nmore medical students to practice in these areas when they graduate.\n  And finally, the Skilled Nursing Facility Wage Information \nImprovement Act will promote fairness in Medicare payments to nursing \nhomes by collecting and using accurate nursing home wage data rather \nthan, as is the current practice, using the inaccurate hospital wage \ndata that discriminates against States like Maine.\n  As Congress works to modernize Medicare, we must also restore basic \nfairness to the program and find ways to reward, rather than penalize, \nproviders of high-quality, cost-effective care. This is what our \nlegislation will do, and I encourage all of our colleagues to join us \nas cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n        Jeffords, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1949. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to promote \norgan donation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on this Valentine's Day, National Donor \nDay, I rise to speak on the critical issue of organ donation. It is \nwith great pleasure that I join with my colleagues Senators Dodd, \nHutchinson, Jeffords, and Enzi to introduce the Organ Donation and \nRecovery Improvement Act.\n  This far-reaching, comprehensive legislation includes a number of new \nsteps intended to improve organ donation and recovery efforts \nnationwide and increase the number of organs available for transplants \neach year. This legislation is further complemented by a resolution \nthat I, and a number of my colleagues are introducing today to \ncommemorate today as National Donor Day and call attention to the \nimportant issue of organ donation.\n  This year, more than twenty-two thousand Americans will receive an \norgan transplant. This is due to the rapid and tremendous advancements \nin our knowledge and in the science of organ transplantation. As a \nheart and lung transplant surgeon before coming to the Senate, I have \nhad the opportunity to watch the field develop tremendously over the \npast three decades. I remember my own experiences, of conducting some \nof the first transplants using hearts and lungs, and know the \ntremendous progress that has been made since that time. And I know the \nhundreds of my own patients who have benefitted from improved lives due \nto advances in transplantation.\n  Advances in our knowledge and the science have allowed us to \ntransplant individuals who were once not considered candidates. But \nsuch advances have meant a staggering increase in the number of \npatients waiting for a transplant, while the number of donated organs \nhas failed to keep pace. In fact, there are almost 80,000 patients \nwaiting for a transplant today, a four-fold increase from just over a \ndecade ago. Many of them may die before they can receive a transplant.\n  More needs to be done. We must look for other ways to improve organ \ndonation, to identify eligible organs and work with families to help \nthem better understand the value of donation.\n  Secretary Thompson already has made great progress in this area. I \ncommend him for making organ donation a top priority at the Department \nof Health and Human Services. His initiative holds great promise. In \nparticular, I applaud his call to recognize donor families through a \nmedal of honor, something I have long supported through my own \nlegislation, the Gift of Life Congressional Medal Act. I also welcome \nthe Secretary's commitment to more closely scrutinize the role that \norgan donor registries play in the donation process.\n  The legislation I am introducing today builds on these efforts \nthrough a broad range of initiatives intended to improve organ donation \nand recovery, enhance our knowledge base in these fields, and encourage \nnovel approaches to this growing problem.\n  The Organ Donation and Recovery Improvement Act is designed to \nimprove the overall process of organ donation and recovery. The bill \nalso seeks to remove potential barriers to donation, while identifying \nand focusing on best practices in organ donation.\n  Let me briefly highlight a few key provisions of the legislation. \nFirst, the bill establishes a grant program for demonstration projects \nintended to improve donation and recovery rates and\n\n[[Page S858]]\n\nensures that the projects' results will be evaluated quickly and \ndisseminated broadly. The bill also provides for the placement and \nevaluation of organ donation coordinators in hospitals, a model that \nhas worked with success in other countries.\n  In addition, the legislation expands the authority of the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality to conduct important research, \nincluding research on the recovery, preservation and transportation of \norgans and tissues. As we all know, the science of organ \ntransplantation has been improved and refined over and over again since \nits inception. Yet all too often organ donation efforts are conducted \nunder the same conditions and understandings as they were twenty years \nago. This must change, and the legislation Senator Dodd and I are \nintroducing today will help establish a strong evidence-based approach \nto enhance organ donation and recovery and improving our understanding \nof this process.\n  The bill also includes several important provisions affecting living \norgan donation. First, it attempts to reduce potential financial \ndisincentives toward serving as a living donor by allowing for the \nreimbursement of travel and other expenses incurred by living donors \nand their families.\n  Importantly, the bill also takes steps towards evaluating the long-\nterm health effects of serving as a living donor by asking the \nInstitute of Medicine to report on this issue, as well as through the \nestablishment of a living donor registry intended to track the health \nof individuals who have served as living organ donors. There remain \nimportant questions surrounding how this registry should be structured, \nand I look forward to working with my colleagues and the experts in the \nfield to finalize the details before any legislation is enacted.\n  Finally, I would like to address the issue of prospective organ donor \nregistries. I am supportive of donor registries and feel they have an \nimportant role to play in improving organ donation rates. Moreover, I \nam pleased by the actions taken by some states to establish and enhance \nsuch registries. However, I am concerned that too great a focus has \nbeen placed on registries at a time when a number of questions \nsurrounding registries remain unanswered and their effectiveness has \nnot been fully evaluated. Therefore, the bill establishes an advisory \ncommittee to study this question and to report to Congress on the \nusefulness and success of organ donor registries and potential roles \nfor the federal government to play in encouraging and improving such \nprograms.\n  The Frist-Dodd Organ Donation and Recovery Improvement Act is \nsupported by a wide range of patient and organ transplantation \norganizations. I am pleased that the bill is supported by the American \nSociety of Transplantation, National Kidney Foundation, American Liver \nFoundation, North American Transplant Coordinators Organization, \nPatient Access to Transplantation Coalition, TN Donor Services, New \nMexico Donor Services, and Golden State Donor Services. I thank them \nfor their hard work and dedication to this issue.\n  Organ donation is one of the most important issues before us today. \nEach year, thousands of donors and families make the important decision \nto give consent and give the gift of life. We must recognize and honor \ntheir sacrifice, and, in so honoring, work to increase donation rates \nand allow more families to receive this gift of life each year. \nHundreds of my own patients are alive today because of this gift. Let \nus work together to allow more patients and families to experience this \nmiracle.\n  I thank Senators Dodd, Hutchinson, Jeffords and Enzi for joining me \nin this effort, and look forward to working with them and my other \ncolleagues to pass this important legislation this year.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, most of us know February 14 as Valentine's \nDay, but for the past few years, it has shared that date with another \nvitally important, and unfortunately less well-known, event: National \nDonor Day.\n  Thanks to the selflessness of thousands, February 14 has become our \nNation's largest one-day donation event. On a day that celebrates \ngiving the gift of life, we should make a commitment to increasing our \ndonation rates and saving even more lives.\n  Today, I am pleased to introduce legislation with Senator Bill Frist \nto do just that. The Organ Donation and Recovery Improvement Act will \nbring attention to this critical public health issue by increasing \nresources and coordinating efforts to improve organ donation and \nrecovery. I am proud to be working with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Frist, whose leadership and professional experience as a heart \nand lung transplant surgeon has been critical in making this issue a \npriority.\n  At this very moment, more than 80,000 people are waiting for an organ \ntransplant, and one person is added to this list every thirteen \nminutes. This has increased from 19,095 people on waiting lists a \ndecade ago. Unfortunately, the discrepancy between the need and the \nnumber of available of organs is growing exponentially. From 1999 to \n2000 transplant waiting list grew by 10.2 percent, while the total \nincrease in donation grew by 5.3 percent. Tragically, in 2000, \napproximately 5,500 wait-listed patients died waiting for an organ.\n  Undoubtedly, the task before us seems daunting. However, each person \nwho makes the decision to donate can save as many as three lives. These \nare our mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, friends. None of us wants \nto imagine the anguish of watching a family member or a friend wait for \nan organ transplant hoping that their name reaches the top of the list \nbefore their damaged organ fails or having to bear the emotional, \nphysical, or financial costs of undergoing a transplant procedure. For \nthose that do, and for all of those that will, we must improve and \nstrengthen our systems of organ donation and recovery. We must also \nwork to remove the barriers that stand in a donor's way as he or she \nseeks to help another person continue life. States need the resources \nto determine for themselves how best to increase donations and a vital \npart of increasing donations lies in education and public awareness \ninitiatives.\n  We must work to improve the science of donation and recovery and \naddress legal issues relating to donation, including consent. More than \n20 states currently have registries that may prove indispensable in \nensuring that we honor a donor's wishes. We should study the benefits, \nand potential shortcomings, of these arrangements and work to create a \nnational sense of urgency that matches the national need for donors.\n  I would like to recognize the invaluable support and guidance we \nreceived, in drafting this bill, from the American Society of \nTransplantation, the American Liver Foundation, the Patient Access to \nTransplantation Coalition, North American Transplant Coordinators \nOrganization, and the National Kidney Foundation. I would be remiss not \nto mention the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations and the \nOPOs nationwide that have worked so tirelessly to bridge the gap \nbetween the immense need and the inadequate supply. In my home state of \nConnecticut, we are well served by the tremendous work of the Northeast \nOrgan Procurement Organization and the New England Donor Bank.\n  Finally, I look forward to working with my colleagues, including \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Gregg and Senator Durbin, whose commitment to \nthis issue has been unparalleled. I urge Congress to take swift action \non bipartisan legislation aimed at increasing organ donation and saving \nlives.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, Valentine's Day, provides a \nwonderful opportunity for me to offer my support for the Organ Donation \nand Recovery Improvement Act. I commend my colleagues, Senator Frist of \nTennessee and Senator Dodd of Connecticut, for their leadership and \ncommitment to this important issue. Organ transplantation provides \nperhaps the clearest example where scientific research has been \ntranslated and applied to modern medicine. Not too many years ago organ \ntransplantation was associated with inconsistent success and numerous \ncomplications. Today these procedures have advanced to the point where \nsuccess is commonplace. Not only the duration of life, but the quality \nof life, is improved.\n  I have carried an organ donor card in my wallet for more than twenty-\nfive years, and I am a long-time organ donation supporter. In my home \nState of\n\n[[Page S859]]\n\nVermont, Representative Johannah Donovan has introduced a bill to allow \nfor the creation of a donor registry through the Department of Motor \nVehicles. It is an excellent example of trying to make the organ donor \nprocess easier and more efficient. So, I am proud to join my colleagues \nas an original sponsor in this effort to increase organ donation at the \nnational level. Even though great strides have been made in organ \nprocurement and distribution, problems remain, and those issues are \naddressed by this legislation. This proposal would establish a federal \ninter-agency task force to coordinate organ donation efforts and \ntransplant research; expand the Federal organ-donation grant authority \nand provide funds to educate lay professionals in issues surrounding \norgan donation; expand the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality \nauthority to review and improve organ recovery, preservation, and \ntransplantation; provide for two important Institute of Medicine \nstudies to review and document issues associated with live organ \ndonation; and establish an advisory committee to make recommendations \nregarding costs, benefits, expansion, availability, and other issues \ninvolving transplantation.\n  In Vermont, we are fortunate to have Fletcher Allen Medical Center. \nThis state-of-the-art institution provides quality transplantation \nservices to the residents of my state and surrounding areas. However, \ndespite a wonderful facility and a well-trained and experienced staff \nof health professionals, Fletcher Allen is limited, like all similar \ninstitutions, by the high demand for donor organs and the limited \nsupply. This legislation will move us closer to the day when all \nindividuals who would benefit from transplantation are able to receive \nappropriate care in a timely manner. I urge all of my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Wyden, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 1951. A bill to provide regulatory oversight over energy trading \nmarkets, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill \ntoday with Senators Cantwell and Wyden to make sure that all energy \ntransactions are transparent and subject to regulatory oversight. With \npassage of this legislation, we can reinstate regulatory oversight to \nthe marketplace and help ensure there is not a repeat of the energy \ncrisis that had such a devastating impact on California and the West.\n  The Enron bankruptcy has uncovered many gaping holes in our \nregulatory structure, everything from accounting and investment \npractices to on-line energy transactions. Congress must take a look at \nall of this. The bill we are introducing today is a first step. The \nexemptions and exclusions to the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization \nAct essentially gave EnronOnline, and the entire energy sector, the \nability to operate a bilateral electronic trading forum absent any \nregulatory oversight or price transparency.\n  Let me give you an example of what that lack of transparency meant to \nCalifornia: On December 12, 2000, the price of natural gas on the spot \nmarket was $59 in southern California while it was $10 in nearby San \nJuan, NM. We know it costs less than $1 to transport gas from New \nMexico to California because this was the cost when these \ntransportation routes were transparent and regulated. So there was $48 \nunaccounted for that undoubtedly found its way into someone's pocket.\n  This problem lasted from November, 2000 to April, 2001, and all this \ntime no one knew where all this money was going. The Senate Energy \nCommittee looked at this issue last year but was not able to piece \ntogether all of what happened. In the wake of Enron's bankruptcy, \nhowever, we are beginning to learn a lot more. By controlling a \nsignificant number of energy transactions affecting California, some \ntraders estimate that Enron controlled up to 50-70 percent of the \nnatural gas transactions into southern California, and by trading in \nsecret, Enron had the unique ability to manipulate prices and gouge \ncustomers. And the consumes, particularly those in California, \nultimately bore the brunt of the costs. In fact, through the course of \nthe crisis in California, the total cost of electricity soared from $7 \nbillion in 1999 to $27 billion in 2000 and $26.7 billion in 2001.\n  A market does not function properly without transparency. \nAdditionally, regulators need the authority and the tools to step in \nand do their jobs when markets have gone awry. This bill, then, is \nintended to close the regulatory loopholes that allowed EnronOnline to \noperate unregulated trading markets in secret. The Commodity Futures \nModernization Act provided a regulatory exemption for bilateral \ntransactions between sophisticated parties in nonagriculturual and \nnonfinancial commodities. This exclusion includes energy products and \nelectronic trading forums. Because many of the EnronOnline transactions \ndid not involve physical delivery, there was also no oversight by the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission. In determining which agency, FERC \nor the CFTC should have the proper authority, we are faced with two \nchallenges: 1. FERC does not have the necessary expertise in derivative \ntransactions; and 2. CFTC does not have the necessary expertise to \nprotect consumers from out-of-control energy prices.\n  This bill tries to utilize the unique talents of each agency.\n  In summary, our legislation: 1. Repeals exemptions and exclusions \nprovided for by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000; 2. \nensures that energy dealers in derivatives markets (such as \nEnronOnline) cannot escape federal regulation; 3. makes sure that all \nmultilateral markets and dealer markets in energy commodities are \nsubject to registration, transparency, disclosure and reporting \nobligations; 4. gives FERC regulatory oversight authority over \nbilateral transactions not subject to CFTC oversight. Although CFTC \nwould have antimanipulation authority over these transactions; 5. \nexpands FERC jurisdiction to include derivatives transactions, which \nare defined to include transactions based on the cost of electricity or \nnatural gas and include futures, options, forwards and swaps unless \nsuch transactions are under the jurisdiction of the CFTC or the state; \nand 6. Ensures that entities running on-line trading forums must \nmaintain sufficient capital to carry out its operations and maintain \nopen books and records for investigation and enforcement purposes.\n\n  This last point is also very important. Enron saw its future as a \n``virtual'' company. As such it sold off many of its physical assets \nover the past few years. Investors lost confidence in Enron's ability \nto back up its trades since Enron did not have enough assets to back up \nits trades. This was a contributing factor in Enron's final spiral into \nbankruptcy.\n  Energy trading has gotten extremely arcane and complex over the last \nthree decades. Very few people fully understand how swaps and other \nderivatives actually work. Without adequate transparency, regulatory \noversight, and a regulatory agency willing to do its job, the \nlikelihood is that consumers will pay the price. This is what happened \nin the California Energy Crisis and has happened with Enron. It would \nbe unconscionable not to do everything we can to prevent the same thing \nfrom happening again.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \n        Breaux):\n  S. 1952. A bill to reacquire and permanently protect certain leases \non the Outer Continental Shelf off the coast of California by issuing \ncredits for new energy production in less environmentally sensitive \nareas in the Western and Central Planning Areas of the Gulf of Mexico; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, for decades, Californians have opposed oil \nand gas drilling along their coasts. Nothing sharpened this concern \nmore than the horrific tanker spill that occurred off the coast of \nSanta Barbara in 1969. Californians are still living with the \necological implications of that spill and the myriad other spills and \nleaks associated with the rigs that are currently along our coast.\n  Unfortunately, 36 more leases off our coast remain eligible for oil \nand gas development and four additional leases remain in legal limbo.\n  That is the last thing Californians want or need.\n\n[[Page S860]]\n\n  California is now in a pitched legal battle with the Department of \nInterior over whether the State has the ability to deny these leases. I \nstrongly support the State in this effort and have joined \nRepresentative Capps in filing an amicus brief in the case.\n  Every State should have the right to deny oil and gas development off \ntheir shores, as offshore activities inevitably impact the people and \nresources that are onshore. Last year, I reintroduced legislation, the \nCoastal States Protection Act, to place a moratorium on new drilling \nleases in Federal waters that are adjacent to State waters that have a \ndrilling moratorium. That bill, however, addresses only the issue of \nfuture leases.\n  With regard to the existing leases off of California's coast, I am \nnot completely confident that the courts will solve the problem. We \nmust therefore act now to eliminate the threat, the threat to \nCalifornia's natural resources and the threat to our economy through \nlosses in the tourism and fishing industries.\n  It is for this reason that I am proud to introduce today with my \ncolleague Senator Landrieu, the California Coastal Protection and \nLouisiana Energy Enhancement Act.\n  Our bill would end the seemingly endless battle over the California \nleases and would permanently protect those areas from oil, gas, and \nmineral development.\n  Here's how it would work. Within 30 days of enactment, the Secretary \nof Interior would provide the oil companies holding the 40 California \nleases with a swap of equivalent value in the Gulf of Mexico. If all of \nthe companies holding the California leases agree to this offer and \nagree to drop all pending litigation regarding those leases, then the \nCalifornia leases will be canceled, and the lessees will receive a \ncredit equal to the amount paid for the leases plus the amount already \nspent to develop them.\n  These credits could be used only in the central and western Gulf, an \narea already open to drilling and open to further leasing. They could \nbe used for bidding on new leases in that area or to pay royalty \npayments for existing drilling activities in that area.\n  The 40 tracts off of California's coast would then be converted to an \necological preserve, thus permanently protecting the areas from future \nmineral leasing and development. The tracts would be managed for the \nprotection of traditional fishing activities as well as conservation, \nscientific, and recreational benefits.\n  I am very proud of this legislation, and this very promising proposal \nto end the imminent threat of additional drilling off California's \ncoast. We have been very careful to make sure that these credits are \ndesigned in a way that will not promote new drilling in environmentally \nsensitive areas. Instead, these credits can only be used in non-\ncontroversial areas that have already been set aside for future \ndevelopment.\n  We have also been very careful to ensure that the Federal Government, \nand in turn, the Federal taxpayer are protected from any future claims \nby these companies regarding these leases.\n  And, I am very pleased to say that we have worked to ensure that the \n40 California tracts will never again be threatened by offshore \ndevelopment.\n  In short, we get rid of unwanted drilling in California and \npermanently protect these sensitive areas. The oil companies are freed \nfrom a protracted legal battle and allowed to take their business \nelsewhere. And, the Federal Government is protected from expensive \nlitigation that the companies are currently pursuing.\n  I believe that we have hit upon the proverbial win-win situation. And \nI look forward to having this bill became a reality soon.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. \n        Dayton):\n  S. 1953.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire that the area wage adjustment under the prospective payment \nsystem for skilled nursing facility services be based on the wages of \nindividual's employed at skilled nursing facilities; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nfrom Maine to introduce legislation to restore fairness to the Medicare \nprogram. This package of legislation will reduce regional inequalities \nin Medicare spending and support providers of high-quality, low-cost \nMedicare services.\n  Just about a month ago, I met with representatives of Wisconsin's \nhospitals, doctors, and seniors, who spoke passionately about how \nMedicare inequities have a real and serious impact on the lives of \nWisconsin seniors, and on health care providers in my State. Wisconsin \nseniors and providers came to me with these concerns, and this \nlegislation is a direct result of their advocacy. I thank them for \ntheir efforts.\n  I also want to thank my colleague from Maine, who has joined me on a \nnumber of health care initiatives that address the mutual concerns of \nour constituents. I am grateful for her efforts on health care issues \nthat concern both of our States, such as home health care, access to \nemergency services, and this legislation on Medicare fairness.\n  The Medicare program should encourage the kind of high-quality, cost-\neffective Medicare services that we have in Wisconsin and Maine. But \nunfortunately, that's not the case.\n  To give an idea of how inequitable the distribution of Medicare \ndollars is, imagine identical twins over the age of 65. Both twins \nworked at the same company all their lives, at the same salary, and \npaid the same amount to the Federal Government in payroll taxes, the \ntax that goes into the Medicare Trust Fund. But if one twin retired to \nanother part of the country and the other retired in Wisconsin, they \nwould have vastly different health care options under the Medicare \nsystem.\n  The high Medicare payments in some areas allow Medicare beneficiaries \na wide array of options, they can choose between an HMO or traditional \nfee-for-service plan, and, because area health care providers are \nreimbursed at such a high rate, those providers can afford to offer \nseniors a broad range of health care services. The twin in Wisconsin, \nhowever, would not have the same access to care, there is no option to \nchoose an HMO, and there are fewer health care agencies that can afford \nto provide care under the traditional fee-for-service plan.\n  How can two people with identical backgrounds, who paid the same \namount in payroll taxes, have such different options under Medicare?\n  They do, because the distribution of Medicare dollars among the 50 \nStates is grossly unfair to Wisconsin, and many other states around the \ncountry. Too many Americans in Wisconsin and other States like it pay \njust as much in taxes as everyone else, but the Medicare funds they get \nin return don't come close to matching the money they pay in to the \nprogram.\n\n  Wisconsin has a lot of company in this predicament. More than 35 \nStates are below the national average in terms of per beneficiary \nMedicare spending. In some States, such as Wyoming and Idaho, Medicare \nspends almost $2,000 less per beneficiary than the national average.\n  While there are different reasons for this wide range in Medicare \npayments, their result is often the same, higher private sector \ninsurance costs and a loss of access to care. In Milwaukee WI, there \nare reports that lower Medicare reimbursement rates often causes costs \nto shift to the private sector. In rural parts of Wisconsin, these low \nreimbursement rates jeopardize access to health care services.\n  In the case of my home State of Wisconsin, low payment rates are in \nlarge part a result of health care proviers' historically high-quality, \ncost-effective health care. In the early 1980s, Wisconsin's lower-than-\naverage cost were used\n\n[[Page S861]]\n\nto justify lower payment rates. Since that time, Medicare's payment \npolicies have only widened the gap between low- and high-cost States.\n  This package of legislation will take us a step in the right \ndirection by reducing the inequities in Medicare payments to hospitals, \nphysicians, and skilled nursing facilities that the majority of States \nacross the country now face.\n  At the same time, our proposal would establish pilot programs to \nencourage high-quality, cost-effective Medicare practices. Our proposal \nwould reward providers who deliver higher quality at lower cost. It \nwould also require that the pilot States create a plan to increase the \namount of providers providing high quality, cost-effective care to \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  This legislation would also help to address the unique workforce \nneeds of urban and very rural areas by encouraging clinical rotations \nin those areas. These rotations could help focus a workforce on the \nspecific challenges facing these areas, so that they can deliver care \nthat serves the unique needs that they have.\n  Congress must modernize Medicare. But it must also restore basic \nfairness to the Medicare program.\n  My legislation demands Medicare fairness for Wisconsin and other \naffected States, plain and simple. Medicare shouldn't penalize high-\nquality providers of Medicare services, and most of all Medicare should \nstop penalizing seniors who depend on the program for their health \ncare. They have worked hard and paid into the program all their lives, \nand in return they deserve full access to the wide range of benefits \nthat Medicare has to offer.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this legislation \nforward. I believe that we can rebalance the budget, while at the same \ntime encouraging efficient, quality enhancing services, and that's what \nmy legislation sets out to do.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nMedicare Value and Quality Demonstration Act, the Physician Wage \nFairness Act, the Graduate Medical Education Demonstration Act, and the \nSkilled Nursing Facility Wage Information Improvement Act. I am proud \nto cosponsor this package of legislation that will finally begin to \naddress the grossly distorted Medicare reimbursement system, which \npenalizes health care providers in States like Wisconsin for being \nefficient as they provide high-quality care, and penalizes seniors in \nWisconsin by delivering fewer benefits than seniors in other States \nreceive. I want to commend Senator Feingold and Senator Collins for \ntheir hard work and commitment to fixing this problem, and I am proud \nto join them as an original cosponsor in this effort.\n  This issue points to a basic question of fairness. The current \nMedicare reimbursement system is extremely unfair for Wisconsin. \nBecause Wisconsin has been successful in holding down health care \ncosts, current Medicare payment rates are very low in comparison to \nhigher cost States, like Florida and California. In other words, the \ncurrent system effectively punishes Wisconsin providers for being more \nefficient, and puts Medicare beneficiaries in Wisconsin at an unfair \ndisadvantage compared to beneficiaries in other States.\n  This system has to change. My constituents in Wisconsin pay the same \nMedicare payroll tax as people in other States. They suffer from the \nsame illnesses; they need the same treatments; they see the same types \nof health providers. Yet Wisconsin Medicare beneficiaries receive on \naverage $3,795 in Medicare benefits per year, the eighth lowest in the \ncountry. That's 25 percent below the national average of $5,034. A \nstudy conducted by the Rural Wisconsin Health Cooperative found that \nthis costs Wisconsin nearly a billion dollars each year in Medicare \ndollars lost.\n  There is simply no logical reason why Wisconsin doctors, hospitals, \nnursing homes, and ultimately, Wisconsin beneficiaries, should receive \nless reimbursement and fewer Medicare benefits than other States \nreceive. And there is no logical reason why Medicare tax dollars paid \nby Wisconsinites should instead be used to pay higher rates to \nproviders and greater benefits to beneficiaries in other States.\n  And this system isn't just bad for seniors on Medicare. The current \nsystem also has major consequences for businesses and non-Medicare \npatients in Wisconsin. When Medicare reimbursement to hospitals or \nnursing homes or doctors is inadequate, somebody has to make up the \ndifference in order for these providers to stay afloat. This means that \nWisconsin employers who provide health insurance for their employees, \nand patients who pay all or part of their health care bills, must pay \nhigher prices and premiums to make up the shortfall. This is unfair to \nall of Wisconsin's citizens and exacerbates the problem of rising \nhealth care costs.\n  We should all be outraged by a system that treats seniors in some \nStates like second-class citizens. Congress must stop sanctioning the \ncurrent system, which penalizes Medicare beneficiaries based on where \nthey live, penalizes providers for being efficient, and rewards \nproviders that do not do their part to hold the line on costs. This \nbackward system simply makes no sense.\n  The package of bills introduced today will finally begin to turn this \nsystem around and ensure that health care providers in Wisconsin and \nsimilarly affected States are adequately reimbursed and rewarded for \nproviding high quality, cost-effective care. It will eliminate outdated \nand inaccurate data that is currently used to determine Medicare's \nflawed payment rates. And most importantly, it will help level the \nplaying field for seniors in Wisconsin by helping to ensure that they \nhave access to the same benefits as seniors in other States.\n  First, the Skilled Nursing Facility Wage Information Improvement Act \nwill create a reimbursement system for nursing homes that is actually \nbased on accurate nursing home data. This would seem to be common \nsense; yet the current formula for determining Medicare nursing home \npayments is based on hospital wage data that is inaccurate and \ndiscriminates against many States like Wisconsin. The Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, is now compiling nursing home wage \ndata but as of yet has not finalized a plan to utilize it. This bill \nwould set October 1, 2002 as the date for which CMS must incorporate \nthe nursing home data.\n  Second, the Medicare Value and Quality Demonstration Act would begin \nto reverse the backward incentive structure in today's Medicare system. \nMedicare currently penalizes low-cost, high-quality States and health \ncare providers by delivering inadequate reimbursement for their \nservices. It just makes no sense to penalize providers who are working \nhard to be cost-effective and provide high-quality care at the same \ntime. This second bill would create 4 demonstration projects to provide \nbonus incentive payments to high-quality, low-cost hospitals and \ndoctors in the demonstration States. These States would also have to \nimplement a plan to encourage more of their providers to deliver low-\ncost, high-quality care.\n  Third, the Physician Wage Fairness Act would correct a flaw in the \npayment system for physicians. The current physician payment formula \nincludes a geographic adjustor that is outdated. Many studies now point \nto the fact that the labor market for health professionals is actually \na national labor market and therefore, a geographic adjustor simply \ndoes not match today's reality. This bill would eliminate the \ngeographic adjustor and bring the physician payment formula up to date. \nWisconsin's physicians stand to gain $8 million more in Medicare \nreimbursement with passage of this legislation.\n  Finally, the Graduate Medical Education Demonstration Act would help \naddress the issue of shortages of health professionals in underserved \nareas. It allows the HHS Secretary to use Medicare Graduate Medical \nEducation funds to create a program to give providers in underserved \nareas financial incentives to attract educators and clinical \npractitioners.\n  This package of legislation is not the end of the story when it comes \nto fixing Medicare's current flawed payment system. In addition to this \npackage, for the past 2 years I have been a cosponsor of the Medicare \nFairness in Reimbursement Act, introduced by Senators Harkin and Craig. \nThis bill also works to level the playing field between high payment \nStates and low payment\n\n[[Page S862]]\n\nStates, with a particular emphasis on improving reimbursement rates for \nrural areas. And I look forward to continuing to work with Senator \nFeingold and Senator Collins on additional legislation that will deal \nwith the complicated problems of hospital reimbursement and Medicare + \nChoice.\n  But these bills are an important first step toward fixing a system \nthat is not just unfair to my State; it is inaccurate, outdated, and \ncreates perverse incentives for inefficient providers.\n  Many of us in the Congress are working to update Medicare and \nmodernize its structure to fit today's health care system. It is \ncritical that we add a prescription drug benefit for seniors so they \ndon't have to choose between taking their medicine and eating their \nnext meal. It makes sense to add more preventive benefits to keep \nseniors healthy at the start rather than only treating illnesses when \nthey become more serious. I strongly support these efforts and hope \nthat Congress will act this year. But if we don't also fix the \ninequities in Medicare's payment system, these new benefits could also \nturn out to be inequitable for Wisconsin's seniors. This is an issue \nthat must be addressed if Congress is serious about passing real \nMedicare reform.\n  Again, I want to commend Senators Feingold and Collins for their hard \nwork on this package. I look forward to working with them as Medicare \nreform moves forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Schumer, and Ms. \n        Cantwell):\n  S. 1956. A bill to combat terrorism and defend the Nation against \nterrorist attacks, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Safe \nExplosives Act. This legislation will help prevent the criminal use and \naccidental misuse of explosive materials.\n  The events of September 11 have tragically demonstrated how good \nterrorists are at seeking out loopholes in our Nation's defenses. Law \nenforcement, now more than ever, must be several steps ahead of these \ncriminals.\n  Most Americans would be stunned to learn that in some States it is \neasier to get enough explosives to take down a house than it is to buy \na gun, get a drivers' license, or even obtain a fishing license. \nCurrently, it is far too easy for would-be terrorists and criminals to \nobtain explosive materials. Although permits are required for \ninterstate purchases of explosives, there are no current uniform \nnational limitations on the purchase of explosives within a single \nstate by a resident of that State. As a result, a patchwork quilt of \nState regulations covers the intrastate purchase of explosive \nmaterials. In some States, anyone can walk into a hardware store and \nbuy plastique explosives or a box of dynamite. No background check is \nconducted, and no effort is made to check whether the purchaser knows \nhow to properly use this deadly material. In at least 12 States, there \nare little to no restrictions on the intrastate purchase of explosives.\n  Since September 11, the threat of a terrorist attack involving \nexplosives is more real than ever. As Richard Reid, the so-called \n``shoe bomber,'' recently demonstrated when he tried to take down a \nBoeing 767 en route from Paris to Miami, terrorists are actively trying \nto use explosives in pursuit of their aims. We must be more vigilant in \noverseeing the purchase and possession of explosives if we ever hope to \nprevent future potential disasters.\n  The Safe Explosives Act would close the deadly loophole in our \ncurrent laws by requiring people who want to acquire and possess \nexplosive materials to obtain a permit. This measure would \nsignificantly reduce the availability of explosives to terrorists, \nfelons, and others prohibited by current federal law from possessing \ndangerous explosives.\n  Let me elaborate on what the proposal does. As I said, under current \nlaw anyone who is involved in interstate shipment, purchase, or \npossession of explosives must have a Federal permit. This legislation \ncreates the same requirement for intrastate purchases. It calls for two \ntypes of permits for these intrastate purchasers: user permits and \nlimited user permits. The user permit lasts for 3 years and allows \nunlimited explosives purchases. The limited user permit also expires \nafter 3 years, but only allows six purchases per year. We created this \ntwo-tier system so that low-volume users would not be burdened by \nregulations. The limited permit, like the user permit, imposes \ncommonsense rules such as a background check, monitoring of explosives \npurchases, secure storage, and report of sale or theft of explosives. \nHowever, the Safe Explosives Act does not subject the limited user to \nthe record keeping requirements currently required for full permit \nholders.\n\n  In addition to creating the permit system, our measure makes some \ncommonsense addition to the classes of people who are barred from \nbuying or possessing explosives. Current Federal explosives law \nprohibits certain people from purchasing or possessing explosives. The \nlist of people barred is roughly parallel to those prohibited by \nFederal firearms law. For example, convicted felons are not allowed to \nbuy guns or explosives. However, while current law bars nonimmigrant \naliens from buying guns, they are not prohibited from buying \nexplosives. That makes no sense. The Safe Explosives Act would stop \nnonimmigrant aliens from being able to buy explosives. Since we now \nknow that several of the September 11 terrorists were nonimmigrant \naliens, and that sleeper terrorist cells made up of nonimmigrant aliens \nhave been operating within U.S. borders for number of years, this \nprovision is especially important.\n  In addition, the Safe Explosives Act improves the public's safety by \nrequiring permit holders to adhere to proper storage and safety \nregulations. These provisions will help ensure the safety of explosives \nhandlers and prevent accidental or criminal detonation of explosives. \nSadly, each year, many people are seriously injured or killed by misuse \nand criminal use of explosives. For example, in 1997, there were 4,777 \nexplosives incidents, killing 27 and injuring 164 people, and resulting \nin more than $7.3 million in property damage. Our proposal will help \nreduce these numbers.\n  This measure strikes a reasonable balance between stopping dangerous \npeople from getting explosives and helping legitimate users obtain and \npossess explosives. Most large commercial users already have explosives \npermits because they engage in interstate explosives transport. These \nusers would not be significantly affected by our legislation. The low-\nvolume users will be able to quickly and cheaply get a limited permit. \nAnd high-volume intrastate purchasers who are running businesses that \nrequire explosives should easily be able to get an unlimited user \npermit. Also, the measure will not affect those who use black or \nsmokeless powder for recreation, as the legislation does not change \ncurrent regulations on those particular materials.\n  Our goal is simple. We must take all possible steps to keep deadly \nexplosives out of the hands of dangerous individuals seeking to \nthreaten our livelihood and security. The Safe Explosives Act is \ncritical legislation, supported by the administration. It is designed \nsolely to the interest of public safety. It will significantly enhance \nour efforts to limit the proliferation of explosives to would be \nterrorists and criminals. It will close a loophole that could \npotentially cause mass destruction of property and life. I hope my \ncolleagues will support our efforts to pass this vital law. Thank you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                S. 1956\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of \n     citizenship and regaining the right to vote reintegrates \n     offenders into free society. The right to vote may not be \n     abridged or denied by the United States or by any State on \n     account of race, color, gender, or previous condition of \n     servitude. Basic constitutional principles of fairness and \n     equal protection require an equal opportunity for United \n     States citizens to vote in Federal elections.\n       (2) Congress has ultimate supervisory power over Federal \n     elections, an authority that has repeatedly been upheld by \n     the Supreme Court.\n       (3) Although State laws determine the qualifications for \n     voting in Federal elections, Congress must ensure that those \n     laws are in accordance with the Constitution. Currently, \n     those laws vary throughout the Nation, resulting in \n     discrepancies regarding which citizens may vote in Federal \n     elections.\n       (4) An estimated 3,900,000 individuals in the United \n     States, or 1 in 50 adults, currently cannot vote as a result \n     of a felony conviction. Women represent about 500,000 of \n     those 3,900,000.\n       (5) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact \n     ethnic minorities.\n       (6) Fourteen States disenfranchise ex-offenders who have \n     fully served their sentences, regardless of the nature or \n     seriousness of the offense.\n       (7) In those States that disenfranchise ex-offenders who \n     have fully served their sentences, the right to vote can be \n     regained in theory, but in practice this possibility is often \n     illusory.\n       (8) In 8 States, a pardon or order from the Governor is \n     required for an ex-offender to regain the right to vote. In 2 \n     States, ex-offenders must obtain action by the parole or \n     pardon board to regain that right.\n       (9) Offenders convicted of a Federal offense often have \n     additional barriers to regaining voting rights. In at least \n     16 States, Federal ex-offenders cannot use the State \n     procedure for restoring their voting rights. The only method \n     provided by Federal law for restoring voting rights to ex-\n     offenders is a Presidential pardon.\n       (10) Few persons who seek to have their right to vote \n     restored have the financial and political resources needed to \n     succeed.\n       (11) Thirteen percent of the African-American adult male \n     population, or 1,400,000 African-American men, are \n     disenfranchised. Given current rates of incarceration, 3 in \n     10 African-American men in the next generation will be \n     disenfranchised at some point during their lifetimes. \n     Hispanic citizens are also disproportionately \n     disenfranchised, since those citizens are disproportionately \n     represented in the criminal justice system.\n       (12) The discrepancies described in this subsection should \n     be addressed by Congress, in the name of fundamental fairness \n     and equal protection.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to restore \n     fairness in the Federal election process by ensuring that ex-\n     offenders who have fully served their sentences are not \n     denied the right to vote.\n\n     SEC. 502. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Correctional institution or facility.--The term \n     ``correctional institution or facility'' means any prison, \n     penitentiary, jail, or other institution or facility for the \n     confinement of individuals convicted of criminal offenses, \n     whether publicly or privately operated, except that such term \n     does not include any residential community treatment center \n     (or similar public or private facility).\n       (2) Election.--The term ``election'' means--\n       (A) a general, special, primary, or runoff election;\n       (B) a convention or caucus of a political party held to \n     nominate a candidate;\n       (C) a primary election held for the selection of delegates \n     to a national nominating convention of a political party; or\n       (D) a primary election held for the expression of a \n     preference for the nomination of persons for election to the \n     office of President.\n       (3) Federal office.--The term ``Federal office'' means the \n     office of President or Vice President, or of Senator or \n     Representative in, or Delegate or Resident Commissioner to, \n     Congress.\n       (4) Parole.--The term ``parole'' means parole (including \n     mandatory parole), or conditional or supervised release \n     (including mandatory supervised release), imposed by a \n     Federal, State, or local court.\n       (5) Probation.--The term ``probation'' means probation, \n     imposed by a Federal, State, or local court, with or without \n     a condition on the individual involved concerning--\n       (A) the individual's freedom of movement;\n       (B) the payment of damages by the individual;\n       (C) periodic reporting by the individual to an officer of \n     the court; or\n       (D) supervision of the individual by an officer of the \n     court.\n\n     SEC. 503. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.\n\n       The right of an individual who is a citizen of the United \n     States to vote in any election for Federal office shall not \n     be denied or abridged because that individual has been \n     convicted of a criminal offense unless, at the time of the \n     election, such individual--\n       (1) is serving a felony sentence in a correctional \n     institution or facility; or\n       (2) is on parole or probation for a felony offense.\n\n     SEC. 504.

ELECTION DAY HOLIDAY STUDY.\n\n       (a) In General.--In carrying out its duty under section \n     303(a)(1)(G), the Commission, within 6 months after its \n     establishment, shall provide a detailed report to the \n     Congress on the merits of establishing an election day \n     holiday, including options for holding elections for Federal \n     offices on an existing legal public holiday such as Veterans \n     Day, as proclaimed by the President.\n       (b) Factors Considered.--In conducting that study, the \n     Commission shall take into consideration the following \n     factors:\n       (1) Only 51 percent of registered voters in the United \n     States turned out to vote during the November 2000 \n     Presidential election--well-below the worldwide turnout \n     average of 72.9 percent for Presidential elections between \n     1999 and 2000. After the 2000 election, the Census Bureau \n     asked thousands of non-voters why they did not vote. The top \n     reason for not voting, given by 22.6 percent of the \n     respondents, was that they were too busy or had a conflicting \n     work or school schedule.\n       (2) One of the recommendations of the National Commission \n     on Election Reform led by former President's Carter and Ford \n     is ``Congress should enact legislation to hold presidential \n     and congressional elections on a national holiday''. Holding \n     elections on the legal public holiday of Veterans Day, as \n     proclaimed by the President and observed by the Federal \n     government, would allow election day to be a national holiday \n     without adding the cost and administrative burden of an \n     additional holiday.\n       (3) Holding elections on a holiday or weekend could allow \n     more working people to vote more easily. It could increase \n     the pool of available poll workers and make public buildings \n     more available for use as polling places.\n       (4) Several proposals to make election day a holiday or to \n     shift election day to a weekend have been offered in the \n     107th Congress. Some have argued against weekend voting \n     because people of many faiths would have a religious \n     objection to such civic participation on the Sabbath.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 2895.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that previous \nconsent with respect to S.J. Res. 31 be modified to provide that all \ntime be yielded back; that the joint resolution be read the third time, \nand the Senate then vote on passage, without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, once again, as was that case last \nNovember, the Senate today must consider a measure that comes to us as \na result of the recession. S.J. Res. 31 is an automatic resolution, \nrequired to be introduced by the majority leader and considered by the \nBudget Committee and the Senate under expedited procedures.\n  The resolution is automatic when the Congressional Budget Office \nnotifies the Congress of an economic slowdown.\n  On January 30, the Department of Commerce's advance report on real \neconomic growth, showed the economy in the fourth quarter grew at an \nannual rate of 2 tenths of a percent. In the third quarter the economy \nshrank at an annual rate of 1.3 percent.\n  This report triggered the CBO notification of low-growth, and \nsubsequently triggered the introduction of the resolution before us \ntoday.\n  The provision in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \nAct of 1985--sometimes referred to as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act--\nthat necessitated the reporting of this resolution, was simply that we \ndid not want to be initiating major spending cuts in a time of \nrecession.\n  I might add that the same section of that law that suspends spending \ncuts in the time of recessions also covers events of war.\n  S.J. Res. 31 was reported unfavorably from the Budget Committee \nyesterday. The committee is required to report the resolution without \namendment or be discharged without comment.\n  Again, I concurred with the chairman that the committee should \nexpress its disfavor with the Resolution, to send a signal to the full \nSenate to disapprove it. I ask the Senate to join the chairman, Budget \nCommittee, and me on disapproving the resolution.\n  If this resolution were somehow to make it to the President for his \nsignature, which he would not sign, it would effectively eliminate all \nfiscal discipline, all the enforcement tools we have here in the \nCongress all the way through September 2003.\n  I do not think we need to take such drastic action.\n  Having taken this position on a bipartisan basis, however, does not \nmean that we should not act to address both the economic slow down and \nthe war on terrorism. We should and we must.\n  Having said that, the business sector was the focus of the economic \nweakness in the fourth quarter--as it has been throughout the \nrecession.\n  Businesses reduced inventories at a very rapid pace and decreased \ninvestment in new plant and equipment. These factors were such a drag \non economic growth that had it not been for a large increase in \ngovernment purchases, GDP would have been negative in the fourth \nquarter.\n  However, the outlook for economic growth this year is becoming \nincreasingly positive. This morning the Labor Department reported that \ninitial claims for unemployment insurance dropped last week to the \nlowest level since August. Claims are down 26 percent since the peak in \nOctober. Businesses may not be adding workers and the unemployment rate \nmay continue to rise a bit from here, but the pace of layoffs has \nslowed.\n  The inventory cycle, productivity, monetary policy, and fiscal policy \nall suggest better growth this year. Having decreased inventories by \nmore than $70 billion in 2001, business have more room to make \npurchases in the months ahead.\n  Remarkably, it seems no one told productivity that we had a \nrecession. Productivity growth averaged more than 2 percent during the \nrecession and it usually increases rapidly during recoveries.\n  With short-term interest rates at 1.75 percent, monetary policy is \nloose. Lower energy prices should contribute to growth this year. And, \nalthough I wish we could agree on additional policies to stimulate \ngrowth, the tax cut we enacted last year will boost the economy this \nyear.\n  The tools of fiscal discipline must be contained so we can convey to \nthe American public and the markets that we are keeping an eye not only \non the current challenges we face, but also those longer term \nchallenges.\n  We must maintain the provisions of the Budget Act that provide us \nwith that future discipline, and we must deal with both tax and \nspending legislation today while waiving the Budget Act on a case by \ncase basis as needed.\n  I appreciate the chairman's willingness to approach this issue on a \nbipartisan basis and I join with him in recommending that the full \nSenate now reject this resolution when it votes later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question is, Shall the joint resolution pass?\n  The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 31) was rejected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/14/senate-section/article/S877-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL DONOR DAY\n\n  Mr. REID.
