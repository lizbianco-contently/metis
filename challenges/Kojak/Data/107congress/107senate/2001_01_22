Mr. President, as always, it is good to see you present and \nready for a new beginning. I think we have a new opportunity in this \n107th Congress. Again, I extend appreciation to our Chaplain for the \nspiritual leadership he provides to the Senate, all Senators and our \nSenate family.\n  I see the distinguished Democratic whip, Senator Reid from Nevada, is \non the floor also ready to go to work. I appreciate the work he did in \nthe last Congress and look forward to working with him this year. We \nare now at a stage in our country's history where we will be able to \ntake a new look at what we want to do for the benefit of all of our \npeople. We have completed the election, we have completed the \ninauguration, and now we begin to get down to business.\n  I am pleased today that we will have an opportunity to go down with \nleaders of both parties from both the House and the Senate to meet with \nthe new President to begin to discuss the agenda and how he would like \nto proceed and how we would like to proceed in our own way.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  This is the first day for bills to be introduced. The Senate will \nthen have a period of morning business until 3 p.m. for the purpose of \ngeneral statements, most of them, of course, with respect to the bills \nintroduced.\n  As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes today. \nVotes, if necessary can be expected during this week's session \nregarding the confirmation of the President's Cabinet nominees. \nSenators will be notified as votes are scheduled. I expect there could \nbe a vote or two scheduled on Tuesday, perhaps also on Wednesday, but \nwe will give Members specifics on that once we have had an opportunity \nto consult with leaders on the Democratic side of the aisle.\n  I also thank all the Senators for their willingness to allow us to \nmove seven of the President's nominees through confirmation on \nSaturday. There had been some indication that perhaps recorded votes \nwould be necessary, but after a great deal of working back and forth \nand the fact that Senator Daschle was willing to be supportive of \nmoving the nominees through quickly, we were able to get that done. I \nthink that was a wise decision on behalf of myself and I know the new \nPresident is glad six members of his team have already been sworn in \nand the seventh will probably be sworn in today, especially those \ndealing with national security issues, economic issues, and even the \nnew Energy Secretary who will have to immediately begin to address some \nof the energy needs in this country. I think we are off to a good \nstart.\n\n[[Page S70]]\n\n  We will have the first 30 minutes I believe on this side of the \naisle, and then the second 30 minutes goes to the Democratic side. \nTraditionally, we introduce the first five, the majority party \nintroduces the first five, and then the other side does the next five, \nand back on this side for five more, and back to the other side. Then \nany Senators who wish would be able to offer their bills after that.\n  I notice the Senator standing. Before I go further, I am happy to \nyield to Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID. If the majority leader would yield for a brief statement, I \nsay to the leader I hope during this coming year, he will look at what \nhappens here that is positive in nature. I was very happy to hear the \nmajority leader talk about what we did last Saturday, in one fell \nswoop, approving seven of the Cabinet positions given to us by the \nPresident.\n  There will be times during this year that we won't be approving seven \nmajor nominations or doing anything that is that large of a step. I \nthink there is a spirit of bipartisanship. I have to say it was \ngenerated and improved by the work of the two leaders in allowing us to \nhave the committee structure as indicated.\n  I think there is a good feeling on both sides of the aisle that we \ncan get things done. As the year proceeds, when there are things that \ndon't go the way of the majority, with Vice President Cheney making \nthat majority, I hope he would reflect on those things we do that are \npositive in nature.\n  This is a legislative body. To get things done we have to compromise. \nLegislation is the art of compromise. I hope we can maintain this \nfeeling of bipartisanship that we now have. There is no reason we \ncannot do that, especially if we look at things done here as the glass \nbeing half full rather than half empty.\n  I have told the leader personally how much I appreciate what he has \ndone. I look forward to a very fruitful legislative year for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \ncomments. That is why I did make specific mention of the fact that we \nconfirmed seven of the nominees on Saturday. That was a very good \ngesture, very positive gesture. I had noted earlier that 8 years ago we \nhad confirmed three of then-President Clinton's nominees the first day \nand all of the rest of his nominees the second day except one, which we \ndid have a recorded vote on subsequently. But I thought in this case \nthe fact that we moved seven was very good. I think as long as we can, \nand as many times as we can find a bipartisan way to work together, we \nshould do that and we will do our best to do that.\n  Back to the schedule today of introducing bills, the leadership may \nopt in some instances to go ahead and introduce a bill that is fully \nprepared, fully vetted and properly drafted or they may decide to have \nwhat we call place holders for their bills--S. 1 through S. 5 on our \nside or S. 6 through S. 10 on the other side.\n\n  We will probably have place holders today because we would like to \nhave an opportunity to honestly have more consultation with leaders on \nboth sides of the Capitol in the majority party, but also to have input \nfrom the President. This week, the President will go forward with his \ncommitment to make education his highest priority, and he, as I \nunderstand it, will speak to different aspects of his proposal each \nday, or two or three times during this week. We would like to make sure \nwe have a bill that has been worked through and we will have an \nopportunity to work with our new chairman of the Senate Republican \nConference, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSantorum. So, within a couple of weeks we will have the specifics of \nthis legislation.\n  Again, without saying these are the order of priorities, I do think I \nshould at least touch on the issues we are going to be focusing on in \nthese early bills. Education, as the President has indicated--I think \neverybody in America is in agreement, regardless of region or party or \nfinancial background--has to be addressed. We have lost some ground in \ncomparison to previous generations, compared to other countries. We can \ndo a better job in education. No child should be left behind in \nAmerica. We are going to focus on accountability and reading. I feel \nvery strongly about this whole issue.\n  I am the son of a schoolteacher who taught school for 19 years. I \nwent to public schools all my life, as did my wife and both of our \nchildren. It really pains me to see what is happening in some of our \nschools. The quality has deteriorated. The accountability has left. The \nschools are dangerous. The schools are not safe from drugs. So we have \nwork to do there.\n  Also, clearly we need to continue to try to address the Tax Code. The \nTax Code is unfair. It is too complicated; it is too long--it is \nendless. But even beyond that, now, we see there is some softening in \nthe economy. Without trying to predict what might happen in that area--\nwe always look for a way, in America, to have more. But when you look \nat the surplus we have and look at what can be done with the Tax Code \nto make it more fair and also to encourage economic growth. I think \nthat should be one of our high priorities.\n  I believe it will be. The President has said he is going to seek \nthat, and I believe there are Members of Congress, again, on both sides \nof the aisle in both Chambers, who are going to try their best to \nachieve that goal. Will there be arguments over some of the details? \nSurely. This is a legislative body and different Senators and different \nHouse Members will have different approaches. But we should get this \ndone and do it as quickly as possible because we need to start having \nsome impact. That is why I do support the ideas that have been \nsuggested, that it be across-the-board rate cuts and that we look at \nretroactivity and other ways to really affect the economy.\n  Over the past week, in various settings, I did also have the \nopportunity to talk to some of our leaders in defense. I spent some \ntime with the new Secretary of Defense, Don Rumsfeld. I had the \nopportunity to talk to a number of Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nbut, more important, to individual military men and women. I believe \nthere are more problems in our military and greater needs there than we \nhave acknowledged or that people are prepared to recognize at this \npoint. It does go to morale, the quality of the facilities for our \nmilitary personnel: readiness and modernization. So defense has to be \nat the very top of any agenda we discuss.\n  Then you start looking to your grandparents and your parents, to your \nown future and that of your children and grandchildren. We have to go \nahead and address the issues that are difficult politically but \nessential for the future security of all of us; that is, Social \nSecurity and Medicare, and how do you provide prescription drugs to our \nneedy elderly. It will not be easy, but as the President said in his \nInaugural Address at his swearing in on Saturday: We cannot just pass \nthese issues on to the next generation because it is tough for us to \ndeal with them.\n  That is not exactly what he said, but that was the gist of it. That \nis what he meant. So I think we have to find a way to do these things, \nand we can do them. There are a lot of different ways to approach this. \nAgain, the substance will be hotly debated. I really think that Social \nSecurity can be dealt with, with just a few changes that would protect \nit for 90 years or more. Medicare has more moving parts, and I think it \nhas more difficulty right now, but we should start early to try to find \na way to work on those.\n  On Medicare, I think a good place to begin would be where the \nMedicare Commission left off. We had a bipartisan Medicare Commission \nwith some of the most thoughtful Members of the Congress serving on \nthat Commission, chaired by Senator John Breaux. They did a lot of good \nwork. Have we learned more? Surely. But that would be good place to \nstart because unfortunately that Commission's recommendation never had \na good airing by the Senate committee or the House Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n\n  In the case of Social Security, I think a good idea would be to \nconsider a commission somewhat similar to the commission we had in the \n1980s, sort of a base closure-type commission, where we have a \ndistinguished blue ribbon commission that would look at this area and \nmake recommendations. Then Congress would have to review it and then \nvote it up or down. But these are\n\n[[Page S71]]\n\njust some ideas, ideas I am not advocating on behalf of any group of \nSenators and not the new President, but just some thoughts that we can \nwork on.\n  Another area--and this goes beyond five categories but is something \nwe have to look at very quickly--is energy. We have ignored this energy \nproblem. We don't have a national energy policy. How many times are we \ngoing to have to be shaken to wake up and realize that we do not have a \nnational energy policy; we are not making use of the resources we have \nin America, we are not properly providing the right incentives for \nconservation; we are dependent on foreign oil? This makes no sense.\n  Then we have the situation in California where they say they have \nderegulation but it is not deregulation, or it is half deregulation \nwhich is worse than no deregulation. They deregulated at one end and \nnot at the other, and we see there are real problems. But we should not \nprotest and damn the darkness. We should prepare for the light. We \nshould find a way to have a broad policy in this area.\n  On Sunday, I spoke to the distinguished chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, Senator Murkowski. I thought that issue \nwas so important that I took some time to give him a ring and talk \nabout what he has in mind and the preparation he is doing to have a \nbill ready within the next few days. It can be introduced in our first \ngrouping of bills.\n  We have a lot of work to do, but I am excited about the \npossibilities. This is by no means a complete list. There will be \nissues we will be working on beyond the first five or first six bills, \nthings that are left over from last year that I know we are going to \nneed to address.\n  We will have to address them. It will be in a variety of areas all \nthe way from transportation to housing to health care, obviously, that \nis still pending. So we will have plenty of other things that will be \nmoving.\n  But as Winston Churchill would say, I think, and as he said, you do \nneed to give the people a few really big ideas.\n  You do need to step up to the difficult issues. You need to stretch \npeople to reach beyond their own comfort and try to think about the \nnext generation. So the issues I have addressed here are big issues, \nissues that we need to speak to quickly. With the leadership of our new \nPresident, one who is going to be very aggressive in promoting ideas \nbut also very willing to listen, to reach out to Members of both \nparties and Americans of all stages in life, I think he is set up now \nin such a way, with his own efforts and also some things that have \nhappened here in the Senate, that give us an opportunity to achieve \nsome really wonderful things for the American people.\n  So I look forward to this opportunity, working with Senators on both \nsides of the aisle. I thank the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor being willing to be here this morning and go over this list, \nperhaps in some more specificity. I yield the floor at this time, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his opening \nremarks and for setting the stage for what we all hope to be a very \nproductive session of Congress. It is like the first day of a football \nseason or baseball season. Everybody is even right now. Nobody has lost \na game yet. Everybody has high expectations and high hopes for a good \nseason.\n  I believe we have a good team here. We have a good team here in the \nU.S. Senate. We have a good team in the House, a good team in the White \nHouse. I am very optimistic that we can work together and really \nproduce for the American public, because that is really what it is all \nabout. It is about delivering and meeting the concerns that the \nAmerican public have with how we here in Washington, D.C. interact with \nthem.\n  There are certain issues that are very important to average \nAmericans--I always use the term kitchen table. What are people talking \nabout at their kitchen table, and what is relevant in their daily lives \nand how do we react to that and intersect with that here in Washington, \nD.C. I think it is vitally important for us to approach what we do here \nin part based on that.\n  Obviously, there are great issues of national security and foreign \ndiplomacy that may not be kitchen-table conversations on a daily basis \nto which we obviously have to pay attention. Making sure Government \nruns efficiently and effectively may not be on the front burner of the \nAmerican people but certainly is the responsibility of Congress. But \nwhen it comes to the agenda of changing to improve our system to \nreflect the concerns of the American public, I think that is what we \nreally want to focus on today.\n  Senator Lott did a good job of running through those items that he \nbelieves and I believe are on the minds of millions of Americans, where \nthey see problems and they see ways in which the Federal Government \ncan, by some level of involvement, make a positive difference in making \ntheir lives better and America better. I want to walk through those.\n  We, as a Republican Conference, a few weeks ago met across the street \nin the Library of Congress. We had a discussion about what we thought \nwere the issues of importance to the people of America where Congress \ncould make a difference, where Congress could improve the quality of \nlife in America and improve the prospects for future generations of \nAmericans to live free and to have opportunities.\n  The six we came up with are these: Improving our national defense. \nObviously, a big concern with this new administration and I think with \nthe entire Congress on both sides of the aisle is the low level of \nmorale in many areas of our military and the fact that we have not \nfaced up to the challenges we have in national security. I will go \nthrough those.\n  First, morale. Let's make no mistake about it; we have the best \nfighting force ever seen on the face of the Earth. We have outstanding \nyoung men and women who are serving this country and serving it well, \nbut we have not provided leadership in two ways: No. 1, providing basic \ncare for them as people, whether it is the military health care system \nwhich has an inordinate amount of problems or whether it is simply pay, \nsalary. We gave a pay increase, but it is still lagging far behind the \nprivate sector. We ask our people to serve and put their lives on the \nline, and yet the compensation is such that most of our people in the \nmilitary live hand to mouth, paycheck to paycheck.\n  We need to do something to improve quality of life in housing. We \nneed to improve quality of life in another area, and that is \ndeployment. Our front-line troops in particular are stretched out, even \nseveral members of a family and friends who are in the Reserves and \nGuard and are being asked to do much more and many more deployments. \nThat is stretching them at home and at their work, all because of our \ninability to focus our resources in America appropriately.\n  I am hopeful with this new President that we will reduce the number \nof deployments, and not just because we should not be involved in a lot \nof the areas in which we have been involved, but certainly because of \nthe strain it takes on our military in morale and readiness. That is \nanother area in which I am looking forward to doing some work.\n  The final area in defense I want to talk about today is we have not \nprepared our military for the next generation, the new threats that are \nout there, whether it is missile defense and the threat of terroristic \nmissile attacks on this country and our allies or cyberwarfare. There \nare 20 countries around the world developing offensive capability to \nattack not just our military installations and our military computers, \nbut our commercial computer systems through cyberwarfare. We have to do \na better job of responding to that and chemical and biological weaponry \nand other types of terroristic attacks--homeland defense.\n\n  We have to do a better job in this new millennium to respond to the \nthreats of the new millennium. Frankly, we just have not put forth the \nresources we need and have not given it thought. I am hoping to work on \nthat on a bipartisan basis in the Congress.\n  We all recognize--many on the other side of the aisle have worked in \nthese areas--we need to work in these areas and move this country \nforward.\n  I am doing these items in alphabetical order.\n  Education: I do not know of anything President Bush has focused on \nmore than providing a quality education for every child. We heard over \nand over\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\nthat no child should be left behind. I am excited to see he already has \na growing volume of information, suggestions, and ideas for the \nCongress to improve the quality of education by insisting on \naccountability through testing and setting goals, but ensuring and, in \na sense, restoring local control where, yes, there are goals and, yes, \nthere is testing, but there has to be local control and flexibility for \nthe schools to be able to accomplish that. We have to do something to \nimprove education overall. One way to do that is by improving safety in \nour schools. I know President Bush is very sincere about that, as we \nall are. One way is to ensure that people who are going to a school \nwhere they do not feel safe is to give them a choice to go to another \nschool that is safe.\n  There are schools in this country--I have been to a few. I remember \ngoing to a school in Philadelphia and asking a group of kids, of whom a \nvery small percentage are going on to college, what is the No. 1 \nconcern they have at school. Was it not enough computers? Quality of \nteachers? Classroom size? Their No. 1 concern was getting to school \nalive every day. That was the consensus in the room.\n  If one's first concern is getting to school alive every day, how well \ncan one learn when they get there? We have to do something to provide \nthe opportunity, for people who want to learn, to go to school where \nthey feel safe. Obviously, we need to improve safety in every school, \nbut we need to give choices to people who do not feel safe in their \nschool.\n  One of the things President Bush did when he was Governor of Texas \nwas close the gap between those schools that were ``advantaged'' and \nthose schools that were in poor neighborhoods, focusing on getting more \nresources into our disadvantaged schools to help kids. Yes, parental \nchoice and giving parents the choice to send their kids to another \nschool is one aspect, but obviously bringing up the standards in those \npoorer schools is another way to do that. That has to be a big focus of \nour education agenda.\n  Third is energy. Senator Lott spoke very eloquently to the fact we \nsimply have not had a national energy strategy. We have been able to \nget away with it. OPEC and the rest of the world were allowing oil to \nflow very freely, and we had relatively cheap oil for some time in this \ncountry. The result of that is we have seen our dependence on foreign \noil go up to 56 percent.\n  One of the objectives of this Congress and this administration should \nbe to get back to the level of dependency on foreign oil that we had 8 \nyears ago, which was 50 percent. We are talking about a 10-percent \nreduction in our dependency on foreign oil. It is vitally important we \ndo that, and we can do that through a variety of ways. Developing \nalternative sources of energy is one. It is vitally important we use \nrenewables but also use the fossil fuels we have in our country.\n  I come from coal country. I can tell you, the poorest counties in my \nState are counties in which coal used to be king. We need to do \nsomething--and we can--to use our coal resources--and we have literally \nhundreds and hundreds of years of coal reserves in our country to use \nour coal resources to create power and to do it in a clean way. We can \ndo it in a clean way if we are willing to invest in it. We have to \ninvest in using our domestic capability, but do it in a way that is \nclean, and we can do it by investing in technology to burn coal \ncleanly. It can be done.\n  We have to have a comprehensive strategy; we have to come together as \na nation and say what our agenda is going to be for energy and do it in \na bipartisan way, and we need leadership from the White House. We did \nnot have that leadership. We did not have any real effort made. I am \nexcited our former colleague, Secretary Spence Abraham, will be leading \nthat charge, and I am very excited about the opportunities we will have \nin the area of energy strategy.\n  Third is Medicare. Medicare is probably one of the most popular \nprograms in the United States. It is popular because it provides much \nneeded health care to those who are the most vulnerable to illness, and \nthey are our seniors. But the problem with Medicare is that it simply \ndoesn't do the job of providing enough benefits, enough services in an \nefficient way to a population that is ever increasing in need and in \nsize. So it is vitally important for the Congress to do something to \nimprove the quality of Medicare and to improve the expanse of Medicare. \nIn other words, we need to expand it.\n  I think everybody in this Chamber would agree, we have to have a \nprescription drug component for Medicare. I think everyone would also \nagree that the only reason we don't have a prescription drug component \nof Medicare--I am talking about an outpatient prescription drug \nbenefit--is because Medicare is a Government-run health care system. \nFor many years, while every private plan in America had a prescription \ndrug program to it, Medicare didn't for probably 10 to 15 years. The \nreason it didn't is because the Government had to change it. We were \nrunning big deficits at the time and we simply didn't have the money. \nWe didn't have the money to add a benefit onto an existing system as \nother programs did, to change their insurance policies--to change \ntheirs from less utilized care to more utilized care, to respond to \nwhat the public wanted and the changes in Medicare.\n  We are stuck with a one-size-fits-all Government program that would \nnot do that. So now millions of people in America don't have \nprescription drug coverage as seniors. We need to change the Medicare \nsystem so it can change as medicine changes, not as Congress changes \nbecause Congress doesn't move as quickly as medicine does. So we need \nto do something to make sure Medicare is responsive to the changes in \nmedicine, and to the changes people who are on Medicare want, with the \nkind of medicine they want to have provided to them.\n  So it is vitally important for us to change Medicare to be patient \nfriendly, to respond to the needs of the American public. That includes \na prescription drug program, but it also includes choices for people. \nIt includes changing the system to allow it to evolve as the needs and \nwants of seniors in this country change and as medicine changes.\n  So that is what we are going to be focusing on with the Medicare \nProgram. It is vital for us to do so right now because we have too many \npeople who are not getting the kind of services they need under \nMedicare. We need to give them those choices. We need to give them the \nchance to get quality health care the way they want it delivered, on a \ntimely basis.\n  Next is Social Security. I can't think of any Member of either the \nHouse or the Senate who has done more work on Social Security than the \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Gregg. But he \nand I, and several of us here, have been working to try to communicate \nto the American public: If you think there are problems in Medicare--\nand there are, as shown in the reasons as I laid them out before--the \nsame problems really exist in Social Security. I know there are \nprobably people listening whose sole income comes from their Social \nSecurity check. They are living hand to mouth. They are probably not \neven surviving simply with their Social Security. They are probably \nhaving to get supportive services like Meals on Wheels or other food \nsupport from charitable organizations. They are probably getting help \nfrom relatives or friends because the Social Security check alone isn't \nenough anymore.\n  The fact is, the Social Security system is not enough. It is not \ngoing to be adequate for future generations. We have to do a better job \nto improve it because as much as we encourage people to save and \ninvest, there will always be those who either don't or can't--and in \nmost cases can't--so we have to make sure that basic level of security \nis there, and we have to improve that system.\n  No. 1, we have to improve the system. No. 2, we have to make sure it \nis not a system that is going to have to be dramatically cut in the \nfuture because of demographic changes, such as the mass retirement of \nthe baby boom generation. If we do not improve Social Security now, and \nin the appropriate manner, we will have tremendous tax increases as a \nresult of this demographic shift that I mentioned.\n  I love the people who say, well, just leave Social Security alone and \nit will be fine. If we do nothing, we will either have to cut benefits \nby 30 percent, or increase taxes by 50 percent within 20 years for this \nsystem to survive. Let\n\n[[Page S73]]\n\nme repeat that. We will either have to cut benefits by 30 percent or \nincrease taxes by 50 percent, or some combination thereof, if we keep \nthe system the old way, which is a completely Government-operated \nsystem, where all the money comes in and just goes straight back out in \nthe form of benefits.\n  The only way we can change the system and improve it is to add a \nthird component. Instead of cutting benefits or raising taxes, we can \nadd investment. Every other retirement system in America is funded \nthrough investment. It is good enough for those who have the choice as \nto how they want to create a retirement system, and I don't know of \nanybody out there who would trade their retirement system at work, \nwhether it is a 401(k) or whether it is a defined benefit plan, whether \nthey would take that contribution they make, that is invested--that \nmoney they give is invested--that they would trade that for the current \nSocial Security system. Instead of investing their money, we just take \nit, we just use it, and then we promise, 20 years from now, when they \nretire, we will pay them.\n\n  How many people would trade the ability to see that investment--see \nit grow, manage that investment or have someone help them manage that \ninvestment, and then get that return when they retire--how many would \ntrade that for a promise of the company, 20 years from now, to pay them \na benefit? I don't know of one person who would do that. But that is \nwhat Social Security is. Instead of taking the money we now put in as \n12.4 percent of every dollar most people earn, instead of taking some \nof that money and putting it in an investment and managing it and \nseeing it grow, to use that to provide for retirement, we say: Just \ntrust us. It will be there.\n  The problem is, it won't be there. It won't be there in the sense \nthat we are going to have to make dramatic changes to either the \nbenefit structure or the tax structure.\n  If we make big changes to the tax structure--that is, increasing \ntaxes to 18 percent or 19 percent instead of the now 12.4 percent----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Seeing no one else on the floor, I ask unanimous \nconsent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So we really do have a real choice here. And the choice \nis between preparing for what we know is to come, preparing for the \ndemographic cliff we are going to fall off, which is the baby boom \ngeneration, where we are going to go right now from 3\\1/2\\ workers for \nevery retiree to 2 workers for every retiree, we can prepare for that, \nallowing for a voluntary contribution for existing workers, allowing \nthem to put money aside to be able to invest that money and grow that \nmoney and use it to help pay their benefits, or we can sit back and \nwait.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire and I probably aren't going to be \naround then. We are not going to be around 20 years from now. We can \nvery casually say: Hey, we tried. Let someone else worry about it. We \nare not going to be here. We will not be blamed for it. Someone else is \ngoing to have to raise those taxes and someone else is going to have to \nmake those benefit cuts.\n  I think it would be unconscionable in a time of record prosperity and \nin a time when I think most people would argue there is no great \npressing issue facing the American public, that we can't look forward \nand say we know there is a problem out there, and it is a major \nproblem. It is not a little problem; it is a big problem. We can't just \nlook forward a few years. We can prevent a big problem right now by \njust a little courage and a little consensus.\n  So I am hopeful. I think, with the leadership out of the White House, \nand with people of good faith, we can look forward, and we can do \nsomething we have not done in Social Security ever before. I underscore \nthis. We have a tremendous challenge before us. We have always fixed \nSocial Security when the disaster was on the doorstep--the checks were \nnot going to be written, there wasn't enough money in the fund. It was \nonly then that we mustered the ``courage''--I put that in quotations--\nwe mustered the ``courage'' to act. That is not leadership. In fact, it \nhas resulted in a system that, as I mentioned before, is not the best \nsystem for retirement for our seniors. Had we done it, looking forward, \nback in the 1960s and 1970s--particularly in the 1970s--had we looked \nforward and seen the baby boom generation projected out which we, of \ncourse, knew of then, and had said, we know this problem is going to be \nahead of us, so why don't we begin new investment now--instead of \nraising taxes, let's create the opportunity for investment--we would \nnot be in the situation we are in today.\n  We were at the point where the checks were not going to get paid so \nwe blinked. We did the old, safe thing. We just increased taxes or \nreduced benefits.\n  I am hopeful we will have more courage than that this time around, \nand we will be better public stewards. That is what it is really about. \nIt is about stewardship for future generations.\n  Finally, turning to tax relief, aside from education I don't know of \nany issue on which President Bush is more focused than the issue of tax \nrelief. This conference, as with all these issues, is going to support \nthe President in reducing taxes.\n  I remember my good friend, Paul Coverdell, used to give a talk--and I \nheard it many times--where he would discuss taxes and how paying taxes \nto Washington really equated to freedom. The more taxes you paid, the \nless free you were. Someone who would pay 40 percent of their taxes to \nGovernment was less free than someone who only paid 10 percent.\n  There are a lot of economic reasons why we should reduce taxes. There \nare a lot of reasons from the point of view of not providing more money \nto Washington, letting the Government grow. It really is a fundamental \nissue of personal freedom. When we can say to a family of four making \n$35,000 a year that we are going to reduce your taxes by $1,500, which \nis basically eliminating your tax liability, that certainly, for a \nfamily of four at $35,000 a year, creates more economic freedom and \nmore opportunity for them to provide for themselves, not to look to \nWashington but to be able to do more for themselves. It provides \nopportunity and freedom. For a family of four making $50,000, it \nprovides a $2,000 tax cut. That is a 50 percent reduction in their \ntaxes. It is not a tax break for the wealthy. It is a tax break \npredominantly focused on average working Americans who need that tax \nrelief.\n  We do provide across-the-board tax relief, but even with the \nreduction the President has suggested, the top rate of taxation will \nstill be higher than it was 8 years ago. So it won't even go back to \nthe level it was under former President Bush. It is, in fact, a modest \nreduction in taxes, but it is important--in the top rate particularly--\nbecause it provides, at a time when the economy seems to be slowing \ndown somewhat, the opportunity for more available capital and \ninvestment to keep the economy chugging along.\n  There are good economic reasons for doing this. There are good policy \nreasons for doing this. The fundamental issue is freedom.\n  When we get down to it, people who have more of their own resources \nare simply more free to provide for themselves and are less dependent \nupon Washington to do things for them.\n  That is our agenda. It directly impacts every American--whether it is \nthe bill you pay at the utility or the school you send your children \nto, your parents, your grandparents, providing them with a stable \nSocial Security system as well as quality Medicare coverage that is \nappropriate for the medicine being practiced at the time--it changes as \nmedicine changes; it changes as your needs change--finally, tax relief \nthat affects all of us who are taxpayers and says that Washington, in a \ntime of surplus, can do with less. We don't need to grow the size of \nGovernment. We need to grow the opportunity of the American people.\n  This is our agenda. We are very excited about it. I am hopeful there \nwill be bipartisan support for each of these because I know there are \nmany of these items on our list that our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle care as deeply about. We need to find that common ground \nand we need to share our conviction that America can do better and that \nits best days are ahead. We can do that in a bipartisan way, with \nstrong leadership from the White House.\n  As we start the season, everybody without any wins and losses, let us \nset\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\nour sights high and, in so doing, provide a great vision and great \nopportunity for America and its citizens.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand that time is reserved for the \nDemocratic side. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed \nin morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, those of us who had the opportunity--and I \nthink most of America did, I hope--to listen to President Bush's \ninaugural address were tremendously impressed by the tone of it and its \npurpose, which was to bring civility back to politics and governance in \nWashington and to call us to a higher purpose beyond partisanship, \nbeyond pettiness and rather to move into trying to bring back the \ndreams, in essence, that have made this country great. Part of this \ninitiative is to direct a significant amount of energy at our \neducational system in an attempt to make sure no child is left behind, \nand by doing that we give every American citizen the opportunity to \nobtain the American dream.\n  We all recognize that education is the first and most important \nelement of success in our society. It is not only important for the \nindividual, but it is important for our Nation because we are a Nation \nwhich clearly thrives and expands and grows and prospers on the basis \nof a well-educated people, and our capacity to compete in the \ninternational community is tied directly to our capacity to have a \nwell-educated people who can lead us on the cutting edge in areas of \ntechnology and other areas that are necessary for the productivity of \nour Nation. Thus, focusing on education is the appropriate thing to do \nas we move forward as a government, and it is truly appropriate that \nthe President has chosen this to be his first and most significant \ninitiative. I understand that either later today or tomorrow he is \ngoing to outline the principles upon which he intends to move on the \nissue of education policy here at the Federal level.\n\n  Let me outline quickly some of the things we as a Republican Congress \nand as a Republican Senate have been focusing on, which I presume and \nexpect to be part of the essence of what the President also wants. Last \nyear, we passed out of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions of the Health Committee a truly significant step in \nthe area of trying to improve education, the ESEA bill, Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, in a form which was different than it had been \npassed out in prior years. We took the basic act which is directed at \nlow-achieving, low-income children and tried to rewrite it in a way \nthat would assist those children and keep them from being left behind.\n  We discovered that after 20 years of spending literally billions of \ndollars on elementary and secondary education for low-income children--\nin fact, I think it is approximately $137 billion or $127 billion over \nthat period--that those children were still being left behind; that \nlow-income children in grade 4, for example, were reading at a level \ntwo grades behind their peers who were not from those backgrounds; that \nespecially in a minority community children were simply not obtaining \nthe academic levels to be competitive in society; that the children \nwere not only coming to school not ready to read but once in school \nwere not able to learn to read because the educational system was \nleaving them behind; that failed schools are being allowed to continue \nto be failed schools year in and year out; that children were being put \nthrough a system where failure had been identified but nothing was done \nto change the fact that failure was occurring.\n  So we decided to change and adjust the approach. Rather than being a \nsystem that was based on institutions which funded the institution, the \neducational building or the educational bureaucracy, we decided to \nchange to a procedure where we actually funded the child. We decided to \ntake a child-centered approach to education. That is what one presumes \nis the logical approach under any scenario, but it has been in the last \n20 years the approach of the use of Federal dollars. Instead, we have \nthrown them at the education bureaucracy. We have thrown them into \nschool buildings, but we have not said let's have the dollars fund the \nchild who is being left behind, especially the low-income children.\n  So the first element of our bill was to have it be child centered. \nThe second element of our bill was to give flexibility to local schools \nbecause they understand how to educate the child, to say to the local \nschool districts, the local teachers and principals, local school \nboards, and especially to the parents of the children: You shall have \nthe opportunity to use Federal dollars in a more flexible way. We will \nnot categorize how you must use those dollars. We will not control the \ndecisions at the front end. We will not say how many desks you must \nhave and books you must have in a classroom, or how many hours you must \nteach a child. Rather, we will give you flexibility over the use of \ndollars, but in exchange for that flexibility, we also, as a third \nelement, require accountability.\n  We said the local schools are going to have to achieve, that they \ncould no longer leave the low-income child behind; that that low-income \nchild's academic ability was going to have to be maintained at the \nlevel at which his or her peers were being maintained; that the schools \ncould no longer ignore a failing school. For example, they could no \nlonger keep in their school system a failing school year after year and \nexpect to continue to get funds for that failing school; that instead \nwe were going to expect that children not be shuffled through the \nsystem but rather the children be allowed to excel and achieve within \nthe system. Those were the elements of our bill: First, that it was \nchild centered; second, there be flexibility for local communities to \nmake the decisions as to how to educate the children; but, third, there \nwould be an expectation of results. There would be academic \naccountability so low-income children would not be left behind.\n\n  Three of the elements that made up this package were reasonably \ncontroversial, at least in the sense that the educational lobby here in \nWashington was opposed to them. The educational lobby here in \nWashington is strong, and it has an iron hold over this city, or has \ntraditionally had an iron hold. They do not like change. They don't \nlike to be held accountable. They do not like things that require them \nto produce results. Rather, they are more interested in teaching to a \nstandard which, unfortunately, has been the least common denominator, \nand not requiring that they be held accountable for the use of dollars \nwhich have been sent to them. But we felt those dollars should be \naccountable. So we said, first, there should be portability. In other \nwords, if a child is in a school that has failed year in and year out, \nwe said, rather than having the money to continue to go to that school, \nwe will allow the parent of that child to get dollars and allow the \nparent of that child to take those dollars with the child either to \nanother school or to a tutorial program so that the child has the \nopportunity to get out of the failing school.\n  This idea of portability of funds, of attaching the dollars to the \nchild, attaching the dollars to the school, has been controversial, but \nit is an idea which has worked and is working in places such as \nArizona.\n  We are not saying the school district has to pursue this activity, \nbut rather we are saying a school district will have the option of \npursuing this activity. We are not saying the school must undertake \nportability. We are saying if the school wishes to use Federal dollars \nin a portable way, they can. So we are making it, again, an option to \nthe local school district as to whether or not they pursue this.\n  This has been stamped a voucher program by the forces that do not \nwish to see it succeed or don't wish to try anything else. It is simply \na statement to the local district that if they feel that attaching the \ndollars to the child so that the child and the child's parents can take \nadvantage of dollars to improve the child's education, makes sense if \nthe local public entity which\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\nmanages that school district--be it a public school board or be it a \npublic education authority that decides that you want to use \nportability, you can. So it is not a federally-mandated program. It is \na Federal option given to the local school districts.\n  We said to school districts what we need are teachers who can teach \ntheir subjects best. You--the local school districts--understood, and, \nfortunately, have been told that what you need are more teachers. The \nFederal program as it presently exists says you must hire teachers even \nif you do not need more teachers. Forty-two of the States already meet \nthe teacher-student ratio which is required under federal law. But to \nget Federal dollars, you have to hire more teachers. We said that \ndoesn't make much sense. We said let's let the local community decide \nwhether they need more teachers or better trained teachers.\n\n  So we passed something called the Teacher Empowerment Act which said \nto local school districts here are the Federal dollars for teaching. So \nwe will put them in a bundle and give them to you. You can use them for \nany of a variety of things. You can use them to hire more teachers in \nyour classroom. You don't have to use it for that but you can. You can \nuse them to educate your teachers so they teach better, or you can use \nthem to give technical support to your teachers so they have better \ntools with which to teach. It is the local school districts that have \nthe flexibility to do that. But if you get that flexibility, you also \nhave to have accountability and you have to show us the teaching of the \nstudents has improved over a 5-year period; that the students are \nactually learning more; that they are doing better. So, once again, we \ngave local flexibility to the community and we did it in the context of \nan accountability system.\n  This, again, was opposed and is opposed aggressively by the Federal \nlobby here in Washington because it gives the local community the \ndecision power over how to use the Federal dollars, and the community \nhere in Washington doesn't like it. They want to be able to manage \nthose dollars from Washington so it is a Washington-driven event versus \na local event. This, in essence, is where the battle will once again \njoin if there is a battle in this Congress as we move forward with \neducational reform.\n  There are many people on the other side of the aisle who see the need \nfor flexibility and for accountability proposals that came from the \nSenator from Colorado last year and the Senator from \nIndiana. Democratic Senators had ideas and initiatives in many ways \nsimilar to the initiatives we had on our side of the aisle that \nrepresent a positive step toward a bipartisan compromise in these \nareas. I am hopeful as we move further down the road on educational \nreform we can come together in this Congress and especially in this \nSenate on a whole series of initiatives which will accomplish this \nfundamental goal that we aren't leaving children behind or allowing \nfailing schools to continue to function, that we are expecting that our \neducational system will deliver to our children the opportunity to \nparticipate in the American dream.\n\n  There is great room for compromise, there is great room for \nbipartisan initiative. I congratulate the President on making this his \nfirst order of business. This is the essence of how we as a nation \ncontinue to remain strong and vibrant.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I said on January 3 that I intended to \nsavor every one of the next 17 days. And I am happy to report that I \ndid.\n  It was a great honor to serve as Majority Leader of the United States \nSenate--however briefly.\n  At noon on Saturday, I handed that title back to my friend, Senator \nLott. Today, in the spirit of bipartisanship, I want to tell Senator \nLott that, if he ever needs to take a day off--for whatever reason--\nI'll be happy to pinch hit for him.\n  I learned a few things about the Senate these past two and a half \nweeks that I had not known before.\n  One of my favorite bits of new knowledge has to do with a former \nmember of this Senate, David Rice Atchison, of Missouri.\n  Senator Atchison was president pro tem of the Senate in 1849. Back \nthen, new Presidents were sworn in on March 4, not January 20.\n  But, in 1849, March 4 fell on a Sunday. And the new President-elect, \nZachary Taylor, didn't think it was appropriate to conduct official \nbusiness on the Sabbath. So he chose to wait until the next day to take \noath of office.\n  Back then, the President pro tem was third in the line of \npresidential succession, not fourth.\n  So, from noon on Sunday, March 4, when President Polk's term ended--\nuntil noon on Monday, March 5--when President Taylor was sworn in--\nSenator Atchison was President. Or so he and his friends claimed.\n  Today, we know that President Taylor automatically became President \nas soon as President Polk stepped down.\n  But for the rest of his life, Senator Atchison loved to say that he \nhad been ``President for a day''--and that his presidency was the \n``honest-est administration this country ever had.''\n  I do not know that Senate Democrats' brief time in the majority will \nmake as interesting an historical footnote as the Atchison presidency. \nBut I do believe the Senate accomplished some things during these last \n17 days that bode well for this Congress.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Lott for the fairness he showed \nin agreeing to a distribution of responsibility that accurately \nreflects the composition of this first-ever 50-50 Senate. I also thank \nmy fellow Democrats--particularly those who chaired committees.\n  On Saturday, after a week of fair and thorough hearings, we confirmed \nthe first seven of President Bush's cabinet officers.\n  On Saturday, too, we saw, once again, one of the great miracles of \nAmerican democracy: the peaceful transfer of power from one President \nto the next.\n  I was moved by much of what President Bush said in his inaugural \naddress, especially his conviction that there is no such thing as an \n``insignificant'' person. I also believe there is no such thing as an \ninsoluble problem. My colleagues and I are ready and willing to work \nwith President Bush and Vice President Cheney, and with our Republican \ncolleagues in Congress, to move America forward.\n  Tomorrow, we understand the President will send us his ideas on \neducation. We are anxious to see them. We will give them, and all of \nthe President's proposals, careful and respectful consideration. We \nwant to make this 50/50 Senate something to be proud of.\n  Today, we are introducing our first proposals--our first priorities--\nfor this Congress.\n  Many of them will sound familiar. That is because we have been \nworking to pass them for a good long while. They are things like: a \nreal, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights; a reliable, affordable \nMedicare prescription drug benefit; middle-class tax cuts, and help for \nour children's schools.\n\n  They all lead our list of priorities--for two reasons.\n  First, and most important, because the American people have made it \nclear, these are their top priorities. Second: Because bipartisan \nmajorities in Congress support them.\n  The challenges we address affect all Americans, but they effect rural \nAmericans in ways that are often different and more pressing. That is \nwhy I am also developing a separate package of bills called ``South \nDakota First.'' But it won't help just my State. Instead, it will help \npeople in small towns and rural communities throughout America.\n  As we move ahead, we cannot leave rural America behind.\n  Over the past several years, relations between our parties have \nbecome increasingly strained. By starting with the issues on which most \nof us do agree, we can strengthen our bonds of trust. And that will \nmake it easier for us to solve the next challenges.\n  Under President Clinton, we experienced the longest, strongest \neconomic expansion in our Nation's history. We went from the biggest \ndeficits ever, to the biggest surpluses ever.\n  The question now is: What should we do with that surplus?\n  One of our top priorities this year will be to deliver tax relief to \nhard-working families across the country.\n\n[[Page S76]]\n\n  The debate over how we structure that tax cut is likely to be the \nmost consequential debate we have all year.\n  Our ability to achieve a strong, bipartisan compromise on taxes will \nbe the biggest test of our 50-50 Senate.\n  I am confident we can pass that test.\n  We are willing to negotiate. At the same time, we are committed to \ntwo fundamental principles:\n  First: The bulk of the tax relief must go to middle-class working \nfamilies because they are the people who need tax relief most.\n  Second, any tax cut must be affordable and fiscally responsible.\n  The efforts we have made to restore fiscal discipline these last 8 \nyears have resulted in lower interest rates, record-high job creation, \nand record-low unemployment. We must protect those gains. We cannot \nsquander them by going back to the old days of deficit spending.\n  President Bush has indicated that he will be sending us his \nrecommendations for cutting taxes in late February. We look forward to \nworking with him, and with out Republican friends, to pass a fair, \nfiscally responsible tax cut this year.\n  Today, we are taking our first step. We are introducing a package of \ntargeted tax cuts to help working families at the key junctures in \ntheir lives.\n  Our tax cuts will help families pay for college; save for retirement; \ncare for disabled and elderly family members; and pay for long-term \ncare.\n  We want to eliminate the marriage-penalty tax and eliminate the \nestate tax on more than 99 percent of estates--to help keep small \nbusinesses and family farms in families.\n  We also want to expand the earned income tax credit for low-income \nworking parents so they do not have to raise their children in poverty.\n  And, we want to significantly expand child care tax credits for \nmiddle-class families; and extend them, for the first time, to stay-at-\nhome parents of infants.\n  Next, we must pass a real, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights this \nyear.\n  The Norwood-Dingell Patients' Bill of Rights passed the House more \nthan a year ago with strong bipartisan support.\n  In the Senate, it was supported by every Democrat, and four \nRepublicans.\n  The bill we offer today mirrors it.\n  It guarantees that you can go to an emergency room when you need to.\n  It gives women direct access to OB-GYNs.\n  It guarantees parents the right to choose a pediatrician for their \nchildren, and a pediatric specialist if they need one.\n  It guarantees people the right to see qualified specialists when \nnecessary, and to continue with the same doctor if they are pregnant or \nbeing treated for a serious illness.\n  It guarantees that you will get the medicines your doctor says you \nneed.\n  It prohibits HMOs and insurance companies from gagging doctors to \nprevent them from telling patients all of their treatment options.\n  It also prohibits them from providing doctors and hospitals with \nfinancial incentives for denying needed care.\n  Finally, our bill holds insurers accountable. It gives patients the \nright to appeal denials of care to an independent board.\n  If an insurer ignores the board, and its denial or delay of care \nresults in serious injury or death, our bill allows victims to seek \njustice in a State court.\n  Employers that provide health coverage cannot be sued under our plan \nunless they make the actual medical decisions that result in injury or \ndeath.\n  Every week we delay, 350,000 Americans are denied needed health \ncare--health care for which they have already paid. It is time for \nthose delays to end. It is time to pass a real Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Next, we propose an affordable, voluntary Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  We all know the terrible financial--and emotional--strain paying for \nprescription drugs places on many older Americans and their families. \nPrescription drugs are an essential part of modern medicine. They ought \nto be part of Medicare, too.\n  Our plan is universal. Every Medicare beneficiary is eligible, \nwhether they are in traditional Medicare or Medicare+Choice.\n  Our plan is voluntary. If you already have private prescription \ncoverage you like, you can keep it. It is up to you.\n  Our plan is affordable, and comprehensive. There is a $250 \ndeductible, no caps on benefits and no gaps in coverage. The most \nanyone would pay out-of-pocket is $4,000 a year.\n  It is absolutely wrong that seniors pay, on average, twice as much as \nHMOs and big insurance companies for the exact same medications.\n  By combining the purchasing power of 40 million Medicare recipients, \nour plan gives seniors real bargaining power--so they will not have to \npay the highest prices at the drugstore anymore.\n  We are not talking about Government-run medicine. Medicare will \ncontract with private companies to offer the prescription benefit. \nSeniors will be able to choose the company they like best, and they \nwill be guaranteed convenient access to local pharmacies, whether they \nlive in big cities or small rural communities.\n  Next: Someone once said that education is the soul of a generation as \nit passes from one generation to the next.\n  We need to work together to ensure the next generation of Americans \nlearns the skills and knowledge necessary to be good parents, good \nworkers, and good citizens.\n  The quality of our future will be determined by the quality of our \nschools. It is as simple as that.\n  We agree with President Bush: No child should be left behind. Every \nchild deserves the chance to go to a good public school.\n  The education bill we are introducing today gives more to local \nschools and asks more of schools.\n  It includes incentives for States to set higher standards for \neveryone--students, teachers, and administrators--because the stakes \nare higher. But it lets local communities decide the best way to meet \nthose standards.\n  Our plan gives parents more information about how their children's \nschools are performing--and more of a say in how those schools are run.\n  It also gives parents more choices about the public schools their \nchildren attend.\n  Our bill targets special attention and help to struggling schools. At \nthe same time, if a school cannot or will not fix its chronic problems, \nour plan contains real consequences. We will not allow children to be \ntrapped in chronically failing schools.\n  Much of what we are proposing won bipartisan support in Congress last \nyear.\n  Our bill reduces class sizes by keeping our commitment to help \ncommunities hire 100,000 qualified new teachers.\n  It helps communities recruit good new teachers and principals, and it \nensures that teachers, and principals, have the opportunity to update \ntheir skills and knowledge.\n  Our plan includes grants to help schools repair leaking roofs and \nburst pipes and other urgent safety hazards, and reduced-rate bonds \nthat will enable communities to cut the costs of new school \nconstruction by up to 50 percent.\n  It also includes assistance to make sure that all schools have up-to-\ndate technology and all teachers know how to use technology so all of \nour children are ready for the new economy.\n  In addition, we propose to expand Head Start, so more children can \nstart school ready to learn; and provide more and better child care, \nand before- and after-school programs, so children have a safe place to \ngo when parents are at work.\n  Our plan expands the Reading Excellence Act, to make sure every child \ncan read by the end of the third grade.\n  And it puts us on track to fund the Federal Government's full share \nfor IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, to help \nstudents with disabilities develop to their fullest potential.\n  In addition, our plan makes college more affordable for more families \nby increasing Pell grants and extending college tuition tax credits.\n  And it strengthens training and other lifelong learning programs so \nworkers can learn new skills and move into better-paying jobs.\n  In the long run, investing in education is the surest way to increase \na family's financial security. But, as someone once pointed out, people \ndon't eat in the long run. They eat every day.\n\n[[Page S77]]\n\n  It has been more than four years since the last time we raised the \nminimum wage. Inflation has since wiped out that entire increase. Too \nmany low-income parents who work full time don't earn enough to feed \ntheir families and pay for other basic necessities.\n  Two years ago, we introduced a bill to raise the minimum wage $1 an \nhour. This year, we are proposing a $1.50 an hour over 25 months--to \nmake up for Congress's inaction. We need to raise the minimum wage. \nThis year--no more delays.\n  We also need to close the wage gap between men and women. It has been \n38 years since President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act. And American \nwomen still earn only 77 cents for every dollar men earn for doing the \nsame work. This wage gap costs America's families $200 billion a year, \nmore than $4,000 for each working woman's family. It is time to close \nit once and for all by better enforcing the law, and giving victims of \nwage discrimination new options for fighting it.\n\n  We are also proposing new ways to help parents balance family and \nwork without sacrificing part of their income.\n  For instance, our bill expands the Family and Medical Leave Act to \ncover more work places, to fund workplace demonstration projects to \nprovide paid family leave, and allow parents to use the leave to attend \nparent-teacher conferences and other important school functions.\n  We also give States and communities more resources to develop more \nand better child care opportunities for working families.\n  One necessity that too many low-income working families try to get by \nwithout is health insurance. Two years ago, we created the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program to help low-income parents obtain health \ninsurance for their children.\n  Today, we are proposing to expand the CHIP program to include parents \nof eligible children, and to give States the option of expanding \ncoverage to 19- and 20-year olds, and to legal immigrant women and \nchildren.\n  These are important first steps. But we will be offering additional \nideas in coming months to make sure more Americans have access to good, \naffordable health coverage.\n  We also intend to offer ideas for strengthening our Nation's \nunemployment insurance system. We expect those proposals to look much \nlike the reforms suggested last year by a blue ribbon commission made \nup of business, workers and Government representatives.\n  It is not just low-income families; nearly every American family \nrelies on Social Security and Medicare for economic security.\n  We have a responsibility to make sure Social Security and Medicare \nare always there not just for the current generation of retirees, but \nfor every generation.\n  When Bill Clinton was first elected President, Medicare was expected \nto run out of money in 1999. But we didn't let that happen. Instead, we \nextended the life of the Medicare trust fund to 2025. And we improved \nMedicare coverage by adding important new preventive benefits. We also \nextended the solvency of the Social Security trust fund to 2034. This \nyear, we are proposing to further protect both programs by taking both \nMedicare and Social Security off budget; putting the surpluses from \nboth programs in a real lockbox, and making it harder to use the money \nin the lockbox for anything other than Social Security or Medicare.\n  This administration, and this Congress, must work together to \nmodernize Social Security and Medicare so they will be there for the \nbaby boomers and beyond. Locking away the surpluses now must be the \nfirst step.\n  People ought to be able to feel secure in their retirement. They also \nought to be able to feel safe and secure in their own homes and \ncommunities. In the last several years, we have seen major crime go \ndown in almost all categories. We need to keep those trends moving in \nthe right direction.\n  We know community policing works. We are proposing to help \ncommunities hire more community police and prosecutors as a result of \nthat knowledge.\n  We also know that kids and convicted criminals have no business \npossessing guns. So we are proposing to extend Project Exile and other \nsuccessful efforts to reduce gun violence.\n  We are also proposing to pass the Juvenile Brady bill to make sure \nthat juveniles who commit serious drug or violent crimes are not \nallowed to possess guns ever, and close the gun show loophole--once and \nfor all.\n  We want to strengthen the Violence Against Women Act, including \nincreased support for shelters. We want tougher punishments for \ncriminals who prey on seniors. We want to expand drug courts and drug \ntreatment. We want to expand delinquency prevention programs, so kids \nwho are at risk, or who have already had scrapes with the law, can turn \ntheir lives around.\n  In addition--and this is very important--we want to ensure that crime \nvictims are treated with fairness and respect. We are proposing that \ncrime victims be notified about court proceedings involving their case, \nand have an opportunity to have their opinions heard on these matters. \nThese things are just basic decency. They ought to be basic rights as \nwell.\n  There is another right every American deserves--the right to vote, \nand to have his or her vote count--that is a right that should never be \ncompromised. And we believe that there are times when it is \ncompromised. Then our entire system of Government is jeopardized.\n  We have just come through the most difficult Presidential elections \nin our lifetimes. We are seeing the peaceful transition of power to a \nnew administration. Now, we need to make sure we never see another \nelection like this last one.\n  We are proposing that Congress create a blue ribbon commission on \nelection reforms. Do all Americans have equal access to vote? If not, \nwhat should the Federal Government do to help? We need to hear from \nexperts on these and other matters.\n  We are also proposing a grant program to help states and communities \nupdate antiquated voting equipment. No American should be forced to \novercome unreasonable obstacles to vote. In my mind, that is doubly \ntrue for members of our armed services.\n\n  So, as part of our election reform package, we want to make it \nabsolutely clear that military personnel retain their rights to vote at \nhome--even when they are stationed abroad. This is not a change. This \nis the law now. We need to make sure everybody knows it.\n  Also, before the next election, we must pass real campaign finance \nreform. The average winning Senator spent $6.4 million in the last \nelection, 530 percent more than in 1980. In all, candidates and \npolitical parties spent more than $3 billion on Federal elections in \n2000. An additional $400 million was spent on ``issue ads'' to try to \ninfluence races.\n  More and more, special-interest money influences who runs for office, \nwho wins, and what they do and don't do once they get here. We can--and \nmust--change that.\n  We are offering a plan based on the bipartisan Shays-Meehan plan that \npassed the House last year and won 52 votes in the Senate. Our plan is \nfair. It does not place one party or another at an advantage. It treats \nincumbents and challengers in both parties fairly.\n  Most importantly, our plan is comprehensive. It bans unregulated \n``soft money'' to political parties--the biggest loophole in the \ncurrent system. It also prevents soft money from being rechanneled to \noutside groups for phony ``issue ads.''\n  We know Senators McCain and Feingold are also committed to passing \ncampaign finance reform. We look forward to working with them to pass a \nworkable, comprehensive plan this year.\n  For many Americans, these past 8 years have been a time of \nunprecedented prosperity. But that is not true for most rural \nAmericans.\n  There is a quiet depression in many rural communities in South Dakota \nand throughout our Nation. Many small producers are being forced to \nsell farms and ranches that have been in their families for \ngenerations. Others are barely holding on.\n  As small farms disappear, so do the small towns and businesses that \ndepend on them. Sixty-five percent of the counties in my State lost \npopulation last year.\n  Since 1996, farm income has dropped more than 20 percent. If you take \naway Government payments, it is down more\n\n[[Page S78]]\n\nthan 40 percent. It is expected to drop another 10 percent this year.\n  We don't need another year to know that the Freedom to Farm has not \nworked, and will not work. We must enact a new farm bill this year to \nrestore the agriculture safety net.\n  In addition, we must ensure fair competition for family farmers and \nranchers at home and abroad, by prohibiting agribusiness giants from \nparticipating in anti-competitive practices that harm family farmers \nand rural communities; and by making agriculture a top trading \npriority.\n  We must also continue to invest in ethanol. And we must strengthen \nAmerica's commitment to food safety.\n  Family farms don't just produce commodities. They produce \ncommunities. We can't afford to lose them.\n  Finally, we must take new steps to protect the basic civil rights of \nall Americans, because we agree with President Bush that civil rights \nenforcement is critical to assuring that all Americans have equal \naccess to schools, workplaces, and the courts.\n  We are proposing a modest and necessary increase in funding for the \nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission and other Federal agencies \ncharged with enforcing our nation's civil rights laws, and for the \nLegal Services Commission.\n  In addition, we seek to end racial and other types of unreasonable \nand unconstitutional ``profiling''--whenever and wherever it occurs.\n  As a first step toward that goal, we are directing the Attorney \nGeneral to analyze the investigatory practices of all Federal law \nenforcement agencies.\n  If there is evidence of Federal law enforcement agencies using \nracial, ethnic, or gender profiling, we want to find it.\n  We want to know what should be done about it.\n  We need to know.\n  Beyond that, we propose to expand Federal hate crime laws to include \ngender, sexual orientation and disability and provide greater \nprotections against crimes motivated by racial or religious bias.\n  Our bill also prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of \nsexual orientation.\n  Last year, 57 Senators, including 13 Republicans, voted for our hate \ncrimes bill. In the House, 232 members, 41 of them Republican, voted \nfor it.\n  Some people think of it as ``the Matthew Shephard bill'' or ``the \nJames Byrd'' bill. We think of it as a matter of basic civil rights.\n  Finally, in addition to preventing people from using old stereotypes \nas a basis for discrimination, we must also prevent people from using \nnew technologies to discriminate.\n  Our bill prohibits both employers and health insurers from using \ngenetic test results as a basis for discrimination.\n  It also prevents disclosure of genetic information to health \ninsurers, data banks, employers, and anyone else who has no legitimate \nneed for the information.\n  We need to make sure that the new knowledge scientists are learning \nthrough the Human Genome Project--research funded largely by American \ntaxpayers--is used to help America's families, not hurt them.\n  In closing, Mr. President, 169 years ago this month the French \npolitical and social observer, Alexis De Toqueville, visited the Senate \nin session.\n  Afterward, he wrote that the 1832 Senate was ``composed of eloquent \nadvocates, distinguished generals, wise magistrates, and statesmen of \nnote, whose arguments would do honor to the most remarkable \nparliamentary debates of Europe.''\n  Honorable debate and compromise has been in rather short supply in \nthe Senate these last few years. Its absence has prevented us from \ndoing many things we ought to do.\n  The power has been transferred now to a new Congress, and a new \nAdministration.\n  Let's use that power to move America forward, together.\n  Like ``President-for-a-day'' David Rice Atchison we are already \nassured a footnote in the history books simply by being members of the \nfirst 50/50 Senate.\n  As we begin the work of this Congress, let us resolve that we will be \nmore than a footnote. Let us agree that we will work together to write \na new chapter of progress for the American people.\n  I thank my fellow Democratic Senators--as well as some of our \nRepublican friends--for helping to shape our first leadership bills of \nthe 107th Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I applaud and commend our leader for his \nbrilliant statement. I acknowledge that the things that we do on a \nnational level have direct impact on our States. I appreciate very much \nthe Senator from South Dakota talking about the need to take care of \nthe rural America.\n  Ninety percent of the people in Nevada live in the Las Vegas and Reno \nmetropolitan areas, but rural Nevada is in real need of help. I \nappreciate his directing our attention to the needs of rural Nevada.\n  His comments about taxes also are so important. I remind all of my \nfriends in the Chamber and those within the sound of my voice, these \nare not election conversion statements. We badly wanted to do tax \nmeasures last year. We tried very hard to get rid of all 64 provisions \nof the marriage penalty. We were unable to vote on that. We hope that \nsomething can be done this year to take care of penalties that married \ncouples have in America. Also we were willing to do something dealing \nwith the inheritances taxes. Again, we were unable to vote on our \nversion, which I think clearly would have passed.\n  On health care issues our leader talked about a prescription drug \nbenefit, a Patients' Bill of Rights--these matters we also could have \ntaken care of last year.\n  Today there is a new spirit of bipartisanship in this body. I am \nconfident, with the leadership of the Senator from Iowa on the Finance \nCommittee, that we will be able to do a lot of the things we were \nunable to do last year. I have worked with the Senator from Iowa on a \nnumber of issues over the years. He is a reasonable man.\n  We now have the Senate divided 50/50, and it is time that we join \ntogether and did something regarding taxes. It is time we did something \non health care other than just talk about it.\n  In addition, the issues the Senator from South Dakota spoke about on \neducation are important for the people of South Dakota, the people of \nNevada and everyone in the country. When we pass some of these bills \nthat appear to be national in scope, our individual States benefit \ngreatly.\n  With regards to school construction, the State of Nevada needs it \nbadly. In Las Vegas, we have the sixth largest school district in \nAmerica. We have to build one school every month to keep up with the \ngrowth there. We need help. This legislation which our leader spoke of \nwould give us that help.\n  On issues dealing with individual worker rights, the minimum wage \nissue is really important. It is important for all kinds of reasons, \nnot the least of which is 60 percent of the people who work for minimum \nwage are women; for 40 percent of those women, that is the only money \nthey get for them and their families. It is important that we bring \nthis up today. Equal pay is also important. We have women who are \nworking very hard. They work just as hard as men. They are entitled to \n100 percent of what men make for doing the same kind of work. This \nlegislation is way past due.\n  What we have done these last 8 years dealing with crime has been \neffective. Violent crime in America is down? Why? I believe one of the \nprincipal reasons is because of what we have done with providing more \npolice officers. The 100,000 new police officers in Nevada and the rest \nof the country has made a tremendous impact.\n  We on this side of the aisle seem to talk a lot about the need to do \nsomething about gun safety. We do that with every thought in mind that \nour legislation has no impact upon the sportsmen of America, no impact \nupon law enforcement officers of America, and no impact upon those \npeople who shoot for recreation purposes. We believe the loopholes need \nto be closed--that is, dealing with pawnshops, dealing with gun shows--\nwe need to close these. That is what we are talking about.\n  Finally, what the Democratic leader said regarding campaign finance \nis so important. I am reminded that 2 years ago, in the race for the \nSenate, Senator\n\n[[Page S79]]\n\nEnsign and Senator Reid spent $20 million in the State of Nevada. I am \nnot making a misstatement. The State of Nevada has about a million and \na half people. We spent $20 million. That is really too much money. \nThat doesn't take into consideration the independent expenditures \ninvolved.\n  So with John McCain on the floor of the Senate now, I throw bouquets \nto John McCain for the leadership he has shown. He has not backed down, \nand I appreciate that.\n  I also see present my friend, the Senator from Wisconsin, Russ \nFeingold. He has been a leader. I have admired the work he has done \nwith Senator McCain. I have said it privately, but I say it publicly \nhow much I appreciate the work he has done. He has truly been a leader \nof this country with his partner Senator McCain. I am glad my friend, \nthe Democratic leader, talked about campaign finance.\n  We want to work together. The Senate is divided 50/50. There is no \nreason in the world we can't pass legislation. When we pass \nlegislation, there is credit to go around. There is credit to go to \nRepublicans and credit to go to the Democrats. There is credit to go to \nthe President. We can all walk out of here recognizing we have done \nsomething for the common good. I hope we can do that.\n  The last 2 years have not been constructive or good. I hope we can \nreflect in the future on the good work we have done for our States and \nour country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/22/senate-section/article/S79-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S79]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

The Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/22/senate-section/article/S79-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S79-S80]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FAREWELL TO A TRUE PUBLIC SERVANT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I address the Senate because of a very \ntrusted and longtime staffer of mine, Kris Kolesnik, who is leaving my \nstaff to work in the private sector and to continue some very good \nwork. He served the taxpayers effectively for 18 years and has moved to \nthe private sector, where I think he will not only do the work of the \nassociation with which he works, but he is also going to be working to \nsave the taxpayers money, which is something he did very well for me \nduring that 18-year period of time.\n  Kris started in January of 1982. He began as a budget analyst working \nfor me on the Budget Committee. That year, I proposed what would become \nthe first of several yearly across-the-board budget freezes of the \nFederal budget. Kris worked on those proposals for me.\n  Among my Republican colleagues, the freeze proved popular because it \nwould make a big impact on slowing down the Federal deficits which, at \nthat time, were about $100 billion as far as the eye could see.\n  The only problem was, Republicans wanted to exempt defense spending \nfrom that freeze. All other programs were appropriate to freeze, they \nsaid, and at that time the defense budget under President Reagan was \nincreasing by double digits even after inflation was calculated. My \nreaction was that even if one program--even the defense program--were \nexempt, that would defeat the purpose of an across-the-board freeze \nwhich had the purpose of fairness and shared sacrifice.\n  Today, after 4 years of paying down the national debt, we might \nforget that maybe a freeze was not something that did much in \nparticular. But if you looked at that particular time, we were in the \nmiddle of what was going to be 28 years of unbalanced Federal budgets \nbefore we finally got our house in order. An across-the-board freeze \nmight not have seemed like much, but it was really revolutionary for \nthat particular time. So that year I didn't receive much support among \nmy Republican colleagues on this freeze. They all said the defense \nbudget could not be frozen and that even one penny would cause our \ndefense plan to fall apart.\n  At the end of the year, I asked Kris Kolesnik to spend the winter \ndetermining whether a case could be made for freezing the defense \nbudget while not harming national security. If it could not, then I \nneeded to know because I would have to abandon my attempts to freeze \nacross the board. When I returned to the Senate in January of 1983, I \nasked Kris what progress had been made during that 3-week interim. He \nsaid he had discussions with advocates on both sides of the issue and \nhe determined that those in favor of a defense freeze were more \npersuasive.\n  Those against a freeze seemed to rely on an argument of ``just trust \nus.'' As a first step in unraveling the truth of the defense budget, \nKris suggested that I call up then-Secretary of Defense Cap Weinberger \nand ask to speak to a relatively obscure Pentagon budget analyst by the \nname of Franklin Chuck Spinney. The rumor was that Chuck Spinney had an \nexplosive new report that showed the defense budget was bloated with \nnew programs which far exceeded the already huge projected costs. \nFitting all those programs and their costs within even President \nReagan's growing defense budget would eventually mean skyrocketing \ncosts, plummeting defense capability, or perhaps both. Only a freeze in \ndefense spending, coupled with management reforms, could save the \ndefense plan from imploding.\n\n  Kris predicted Pentagon officials would not let me talk to Chuck \nSpinney.\n  So, I picked up the phone right away and called Cap Weinberger. It \nwas a Thursday evening. He told me there was no problem, that I could \nhave Spinney come over to my office the following Monday at 2 p.m. I \nleft that night for Iowa, expecting a full briefing by Spinney in 4 \ndays.\n  Beginning Friday, however, Kris began to get phone calls from the \nPentagon saying that Spinney would not be available to brief me, that \nthey would send someone named Dr. Chu instead. It turned out that Dr. \nDavid Chu was Spinney's boss, and a political appointee.\n  My reaction was, it's okay to send Dr. Chu, but I want Spinney there \nas well. It didn't happen. I had an inkling that I had to go see Chuck \nSpinney in his office if I wanted to talk to him. I told Kris to go \nwarm up my orange Chevette, that we were going to the Pentagon to find \nout why Cap Weinberger had reneged on his promise to me.\n  It's not every day that a United States Senator shows up at the \nPentagon unannounced and in a disturbed mood. Cap Weinberger was at the \nWhite House, and Dr. Chu was called to persuade me that Spinney's \nbriefing was just a bunch of chicken scratches on pieces of paper. My \nsuspicions were really heightened. We left the Pentagon unsatisfied but \nresolved. My last words to Dr. Chu were, one way or another, I will get \nthat briefing.\n  When I got back to my office, I got a phone call from Cap Weinberger. \nIt is hard to remember 18 years later just exactly what that \nconversation was, but it was something to the effect that if we \nRepublicans could not trust the civil servants that we ought to listen \nto the political appointees of the Reagan administration; that it might \nbe good in some instances--but it didn't satisfy me--that Chuck Spinney \nwas a civil servant; that he was somebody to whom I should listen.\n  Six weeks later, Mr. Spinney appeared before a joint hearing of the \nSenate Budget and Armed Services Committees in the ornate Russell \nCaucus Room, with a dozen TV cameras, a room full of reporters, and \nstanding room only for the public. Instead of a briefing in the privacy \nof my office, Spinney briefed the entire country maybe for the good of \nthe country. That was on a Friday afternoon. On Monday, he was on the \ncover of TIME magazine. Kris and his underground allies had \norchestrated the whole thing.\n\n[[Page S80]]\n\n  That episode marked the beginning of the end for the Reagan defense \nbudget buildup. In just two short years, in large part due to Kris' \nleadership as a staffer, the defense budget was frozen, and remained so \nuntil 2 years ago--a span of 14 years.\n  We had a vote. It was 50-49 on the floor of the Senate when we \nadopted that as part of the budget of 1985.\n  During those 2 years, Kris helped uncover the infamous over-priced \nspare parts, such as a $500 hammer and a $7,600 coffee maker purchased \nby the military. He did so by working with whistleblowers throughout \nthe defense community, such as Ernie Fitzgerald, Tom Amlie, Colin \nParfitt, and many others. Their work exposed tens of billions of \ndollars of waste and mismanagement of the taxpayers' defense dollars.\n  Through the inspector general community, Kris discovered that the \nJustice Department rarely prosecuted defense contractors. By 1986, \neight out of the top ten defense contractors were under criminal \nindictment or criminal investigation for contract fraud. In that year, \nhe was named in Esquire magazine as one of the top eight staffers in \nWashington to watch.\n  In the late 1980's and early 1990's Kris investigated the POW/MIA \nissue. His work, which uncovered many unanswered questions about \nmissing soldiers from the Vietnam War, went toward establishing a \nSenate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs. I was a member of that \nCommittee, and Kris staffed it for me. The Committee was able to find \nanswers for many of the families who, up until then, had none. And \nmillions of pages of POW/MIA records were declassified for the public \nto see.\n  In 1995, after Republicans took control of the Congress, House and \nSenate Republican leaders asked Kris and a small group of staffers to \nshare their oversight skills with the new majority staff. Having \nperformed oversight over the Defense and Justice Departments for a \ndozen years, Kris with his colleagues, now began to apply their \noversight experience to the rest of the federal government. The result \nhas been increased and systematic oversight by Congress across the \nboard.\n  During that time, Kris focused on overseeing the FBI. Such systematic \noversight of the FBI, on a committee that has always been reluctant to \ninvestigate the bureau, has not been successfully done in recent times \nin the Senate. Because of Kris' staff work, much has been done to help \nrestore the public's confidence in federal law enforcement.\n  Among the celebrated cases Kris investigated or helped investigate \nwere: the FBI crime lab scandal; the FBI's poor investigation of the \nTWA Flight 800 crash; the incidents at Waco and Ruby Ridge; Chinese \nespionage cases, including the FBI's botched case against Wen Ho Lee; \nand the campaign finance scandals of the 1996 election.\n  Kris's legacies will be the tens of billions of dollars he helped to \nsave the taxpayers through his work, as well as his work on behalf of \nwhistleblowers. After all, without the whistleblowers, there would be \nno savings. He depended on them, from the staff level, for information. \nAnd so he fiercely defended their right, through legislation he helped \ndraft on my behalf, to share information with Congress. He assisted in \nthe drafting and/or passing of major whistleblower statutes including: \nthe False Claims Act Amendments of 1986; the Whistleblower Protection \nAct; and, the yearly-passed anti-gag appropriations rider for federal \nemployees.\n  Appropriately, Kris is leaving Capitol Hill to become the executive \ndirector of the National Whistleblower Center, an organization that \nsupports and protects whistleblowers throughout government. There, he \ncan continue his work on behalf of the taxpayers, and fighting for \nthose who dare to speak the truth and risk their jobs.\n  The taxpayers will indeed be missing a trusted ally with Kris's \ndeparture. But the impact of his accomplishments will be with us a long \ntime. He'll still work to save the taxpayers money, but he won't be on \nthe public payroll. That's the principled crusader he is!\n  One additional thought that just came to my mind as I was going \nthrough what I prepared today about Kris: Going back to the budget \nfreeze of 1980 and the fact that the spending on defense needed to be \nramped up, it was ramped up to fast. There was a lot of money wasted.\n  We are going to spend money on defense because we have to. But we \nought to learn from the lessons of the 1980's, and hopefully our new \nPresident, President Bush, will move fairly slowly in that area so that \nthe money will be invested wisely and spent wisely and so we don't have \na situation such as we had in 1982 where one assistant Defense \nDepartment secretary said we put the money bags on the steps of the \nPentagon and said come and get it. We want to keep our hands on those \nmoney bags that we set before the Pentagon as we spend money on \ndefense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is a good day to begin a new session. \nIt is a good day to begin, of course, the new year with many challenges \nbefore Members. I think all Members have enjoyed the last several days \nwith many folks visiting from home, particularly from Wyoming, because \nof the new Vice President. We had a great turnout. We were very pleased \nand are all very proud of our new Vice President.\n  We have a great deal to do, as is always the case. I think \nparticularly this year we are faced with seeking to accomplish many \nthings. We talked about many of them last year but did not in every \ncase succeed in getting them finished, so we are back at it again. \nHopefully, we will see some new directions; we will see some new \ndirections from the White House certainly. I was pleased with the \nPresident's talk on Inauguration Day and his defining the goals that he \nhas set forth. Certainly during the next couple of weeks we will see a \ngreat deal more defining of that. Our first obligation, obviously, is \nto finish the nominations so this administration can be in place.\n  We will see some new directions, and hopefully they will be the kinds \nof things upon which we can agree. I believe we will see more emphasis \nin the private sector, trying to encourage and cause things to happen \nthat need to be done for the country in terms of individuals doing \nthem, in terms of local governments doing them, as well as the \ncontribution of the Federal Government.\n  I think we will be inclined to move toward reduction in taxes. I \ncertainly hope so. We have the highest tax rates now being paid of \nanytime since World War II. This is a time, of course, when there are \nlots of things we need to do. One of them is paying off the debt; \nanother is certainly to be able to fund and finance those things that \nwe want to strengthen, such as education, such as health care.\n  On the other hand, the fact that we have a very healthy economy which \nhas produced a surplus doesn't mean we necessarily need to grow the \nrole of the Federal Government. On the contrary, I think each time we \ndo something in the Federal Government, we ought to analyze the extent \nto which we are able to do that at the State or local level, or that it \nis more efficient to do it here simply because we have more money.\n  That does not mean we need to increase the role of government. We \nwill allow States and local governments to have more of a role in the \ndecisionmaking process. We have talked about it already in education, \ncertainly strength in education. We will look for more flexibility so \nlocal schools can use the dollars as they need them. There is a great \ndeal of difference, often, in the needs between Wheatland, WY, and \nPhiladelphia. We should have the flexibility to use those dollars \nlocally as is appropriate.\n  We will certainly be seeking to balance resource development. I live \nin a State that is 50 percent owned by the\n\n[[Page S81]]\n\nFederal Government. We are very heavy in resources--oil, gas, coal. We \nare the largest producer of coal in the United States. We need to be \nable to increase our efforts in the area of energy, at the same time \nprotecting the environment. We can do that. We have to increase the \nopportunity for access to things such as Yellowstone Park and at the \nsame time keep the principle of the parks there, to protect the \nresource. We can do those things with some more flexibility, I believe.\n  Obviously, we need to strengthen the military. We have had a time, a \npeaceful time, with a tendency to not emphasize the military as much as \nI think we should. Our best opportunity for peace in the future is to \nhave a strong military and to keep it that way, to have national \npreparedness. Certainly we need to do that.\n\n  We need more emphasis on opportunity for everyone to do well in this \ncountry. Opportunity is what we need to seek.\n  We need to strengthen the economy. Hopefully in some of our tax \nactivities we can leave more dollars in the private sector, to be \ninvested to create jobs. These are the things I think will be paramount \nfor us.\n  Will there be differences in view? Of course. I hope we have moved to \na situation where we will be less partisan in our approaches, where we \nrecognize there finally has to be a solution. But will we agree on \neverything? Of course not. We have different ideas. We represent \ndifferent areas of the country. But in large we represent the United \nStates and we need to understand that there are things we need to \naccomplish.\n  I think there will be agreement on general topics such as education, \nhealth care, and military. At the same time, of course, there will be \ndisagreements on the details of how those things are implemented--but \nthat is OK. That is the system. We all have different views. We all \nhave different reasons to be putting forward our views. They are \nlegitimate. And the system does work.\n  I suspect we will certainly be looking at education, we will be \nlooking at strengthening the military, we will be looking at Social \nSecurity to ensure young people paying into their first job will have \nthe opportunity to reap benefits 40 years from now. I think that is our \nobligation.\n  Energy has been a problem for some time, but it was not recognized, \nof course, until we started having blackouts in California and started \nhaving increases in gasoline and natural gas prices. Now, it is a \nproblem that more people recognize as a problem.\n  I hope in our tax relief efforts we also have some tax simplification \nso we do not have to go through all these things with every little tax \nreduction being oriented at affecting behavior. That really is not the \npurpose of taxes. Taxes are to raise the amount of revenues necessary \nto conduct the Government, not necessarily to direct everyone's \nbehavior.\n  Education is a legitimate concern. The first responsibility, of \ncourse, for education is that of the States and local governments. We \nwant to keep it that way. The Federal Government's contribution is \nabout 7 percent of the total expenditures. So we need to assist and to \nmake sure there are opportunities available for all children \neverywhere, but we need to have local control and we need to have \nflexibility. And, of course, we need accountability, not only for the \nFederal Government's contribution but to all taxpayers to ensure those \ndollars are being used to produce the kind of product each of us wants.\n  Sometimes we find ourselves with an excessive amount of paperwork. I \nhear about it quite often since my wife is a special education teacher \nand spends a good deal of her time on paperwork, which detracts a \nlittle from her other work.\n  I believe a powerful military is our best hope for the future. We \nneed modern equipment. We also need to reorganize the military. As \ntimes change, things are different than they were 50 years ago. Of \ncourse when you have no draft in place, it is voluntarily, we need to \nmake it attractive, not only for people to come but hopefully for \npeople to stay. What we have now is people come to the military, they \nare trained to fly airplanes or be mechanics or whatever but then leave \nto go to more attractive places in the private sector. We will need to \ngo to that. I think one of the alternatives is to allow young people to \nhave individual accounts that can be invested in the private sector to \ncreate a much higher return to ensure there will be benefits. I \nunderstand that is not something everybody agrees to. Certainly we all \nagree we should be setting aside those dollars that come in for Social \nSecurity for Social Security and not spend them on other things. So I \nam sure we can do a great deal there.\n  In energy, we have gone a long time without a real energy policy, a \npolicy that will direct where the resources go, how we encourage \nproduction of domestic resources and not allow ourselves to become a \ntotal captive of OPEC and foreign nations. That is not only oil and \ngas, but we have various ways of producing energy, of course, hydro, \nwind, and nuclear--things that can be used. With a policy of that kind, \ncertainly we can do some things.\n  We are also now looking at some short-term problems. California has a \nreal problem. Regardless of how they got there, they have one, and \nthere is some peeling off of that in other places. So hopefully we will \nhave a longer term policy in addition to that and certainly be able to \ndo something on the short term.\n  So I think we have a great opportunity as always to serve this \ncountry. That is why we are here. I hope we can agree upon the role of \nthe Federal Government and how we strengthen that and how we finance \nthat and how we will be able to leave people's money in their hands. \nHow we do that will turn a lot on how we work together here and work \nwith the administration during these next at least 2 years.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Democrats have introduced some of our \nlegislation. George W. Bush is now President Bush. His administration \nis coming in. We will have votes on nominees.\n  I think the important word here is civility. I also point out--not \nthat I am opposed to civility--I think when people in the country--in \nMinnesota, Nebraska, and around the Nation--say they want us to be \nbipartisan, what they are not saying is, we don't want any debate. \nPeople expect debate on issues and they expect us to have differences \nthat make a difference, especially in their lives.\n  But I think what people are saying is two things: No. 1, we want to \nhave civility, we want to see civility; and the second thing that \npeople are saying is we want you to govern at the center. But, \ncolleagues, they are not talking about the center that I think pundits \nin D.C. talk about, or too many of us talk about. I think what people \nare talking about is not the usual labels but, rather, we want you, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to govern at the center of our lives. That \nis what people are talking about, the center of their lives.\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\n  So if, in fact, we have legislation on the floor and have amendments \nand debate about amendments that deal with making sure people are able \nto have a standard of living where they can support their families and \ngive their children the care they need and deserve, we are governing at \nthe center of their lives. If we are talking about legislation that \nprovides more resources to enable States and school districts to do a \nbetter job of providing the best education for all the children in this \ncountry, we are governing at the center of people's lives.\n  If we are going to speak, as the President did with considerable \neloquence, about leaving no child behind, let us make sure this is not \nsymbolic politics. This cannot be done on a tin cup budget. If we want \nto leave no child behind, the best thing we can do is make a real \ninvestment in early childhood development so these children, when they \ncome to kindergarten, are ready to learn. They are not already way \nbehind.\n  If we are going to talk about governing at the center of people's \nlives then we are going to have to talk about the health insecurity \nthat so many Americans experience. I am not talking just about elderly \npeople who cannot pay prescription drug bills. I am also talking about \npeople toward the end of their lives who are worried they are going to \ngo to a nursing home and then lose everything before they get any help.\n  What about how people can stay at home and live in dignity as long as \npossible? I am talking about, not just the 42, 43, 44 million people \nwho have no health insurance at all, but the people who are \nunderinsured. I am talking about people who are paying more in copays \nand deductibles than they can afford to pay. I am also speaking about \nthe people who right now have plans but plans that do not provide \nanywhere near as good coverage as we have.\n  It would seem to me that what is good enough for Senators and \nRepresentatives should be good enough for the people we represent. If \nwe are going to talk about jobs and decent wages, economic development \nand economic growth--which is critically important, whatever ways we \ncan contribute to that--and education and affordable child care and \naffordable health care, then we are governing at the center of people's \nlives and I think there can be real bipartisanship.\n  But I also want to point out I don't see how we do it with a $1.3 \ntrillion tax cut over the next 10 years. I don't see how we do it if \nthat tax cut is all the way at the level of $1.3 trillion. I certainly \ndo not see how we do it if it is too targeted to people at the top of \nthe income ladder. I ask my colleagues this question: How can we give \nall the speeches and talk about the children and talk about education \nand talk about health care and talk about veterans and talk about our \ncommitment to all these issues and all these people and at the same \ntime have no revenue? You cannot do both.\n  Let's have some balance here. Let's have some tax cuts that are \ntargeted at middle-income working families and let's also not rob \nourselves of the capacity to make the investments in the very areas we \nsay we care so much about.\n  I also say to colleagues that I think Speaker Gingrich found this \nout: Don't assume there can be an assault on basic environmental \nprotections and protections at the workplace, health and safety \nprotections, and that will go without a fight. There will be a real \nfight on those issues. I hope we can find middle ground, but I do not \nbelieve it is a agenda that speaks to the center of people's lives \nbecause the vast majority of people in our country believe we are all \nstrangers and guests on this land and we should make the environment \nbetter; we should leave it better.\n  I also believe we will have a healthy debate--again with civility--\nover the question of whether or not there is such a thing as a workable \nstar wars, a workable missile defense which ultimately could cost \nhundreds of billions of dollars. This was, at first glance, a good \nidea, starting in the late 1950s. But every time we look at it and \nrealize the ways offensive weaponry overwhelms defensive weaponry, and \nwe consider the danger of chemical and biological warfare being brought \nin by suitcases, there is no evidence this is technologically feasible, \nmuch less the way this puts the arms control regime in jeopardy.\n  So I say to my colleagues on the first day: I look forward to the \ndebate. I look forward to passionate politics. I look forward to \npolitics focused on peoples' lives. I look forward to civil debate, \ncivil politics. I think we can have that. But I believe so much has \nchanged in the country, so much is at stake, the Senate is 50-50--we \ncan agree on some important legislation that will help people. Let's \nmove forward. Then when we do not agree, there will be major, major \ndebate on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  For my part, I look forward to working with my Republican colleagues \nwhenever we can and wherever we can and to be honest. With a twinkle in \nmy eye, I just as much look forward to the debate and disagreement. As \na Senator from Minnesota, I am in profound disagreement with the \ndirection on some things I think the President is going to go forward \nwith. But that is what the Senate is all about, to have debate, to do \nyour best for people, and I look forward to the Senate functioning at \nits very best. I hope we can make amendments on the floor to \nlegislation that should not be closed off again. We can start early in \nthe morning, work late at night, we can do the work and then I think \nthe Senate will be at its best as a institution and give all of us a \nchance to be good Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to call my colleagues' \nattention to the brave and persistent efforts of the Association of the \nFamilies of the Detained and Disappeared on behalf of human rights in \nColombia.\n  One of the most pressing human rights emergencies in our hemisphere \nhas been taking place in Colombia, where the government, paramilitary \ngroups, and guerrillas remain locked in fierce struggles. Thousands of \ninnocent civilians have been caught in the crossfire, and human rights \nabuses have been rampant. Throughout Colombia, members of ASFADDES have \nresponded to this crisis by seeking justice for their relatives who \nhave been killed or disappeared.\n  Members of ASFADDES ask that cases of forced disappearances be \nproperly investigated and prosecuted. They have worked for the last \ntwelve years to make forced disappearances an official crime in \nColombia, and a law was finally passed last year to do so, because of \ntheir work and dedication.\n  Because of their calls for justice, members of ASFADDES are at \ntremendous personal risk. Since 1993, their members have received \nnumerous threats. According to ASFADDES, members have been harassed, \nand have been the subject of intelligence-gathering by Colombian police \nand military personnel.\n  The members are under particular threat, because they are one of the \nfew organizations to bring cases against members of Colombia's security \nforces at the local, national, and international levels--including the \nInteramerican Commission on Human Rights--often raising the issue of \ncollusion between Colombia's security forces and the paramilitary. \nASFADDES is the only nation-wide organization in Colombia that \nrepresents families of human rights victims. Attacks are carried out \nagainst the staff of the organization and against the family members \nwho seek the organization's help.\n  Regrettably, serious acts of violence against members increased in \n2000.\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\nElizabeth Canas of Barrancabermeja chapter was murdered on July 11; one \nday after the forced disappearance law was passed. On October 6, two \nmembers of the Medellin chapter, Angel Quintero and Claudia Patricia \nMonsalve, were disappeared. Members of the Popayan and Bogota chapters \nwere harassed and followed, and escalating death threats were received \nby ASFADDES members throughout the country. The severity of the threats \nand attacks led the organization to temporarily close its offices last \nyear. Sadly, a systematic campaign of terror against the organization \nappears to be underway.\n  The Interamerican Commission on Human Rights has ordered the \nColombian government to provide special protective measures to ASFADDES \nmembers to ensure their safety. While certain measures have been taken \nby the government, ASFADDES asserts that they are not always carried \nout expeditiously. Moreover, the organization is extremely concerned \nthat the Colombian government has not taken adequate measures to \ninvestigate and prosecute the multiple cases of threats, harassment, \nmurder and disappearance directed against its members.\n  I commend the courageous members of ASFADDES, and all of the other \nmen and women in Colombia who have shown great bravery in risking their \ncareers, and their very lives, for the cause of human rights. I urge \nthe Colombian Government to ensure that ASFADDES members and offices \nreceive full protection, and to keep the organization informed about \nprogress on cases it raises. I also urge the government to ensure the \neffectiveness of the new commission established to search for \ndisappeared persons, under the new law against forced disappearances, \nand to prosecute such cases vigorously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/22/senate-section/article/S83-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S83-S85]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, WILLIAM S. COHEN\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, our Nation has been most pleased with the \nextraordinary leadership of Secretary William S. Cohen at the helm of \nour Armed Forces for the past 4 years. On January 17, 2001, the \nChairman and members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff honored Secretary \nCohen and his lady, the First Lady of our military, Janet Cohen, with a \nspectacular ceremony at Fort Myer. Although the ceremony was to \nofficially honor Secretary Cohen, it made all in attendance most \npleased that Mrs. Cohen, Janet, as she is known to men and women in the \nArmed Forces, was also honored. I believe it was the first time in \nhistory when our troops were officially reviewed by the Secretary and \nhis lady. Janet Cohen was most deserving of this high honor. As the \nremarks eloquently note, she was, indeed, the First Lady of the United \nStates Armed Forces.\n  The pomp and ceremony, the colors and the parade were memorable, but \nthe remarks made by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \nHenry S. Shelton, and the response by Secretary Cohen will be long \nremembered. I respectfully believe that these speeches are worthy of \nthe attention of my colleagues. Accordingly, I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the remarks by General Henry S. Shelton, Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, and the responding remarks of the Secretary of \nthe Department of Defense, the Honorable William S. Cohen, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks of General Henry H. Shelton, USA, at the Farewell Ceremony in \n                        Honor of Secretary Cohen\n\n       Secretary and Mrs. Cohen, Mr. Kevin Cohen, Members of the \n     Cabinet, Designated Members of the Cabinet, Members of the \n     Diplomatic Corps, Distinguished Members of Congress, Service \n     secretaries, Fellow members of the Joint Chiefs, Commanders-\n     In-Chief, Unified and Functional Commands, Distinguished \n     guests, Fellow members of the Armed Forces, Ladies and \n     Gentlemen:\n       Thanks to each of you for coming to this special event as \n     we, the members of the Armed Forces and the Department of \n     Defense, pause to honor and salute a truly great American \n     couple.\n       But first, let me, once again, thank the outstanding men \n     and women standing in front of you today and representing \n     hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines \n     and coastguardsmen. They are truly our Nation's treasure . . \n     . they serve with honor and courage . . . and they are \n     committed to keeping America strong and free.\n       Let's give them a hand!\n       We are all here this morning to honor and pay tribute to \n     Secretary and Mrs. Cohen. And while it is always difficult to \n     say farewell . . . the task is particularly difficult today \n     because the Secretary and Janet have served the department . \n     . . and indeed this Nation . . . with such distinction and so \n     unselfishly over the past 4 years.\n       Of course, Secretary Cohen's outstanding service to the \n     Nation encompasses much more than his tenure as Secretary of \n     Defense. For nearly a quarter century, first as a Congressman \n     and later as a Senator from the great State of Maine, he \n     served his constituents and, indeed, all Americans well . . . \n     as a skillful legislator and powerful advocate.\n       In the Senate, he was known as an influential voice on \n     defense and international security. He was admired for his \n     commitment to the principle that the security of our Nation \n     is not, and should never be, a partisan matter. His focus, \n     always, was on what was best for America and what was best \n     for the men and women of our Armed Forces.\n       All of us here today recognize it is a great honor to be \n     asked by the President to serve in the Cabinet . . . \n     especially if it's the first time in American history when an \n     elected official of the other party was selected to be a \n     senior member of the cabinet.\n       But, 25 years in this town as a dedicated public servant is \n     a long time . . . and Senator Cohen had certainly ``earned \n     his parole.'' Why then, you might ask, would this great \n     Senator from Maine want to voluntarily extend his sentence \n     and take on such a position?\n       Well, I don't presume to speak for the Secretary, nor can I \n     know for certain why he willingly accepted the enormous \n     demands that come with the 24 hour-a-day/7 days per week job \n     of Secretary of Defense . . . and the ``scrutiny''--I mean \n     ``help''--of his former colleagues on the Hill.\n       But, from almost daily observation for the last 3 years and \n     4 months, I know that the Secretary took the job out of a \n     deep love for our country . . . and an equally strong \n     devotion and respect for those who serve. And those of us in \n     the Armed Forces are fortunate that he did!\n       For the past four years, America has successfully navigated \n     the often dangerous waters of international security affairs \n     with Secretary Cohen at the helm. The department . . . and \n     indeed the Nation . . . have been well served having him in \n     charge during the many storms we have weathered over these \n     unpredictable years.\n       It was Joshua Chamberlain . . . another great leader from \n     the State of Maine . . . who once said that, in times of \n     great struggle, ``it is character that tells.'' Chamberlain \n     then defined character as a ``firm seasoned substance of soul \n     . . . [including] such qualities as intelligence, \n     thoughtfulness, conscientiousness, right-mindedness, \n     patience, fortitude, and unconquerable resolve.''\n       Those who know Secretary Cohen, know that he personifies \n     the qualities of character that Chamberlain, a fellow Bowdoin \n     College graduate, talked about over a century ago. And we \n     also understand that as a result we are a stronger, better \n     military today.\n       Throughout Secretary Cohen's tenure, America has operated \n     in and been successfully engaged in a dangerous and untidy \n     world. He has been a great coach . . . a ``players coach'' \n     who cared deeply for his soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \n     marines . . . and a visionary leader who executed a winning \n     game plan . . . a game plan we call our strategy of shape, \n     respond, and prepare:\n       The first piece of the strategy is shaping . . . and we \n     have shaped the international security environment in many \n     ways: From NATO enlargement, to the more recent and indeed \n     on-going negotiations on the EU-NATO relationship. From \n     Bosnia, to Kosovo and the indispensable role we have played, \n     along with our allies, in promoting peace. And, from the no-\n     fly zones, to the Persian Gulf, where U.S. forces have \n     ensured the free flow of oil and prevented Saddam Hussein \n     from threatening his people or neighbors.\n       The second element of our strategy is responding . . . and \n     we, along with our allies and friends, have responded to a \n     wide range of crises.\n       From the December 1998 air campaign to degrade Iraq's \n     ability to deliver WMD and threaten its neighbors, to the 78-\n     day air campaign that succeeded in reversing Slobodan \n     Milosevic's reign of terror in Kosovo.\n       From our presence during the turmoil in East Timor to the \n     evacuation of noncombatants from life-threatening civil \n     unrest in West Africa.\n       From providing humanitarian assistance in Central America, \n     to fighting raging forest fires in the Western U.S.\n       The third and final element of our strategy is preparing . \n     . . that is, getting ready now for the demands of the future. \n     Under Secretary Cohen's leadership we have seen the largest \n     increase in military spending in over a decade and \n     restructured the department to confront the emerging threats \n     of this new century. Under his leadership we pursued and \n     achieved--with the great support of Congress and the \n     administration--the largest increase in pay and benefits in a \n     generation . . . and recognized that quality of force, in \n     part, reflects the level of public support for the military. \n     We are attracting and retaining the best-qualified people for \n     our military, and making sure we provide them with the best \n     equipment and training.\n       In all these areas, and many others Mr. Secretary, our \n     successes have been due to\n\n[[Page S84]]\n\n     your outstanding leadership and vision. Of course, you have \n     been helped along the way by the fantastic team you built \n     within OSD . . . and, from one other very ``special \n     assistant'' as well. Indeed, over the past four years you \n     have had a great partner at your side. And so, today, we say \n     goodbye as well to your partner, the First Lady of the \n     Department . . . Janet Cohen.\n       Janet, on behalf of our men and women in uniform, let me \n     say a special thank you . . . for your tireless efforts to \n     improve the quality of life of our people in uniform and \n     their families. And for your efforts to help the Secretary \n     reconnect the military to the America we serve. Those of us \n     here today who have grown to know you well, will miss you \n     greatly. But, so too will the families of those who serve . . \n     . the very families that you have served so compassionately. \n     Finally, on a very personal note Mr. Secretary, let me thank \n     you for the tremendous opportunity to serve as your, and \n     President Clinton's, principal military advisor and to \n     represent our great soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \n     here in Washington--there can be no greater honor and for \n     that I am forever indebted to you.\n       You embody those attributes and values that the members of \n     our Armed Forces try to live by--you're a person of great \n     character . . . the ``character'' that Chamberlain eloquently \n     defined. You are a person of absolute integrity and of \n     tremendous vision. I have watched you work tirelessly on \n     behalf or our men and women in uniform, watched you travel \n     over 750,000 miles to foster peace and stability around the \n     globe with Allies, partners and friends and fight the tough \n     fights at home and abroad for what was best for America and \n     for America's Armed Forces. For that, we are all indebted to \n     you.\n       In closing . . . thank you, Mr. Secretary . . . and thank \n     you Janet . . . for all that you have done. We are a \n     stronger, better-prepared, and prouder military for your \n     efforts. The Nation has been truly blessed by your service. \n     All of us wish you and Janet life's best in all your future \n     endeavors. Thank You.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Remarks by Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen\n\n       General Shelton, thank you for your overly generous \n     remarks. Carolyn Shelton. When I recommended that Hugh \n     Shelton be selected as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I was \n     approached by a reporter who asked, ``What's our reaction to \n     him? How do you size him up?'' I answered, ``About 6'6\".'' \n     I'd say he's a combination of Randolph Scott, John Wayne, and \n     a little bit of Clint Eastwood. He's a man of few words, but \n     who's silence tells you all you really need to know about \n     him. You don't want to make his day.\n       One of the first things he did after his confirmation was \n     to give me and the other members of the Joint Chiefs a copy \n     of a book entitled Dereliction of Duty. He was sending a very \n     strong signal in passing out that book--he was saying that \n     under my watch I'm never going to tailor my judgment or \n     advice to fit a particular objective that I think is unwise. \n     It's a book that I keep very much at eye-level on my shelf, \n     Mr. Chairman.\n       The second thing you gave me was a fountain pen, and a note \n     that went with it. It was a statement from General William \n     Tecumseh Sherman to Grant. He said, ``I always knew that if I \n     was in trouble you'd come for me if alive.'' Mr. Chairman, I \n     always knew that if I were ever in trouble, that you would \n     always be there for me as you've been there for all of the \n     men and women who wear our uniform. You are a warrior and you \n     carry the warrior's code not on your sleeve, but in your \n     soul. I am deeply grateful that I had the chance to work \n     beside you and to have you as a principal advisor.\n       General Joe Ralston and Dede, I believe you're here, but if \n     you're not I will say a few words anyway. I want to thank you \n     for all that you have given to our country and what you \n     continue to give as commander of our forces in the European \n     theater, and as Supreme Allied Commander, Europe. You have \n     carried on the great work of your predecessors and the \n     tradition established by Generals George Joulwan and Wes \n     Clark, and you have been succeeded as Vice Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs by a truly able officer and friend, Dick Myers.\n       So I want to take this occasion to thank General Myers and \n     Mary Jo; and to thank General Mike Ryan Chief of Staff, U.S. \n     Air Force and Jane; to thank General Ric Shinseki Chief of \n     Staff, U.S. Army and Patty; to thank Jim Jones Commandant, \n     U.S. Marine Corps, a friend and companion for so many years \n     and Diane; and Admiral James Loy Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard \n     who played basketball against me so many years ago, and \n     unfortunately was the winner.\n       I am told that former Secretary of Defense Caspar \n     Weinberger may be in the audience. I want to say that I \n     enjoyed my friendship and service with you over the years. I \n     don't think anyone other than Mel Laird ever served longer as \n     Secretary of Defense than Cap Weinberger. You helped to \n     rebuild our military and our morale at a time when we \n     needed that boost, and I will never forget how you used to \n     come before a skeptical Congress with your two very sharp \n     pencils in your hand, ready to answer any question that we \n     had.\n       Secretary, Bill Perry, what an opportunity it was for me to \n     know you when I serve in the Senate and what an honor to \n     follow you as Secretary of Defense. You are known and you're \n     revered for your brilliance, your leadership and your quiet \n     strength, but you're also respected and loved for your \n     civility and your kindness. You, along with Cap, are regarded \n     as two of our finest public servants, and I am truly grateful \n     that you could be here to observe my farewell.\n       Deputy Secretary Rudy de Leon, when John Hamre left to take \n     over the presidency of CSIS, Center for Strategic \n     International Studies, I asked you to step into some very big \n     shoes, and you took up the challenge without hesitation. You \n     more than lived up to our high expectations. And no matter \n     how difficult the issue, you never lost your composure and \n     you never lost your focus. And if ever there's going to be \n     another story made of Cool Hand Luke, you'll be the man.\n       Members of the Cabinet and diplomatic corps, Members of \n     Congress, Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera, Secretary of \n     the Air Force, F. Whitten Peters, Secretary of the Navy, \n     Richard Danzig, leaders from across this great institution, \n     Janet, of course, and my son Kevin, thank you for being here \n     on such a special occasion. Distinguished guests, ladies and \n     gentlemen, and most importantly, the men and women of the \n     United States Armed Forces--the finest fighting force on the \n     face of the Earth.\n       Twenty-four years ago another Secretary bid farewell to \n     this institution. In the coming days, the 13th Secretary of \n     Defense will return as the 21st Secretary of Defense. Don \n     Rumsfeld has been an enduring public servant to this country, \n     and he's going to be an outstanding leader of this \n     department. But I must tell you, even if senator Strom \n     Thurmon is in the audience--and what an inspiring example of \n     service he is--I have no illusions. I am not returning in the \n     year 2025.\n       But I do want to take this occasion to thank you for \n     honoring me and Janet with your presence and to use this \n     final occasion to address the ranks among you--those who wear \n     the nation's uniform.\n       During these final days--which somehow have become the most \n     demanding in the last four years--I've been afflicted by a \n     multitude of emotions and thoughts. Late last night, early \n     this morning, I was complaining to Janet that I didn't have \n     enough time to even begin to contemplate what I might say to \n     you today, knowing that my words would have no more lasting \n     effect than those words written in sand. She replied. ``Just \n     tell them what you feel.'' That's always what Janet would \n     say. ``Tell them what you feel.''\n       I thought years back to when I was in college and I used to \n     read the French existentialists. And I think it was Gide, or \n     it could have been Camus, who once said that it's the \n     foreknowledge of the finality of things that destroys bliss \n     at its very apex. In other words, everything that is mortal \n     must come to an end, and therefore we can take no joy in the \n     experience.\n       I used to dabble with such thoughts as a young college \n     student, but 40 years of experience have taught me \n     differently. We have loved this job, knowing that this day \n     would one day have to come. We have loved not this job, but \n     this opportunity to be in the presence of heroes--to walk and \n     to sail and to soar with eagles.\n       So what do I feel? I feel honor, to be sure, but most of \n     all, an unqualified sense of awe. When I'm in the presence of \n     men and women who serve and sacrifice themselves and their \n     families for our freedom, I am in awe. I've had the privilege \n     of meeting with kings and queens, and presidents and prime \n     ministers, and princes and sultans and emirs, and yes, \n     parliamentarians the world over. But nothing has ever been \n     more rewarding than to visit our troops in Bosnia, in Kosovo, \n     Korea, Kuwait, or Saudi Arabia; to land on a carrier in the \n     Persian Gulf where the temperatures can run 120, 130, 140 \n     degrees, and to see our sailors and Marines carrying out \n     their duties in that heat; to watch our Air Force put steel \n     on target or deliver humanitarian relief to helpless victims \n     of hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural disasters; to \n     witness our Coast Guardsmen protect our shores or rescue \n     those who are caught up in those perfect storms.\n       I marvel at your raw courage and your willingness to \n     constantly train and prepare to fight the wars that can't be \n     prevented. And I am touched to the core when I visit you at \n     Christmas time, knowing what a special moment it is for you, \n     how far away you are from your families, what spirit you show \n     in your very loneliness as you're surrounded by your \n     comrades, what pride you take in knowing that you save lives, \n     that you've touched hearts of total strangers, and that \n     you've given them something more precious than gold.\n       And as I reflect on the swift passage of time these past \n     four years, all of these moments and memories come rushing at \n     me with a terrifying velocity. But I'd like to share one of \n     my earliest with you.\n       On our visit to Eagle Base in Bosnia on Christmas Eve three \n     years ago--as we have done every holiday since that time--we \n     joined hundreds of soldiers to share songs and love and \n     levity and laughter, and to bring them just a touch of home. \n     As we left around midnight, we passed along the perimeter and \n     came across three young soldiers for whom Christmas Eve meant \n     manning a security post that was fashioned from wood. They \n     were out there in the mud, in the cold, in the darkness, \n     standing guard in the night.\n       As we expressed our gratitude for their service and \n     conveyed our sorrow they couldn't be home with their \n     families, one of these soldiers looked at Janet and he \n     offered a response that we will never forget, so eloquent in \n     its simplicity, so profound in its\n\n[[Page S85]]\n\n     sincerity, ``That's all right, ma'am. Somebody has to do it. \n     And besides, I think we're making a difference here.''\n       Men and women of the United States Armed Forces for the \n     past four years, we've been blessed to serve with you as you \n     stand guard in the night, and as you continue to make an \n     extraordinary difference the world over. Because of your \n     patriotism and professionalism, because of your dedication \n     and your daring, more people today sleep under the flag of \n     freedom than at any time in history.\n       So the poet asks, ``How should we presume?'' I was recently \n     asked, ``What's your legacy? What can you point to with pride \n     that you've helped to make happen on your watch?'' Well, I'd \n     never really given any thought to legacies. I simply tried to \n     keep the faith of all who have come before me and those who \n     come after.\n       The Chairman stole my thunder here, because I was going to \n     engage in just a touch of immodesty, but he already outlined \n     everything we've done. We have managed to secure an \n     additional $227 billion for future years defense spending. \n     Four years ago we were told there wouldn't be any increases. \n     We now have an additional $227 billion coming to our armed \n     forces. That's a remarkable achievement that this team has \n     produced.\n       We've had the largest defense spending increase in 15 \n     years, the largest pay raise in a generation, retirement \n     benefits back up to 50 percent, the elimination of housing \n     inequities for those who live off-base, overhauling the \n     health care system to make sure that we give decent health \n     care for the men and women who are serving us and those who \n     have retired and their families-care that's worthy of this \n     nation.\n       We conducted the most successful air campaign in the \n     history of warfare. We drove Milosevic out of Kosovo, and \n     hopefully into oblivion, or at least to The Hague where he \n     can stand trial. We kept Saddam Hussein in his box and out of \n     his neighbors' oil fields and homes. We've enlarged the NATO \n     family with three new democracies. We've strengthened our \n     relationships in South America, in Africa, the Gulf States, \n     South Korea, Japan, and all of the Southeast Asian countries. \n     We've reduced nuclear weapons in Russia. We have established \n     military to military ties with China.\n       We created the Joint Forces Command, preparing to deter and \n     counter those who plot our destruction with weapons of mass \n     destruction. We have reoriented the Space Command to ensure \n     that we remain as dominant in space and cyberspace as we are \n     on the battlefields. We've accelerated that Revolution in \n     Military Affairs, transforming our forces so we can marshal \n     and match the power of our technology with the force of our \n     ideals.\n       And I want to mention one other thing--we've kept our \n     promise to help reconnect America to its military, to remind \n     the American people that we must take care of those who take \n     care of us and that freedom can be lost just as easily \n     through indifference and neglect as it can through warfare.\n       In his wonderful book, On the Origins of War and the \n     Preservation of Peace, Donald Kagan talked about Athenian \n     democracy. He said that in the end, more than they wanted \n     freedom, they wanted security. And when the Athenians finally \n     wanted not to give to society, but for society to give to \n     them, when the freedom that they wished for was freedom from \n     responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free. We should \n     never let that happen to the United States of America.\n       General Shelton, you quoted Chamberlain, one of my heroes. \n     And I would suggest that no words better describe those that \n     we serve. On countless occasions I've been asked by foreign \n     leaders. ``How can our military be more like America's?'' \n     I'll repeat here today what I've said time and time again. \n     It's not our training, although our training is the most \n     rigorous in the world. It's not our technology, although \n     ours is the most advanced in the world. And it's not our \n     tactics, although ours in the most revolutionary in the \n     world. We have the finest military on Earth because we \n     have the finest people on Earth, because we recruit and we \n     retain the best that America has to offer.\n       So as I prepare to leave public office, I want to take this \n     final occasion to remind all of America: take a look at the \n     leadership that we have, take a look at what you see arrayed \n     before you here. Be inspired by their character and their \n     devotion to duty. Stand in awe of their courage and their \n     professionalism and their ability to maintain bravery in the \n     midst of tragedy and loss.\n       When we stood on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base to \n     welcome home the flag-drapped coffins of those that we lost \n     in our embassies in East Africa, when we stood on the pier in \n     Norfolk with the wounded sailors and the families of those \n     who perished in the Cole, when we learned of those who were \n     lost aboard the Osprey, and whenever the phone rang at \n     midnight or in the early morning hours telling me of an \n     accident that would not make the headlines, but that would \n     rip a hole in the hearts of the families who were affected, \n     then we understand why these brave men and women and their \n     families truly are patriots among us--the pride of America, \n     the envy of the world.\n       Finally, I'd like to pay special tribute to the most \n     remarkable person in my life. When you think of Janet \n     Langhart Cohen, you think of passion, of fire, of spirit. \n     Creative ideas spring from her like the cherry blossoms \n     around the Tidal Basin, only it's not just in the spring \n     time, they're always springing forward. And it's not just the \n     creativity, it's moving from the creation of the idea to the \n     actuality of the event.\n       I think of all she has been able to do--creating that first \n     Family Forum or the Pentagon Pops, helping to organize those \n     holiday tours overseas, creating the new USO Corridor in the \n     Pentagon and a new liaison office in the Pentagon, hosting \n     that Special Assignment television program that goes \n     worldwide to our troops, receiving the VFW Award, then just \n     last week the Zach Fisher Award, being recognized by the \n     United States Chamber of Commerce for her work on behalf of \n     all of those in uniform, and yes, named the First Lady of the \n     USO. But I would say most of all, she has loved our men and \n     women in uniform with a zeal that transcends any ability of \n     mine to describe. I have never felt more alive--or more \n     ignored--than when she's out there with the troops. Lou \n     Gehrig was wrong, I'm the luckiest man alive.\n       So it's time for the two of us to take our leave. We have a \n     new President who has assembled a great new national security \n     team and they will, with your help and God's help, continue \n     to make the United States of America the greatest force for \n     freedom in the world.\n       I'd like to close with the paraphrased words of the poet \n     Tagore. ``When one comes and whispers to me, `Thy days are \n     ended,' let me say to him, `I have lived and loved and not in \n     mere time.' And he will ask, `Will thy songs remain?' And I \n     shall say, `I know not, but this I know. That often when I \n     sang, I found my eternity.' '' Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/22/senate-section/article/S85-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S85-S86]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THE LATE VICTOR BORGE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, one of the great joys of being a United \nStates Senator from Connecticut is the privilege of counting so many \nextraordinary individuals as my constituents. One of the most \nextraordinary of them--Victor Borge--passed away quietly in his \nGreenwich, Connecticut, home last month at the age of 91. He will be \nmissed by millions of fans the world over, including me.\n  Victor Borge often famously told his audiences that ``the shortest \ndistance between two people is a smile.'' Indeed, the entertainer known \nthe world over as the Clown Prince of Denmark was singularly \nresponsible for millions of upturned lips--and untold bouts of \nhysterical laughter--during a magnificent career as a comedian and \nmusician that spanned almost a century.\n  I'd like to take a few minutes today to remember the remarkable life \nand laughter inspired by Victor Borge, an entertainer who gave new \nmeaning to the expression ``tickling the ivories'' by combining comedy \nand classical piano as no one else ever has. He was a one-of-a-kind \nkeyboard ham who enjoyed making his audiences laugh as much as he \nenjoyed making music.\n  He was a classically trained concert pianist who could be in the \nmiddle of a breathtaking rendition of Strauss' ``Die Fledermaus'' and \nsuddenly fall right off the side of his piano bench, sending his \naudience into hysterics. Or in a similar stunt, while in the middle of \nconducting an aria, a soprano's high note might blast him right off his \nstool, and he would stoically climb back on, only this time wielding a \nsafety belt to bolt himself to his seat. Sometimes Victor would \nintentionally strike the wrong pitch at the piano, only to brandish the \nsheet music and a pair of scissors and literally cut out the offending \nnote.\n  He's the only musician I know who could begin a solemn rendering of \nBeethoven's ``Moonlight Sonata,'' then seamlessly slide into Cole \nPorter's ``Night and Day.'' To say nothing of his ability to morph \nMozart into ``Happy Birthday.'' Sight gags and musical quirks were only \npart of the act. Borge always had a stable of rhetorical flourishes at \nthe ready, such as, ``Mozart wrote this piece in four flats, because he \nmoved three times while composing it.''\n  I felt lucky to count Victor as my friend. I'll never forget the many \ntimes I tried to give a speech to a roomful of people, only to find \nmyself drawn into the role of his straight man as he joked with the \ndroopy-faced delivery that made everyone laugh until in hurt.\n  His comic genius hid the life story of a European Jew who narrowly \nescaped Nazi persecution. Borge was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, to a \nfather who was a violinist in the Royal Danish Philharmonic. The \nyounger Borge was a child prodigy concert pianist, debuting at age 8, \nand a Scandinavian star by his early 20s. By 1940, he was at the top of \nthe Nazis' extermination list because he poked fun at Hitler and the \nThird Reich in his act. Ultimately,\n\n[[Page S86]]\n\nthough, his music helped save his life when two Russian diplomats who \nwere fans of his show helped smuggle him on a ship bound for Finland, \nwhere Borge found his way onto the S.S. American Legion, one of the \nlast boats out of Europe.\n  Victor Borge arrived in New York penniless and speaking no English. \nBut he quickly learned the language by watching 10-cent movies in \nmidtown Manhattan theaters. In less than two years, he had adapted his \nact to the English language and debuted on the Bing Crosby radio show. \nWithin a decade he had appeared on Ed Sullivan and been offered his own \nradio program. By the end of his career, Borge's one-man Broadway show, \n``Comedy in Music,'' had logged 849 performances, which is still a \nrecord today.\n  Over the last half-century, he also developed credentials as an \norchestra conductor, directing the London and New York Philharmonics, \nthe Philadelphia Orchestra, and the Boston Pops. He also raised \nmillions of dollars for worthy causes such as Thanks to Scandinavia, a \nscholarship fund to commemorate efforts to help victims of Nazi \npersecution. Victor was knighted by all five Scandinavian countries for \nhis life's work, and was honored by the United Nations as well as the \nU.S. Congress.\n  I will never forget the night of December 29, 1999, right here in \nWashington, when Victor received the prestigious Kennedy Center Honors \nalong with Jason Robards, Sean Connery, and Stevie Wonder. President \nClinton hung a medal around his neck that night in recognition of his \nlife achievements, and Borge--clowning around into his 90s--showed up \nat the reception afterward in a red clown nose.\n  Years ago, on the occasion of his 75th birthday, the New York Times \nwrote an editorial calling Victor Borge, simply, ``the funniest man on \nearth.'' To me, he was also eloquently warm, gifted, and brilliant--a \nbright and irrepressible star who lit the world around him. We shall \nmiss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/22/senate-section/article/S86-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S86]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RICHARD METREY\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I want to pay tribute to an \noutstanding public servant, Mr. Richard Metrey, who retired last week \nafter 41 years of Government service in the United States Navy.\n  Throughout his career, Richard Metrey has distinguished himself \nthrough his leadership, commitment and dedication to public service, \nand by making government work better and more efficiently. Beginning as \na project engineer in the Ships Machinery Division of the former Bureau \nof Ships, he swiftly worked his way up through the ranks into positions \nin senior management, including Head of the Combat Systems Branch in \nthe Naval Sea Systems Command and Program Manager for the Navy Advanced \nPrototyping Program.\n  For the last fifteen years, Mr. Metrey has served as Technical \nDirector of the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, where \nhe has had a profound impact on the Navy's approach to researching, \ndeveloping, testing and evaluating naval vehicles. During this time, \nRichard was directly responsible for the Division's entire technical \nprogram--its planning, execution, and staffing of current programs, as \nwell as strategic planning and new starts. Prior to that, Mr. Metrey \nalso served in the Navy Secretariat in a range of important \nresponsibilities from Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for \nSurface Warfare to principal advisor to the Assistant Secretary of the \nNavy for Surface Warfare Research and Development and Acquisition.\n  Mr. Metrey's colleagues attest to the ingenuity and integrity he has \nbrought to the positions in which he has served. His contributions and \naccomplishments have been recognized through many prestigious awards, \nincluding the Presidential Rank Meritorious Executive Award, the Navy \nSuperior Civilian Service Award and numerous Outstanding Performance \nAwards--to name only a few. He has also been selected to serve as the \nUnited States representative on several international forums, and on \nhigh level committees, including the Congressionally established \nAdvanced Submarine Advisory Panel.\n  I came to know Richard Metrey in the early 1990s during the Base \nClosure and Realignment (BRAC) process. Having had the opportunity to \nwork with him during the BRAC and on other matters, I can also attest \nfirsthand to his professionalism and deep commitment to our Navy and \nits mission. It is my firm conviction that public service is one of the \nmost honorable callings, one that demands the very best, most dedicated \nefforts of those who have the opportunity to serve their fellow \ncitizens and country. Throughout his career, Richard Metrey's \ncommitment and remarkable talent have enabled him to go beyond meeting \nthis demand. So I want to extend my personal gratitude to Richard for \nthese many years of hard work and dedication and I wish him well in \nwhatever endeavors he seeks to undertake in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/22/senate-section/article/S86-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S86]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ROBIN COMSTOCK\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Dean Kamen of Bedford, New Hampshire, whose dedication to the \nfield of technology has earned him the admiration and gratitude of his \nstate and nation. As a testament to his many extraordinary \nachievements, Dean was awarded the National Medal of Technology by \nPresident Clinton in 2000 for inventions that have advanced medical \ncare worldwide. His innovative spirit and imaginative leadership have \nawakened America to the excitement of science and technology.\n  Dean's remarkable career as an inventor began while he was still a \ncollege undergraduate, when he invented the first wearable infusion \npump. This device rapidly found uses in such diverse medical \nspecialties as chemotherapy, neonatology, and endocrinology. Since then \nDean has played a leading role in many major advances in healthcare, \nsuch as the insulin pump for diabetics. He was also instrumental in the \ndevelopment of IBOT, a personal transporter developed for the disabled \ncommunity, which is capable of climbing stairs, traversing sandy and \nrocky terrain and raise its user to eye-level with a standing person.\n  Nearly a decade ago, Dean founded FIRST (For Inspiration and \nRecognition of Science and Technology) to motivate America's youth to \nlearn about science and technology, and has personally recruited many \nof the top leaders of industry, education and government in this \nmission. He has been recognized for his efforts by prestigious \npublications such as Smithsonian Magazine and the New York Times, which \nlabeled him a ``New Kind of Hero for American Youth.''\n  Dean's passion for technology and its practical uses has changed the \nface of healthcare and inspired a love of science in a generation of \nAmerican children. Because of his extraordinary achievements, we have a \nnew understanding of ourselves and the world, as well as a renewed hope \nfor the future. It is an honor to represent Dean in the\n\n[[Page S87]]\n\nUnited States Senate, and I wish him all the best in his \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/22/senate-section/article/S87-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S87]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ALYSSA SPELLMAN\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Congress responded \n     by enacting IDEA to ensure that disabled children received \n     appropriate services and to provide financial support to the \n     States for providing these services.\n       (C) Since the enactment of IDEA, schools have been serving \n     disabled children, helping them develop their skills and \n     abilities and go on to lead productive and independent lives. \n     Today, IDEA serves 5,400,000 children with disabilities from \n     birth through age 21. Every State offers public education and \n     early intervention services for children with disabilities. \n     Fewer than 6,000 disabled children now live in institutional \n     settings away from their families, compared to 95,000 such \n     children in 1969. The number of disabled students completing \n     high school with a diploma or certificate has increased by 10 \n     percent in the last decade. The number of students with \n     disabilities entering higher education has more than tripled \n     since the implementation of IDEA.\n       (D) When IDEA was enacted, the legislation included a goal \n     to provide 40 percent of the cost of providing services for \n     these students.\n       (E) The cost of providing special education has increased \n     significantly for school districts across the country. The \n     Federal Government currently provides about 15 percent of the \n     national average per pupil expenditure for IDEA students.\n       (F) IDEA will be up for reauthorization for fiscal year \n     2003.\n       (2) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (A) when Congress reauthorizes the IDEA program, it should \n     ensure that the Federal Government will reach the goal of \n     providing 40 percent of the national average per pupil \n     expenditure under IDEA; and\n       (B) disabled children will benefit from efforts to help \n     schools hire and train high quality teachers and principals, \n     reduce class size, renovate overcrowded and crumbling \n     buildings, integrate technology into the classroom, \n     strengthen early literacy programs, and increase the \n     availability of after-school learning opportunities.\n\n            TITLE V--MAKING HIGHER EDUCATION MORE AFFORDABLE\n\n     SEC. 501. INCREASE IN MAXIMUM PELL GRANT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A college education has become increasingly important, \n     not just to the individual beneficiary, but to the nation as \n     a whole. The growth and continued expansion of the nation's \n     economy is heavily dependent on an educated and highly \n     skilled workforce.\n       (2) The opportunity to gain a college education also is \n     important to the nation as a means to help advance the \n     American ideals of progress and equality.\n       (3) The Federal Government plays an invaluable role in \n     making student financial aid available to ensure that \n     qualified students are able to attend college, regardless of \n     their financial means. Since the inception of the Pell Grant \n     program in 1973, nearly 80,000,000 grants have helped low- \n     and middle-income students go to college, enrich their lives, \n     and become productive members of society.\n       (4) Nationwide, almost 70 percent of high school graduates \n     continue on to higher education. This degree of college \n     participation would not exist without the Federal investment \n     in student aid, especially the Pell Grant program. Nearly 25 \n     percent of low- and middle-income students receive some \n     amount of Pell Grant funding.\n       (5) In the next 10 years, the number of undergraduate \n     students enrolled in the nation's colleges and universities \n     will increase by 11 percent to more than 11,000,000 students. \n     Many of these students will be the first in their families to \n     attend college. One in 5 of these students will be from \n     families with incomes below the poverty level. The continued \n     investment in the Pell Grant program is essential if college \n     is to remain an achievable part of the American dream.\n\n[[Page S145]]\n\n       (6) Increasing the maximum Pell Grant to $4,700 would allow \n     approximately 430,000 additional students to benefit from the \n     program.\n       (7) Increasing the maximum Pell Grant to $4,700 would \n     result in an $800 increase in the average grant award.\n       (8) Because Pell Grant recipients are more likely to \n     graduate with student loan debt and to amass more debt than \n     other student borrowers, increasing the maximum Pell Grant to \n     $4,700 by fiscal year 2004 will help remedy this disparity.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate the \n     maximum Pell Grant should be increased to $4,700.\n\n     SEC. 502.

10. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs under the Medicare \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            medicare prescription drug coverage act of 2001\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation, along with \nSenator Daschle and our colleagues, to establish a universal \nprescription drug benefit program in Medicare. I am pleased to be part \nof this effort, because I believe Congress should enact a drug benefit \nthis year. The lack of coverage for outpatient prescription drugs in \nMedicare has become a glaring gap in the program.\n  The practice of medicine has changed dramatically since Medicare was \ncreated in 1965. Today, more often than not, a trip to the doctor \nresults in a trip to the pharmacy, to fill a prescription as part of \nthe therapy. In many cases, prescription drugs allow patients to avoid \nmore expensive and invasive therapies such as hospitalization and \nsurgery.\n  Our increasing reliance on pharmaceutical products has also fueled \ndrug spending. Pharmaceuticals are the fastest growing segment of \nnational health expenditures. In 2000, national drug spending increased \nby an estimated 11 percent, compared with 7 percent for physician \nservices and 6 percent for hospital care. Since 1990, national spending \nfor prescription drugs has tripled.\n  And as the role and expense of prescription drugs have grown, their \nabsence from Medicare's outpatient benefit package has become \nincreasingly problematic for beneficiaries. An estimated 35 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries currently lack coverage for outpatient \nprescription drugs. But that figure may understate the problem. One \nstudy has shown that only about 50 percent of seniors have drug \ncoverage throughout the year, and for many who do have coverage, it is \noften limited or inadequate.\n  In my home state of Montana, Medicare beneficiaries are even less \nlikely to have coverage for prescription drugs than those living in \nother parts of the country. A National Economic Council study that I \nrequested last year showed that rural Medicare beneficiaries are 50 \npercent less likely than their urban counterparts to have prescription \ndrug coverage. And although rural Medicare beneficiaries use 10 percent \nmore prescriptions than urban folks, they pay 25 percent more out-of-\npocket for their drugs.\n  These factors underscore the importance of this issue to folks back \nhome. I intend to work hard this year to pass a Medicare drug bill for \nthem and for the millions of other Medicare beneficiaries who lack \ncoverage or are at risk of losing the coverage they currently have. It \nis time for Congress to act on this issue and pass legislation to \nprovide prescription drugs for America's seniors.\n  The Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage Act of 2001 is a good place \nto start. This legislation builds on the excellent work of Senator \nGraham and other members of the Finance Committee, including Senators \nConrad, Jeffords, and Rockefeller. The benefit is universal, it is part \nof the Medicare program, it includes a deductible, and patient \ncoinsurance decreases as drug expenditures increase. The proposal \nprovides subsidies for low-income seniors to help them with their \npremiums and cost sharing. And the proposal relies on private sector \nentities to administer the benefit.\n  Let me add--by no means does this legislation represent the end of \nthe debate. Rather, it represents a beginning, a starting point. For \nexample, the bill does not address many of the elements of Medicare \nreform that are currently on the table and, quite frankly, should be \nincluded. President Bush and others have emphasized that a new drug \nbenefit must be added in the context of overall Medicare reform. As \nSenator Breaux is fond of saying, a prescription drug benefit is the \ndessert that we get when we take the medicine of reform.\n  I expect that any prescription drug legislation we pass, and the \nPresident signs, will include provisions addressing solvency, \ncompetition, HCFA reform, and fee-for-service modernizations. These are \nareas, in addition to adding a drug benefit, where Medicare could also \nbe updated and improved, and the bipartisan Medicare Commission has \ngone a long way toward putting these issues on the national agenda.\n  I am encouraged that the new administration also recognizes that \nprescription drugs is an important issue. President Bush campaigned on \na promise to address this issue early on, and I sincerely appreciate \nthat it is one of the top priorities of the new administration. \nLikewise, I know that Senator Grassley also cares deeply about this \nissue.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate that I am committed to working with \nSenator Grassley, with the other members of the Finance Committee, and \nwith the new Administration to come up with a compromise solution. It \nis truly my hope that we can work together, build consensus, and forge \ncompromise solutions on this issue. If we're creative, and if we listen \nto each other, I am confident that we can find balanced and bipartisan \nsolution.\n\n                                 S. 10\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Prescription drug coverage was not a standard part of \n     health insurance when the medicare program under title XVIII \n     of the Social Security Act was enacted in 1965. Since 1965, \n     however, drug coverage has become a key component of most \n     private and public health insurance coverage, except for the \n     medicare program.\n       (2) At least \\2/3\\ of medicare beneficiaries have \n     unreliable, inadequate, or no drug coverage at all.\n       (3) Seniors who do not have drug coverage typically pay 15 \n     percent more for prescription drugs than individuals that \n     have such coverage pay for such drugs, and often pay 2 times \n     the best available price for such drugs.\n       (4) Although many medicare beneficiaries who lack \n     prescription drug coverage have low incomes, more than \\1/2\\ \n     of such beneficiaries have incomes greater than 150 percent \n     of the poverty line.\n       (5) The number of private firms offering retiree health \n     coverage is declining.\n       (6) The premiums for medicare supplemental policies \n     (medigap policies) that provide prescription drug coverage \n     are too expensive for most medicare beneficiaries and are \n     highest for older senior citizens who need prescription drug \n     coverage the most and typically have the lowest incomes.\n       (7) The management of a medicare prescription drug benefit \n     should mirror the practices employed by private entities in \n     delivering prescription drugs. Discounts should be achieved \n     through competition.\n       (8) All medicare beneficiaries should have access to a \n     voluntary, reliable, affordable outpatient drug benefit as \n     part of the medicare program that assists with the high cost \n     of prescription drugs and protects them against excessive \n     out-of-pocket costs.\n       (9) The addition of a medicare drug benefit should be \n     consistent with an overall plan to strengthen and modernize \n     the medicare program.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to eliminate \nthe marriage penalty by providing that the income tax rate bracket \namounts, and the amount of the standard deduction, for joint returns \nshall be twice the amounts applicable to unmarried individuals, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S164]]\n\n                      marriage penalty legislation\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, for 4 years now, I have introduced a \nbill to eliminate the marriage penalty tax. I have said all of these \nyears that I do not think Americans should have to choose between love \nand money. They should be able to get married and not be penalized \nbecause they do. But in fact 25 million married couples in America \ntoday do pay a penalty just because they got married. The sad thing is, \nthe average penalty they pay is about $1,400. That is $1,400 that a \nyoung couple would like to have as they are starting their lives \ntogether, for the things they want: Like the down payment on the new \nhouse or the new car or the expenses associated with having children. \nWe want them to be able to have the money they earn to make their \nchoices rather than having Uncle Sam take $1,400 more just because of \nwhat amounts to a glitch in the Tax Code that requires these married \ncouples to pay this penalty.\n  The bill I have just introduced today, S. 11, is cosponsored by \nSenators Brownback, Lott, Nickles, Allen, Bunning, Burns, Crapo, Frist, \nGramm, Hagel, Kyl, Ensign, McConnell, Murkowski and Warner.\n  This is a bill that I hope will have broad bipartisan support \nbecause, in fact, we have passed it twice and sent it to the President \nwith bipartisan majorities in the past. The President has chose to veto \nthe bills before, but today we have a new President who I believe will \nsign marriage penalty relief. It was part of President Bush's campaign. \nWhen we send him Marriage penalty relief for the third time in a \nbipartisan way in Congress, I believe President Bush will sign it.\n  I am very pleased this bill will double the standard deduction for \nmarried couples. Today, if you get married the standard deduction that \ntwo single people would have is not double. We want to double the \nstandard deduction. Two people getting married who have two incomes but \ndo not itemize would receive a increase of $1,500 in their standard \ndeduction. That is what we want to do.\n  Secondly, we will double each tax bracket for married couples filing \na joint return. For example, if a couple is in the 15-percent income \ntax bracket but they get married and are thrown into the 30-percent \nbracket, we want to provide them relief such that they will effectively \nremain in the 15 percent bracket. This bill would widen the 15-percent \nbracket by $9,000 for married couples.\n  Congress passed this legislation, and it was vetoed. Today, I am \nintroducing this bill. I know we are going to pass it in this Congress, \nand I know it will be signed. This is the beginning of a new day in our \nUnited States of America, and we are going to eliminate the marriage \npenalty this year. I will count on it.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise in support of legislation my \ncolleague from Texas introduced today that will put an end to the \n``marriage penalty'' tax. Mr. President, we've been fighting this tax \ninequity for several years now. The people of Montana have spoken to me \neither through letters or conversation--they think this tax is unfair.\n  When we first started working to resolve this issue, I was contacted \nby Joshua and Jody Hayes of Billings, Montana. The Hayes paid $971 more \nin taxes because they were married than they would have paid if they \nremained single.\n  In Montana, it is estimated that nearly 90,000 couples are penalized \nby this tax to the tune of $51.5 million--solely for being married. \nMaking a living--supporting a family--is a difficult task in today's \nfast paced economy. A young couple married today is immediately subject \nto an additional financial burden because they want to share their \nlives together. The federal tax system penalizes these young couples. \nThese are not wealthy people--this effort to provide tax relief does \nnot discriminate--this effort does not single out a specific income \ngroup. It is a tax on families.\n  I, along with my Republican colleagues, have made it clear that \ncontinued tax reform and tax relief is necessary, but I can think of no \nother tax that has such a dramatic impact on so many people.\n  If ever there was a disincentive to be married, this penalty would be \nit. I believe this, along with the estate tax, is one of the most \nunfair taxes on Americans. It is not right for people to be penalized \nwith higher taxes simply because they choose to get married.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), almost half of \nall married couples pay higher taxes due to their marital status. \nCumulatively, the marriage penalty increases taxes on affected couples \nby $29 billion per year. Currently, this tax penalty imposes an average \nadditional tax of $1400 on 21 million married couples nationwide.\n  Mr. President, the marriage penalty can have significantly negative \neconomic implications for the country as a whole as well. Not only does \nthis penalty within the tax system stand as a likely obstacle to \nmarriage, it can actually discourage a spouse from entering the \nworkforce.\n  By adding together husband and wife under the rate schedule, tax laws \nboth encourage families to identify a primary and secondary worker and \nthen place an extra burden on the secondary worker because his or her \nwages come on top of the primary earner's wages.\n  As the American family realizes lower income levels, the nation \nrealizes lower economic output. From a strictly economic perspective, \nthe fact that potential workers would avoid the labor force as a result \nof a tax penalty is a clear sign of a failure to maximize true economic \noutput. As a result, the nation as a whole fails to reach its economic \npotential, which is demonstrated by decreased earnings and \ninternational competitiveness.\n  Whereas I am very disappointed President Clinton has vetoed this \ninitiative in the past, I am confident our new President will support \nAmerica's families.\n  Congress has momentum considering this body has already passed this \nlegislation to correct this inequity. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation to repeal the marriage penalty.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 16.

ESTABLISHMENT OF PROTECTIVE FUNCTION PRIVILEGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The physical safety of the Nation's top elected \n     officials is a public good of transcendent importance.\n       (2) By virtue of the critical importance of the Office of \n     the President, the President and those in direct line of the \n     Presidency are subject to unique and mortal jeopardy--\n     jeopardy that in turn threatens profound disruption to our \n     system of representative government and to the security and \n     future of the Nation.\n       (3) The physical safety of visiting heads of foreign states \n     and foreign governments is also a matter of paramount \n     importance. The assassination of such a person while on \n     American soil could have calamitous consequences for our \n     foreign relations and national security.\n       (4) Given these grave concerns, Congress has provided for \n     the Secret Service to protect the President and those in \n     direct line of the Presidency, and has directed that these \n     officials may not waive such protection. Congress has also \n     provided for the Secret Service to protect visiting heads of \n     foreign states and foreign governments.\n       (5) The protective strategy of the Secret Service depends \n     critically on the ability of its personnel to maintain close \n     and unremitting physical proximity to the protectee.\n       (6) Secret Service personnel must remain at the side of the \n     protectee on occasions of confidential conversations and, as \n     a result,\n\n[[Page S169]]\n\n     may overhear top secret discussions, diplomatic exchanges, \n     sensitive conversations, and matters of personal privacy.\n       (7) The necessary level of proximity can be maintained only \n     in an atmosphere of complete trust and confidence between the \n     protectee and his or her protectors.\n       (8) If a protectee has reason to doubt the confidentiality \n     of actions or conversations taken in sight or hearing of \n     Secret Service personnel, the protectee may seek to push the \n     protective envelope away or undermine it to the point at \n     which it could no longer be fully effective.\n       (9) The possibility that Secret Service personnel might be \n     compelled to testify against their protectees could induce \n     foreign nations to refuse Secret Service protection in future \n     state visits, making it impossible for the Secret Service to \n     fulfill its important statutory mission of protecting the \n     life and safety of foreign dignitaries.\n       (10) A privilege protecting information acquired by Secret \n     Service personnel while performing their protective function \n     in physical proximity to a protectee will preserve the \n     security of the protectee by lessening the incentive of the \n     protectee to distance Secret Service personnel in situations \n     in which there is some risk to the safety of the protectee.\n       (11) Recognition of a protective function privilege for the \n     President and those in direct line of the Presidency, and for \n     visiting heads of foreign states and foreign governments, \n     will promote sufficiently important interests to outweigh the \n     need for probative evidence.\n       (12) Because Secret Service personnel retain law \n     enforcement responsibility even while engaged in their \n     protective function, the privilege must be subject to a \n     crime/treason exception.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to facilitate the relationship of trust and confidence \n     between Secret Service personnel and certain protected \n     officials that is essential to the ability of the Secret \n     Service to protect these officials, and the Nation, from the \n     risk of assassination; and\n       (2) to ensure that Secret Service personnel are not \n     precluded from testifying in a criminal investigation or \n     prosecution about unlawful activity committed within their \n     view or hearing.\n       (c) Admissibility of Information Acquired by Secret Service \n     Personnel While Performing Their Protective Function.--\n       (1) Protective function privilege.--Chapter 203 of title \n     18, United States Code, is amended by inserting after section \n     3056 the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 3056A.

CERTAIN PUNISHMENT AND GRADUATED SANCTIONS FOR \n                   YOUTH OFFENDERS.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) youth violence constitutes a growing threat to the \n     national welfare requiring immediate and comprehensive action \n     by the Federal Government to reduce and prevent youth \n     violence;\n       (B) the behavior of youth who become violent offenders \n     often follows a progression, beginning with aggressive \n     behavior in school, truancy, and vandalism, leading to \n     property crimes and then serious violent offenses;\n       (C) the juvenile justice systems in most States are ill-\n     equipped to provide meaningful sanctions to minor, nonviolent \n     offenders because most of their resources are dedicated to \n     dealing with more serious offenders;\n       (D) in most States, some youth commit multiple, nonviolent \n     offenses without facing any significant criminal sanction;\n       (E) the failure to provide meaningful criminal sanctions \n     for first time, nonviolent offenders sends the false message \n     to youth that they can engage in antisocial behavior without \n     suffering any negative consequences and that society is \n     unwilling or unable to restrain that behavior;\n       (F) studies demonstrate that interventions during the early \n     stages of a criminal career can halt the progression to more \n     serious, violent behavior; and\n       (G) juvenile courts need access to a range of sentencing \n     options so that at least some level of sanction is imposed on \n     all youth offenders, including status offenders, and the \n     severity of the sanctions increase along with the seriousness \n     of the offense.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to \n     provide--\n       (A) assistance to State and local juvenile courts to expand \n     the range of sentencing options for first time, nonviolent \n     offenders; and\n       (B) a selection of graduated sanctions for more serious \n     offenses.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) First time offender.--The term ``first time offender'' \n     means a juvenile against whom formal charges have not \n     previously been filed in any Federal or State judicial \n     proceeding.\n       (2) Nonviolent offender.--The term ``nonviolent offender'' \n     means a juvenile who is charged with an offense that does not \n     involve the use of force against the person of another.\n       (3) Status offender.--The term ``status offender'' means a \n     juvenile who is charged with an offense that would not be \n     criminal if committed by an adult (other than an offense that \n     constitutes a violation of a valid court order or a violation \n     of section 922(x) of title 18, United States Code (or similar \n     State law)).\n       (c) Grant Authorization.--The Attorney General may make \n     grants in accordance with this section to States, State \n     courts, local courts, units of local government, and Indian \n     tribes, for the purposes of--\n       (1) providing juvenile courts with a range of sentencing \n     options such that first time juvenile offenders, including \n     status offenders such as truants, vandals, and juveniles in \n     violation of State or local curfew laws, face at least some \n     level of punishment as a result of their initial contact with \n     the juvenile justice system; and\n       (2) increasing the sentencing options available to juvenile \n     court judges so that juvenile offenders receive increasingly \n     severe sanctions--\n       (A) as the seriousness of their unlawful conduct increases; \n     and\n       (B) for each additional offense.\n       (d) Applications.--\n       (1) Eligibility.--In order to be eligible to receive a \n     grant under this section, the chief executive of a State, \n     unit of local government, or Indian tribe, or the chief judge \n     of a local court, shall submit an application to the Attorney \n     General in such form and containing such information as the \n     Attorney General may reasonably require.\n       (2) Requirements.--Each application submitted in accordance \n     with paragraph (1) shall include--\n       (A) a request for a grant to be used for the purposes \n     described in this section;\n       (B) a description of the communities to be served by the \n     grant, including the extent of youth crime and violence in \n     those communities;\n       (C) written assurances that Federal funds received under \n     this subtitle will be used to supplement, not supplant, non-\n     Federal funds that would otherwise be available for \n     activities funded under this subsection;\n       (D) a comprehensive plan described in paragraph (3) (in \n     this section referred to as the ``comprehensive plan''); and\n       (E) any additional information in such form and containing \n     such information as the Attorney General may reasonably \n     require.\n       (3) Implementation plan.--For purposes of paragraph (2), a \n     comprehensive plan shall include--\n       (A) an action plan outlining the manner in which the \n     applicant will achieve the purposes described in subsection \n     (c)(1);\n\n[[Page S174]]\n\n       (B) a description of any resources available in the \n     jurisdiction of the applicant to implement the action plan \n     described in subparagraph (A);\n       (C) an estimate of the costs of full implementation of the \n     plan; and\n       (D) a plan for evaluating the impact of the grant on the \n     jurisdiction's juvenile justice system.\n       (e) Grant Awards.--\n       (1) Considerations.--In awarding grants under this section, \n     the Attorney General shall consider--\n       (A) the ability of the applicant to provide the stated \n     services;\n       (B) the level of youth crime, violence, and drug use in the \n     community; and\n       (C) to the extent practicable, achievement of an equitable \n     geographic distribution of the grant awards.\n       (2) Allocations.--\n       (A) In general.--The Attorney General shall allot not less \n     than 0.75 percent of the total amount made available to carry \n     out this section in each fiscal year to applicants in each \n     State from which applicants have applied for grants under \n     this section.\n       (B) Indian tribes.--The Attorney General shall allocate not \n     less than 0.75 percent of the total amount made available to \n     carry out this section in each fiscal year to Indian tribes.\n       (f) Use of Grant Amounts.--\n       (1) In general.--Each grant made under this section shall \n     be used to establish programs that--\n       (A) expand the number of judges, prosecutors, and public \n     defenders for the purpose of imposing sanctions on first time \n     juvenile offenders and status offenders and for establishing \n     restorative justice boards involving members of the \n     community;\n       (B) provide expanded sentencing options, such as \n     restitution, community service, drug testing and treatment, \n     mandatory job training, curfews, house arrest, mandatory work \n     projects, and boot camps, for status offenders and nonviolent \n     offenders;\n       (C) increase staffing for probation officers to supervise \n     status offenders and nonviolent offenders to ensure that \n     sanctions are enforced;\n       (D) provide aftercare and supervision for status and \n     nonviolent offenders, such as drug education and drug \n     treatment, vocational training, job placement, and family \n     counseling;\n       (E) encourage private sector employees to provide training \n     and work opportunities for status offenders and nonviolent \n     offenders; and\n       (F) provide services and interventions for status and \n     nonviolent offenders designed, in tandem with criminal \n     sanctions, to reduce the likelihood of further criminal \n     behavior.\n       (2) Prohibition on use of amounts.--\n       (A) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       (i) Alien.--The term ``alien'' has the same meaning as in \n     section 101(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1101(a)).\n       (ii) Secure detention facility;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Offender Reentry and \n     Community Safety Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 1602. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There are now nearly 1,900,000 individuals in our \n     country's prisons and jails, including over 140,000 \n     individuals under the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of \n     Prisons.\n       (2) Enforcement of offender violations of conditions of \n     releases has sharply increased the number of offenders who \n     return to prison--while revocations comprised 17 percent of \n     State prison admissions in 1980, they rose to 36 percent in \n     1998.\n       (3) Although prisoners generally are serving longer \n     sentences than they did a decade ago, most eventually reenter \n     communities; for example, in 1999, approximately 538,000 \n     State prisoners and over 50,000 Federal prisoners, a record \n     number, were returned to American communities. Approximately \n     100,000 State offenders who returned to communities received \n     no supervision whatsoever.\n       (4) Historically, two-thirds of returning State prisoners \n     have been rearrested for new crimes within three years, so \n     these individuals pose a significant public safety risk and a \n     continuing financial burden to society.\n       (5) A key element to effective post-incarceration \n     supervision is an immediate, predetermined, and appropriate \n     response to violations of the conditions of supervision.\n       (6) An estimated 187,000 State and Federal prison inmates \n     have been diagnosed with mental health problems; about 70 \n     percent of State prisoners and 57 percent of Federal \n     prisoners have a history of drug use or abuse; and nearly 75 \n     percent of released offenders with heroin or cocaine problems \n     return to using drugs within three months if untreated; \n     however, few States link prison mental health treatment \n     programs with those in the return community.\n       (7) Between 1987 and 1997, the volume of juvenile \n     adjudicated cases resulting in court-ordered residential \n     placements rose 56 percent. In 1997 alone, there were a total \n     of 163,200 juvenile court-ordered residential placements. The \n     steady increase of youth exiting residential placement has \n     strained the juvenile justice aftercare system, however, \n     without adequate supervision and services, youth are likely \n     to relapse, recidivate, and return to confinement at the \n     public's expense.\n       (8) Emerging technologies and multidisciplinary community-\n     based strategies present new opportunities to alleviate the \n     public safety risk posed by released prisoners while helping \n     offenders to reenter their communities successfully.\n\n      SEC. 1603. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this subtitle are to--\n       (1) establish demonstration projects in several Federal \n     judicial districts, the District of Columbia, and in the \n     Federal Bureau of Prisons, using new strategies and emerging \n     technologies that alleviate the public safety risk posed by \n     released prisoners by promoting their successful \n     reintegration into the community;\n       (2) establish court-based programs to monitor the return of \n     offenders into communities, using court sanctions to promote \n     positive behavior;\n       (3) establish offender reentry demonstration projects in \n     the states using government and community partnerships to \n     coordinate cost efficient strategies that ensure public \n     safety and enhance the successful reentry into communities of \n     offenders who have completed their prison sentences;\n       (4) establish intensive aftercare demonstration projects \n     that address public safety and ensure the special reentry \n     needs of juvenile offenders by coordinating the resources of \n     juvenile correctional agencies, juvenile courts, juvenile \n     parole agencies, law enforcement agencies, social service \n     providers, and local Workforce Investment Boards; and\n       (5) rigorously evaluate these reentry programs to determine \n     their effectiveness in reducing recidivism and promoting \n     successful offender reintegration.\n\n             PART 1--FEDERAL REENTRY DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS\n\n     SEC. 1611.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The number of older Americans is growing both \n     numerically and proportionally in the United States.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) millions of young people in America live in areas in \n     which drug use and violent and property crimes are pervasive;\n       (2) unfortunately, many of these same young people come \n     from single parent homes, or from environments in which there \n     is no responsible, caring adult supervision;\n       (3) all children and adolescents need caring adults in \n     their lives, and mentoring is an effective way to fill this \n     special need for at-risk children;\n       (4) the special bond of commitment fostered by the mutual \n     respect inherent in effective mentoring can be the tie that \n     binds a young person to a better future;\n       (5) through a mentoring relationship, adult volunteers and \n     participating youth make a significant commitment of time and \n     energy to develop relationships devoted to personal, \n     academic, or career development and social, artistic, or \n     athletic growth;\n       (6) rigorous independent studies have confirmed that \n     effective mentoring programs can significantly reduce and \n     prevent the use of alcohol and drugs by young people, improve \n     school attendance and performance, improve peer and family \n     and peer relationships, and reduce violent behavior;\n       (7) since the inception of the Federal JUMP program, dozens \n     of innovative, effective mentoring programs have received \n     funding grants;\n       (8) unfortunately, despite the recent growth in public and \n     private mentoring initiatives, it is reported that between \n     5,000,000 and 15,000,000 additional children in the United \n     States could benefit from being matched with a mentor; and\n       (9) although great strides have been made in reaching at-\n     risk youth since the inception of the JUMP program, millions \n     of vulnerable American children are not being reached, and \n     without an increased commitment to connect these young people \n     to responsible adult role models, our country risks losing an \n     entire generation to drugs, crime, and unproductive lives.\n\n     SEC. 4233.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This part may be cited as the ``Truancy Prevention and \n     Juvenile Crime Reduction Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 4242. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Truancy is often the first sign of trouble--the first \n     indicator that a young person is giving up and losing his or \n     her way.\n       (2) Many students who become truant eventually drop out of \n     school, and high school drop outs are two and a half times \n     more likely to be on welfare than high school graduates, \n     twice as likely to be unemployed, or if employed, earn lower \n     salaries.\n       (3) Truancy is the top-ranking characteristic of \n     criminals--more common than such factors as coming from \n     single-parent families and being abused as children.\n       (4) High rates of truancy are linked to high daytime \n     burglary rates and high vandalism.\n       (5) As much as 44 percent of violent juvenile crime takes \n     place during school hours.\n\n[[Page S207]]\n\n       (6) As many as 75 percent of children ages 13 to 16 who are \n     arrested and prosecuted for crimes are truants.\n       (7) Some cities report as many as 70 percent of daily \n     student absences are unexcused, and the total number of \n     absences in a single city can reach 4,000 per day.\n       (8) Society pays a significant social and economic cost due \n     to truancy: only 34 percent of inmates have completed high \n     school education; 17 percent of youth under age 18 entering \n     adult prisons have not completed grade school (8th grade or \n     less), 25 percent completed 10th grade, and 2 percent \n     completed high school.\n       (9) Truants and later high school drop outs cost the Nation \n     $240,000,000,000 in lost earnings and foregone taxes over \n     their lifetimes, and the cost of crime control is staggering.\n       (10) In many instances, parents are unaware a child is \n     truant.\n       (11) Effective truancy prevention, early intervention, and \n     accountability programs can improve school attendance and \n     reduce daytime crime rates.\n       (12) There is a lack of targeted funding for effective \n     truancy prevention programs in current law.\n\n     SEC. 4243.

I am pleased today to join Senator Daschle and other \nDemocratic Senators in introducing the 21st Century Law Enforcement, \nCrime Prevention, and Victims Assistance Act. This comprehensive crime \nbill builds on prior Democratic crime initiatives, including the \nlandmark Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, that \nhave substantially reduced the Nations' serious crime rates.\n  Our current Attorney General, Janet Reno, has helped us all make \nunprecedented strides in combating violent crime, protecting women's \nrights, protecting crime victims rights and reducing violence against \nwomen. The Nation's serious crime rates have declined for an \nunprecedented eight straight years. Murder rates have fallen to their \nlowest levels in three decades, and since 1994, violent crimes by \njuveniles and the juvenile arrest rates for serious crimes have also \ndeclined. Our outgoing Attorney General must be commended for greatly \nimproving the effectiveness of our law enforcement coordination \nefforts, federal law enforcement assistance efforts and for extending \nthe reach of those efforts into rural areas.\n\n[[Page S221]]\n\n  The 21st Century Law Enforcement, Crime Prevention, and Victims \nAssistance Act is designed to keep our Nation's crime rates moving in \nthe right direction--downward. The Nation's serious crime rates are now \nat their lowest level since 1973, the first year the national crime \nvictimization survey was conducted. We are proud of the significant \nreduction in crime rates, but we must not become complacent. Too many \nAmericans still encounter violence in their neighborhoods, workplaces, \nand unfortunately, even in their homes. This bill would ensure that the \ncrime rates continue their downward trend next year, the year after, \nand beyond.\n  We should be able to enact this bill, without partisan or ideological \ncontroversy. We have tried to avoid the easy rhetoric about crime that \nsome have to offer in this crucial area of public policy. Instead, we \nhave crafted a bill that could actually make a difference.\n  The 21st Century Law Enforcement, Crime Prevention, and Victims \nAssistance Act targets violent crime in our schools, combats gang \nviolence, cracks down on the sale and use of illegal drugs, enhances \nthe rights of crime victims, fights crime against America's senior \ncitizens, and provides meaningful assistance to law enforcement \nofficers in the battle against street crime. The bill represents an \nimportant next step in the continuing effort by Senate Democrats to \nenact tough yet balanced reforms to our criminal justice system.\n  I should note that the bill contains no new death penalties and no \nnew or increased mandatory minimum sentences. We can be tough without \nimposing the death penalty, and we can ensure swift and certain \npunishment without removing all discretion from the judge at \nsentencing.\n  Title I of the bill deals with proposals for supporting Federal, \nState and local law enforcement and promoting the effective \nadministration of justice. this title extends the COPS program through \nfiscal year 2007, authorizing funding to deploy up to 50,000 additional \npolice officers, 10,000 additional prosecutors, and 10,000 indigent \ndefense attorneys in the coming years. The bill also extends Project \nExile, the Department of Justice's gun violence reduction initiative \ndesigned to prosecute felons who unlawfully possess firearms, and the \nYouth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, the national program to \ndisrupt the illegal supply of firearms to juveniles by tracing the guns \nthat are used in crimes, and it includes a provision sponsored by \nSenator Biden to authorize grants to alleviate the public safety risk \nposed by released prisoners by promoting their successful reintegration \ninto society.\n  Other important initiatives are included to protect children from \nviolence, including violence resulting from the misuse of guns. \nAmericans want concrete proposals to reduce the risk of such incidents \nrecurring. At the same time, we must preserve adults' rights to use \nguns for legitimate purposes, such as home protection, hunting and for \nsport. Title I of the bill imposes a prospective gun ban for juveniles \nconvicted or adjudicated delinquent for violent crimes. It also \nrequires revocation of a firearms dealer's license for failing to have \nsecure gun storage or safety devices available for sale with firearms. \nThe bill enhances the penalties for certain firearm laws involving \njuveniles. In addition, the bill would close the gun show loophole by \nrequiring criminal background checks on all gun sales at gun shows.\n  This title of the bill also recognizes that law enforcement officers \nput their lives on the line every day. According to the FBI, over 1,000 \nofficers have been killed in the line of duty since 1980. The 21st \nCentury Law Enforcement, Crime Prevention, and Victims Assistance Act \nestablishes new crimes and increases penalties for killing Federal \nofficers and persons working with Federal officers, including in their \nwork with Federal prisoners, and for retaliation against Federal \nofficials by threatening or injuring their family members. The bill \nenhances the penalty for assaults and threats against Federal judges \nand other federal officials engaged in their official duties.\n  A significant problem that arose during Special Prosecutor Kenneth \nStarr's investigation of president Clinton was the loss of \nconfidentiality that had previously attached to the important work of \nthe U.S. Secret Service. The Departments of Justice and Treasury and \neven a former Republican President advise that the safety of future \nPresidents may be jeopardized by forcing U.S. Secret Service agents to \nbreach the confidentiality they need to do their job by testifying \nbefore a grant jury. I trust the Secret Service on this issue; they are \nthe experts with the mission of protecting the lives of the President \nand other high-level official and visiting dignitaries. I also have \nconfidence in the judgment of former President Bush, who has written, \n``I feel very strongly that [Secret Service] agents should not be made \nto appear in court to discuss that which they might or might not have \nseen or heard.''\n  Title I of the 21st Century Law Enforcement, Crime Prevention, and \nVictims Assistance Act provides a reasonable and limited protective \nfunction privilege so future Secret Service agents are able to maintain \nthe confidentiality they say they need to protect the lives of the \nPresident, Vice President and visiting heads of state.\n  Title II of the bill is aimed at strengthening the Federal criminal \nlaws. This part of the bill cracks down on gangs by making the \ninterstate ``franchising'' of street gangs a crime. It would also \nincrease penalties for crimes during which the convicted felon wears \nprotective body armor or uses ``laser-sighting'' devices to commit the \ncrime, and doubles the maximum criminal penalties for using or \nthreatening physical violence against witnesses and contains other \nprovisions designed to facilitate the use and protection of witnesses \nto help prosecute gangs and other violent criminals.\n\n  Title II of the bill also details provisions for combating money \nlaundering. Crime increasingly has an international face, from drug \nkingpins to millionaire terrorists, like Osama bin Laden. The money \nlaundering provisions of this bill hit these international criminals \nwhere it hurts most--in the pocketbook.\n  These provisions would provide important tools not just to combat \ninternational terrorism but drug trafficking as well. We must have \ninterdiction, we must have treatment programs; we must tell kids to say \n``No'' to drugs. But we have to do more, and taking the profit away \nfrom international drug lords is an effective weapon. This Democratic \ncrime bill would strengthen these laws.\n  Title II also contains important initiatives to deter cargo thefts, \nenhance the maximum penalties for voluntary manslaughter, felony theft \nor conversion of grand jury material, counterfeiting, and certain \nantitrust violations committed by corporations.\n  Title III of the bill is intended to increase the rights of victims \nwithin the criminal justice system. The criminal is only half of the \nequation. This bill guarantees the rights of crime victims. All States \nrecognize victims' rights in some form, but they often lack the \ntraining and resources to make those rights a reality. This title \nprovides a model Bill of Rights for crime victims in the Federal \nsystem, and makes available to the States grants for victim-related \ntraining and state-of-the art notification systems. In addition, this \ntitle would authorize grants for pilot programs to operate Victim \nOmbudsman Information Centers in seven States, and to study the \neffectiveness of the restorative justice approach for victims. It would \nalso provide assistance for shelters and transitional housing for \nvictims of domestic violence. In short, this title would help make \nvictims' rights a reality.\n  This title of the bill also includes a number of provisions to \nimprove the safety and security of older Americans. During the 1990s, \nwhile overall crime rates dropped throughout the nation, the rate of \ncrime against seniors remained constant. In addition to the increased \nvulnerability of some seniors to violent crime, older Americans are \nincreasingly targeted by swindlers looking to take advantage of them \nthrough telemarketing schemes, pension fraud, and health care fraud. We \nmust strengthen the hand of law enforcement to combat those criminals \nwho plunder the savings that older Americans have worked their \nlifetimes to earn. The 21st Century Law Enforcement, Crime Prevention, \nand Victims Assistance Act tries to do exactly that,\n\n[[Page S222]]\n\nthrough a comprehensive package of proposals to establish new \nprotections and increase penalties for a wide variety of crimes against \nseniors.\n  Title IV of the bill outlines a number of prevention and alternative \nsentencing programs that are critical to further reducing juvenile \ncrime. These programs include grants to youth organizations and ``Say \nNo to Drugs'' Community Centers, and grants to promote drug testing and \ndrug treatment, as well as reauthorization of the Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools and Communities Program, the Anti-Drug Abuse Programs, and the \nLocal Deliquency Prevention Programs. Additional sections include a \nprogram suggested by Senator Bingaman to establish a competitive grant \nprogram to reduce truancy, with priority given to efforts to replicate \nsuccessful programs.\n  The bill would also reauthorize the Juvenile Justice and Deliquency \nPrevention Act and create a new juvenile justice block grant program, \nretaining the four core protections for youth in the juvenile justice \nsystem while adopting greater flexibility for rural areas.\n  In recent years, the Senate Republicans have tried to gut these core \nprotections in their juvenile crime bills. This Democratic crime bill \nputs ideology aside, and follows the advice of numerous child advocacy \nexperts--including the Children's Defense Fund, National Collaboration \nfor Youth, Youth Law Center and National Network for Youth--who believe \nthese key protections must be preserved in order to protect juveniles \nwho have been arrested or detained. These core protections ensure that \njuveniles are not housed with adults, do not have verbal or physical \ncontact with adult inmates, and any disproportionate confinement of \nminority youth is addressed by the States. If these protections are \nabolished, many more youth may end up committing suicide or being \nreleased with serious physical or emotional scars.\n  The 21st Century Law Enforcement, Crime Prevention, and Victims \nAssistance Act is a comprehensive and realistic set of proposals for \nassisting local enforcement, preventing crime, protecting our children \nand senior citizens, and assisting the victims of crime. I look forward \nto working on a bipartisan basis for passage of as much of this bill as \npossible during the 107th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Dorgan, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Biden, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 17.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Local Law Enforcement \n     Enhancement Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, or disability of the victim poses a \n     serious national problem.\n       (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive.\n       (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n     to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority \n     of violent crimes in the United States, including violent \n     crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) The prominent characteristic of a violent crime \n     motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual \n     victim and the victim's family and friends, but frequently \n     savages the community sharing the traits that caused the \n     victim to be selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including--\n       (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups \n     and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape \n     the incidence or risk of such violence; and\n       (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (7) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (8) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (9) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n       (10) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n       (11) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the \n     extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of \n     slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of \n     real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to \n     the extent such religions or national origins were regarded \n     as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and \n     15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (12) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes.\n       (13) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n     sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n     to warrant Federal assistance to States and local \n     jurisdictions.\n\n     SEC. 103.

The bill contains a number of \nimportant features that constitute a strong start for our work toward a \nnew farm bill.\n  In particular, I want to call attention to the provisions in this \nbill that will address directly the rapid changes occurring in the \nstructure of our food and agriculture industry and the impact those \nchanges are having on America's farm and ranch families and rural \ncommunities. This bill will give USDA new authority to deal with \neconomic concentration and consolidation in agriculture: to prevent \nmergers and acquisitions that damage farmers and rural communities and \nto prevent and take enforcement action against anti-competitive and \nunfair practices in dealings by agribusinesses with farmers.\n  The legislation also incorporates legislation I introduced in the \nprevious Congress to establish new protections for agricultural \nproducers who are involved in contracting arrangements with \nagribusiness processors and to establish new protections that will \nenhance the ability of agricultural producers to form associations to \nbargain effectively with processors and buyers of agricultural \nproducts.\n  I am also pleased that this bill incorporates my legislation to \ncreate a new fund that will spur new equity capital investment in rural \nareas. The legislation has the support of a wide range of the key \ninterested parties in providing and boosting financing and business \ninvestment in rural America. Clearly, if rural America is to grow, and \nif agricultural producers are to develop new value-added businesses, \nthere will have to be increased levels of equity capital investment in \nagricultural processing and other businesses. This bill will go a long \nway in putting more investment capital into rural communities.\n  This bill also makes a strong start toward improving the shortcomings \nof the commodity program provisions of the current farm bill. We have \nall observed the critical need for emergency assistance packages to \nshore up the Freedom to Farm bill over the past several years. But our \nfarm families and rural communities need a predictable and dependable \nsystem of farm income protection. This bill would provide for loan \nrates that are more realistic in light of current production costs in \norder to improve the farm income protection. It focuses on providing \nbetter assistance when it is needed, rather than simply making \nadditional fixed payments regardless of actual market conditions.\n  As I said, I believe the marketing assistance loan rate provisions in \nthis bill are a strong start. We recognize that under the current \nformula, even without the existing loan rate caps, the marketing loan \nrates would have declined quite substantially as market prices suffered \nin recent years. That means a less effective system of farm income \nprotection. However, further work and discussion on loan rate formulas \nand program details will be necessary as we work further on the next \nfarm bill. In particular, it is important that the relative loan rates \namong the various commodities are in balance. Of course, that is the \nmain objective of these provisions: to bring other loan rates into \nreasonable equivalence with the loan rates for oilseeds. But we do not \nwant to create any new inequality while trying to address what is now \nfelt to be an imbalance.\n  It is also important for us to contemplate the consequences of any \nchanges in loan rates that we may ultimately enact, including any \nimpacts on production levels and patterns, and impacts on the relative \nbenefits under the program for family-size farms in comparison with \nthose for much larger operations. For that reason I believe that there \nmust be some restriction or limitation on the quantity of production \nthat is eligible for higher loan rates. Otherwise, I am concerned that \nwe are providing only a small amount of help to family-size farms, but \nfar more to their larger and already better capitalized neighbors \nsimply because those larger farms are producing larger quantities of \nloan-eligible commodities. Similarly, if the loan rate is increased for \nevery unit of production of a given commodity on every farm, no matter \nhow large, we must consider the incentives for higher production that \nwill be put into markets that are in surplus.\n  The commodity provisions are, of course, only one part of a \ncomprehensive approach to a new farm bill. I very strongly believe that \nthe next farm bill should include a new program of incentives for farm \nand ranch conservation practices. In this way we will improve farm \nincome while also enhancing conservation of natural resources for our \nchildren and succeeding generations. I am not proposing a substitute \nfor existing conservation programs, nor am I proposing to abandon \ncommodity and farm income protection programs. But I believe that we \ncan accomplish a great deal by adding to our farm policy a new \nconservation incentive program.\n  Again, I am pleased to cosponsor this bill and look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to work further together on crafting a new \nfarm bill.\n\n[[Page S260]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Breaux, Mr. DeWine, \n        Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Smith of Oregon, \n        and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 22. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nprovide meaningful campaign finance reform through requiring better \nreporting, decreasing the role of soft money, and increasing individual \ncontribution limits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n\n\n          open and accountable campaign financing act of 2001\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today, I join several of my colleagues, \nincluding the Presiding Officer, in introducing the Open and \nAccountable Campaign Financing Act of 2001, S. 22. I am pleased to be \njoined by not only the Presiding Officer, my new colleague from \nNebraska, but also by Senators Landrieu, Breaux, DeWine, Hutchison, \nSmith of New Hampshire, and Thomas, in introducing this legislation \ntoday.\n  I also want to acknowledge the two Senators who have led the fight on \ncampaign finance reform over the years--John McCain and Russ Feingold. \nTheir commitment to this issue and leadership has elevated the debate \non this very important part of our democratic system. They deserve \nrecognition and they deserve credit.\n  Mr. President, S. 22 has three primary components, as you know. \nFirst, it expands and codifies disclosure for candidates, political \nparties and all organizations and individuals who participate in the \npolitical process.\n  Second, it caps and regulates soft money donations to the National \npolitical parties.\n  Third, it increases hard money contribution limits and then indexes \nthese limits to inflation for future years.\n  Our Federal campaign finance system is broken. As all of us know, in \npolitics, as in life, perception is an important dynamic of reality. \nThe American people's perception of the integrity of our political \nsystem is directly connected to their confidence in the system. \nAmericans see a political system controlled by special interests and \nthose able to pump in millions of unaccountable dollars.\n  As our citizens become demoralized and detached because they feel \nthey are powerless, they lower their expectations and standards for \ngovernment and our officeholders. As a result, the American people are \nlosing confidence in our system. They are losing trust in their elected \nofficials. We need to fix the system.\n  The Senate will engage in an open, honest and wide-ranging debate on \ncampaign finance reform this year, as it should be.\n  The debate must be thoughtful, factual and deliberate. Any \nlegislative action will have immense consequences for our political \nsystem and all who participate in it. S. 22 represents a strong, \nbipartisan foundation from which consensus can be built and real \ncampaign finance reform can be established.\n  Our bill is imperfect. It does not address all of the issues. It does \nnot have all of the answers. But it is a genuine attempt to bring about \nreal reforms, including greater disclosure and more accountability. \nGreater disclosure, I believe, is the heart of campaign finance reform. \nWe should not fear an educated and informed body politic. We should \nencourage it.\n  In recent years, so-called independent groups and individuals have \nplayed and increasingly dominant role in the political process \nlaunching late TV blitzes, moving poll numbers in the final weeks and \ndays of a campaign, and then disappearing without the public ever \nknowing who they were and how much they spent for or against the \ncandidate.\n  There are several provisions in S. 22 that will increase the \ndisclosure of campaign financing and election activity. But the most \nsignificant is the provision affecting what information is made public \nregarding political broadcast ads, especially ads referred to as issue \nadvocacy ads.\n  Issue advocacy adds generally refer to a Federal candidate and his or \nher positions on issues, but since the ads do not expressly advocate \nthe election or defeat of a Federal candidate, they don't trigger the \nreporting and disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign \nAct. Even though these ads don't expressly advocate for or against any \ncandidate, many people consider the clear intent of these ads, which is \nto influence the outcome of elections.\n  Our legislation addresses the problems associated with the disclosure \nof these issue ads by requiring disclosure of the relevant information \nat the broadcast stations who broadcast these ads both on radio and TV.\n  Currently, broadcast stations must comply with Federal communications \nregulations requiring them to place in their public file information on \nads run by Federal candidates and political parties. This includes a \nrecord of the times the spots are scheduled to air, the overall amount \nof time purchased, and at what rates, and the names of the officers of \nthe organization placing the ad.\n\n  However, presently, there is no requirement that any of this \ninformation be placed in the public file for political ads run by \nindependent organizations or individuals. Our legislation will codify \nthese regulations and expand them to cover all political broadcast ads \nwithout violating anyone's constitutional rights. Under this bill, the \nAmerican public and the media will know who is buying these ads and how \nmuch they are spending for the ads.\n  Also, let me make clear one thing this provision does not do. It does \nnot require organizations to identify individual donors or provide \nmembership lists. It preserves a reasonable balance between the \npublic's right to know and the privacy rights of members and donors.\n  In addition to increased disclosure, this legislation regulates and \ncaps soft money donations. It limits individuals, independent \norganizations, corporations, and unions, to an aggregate of $60,000 per \nyear in soft money contributions to the national political parties. \nThese donations are disclosed at the Federal Election Commission.\n  We already have constitutionally tested limits on hard money. \nPolitical parties have to deal with this. These contributions are \nreported from the political parties and from the candidates and their \ncampaigns. We should look at placing limits on soft money contributions \nas well.\n  This legislation also adjusts the hard money, or Federal \ncontributions, that is are already fully disclosed to and regulated by \nthe Federal Election Commission.\n  Currently, an individual contribution limit is now set at $1,000. \nThat limit was originally set in 1974. Our legislation would move that \ncurrent $1,000 limit to $3,000 per candidate per election. Indexed to \ninflation, today a 1974 $1,000 contribution is worth $3,000. In future \nyears, all individual limits would be indexed to inflation. This would \nhave a positive effect on the system because more campaign money would \ngo directly to the candidates, where there is the most disclosure and \naccountability.\n  Any legislation to reform America's campaign finance system needs to \nreverse the sharply rising trend of moneys going outside the reportable \nsystem toward unaccountable, independent groups and individuals who do \nnot report, who are not required to report or disclose. That trend has \nbeen more and more away from the candidates in the political parties.\n  We must also ensure that any campaign finance reform genuinely \nimproves the system and doesn't result in unintended consequences that \nactually make it worse. The challenge in reforming our campaign finance \nsystem to do so without infringing upon the constitutional rights of \nAmericans to freely express themselves under the first amendment and \nthe guarantees of equal protection under the law in the fifth \namendment.\n  Any effort, no matter how well-intentioned, that doesn't pass \nconstitutional muster will be an effort in futility, adding further to \nthe erosion of public confidence in our system. Congress has an \nopportunity this year to pass a relevant and responsible campaign \nfinance reform bill that the President will sign.\n  My colleagues and I will be fully engaged in this debate this year \nwith the ultimate goal of making our campaign finance system more open \nand accountable--the essence of any reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. LOTT (for Mr. Specter):\n\n[[Page S261]]\n\n  S. 23. A bill to promote a new urban agenda, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    the new urban agenda act of 2001\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President. I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation that will address the plight of our nation's cities. With \n80 percent of the U.S. population living in metropolitan areas, there \nis an urgent need to improve our urban economies and the quality of \nlife for the millions of Americans who live and work in cities. By \nsimply making our cities an appealing place to live, work, and visit, \nurban areas can rebound to the vibrant economic centers they once were.\n  There is a common perception that most urban areas are abandoned and \nstripped of their resources, burdened with poverty and crime. However, \ncities have a wealth of resources available to not only the urban \ndweller, but to cultural centers, business hubs, and some of the finest \neducational and medical institutions. The real problem is that we do \nnot draw upon these riches or strive to better coordinate them to serve \npeople, especially those in need.\n  My proposal, the ``New Urban Agenda Act of 2001,'' is based on \nlegislation which I have endeavored to enact into law since the 103rd \nCongress. The bill constitutes an effort to give our cities some much-\nneeded attention, but reflects the federal budgetary constraints which \ngovern our actions in Congress. This bill, based in significant part on \nsuggestions by Former Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell and the \nLeague of Cities as well as current Philadelphia Mayor John Street and \nPittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy, offers aid to the cities while containing \nfederal expenditures and re-instituting important cost-effective tax \nbreaks.\n  Urban areas remain integral to America's greatness as centers of \ncommerce, industry, education, health care, and culture. Yet urban \nareas, particularly the inner cities which tend to have a \ndisproportionate share of our nation's poor, also have special needs \nwhich must be recognized. We must develop ways of aiding our cities \nthat do not require either new taxes or more government bureaucracy.\n  With that in mind, I am pleased that Congress recognized included an \ninitiative to aid our cities in the fiscal year 2001 Omnibus \nAppropriations Act. This initiative provides important incentives for \nbusinesses to invest and locate in our nation's cities by stimulating \nnew private capital investments in economically distressed communities, \nexpanding empowerment zones, increasing the low income housing tax \ncredit, creating new market venture capital firms, and creating 40 \nRenewal Communities, which will provide additional key incentives to \nspur investment. I am particularly pleased that a close variation of a \nprovision from my Urban Agenda bill was included as part of this \ninitiative, which will provide a 60 percent exclusion for capital gains \ntax purposes for any gain resulting from targeted investments in small \nbusinesses located in urban empowerment zones, enterprise communities, \nor enterprise zones. A targeted capital gain will serve as a catalyst \nfor job creation and economic growth in our cities by encouraging \nadditional private investment in our urban areas. While all of these \ninitiatives are an important first step in assisting our cities, I \nbelieve that there is still more that needs to be accomplished to \nrevitalize America's metropolitan areas.\n  If we are to address many of the serious social issues that we face--\nunemployment, drug abuse, juvenile violence, welfare dependency, and \nother pressing issues--we cannot give up on our cities. We must \ncontinue to develop new strategies for dealing with the problems of \nurban America. The days of creating ``Great Society'' federal aid \nprograms are clearly past, but that is no excuse for the national \ngovernment to ignore the problems of the cities.\n  As a Philadelphia resident, I have first-hand knowledge of the \ngrowing problems that plague our cities. I have long supported a \nvariety of programs to assist our cities, such as increased funding for \nCommunity Development Block Grants and legislation to establish \nenterprise and empowerment zones. To encourage similar efforts, in \nApril 1994, I hosted my Senate Republican colleagues on a visit to \nexplore urban problems in my hometown. We talked with people who wanted \nto obtain work, but had discovered few opportunities. We saw a \ncrumbling infrastructure and its impact on residents and businesses. We \nwere reminded of the devastating effect that the loss of inner city \nbusinesses and jobs has had on our neighborhoods. What my Republican \ncolleagues saw in Philadelphia is the urban rule across our country, \nnot the exception.\n  There are many who do not know of city life, who are far removed from \nthe cities and would not be expected to have any key interest in what \ngoes on in the big cities of America. I cite my own boyhood experience \nillustratively: Born in Wichita, Kansas, raised in Russell, a small \ntown of 5,000 people on the plains of Kansas, where there is not much \ndetailed knowledge of what goes on in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, or \nother big cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Miami, \nPittsburgh, Dallas, Detroit or Chicago.\n  Those big cities are alien to many in America. But there is a growing \nunderstanding that the problems of big cities contribute significantly \nto the general problems affecting our nation as a whole and have an \neconomic impact, at the very least, on our small towns. For rural \nAmerica to prosper, we need to make sure that urban America prospers \nand vice-versa. For example, if cities had more economic growth, taxes \ncould be reduced on all Americans at the federal and state level \nbecause revenues would increase and social welfare spending would be \nreduced.\n\n  There is indeed a domino effect from our cities to rural communities \nthroughout the country. Lately, we have witnessed this in the violent \nbehavior of adolescents. School violence, juvenile crime and drug abuse \nare no longer endemic to urban living. Take the Bloods and the Crips \ngangs from Los Angeles, California, and similar gangs; that are all \nover America. They are in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Des Moines, Iowa; \nPortland, Oregon; Jackson, Mississippi, Racine, Wisconsin; and \nMartinsburg, West Virginia. They are literally everywhere, big city and \nsmall city alike. Additionally, while drug abuse among teens has \nhistorically been viewed solely as an inner city problem, recent \nstatistics indicate that teen drug abuse in the suburbs is an \nincreasing epidemic. According to an October 10, 1999 Philadelphia \nInquirer article, in the seven county Philadelphia suburbs, the rate of \nyouths in treatment for heroin jumped from 77 to 84 per 100,000 people \nbetween 1995 and 1998. In the Baltimore suburbs, 25 percent of teens \nadmitted to drug treatment centers used heroin compared to 17 percent \nin inner city Baltimore.\n  In the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's 2000 report \non the ``State of the Cities,'' findings show that large urban schools \nstill deal with a higher concentration of violence, and the data only \nrepresents crimes which were serious enough to report to the police. An \nestimated 3 million crimes each year are committed in or near the \nnation's 85,000 public schools. During the 1996-97 school year alone, \none-fifth of public high schools and middle schools reported at least \none violent crime, such as murder, rape or robbery. More than half \nreported less serious crimes. Homicide is now the third leading cause \nof death for children age 10 to 14. For more than a decade it has been \nthe leading cause of death among minority youth between the ages of 15 \nand 24. The School District of Philadelphia's most recent report on \nschool violence shows that in the 1994-1995 academic year, students, \nteachers and administrators were the victims of 2,147 reported criminal \nincidents, up by almost 100% from the previous year. These included \nassault, robbery, rape, and students being stabbed or even shot. The \nschool district also reported troubling news about abysmal attendance \nrates. On any given day, more than one in every four students are \nabsent.\n  In an effort to seriously address the problem of youth violence, \nduring the summer of 1999, I convened three extensive roundtable \ndiscussions with experts from the Department of Education, Health and \nHuman Services, Labor and Justice, who administer programs targeted at \nchildren from prenatal to age seventeen. On June 7, 1999, I chaired a \ndiscussion session on at-risk youth as part of the White House \nConference on Mental Health. As a result of these meeting, $911 million \nin\n\n[[Page S262]]\n\nfiscal year 2000 and $1.6 billion in fiscal year 2001 have been \nreallocated across government agencies to tackle the problem of youth \nviolence, focusing on the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program, mental \nhealth services for children, character education, and literacy \nprograms. These programs pick up on the conclusion that Surgeon General \nKoop made in 1982--that juvenile violence is a national health problem.\n  I am pleased to note that the HUD 2000 ``State of the cities'' report \nfound that the national poverty rate declined from 13.7% in 1996 to \n12.7% in 1998. Encouragingly, the poverty rate also decreased in \ncentral cities during this same period from 19.6% to 18.5%. However, \ndespite the dramatic record of job gains, one in eight cities still \nfaces high unemployment and significant population loss or high poverty \nrates. The report further found that the overall poverty rate in the \ncities remains twice that of the suburbs. In fact, there are 67 large \ncities that have an unemployment rate of 50% or higher than the U.S. \nrate. These facts emphasize the need for more efforts to be focused on \nstrengthening our inner city businesses which, in turn, will boost \nlocal economies and serve to provide more jobs, reduce poverty and, \nhopefully, reduce crime.\n  To facilitate economic development and job creation in the United \nStates, I supported the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which contained \nsuch provisions as the Job Training Partnership Act and the Targeted \nJob Tax Credit. As Congress put the final touches on that legislation, \nI circulated a joint letter with several Senators to then-Majority \nLeader Dole and Speaker Gingrich which recommended several new urban \ninitiatives to spur job creation and economic growth in our cities such \nas a targeted capital gains exclusion, commercial revitalization tax \ncredit, historic rehabilitation tax credit, and child care credit. In \n1998, I introduced the ``Job Preparation and Retention Training Act,'' \nwhich was included in the Workforce Development act of 1998. My \nlegislation authorized funding for States to enroll long-term welfare \ndependents into a training program to provide the necessary skills to \nlocate and maintain gainful and unsubsidized employment.\n  A number of jobs are becoming available in the high tech industry and \nhigh tech growth is a substantial contributor to recent economic gains \nin cities. According to the HUD 2000 ``State of the Cities'' report, \nhigh tech jobs account for 27% of new employment in cities. However, \nthere is anew digital divide in high tech jobs between cities and \nsuburbs. High tech job growth in suburbs is 30% faster than that of \ncities. In effort to bridge the digital divide, I was an original \ncosponsor with Senator Biden of the ``Kids 2000'' legislation, which \nwould authorize $120 million to build computer technology centers in \nBoys and Girls Clubs nationwide and allow the funds to be used to pay \nfor computer teachers, who are crucial to the success of this \ninitiative. The federal funds would be complemented by donations from \nprivate sources. I have also been supportive of collaborative efforts \nlike PowerUp, founded by America Online (AOL) Chief Executive Steve \nCase, which joins non-profit organizations, major corporations, and \nFederal agencies to help close the digital divide. The goal of this \ninitiative is to help ensure that America's underserved youth acquire \nthe skills, experiences, and resources they need to succeed in the \ndigital age. Initiatives like Kids 2000 and PowerUp are steps in the \nright direction to provide American children with the skills necessary \nto compete in an increasingly technologically-advanced workforce. These \ninitiatives offer training for those segments of the American \npopulation which currently have no opportunity to learn these \ntechnology-based skills, and thus offer extraordinary employment and \nearning possibilities.\n\n  Each day, small business owners question whether they should remain \nin the city because they fear for the safety of their children, their \nemployees, and, ultimately, their businesses. I have personally met and \nspoken with shop owners in the University City section of Philadelphia \nwho tell me that they look desperately for reasons to stay, but it gets \nharder and harder.\n  I have long supported efforts to encourage the growth of small \nbusiness, as small businesses provide the bulk of the jobs in this \ncountry. To that end, I am again introducing legislation to provide \ntargeted tax incentives for investing in small minority or women-owned \nbusinesses called ``Minority and Women Capital Formation Act.'' Many \nminority entrepreneurs, for instance, have told me that they are \ndedicated to staying in the cities to continue to provide employment \nopportunities, but continue to face difficulty in obtaining the \nnecessary capital. My legislation would help remove the capital access \nbarriers, thereby enabling these entrepreneurs to grow their businesses \nand payrolls.\n  The economic problems our cities are facing are not easy to deal with \nor answer. Municipal leaders stress many of the same concerns that \nbusiness people have voiced. Additionally, in a report by the National \nLeague of Cities entitled ``City Fiscal Conditions in 1996,'' municipal \nofficials from 381 cities answered questions on the economic state of \ntheir cities. The report found that 21.7 percent of responding cities \nreduced municipal employment and 18.5 percent had frozen municipal \nemployment due to state budgetary problems. Nearly six out of ten \ncities raised or imposed new taxes or user fees during the past twelve \nmonths.\n  These numbers are of concern to me and I believe they highlight the \nneed for federal legislation to enhance the ability of cities to \nachieve competitive economic status. An added concern is that city \nmanagers are forced to balance cuts in services or enact higher taxes. \nNeither choice is easy, and it often counteracts municipal efforts to \nretain residents or businesses.\n  One issue in particular that is hurting many cities is the erosion of \ntheir tax bases, evidenced particularly by middle-class flight to the \nsuburbs. Mr. Ronald Waiters, professor of Political Science at Howard \nUniversity, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, stated \nthat in 1950, 23 percent of American's lived outside central cities; by \n1998, that number rose to 46 percent. The District of Columbia's \npopulation loss is among the worst in the nation, with a quarter of its \npopulation relocating to the suburbs since the 1970s. This trend of \nshrinking urban populations gives no sign of ending. Middle-class \nfamilies continue to leave for the suburbs where there are typically \nbetter public services. According to the September 2000 General \nAccounting Office Report on Community Development, over 50 percent of \nU.S. cities reported that an inadequate tax base for supporting schools \nand services was among their top four growth related challenges. As \nAmerica's cities struggle with the exodus of residents, businesses and \nindustry, city, residents who remain are faced with problems ranging \nfrom increased tax burdens and lesser services to dwindling economic \nopportunities, leading to welfare dependence and unemployment \nassistance.\n  The September 2000 General Accounting Office Report on Community \nDevelopment also found that of the 2000 cities surveyed, 83 percent \nreported that revitalizing their downtown areas was their top priority. \nThe federal government has attempted to revitalize our ailing urban \ninfrastructure by providing federal funding for transit and sewer \nsystems, roads and bridges. As a member of the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have been a strong supporter of public \ntransit, which provides critically needed transportation services in \nurban areas. Transit helps cities meet clean air standards, reduce \ntraffic congestion, and allows disadvantaged persons access to jobs. \nFederal assistance for urban areas, however, has become increasingly \nscarce as we grapple with the nation's deficit and debt. Therefore, we \nmust find alternatives to reinvigorate out nation's cities so they can \nonce again become economically productive areas providing promising \nopportunities for residents and neighboring areas. To address the need \nfor reliable transportation systems in our nation's cities and to \nprovide access to jobs for city residents, I introduced reverse commute \nand jobs access legislation, which was successfully included in the \n1998 ``TEA-21'' highway and transit reauthorization bill. The bill \nauthorized over five years access-to-jobs transit grants targeted at \nlow-income individuals. Up to $10 million per year may be used for \nreverse commute projects to move individuals from cities to suburban \njob centers.\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\n  In addition to support for infrastructure, I believe there are many \nother opportunities for Congress to assist the America's urban areas. \nOver the past few years, I have worked with Former Mayor Ed Rendell to \ndevelop a legislative package which contains many good ideas. I have \ntaken many of these suggestions and have since added and revised \nprovisions to take into account new developments at the federal, state \nand local levels to create the ``New Urban Agenda Act of 2001.''\n\n  First, recognizing that the federal government is the nation's \nlargest purchaser of goods and services, my legislation would require \nthat no less than 15 percent of federal government purchases be made \nfrom businesses and industries within designated urban Empowerment \nZones, Enterprise Communities and Renewal Communities. Similarly, my \nbill would required that no less than 15 percent of foreign aid funds \nbe redeemed through purchases of products manufactured in urban \nEmpowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities and Renewal Communities. The \nGeneral Services Administration would be required to submit to Congress \nits assessment of the extent to which federal agencies are committed to \nthis policy, and in general, economic revitalization in distressed \nurban areas.\n  The second major provision of this bill would commit the federal \ngovernment to play an active role in restoring the economic health of \nour cities by encouraging the location, or relocation, of all federal \nfacilities in urban areas. To accomplish this, all federal agencies \nwould be required to prepare and submit to the President an Urban \nImpact Statement detailing the impact that relocation or downsizing \ndecisions would have on the affected city. Presidential approval would \nbe required to place a federal facility outside an urban area, or to \ndownsize a city-based agency.\n  The third critical component of this bill would revive and expand \nfederal tax incentives that were eliminated or restricted in the Tax \nRelief Act of 1986. Until there is passage of legislation on the flat \ntax, which would provide benefits superior to all targeted tax breaks, \nI believe America's cities should have the advantages of such tax \nbenefits. These provisions offer meaningful incentives to businesses to \ninvest in our cities. I am calling for the restoration of the Historic \nRehabilitation Tax Credit which supports inner city revitalization \nprojects. According to the September 2000 GAO Report on Community \nDevelopment, 32 percent of cities and 22 percent of counties surveyed \nstrongly supported the extension of federal tax benefits to the \nrehabilitation of historic residential properties. The City of \nPhiladelphia reports that there were 8,640 construction jobs involved \nin 356 projects in Philadelphia from 1978 to 1985 stimulated by the \nHistoric Rehabilitation Tax Credit, which was eliminated in 1986. In \nChicago, 302 projects prior to 1985 generated $524 million in \ninvestment and created 20,695 jobs. In St. Louis, 849 projects \ngenerated $653 million in investment and created 27,735 jobs. \nNationally, according to National Park Service estimates for the 16 \nyears before the 1986 Act, the Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit \nstimulated $16 billion in private investment for the rehabilitation of \n24,656 buildings and the creation of 125,306 homes which included \n23,377 low and moderate income housing units. The 1986 Tax Act \ndramatically reduced the pool of private investment capital available \nfor rehabilitation projects. In Philadelphia, projects dropped from 356 \nto 11 by 1988 from 1985 levels. During the same period, investments \ndropped 46 percent in Illinois and 92 percent in St. Louis.\n  Another tool is to expand the authorization of commercial industrial \ndevelopment bonds. Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, authorization for \ncommercial industrial bonds was permitted to expire. Consequently, \nprivate investment in cities declined. For instance, according to the \nCity of Philadelphia, from 1986--the last year commercial development \nbonds were permitted--to 1987, the total number of city-supported \nprojects in Philadelphia was reduced by more than half.\n  Industrial development or private activity bonds encourage private \ninvestment by allowing, under certain circumstances, tax-exempt status \nfor projects where more than 10 percent of the bond proceeds are used \nfor private business purposes. The availability of tax-exempt \ncommercial industrial development bonds will encourage private \ninvestment in cities, particularly the construction of sports, \nconvention and trade show facilities; parking facilities owned and \noperated by the private sector; air and water pollution facilities \nowned and operated by the private sector and industrial parks. My bill \nwould also increase the small issue exemption, which provides a way to \nhelp finance private activity in the building of manufacturing \nfacilities from $10 million to $50 million to allow increased private \ninvestment in our cities.\n  A minor change in the federal tax code related to arbitrage rebates \non municipal bond interest earnings could also free additional capital \nfor infrastructure and economic development by cities. Currently, \nmunicipalities are required to rebate to the federal government any \narbitrage--a financial term meaning interest earned in excess of \ninterest paid on the debt--earned from the issuance of tax-free \nmunicipal bonds. I understand that compliance, or the cost for \nconsultants to perform the complicated rebate calculations, is actually \ncosting municipalities more than the actual rebate owed to the \ngovernment. This bill would allow cities to keep the arbitrage earned \nso that they can use it to fund city projects and for other necessary \npurposes.\n  A fourth provision of this legislation provides needed reforms to \nregulations and the financial challenges to obtaining affordable \nhousing. My proposal provides language to study streamlining federal \nhousing program assistance to urban areas into a block grant form so \nthat municipal agencies can better serve local residents. Safe, clean, \nand affordable housing is not widely available to most low income \nfamilies. According to the National Housing Law Project, in 1996, only \none in four families was eligible to receive HUD assistance with a \nwaiting period up to five years. This provision of the bill steers the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development to take a hard look at these \nconditions and determine what works and what does not in federally-\nsubsidized housing and to consider alternatives that will provide \nsuitable homes for America's families.\n\n  I believe that as a nation we should work toward providing \nindividuals and their families with more opportunities for home \nownership which stabilizes a community and restores our cities. Urban \nhome ownership, including middle-income home ownership, lags behind the \nsuburbs. According to the Harvard University Joint Center for Housing \nStudies, city residents of all income levels are less likely to own a \nhome than suburban residents with similar incomes. I hear time and time \nagain from families starting out that they move out to the suburbs for \nbetter schools, because central cities lack the property tax base to \nprovide a quality education. Home ownership is key to saving our \ncities, both socially and economically. A 1998 Fannie Mae national \nhousing survey indicated that even though home ownership rates \ncontinued to increase in the late 1990s, six in every ten renters said \nthat buying a home was a very important priority, if not their number-\none priority in life. Yet for so many families financial barriers make \nthat dream unattainable. That is why my legislation includes two \nprovisions to restore the American dream of home ownership.\n  First, my bill would amend the National Affordable Housing Act and \nthe Community Development Block Act of 1974 to make municipal employees \nsuch as policemen, firemen, maintenance workers and teachers eligible \nfor home ownership assistance. Municipal employees and teachers \ncontribute to the health, safety and vitality of the communities in \nwhich they serve. However, escalating rent and housing prices due to \nthe booming technology market and rising salaries have made it \nparticularly difficult for teachers, police officers and city workers \nto live where they work. In a growing number of metropolitan areas, \nhome buyers who make the median income in their region cannot afford \nits median-priced housing, and therefore, must live outside the \ncommunity in which they work, resulting in longer commutes. According \nto the September 2000 GAO Report, the shortage of funding for \naffordable housing in urban areas has forced people to move to the \nfringes of\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\nmetropolitan areas, where housing is typically less expensive. This \nprovision would seek to remedy this situation by providing communities \nwith the tools needed to increase home ownership opportunities for \nthose who form the backbone of our cities and who are an integral \ncomponent of our commitment to revitalize our urban areas.\n  Second, my bill would provide a tax credit for income-eligible \nindividuals and families to purchase homes in distressed areas. In the \n1999 Taxpayer Relief Act, Congress approved such a tax credit for home \nbuyers in the District of Columbia. While single family home sales can \nbe attributed to a multitude of factors, such as historically low \ninterest rates and a strong economy, it is important to note some \ninteresting statistics related to home ownership since enactment of the \ntax credit in the District of Columbia. The Home Purchase Assistance \nProgram through the District of Columbia's Office of Housing and \nCommunity Development helped 410 families purchase homes. Further, a \ngroup called the ``Washington Partners for Home ownership,'' a \ncollaboration of realtors, banks, community and faith-based \norganizations, set a goal last year to create 1,000 new homeowners in \nthe District of Columbia for each of the next three years. Remarkably, \nthe Washington Partners reached that goal before the end of the first \nyear. I believe that this country will reap extraordinary benefits if \nwe expand such a credit on a national basis, as I propose in the ``New \nUrban Agenda Act of 2001.''\n  I believe that the revitalization of cities will require social and \neconomic facets, but is also imperative that our cities are safe and \nclean. This last component of my bill helps urban areas to address \ntheir unique environmental challenges and reforms Superfund law. First, \nthe legislation authorizes a federal brownfields program to help clean \nup idle or underused industrial and commercial facilities and waives \nfederal liability for persons who fully comply with a state cleanup \nplan to clean sites in urban and other areas pursuant to state law, \nprovided that the site is not listed or proposed to be listed on the \nNational Priorities List. The Environmental Protection Agency currently \noperates this pilot program under general authority provided by the \nSuperfund law. My legislation would make this a permanent program and \nsubstantially increase the funding levels to a $100 million authorized \nlevel for Fiscal Year 2002, $105 million for Fiscal Year 2003, and $110 \nmillion for Fiscal Year 2004. The EPA could expend funds to identify \nand examine potential idle or underused Brownfield sites and to provide \ngrants to States and local governments of up to $200,000 per site to \nput them back to productive use. One such grant has been used to great \nsuccess to Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy, and I hope this provision will \ngenerate additional success stories of redeveloping urban brownfields.\n  The Brownfields Program allows sites with minor levels of toxic waste \nto be cleaned up by State and local governments with federal and other \nfunding sources. Companies and individuals who are interested in \ndeveloping land into industrial, commercial, recreational, \nor residential use are often reluctant to purchase property with any \nlevel of toxic waste because of a fear of being saddled with cleanup \nliability under the Superfund law. Through expanded Brownfields grants, \ncleanup at such sites will be expedited and will encourage \nredevelopment of otherwise unusable property.\n\n  My bill would also waive federal liability for persons who fully \ncomply with a state cleanup plan to clean sites in urban or other areas \npursuant to state law, providing that the site is not listed or \nproposed to be listed on the National Priorities List. Many states, \nincluding Pennsylvania, have developed their own toxic waste cleanup \nprograms and have done good work to clean up many of these sites. \nPennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge has developed an extensive plan, where \ncontaminated sites are made safe based on sound science by returning \nthe site to productive use through the development of uniform cleanup \nstandards, by creating a set of standardized review procedures, by \nreleasing owners and developers from liability who fully comply with \nthe state cleanup standards and procedures, and by providing financial \nassistance. However, the efforts of states like Pennsylvania are often \nstifled because the federal government has not been willing to work \nwith the States to release owners and developers from liability, even \nwhen they fully comply with the state plans.\n  This section of my bill only applies to sites that are not on the \nNational Priorities List. These are sites that the state has identified \nfor which the state has created a comprehensive cleanup plan. If the \nfederal government has concerns with the cleanup procedure or the \nsafety of the site, then the government has full authority to place \nthat site on the National Priority List. The plans, like that developed \nby Governor Ridge, deal with sites not controlled by the Superfund law. \nBy not allowing the individual states to take the initiative to clean \nup these sites, and by not providing a waiver for federal liability to \nthose who fully comply with the procedures and standards of the state \ncleanup, the federal government impedes the efforts of the states to \nwork to clean up their own sites. This provision takes a significant \nstep toward encouraging states to take the responsibility for their \ntoxic waste sites and to encourage the effective cleanup of these sites \nin our nation's urban areas.\n  Mr. President, we must take a comprehensive approach to reversing \nurban decay. My bill seeks to accomplish this by requiring increased \nfederal and foreign aid purchases operating in urban zones, a restoring \nof the issuance of tax free industrial development bonds, facilitating \nhome ownership in urban areas, and providing regulatory relief to \nredevelop brownfield sites. As one of a handful of United States \nSenators who lives in a big city, I have a special understanding of \nboth the problems and the promise of urban America. I am committed to a \nnew urban agenda which relies on market forces, not a welfare state, \nfor urban revitalization. While the issues facing our nation's cities \nare indeed difficult, working together with my colleagues I believe we \ncan fashion a strong plan of action to help cities face their pressing \nproblems.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 23\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide improved access to health care, enhance \ninformed individual choice regarding health care services, lower health \ncare costs through the use of appropriate providers, improve the \nquality of health care, improve access to long-term care, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   health care assurance act of 2001\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as the 107th Congress commences, those of \nus elected to serve in the most evenly divided Senate and House in \nhistory recognize that whatever our parties' differences may be, we \nhave a new opportunity to make a positive impact on the lives of the \nAmerican people. The narrow margins in both legislative bodies offer us \na chance to learn from the past, determine how best to respond to the \nchallenges that are before us, and forge important alliances which will \nenable us to pass legislation important to this nation. I believe it is \nclear that one of our first priorities must be additional incremental \nreforms of our health care system.\n  There is no time to waste. Many of our nation's health care problems \nare getting worse, not better. In its April 2000 report, the Employee \nBenefit Research Institute (EBRI) analyzed the March 1999 Current \nPopulation Survey, a document generated yearly by the U.S. Census \nBureau. EBRI's analysis tells us that in 1998, about 194.7 million \nworking-age Americans derived their health insurance coverage as \nfollows: approximately 65 percent from employer plans; 10.4 percent \nfrom Medicare and Medicaid within a total of 14.0 percent from public \nsources of coverage; and 7 percent from other private insurance. While \nthis survey shows us where the insured are obtaining their coverage, it \nalso details a troubling statistic: 43.9 million Americans, or 18 \npercent of Americans aged 18-64, were uninsured. While the rate of \ngrowth of the number of uninsured is slowing, our goal of actually \nreducing the number of people without access to health coverage and \nservices remains clear.\n  As I have said many times, we can fix the problems felt by uninsured \nAmericans without resorting to big government and without completely \noverhauling our current system, one that works well for most \nAmericans--serving 81.6 percent of our non-elderly citizens. We must \nenact reforms that improve upon our current market-based health care \nsystem, as it is clearly the best health care system in the world.\n  Accordingly, today I am introducing the Health Care Assurance Act of \n2001, which, if enacted, will take us further down the path of the \nincremental reforms started by the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act of 1996 (Kassebaum-Kennedy) and various health care \nprovisions enacted during the 105th and 106th Congresses. I would note \nthat the final version of Kassebaum-Kennedy contained many elements \nwhich were in S. 18, the incremental health care reform bill I \nintroduced when the 104th Congress began on January 4, 1995.\n  The bill I am introducing today is distinct from my longstanding \nefforts regarding managed care reform. During the 105th and 106th \nCongresses, I joined a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce the \nPromoting Responsible Managed Care Act of 1998 and 1999, balanced \nproposals which would ensure that patients receive the benefits and \nservices to which they are entitled, without compromising the savings \nand coordination of care that can be achieved through managed care.\n  The managed care debate, which aims to improve insurance coverage for \nthose who already have it, stands in stark contrast to the Health Care \nAssurance Act of 2001. My bill is intended to provide access to \ninsurance coverage for those who have never even had the option to \npurchase it--or who simply could not afford it--due to market \nconstraints.\n  Given the importance of enacting this type of legislation, it is \nworth reviewing recent history which has taught us that bipartisanship \nis crucial in accomplishing any goal. In particular, the debate over \nPresident Clinton's Health Security Act during the 103rd Congress is \nreplete with lessons concerning the pitfalls that inevitably lead to \nlegislative failure. Several times during the 103rd Congress, I spoke \non the Senate floor to address what seemed to be the wisest course--to \npass incremental health care reforms with which we could all agree. \nUnfortunately, what seemed obvious to me, based on comments and \nsuggestions by a majority of Senators who favored a moderate approach, \nwas not obvious at the time to the Senate's Democratic leadership.\n  This failure to understand the merits of an incremental approach was \ndemonstrated in April 1993, during my attempts to offer a health care \nreform amendment based on the text of S. 631, an incremental reform \nbill I had introduced earlier in the session. This bill incorporated \nmoderate, consensus principles in a reasonable reform package. First, I \nattempted to offer the bill as an amendment to legislation dealing with \ndebt ceilings. Subsequently, I was informed that the floor \nconsideration of this bill would be structured in a way that precluded \nmy offering an amendment. Therefore, I prepared to offer my health care \nbill as an amendment to the fiscal year 1993 Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations bill. To my dismay, then Majority Leader Mitchell, and \nSenator Byrd, then Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, worked \ntogether to ensure that I could not offer my amendment by keeping the \nSenate in a quorum call, a parliamentary tactic used to delay and \nobstruct. I was unable to obtain unanimous consent to end the quorum \ncall, and thus could not proceed with my amendment.\n  Three years later, well after the behemoth Clinton health care reform \nbill was derailed, the Senate once again endured a lengthy political \nbattle concerning the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which I was pleased to \ncosponsor. When enough Senators sensed the growing frustration of the \nAmerican people, we achieved a breakthrough in August 1996, and \nKassebaum-Kennedy's vital health insurance market reforms were finally \npassed. There is no question that Kassebaum-Kennedy made significant \nsteps forward in addressing troubling issues in health care--such as \nincreasing the ease of portability of health insurance coverage--but I \ncontinue to recognize that there is much more to be done. That bill's \nincremental approach to health care reform is what allowed it to \ngenerate bipartisan, consensus support in the Senate. We knew that it \ndid not address every single problem in the health care delivery \nsystem, but it would make life better for millions of American men, \nwomen, and children.\n  I urge my colleagues to note a most important fact: the Kassebaum-\nKennedy bill was enacted only after Democrats abandoned their hopes for \npassing a nationalized, big government health care scheme, and \nRepublicans abandoned their position that access to health care is not \nreally a major problem in the United States that demands Federal \naction.\n  Perhaps the greatest recent example of the power of bipartisanship \ntook place during the 105th Congress, with the passage of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997. This historic bipartisan agreement between Congress \nand the White House to balance the budget by 2002 extended the life of \nthe vital Medicare hospital trust fund by ten years, while expanding \nneeded benefits for seniors. The new law created a National Bipartisan \nCommission on the Future of Medicare to address the implications of the \nretirement of the Baby Boom generation, and marked the first balanced \nFederal budget in thirty years. This landmark accomplishment clearly \nwould not have occurred without all members of Congress and the \nAdministration crossing party lines, compromising, and doing what was \nright for the American people regardless of political affiliations.\n  Despite the historic nature of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \nhowever,\n\n[[Page S270]]\n\nmany providers, hospitals, home health agencies, and insurers argued \nthat the cuts went too deep, and that patient access and care were \nbeing compromised. In both the 105th and 106th Congresses, I supported \nbipartisan efforts to carefully relieve and infuse additional dollars \ninto areas which suffered too greatly from Medicare cuts, without \nupsetting the delicate balance of the budget.\n  We must realize that if we are to continue to be successful in \nmeeting the nation's health care needs, the solutions to the system's \nproblems must come from the political center, not from the extremes.\n  I have advocated health care reform in one form or another throughout \nmy 18 years in the Senate. My strong interest in health care dates back \nto my first term, when I sponsored S. 811, the Health Care for \nDisplaced Workers Act of 1983, and S. 2051, the Health Care Cost \nContainment Act of 1983, which would have granted a limited antitrust \nexemption to health insurers, permitting them to engage in certain \njoint activities such as acquiring or processing information, and \ncollecting and distributing insurance claims for health care services \naimed at curtailing then escalating health care costs. In 1985, I \nintroduced the Community Based Disease Prevention and Health Promotion \nProjects Act of 1985, S. 1873, directed at reducing the human tragedy \nof low birth weight babies and infant mortality. Since 1983, I have \nintroduced and cosponsored numerous other bills concerning health care \nin our country. A complete list of the 31 health care bills that I have \nsponsored since 1983 is included for the Record.\n  During the 102nd Congress, I pressed the Senate to take action on the \nhealth care market issue. On July 29, 1992, I offered an amendment to \nlegislation then pending on the Senate floor, which included a change \nfrom 25 percent to 100 percent deductibility for health insurance \npurchased by self-employed individuals, and small business insurance \nmarket reforms to make health coverage more affordable for small \nbusinesses. Included in this amendment were provisions from a bill \nintroduced by the late Senator John Chafee, legislation which I \ncosponsored and which was previously proposed by Senators Bentsen and \nDurenberger. When then-Majority Leader Mitchell argued that the health \ncare amendment I was proposing did not belong on that bill, I offered \nto withdraw the amendment if he would set a date certain to take up \nhealth care, similar to an arrangement made on product liability \nlegislation, which had been placed on the calendar for September 8, \n1992. The Majority Leader rejected that suggestion and the Senate did \nnot consider comprehensive health care legislation during the balance \nof the 102nd Congress. My July 29, 1992 amendment was defeated on a \nprocedural motion by a vote of 35 to 60, along party lines.\n  The substance of that amendment, however, was adopted later by the \nSenate on September 23, 1992, when it was included in a Bentsen/\nDurenberger amendment which I cosponsored to broader tax legislation \n(H.R. 11). This amendment, which included essentially the same self-\nemployed tax deductibility and small group reforms I had proposed on \nJuly 29th of that year, passed the Senate by voice vote. Unfortunately, \nthese provisions were later dropped from H.R. 11 in the House-Senate \nconference.\n  On August 12, 1992, I introduced legislation entitled the Health Care \nAffordability and Quality Improvement Act of 1992, S. 3176, that would \nhave enhanced informed individual choice regarding health care services \nby providing certain information to health care recipients, would have \nlowered the cost of health care through use of the most appropriate \nprovider, and would have improved the quality of health care.\n  On January 21, 1993, the first day of the 103rd Congress, I \nintroduced the Comprehensive Health Care Act of 1993, S. 18. This \nlegislation was comprised of reforms that our health care system could \nhave adopted immediately. These initiatives would have both improved \naccess and affordability of insurance coverage and would have \nimplemented systemic changes to lower the escalating cost of care in \nthis country. S. 18 is the principal basis of the legislation I \nintroduced in the last three Congresses as well as this one.\n  On March 23, 1993, I introduced the Comprehensive Access and \nAffordability Health Care Act of 1993, S. 631, which was a composite of \nhealth care legislation introduced by Senators Cohen, Kassebaum, Bond, \nand McCain, and included pieces of my bill, S. 18. I introduced this \nlegislation in an attempt to move ahead on the consideration of health \ncare legislation and provide a starting point for debate. As I noted \nearlier, I was precluded by Majority Leader Mitchell from obtaining \nSenate consideration of my legislation as a floor amendment on several \noccasions. Finally, on April 28, 1993, I offered the text of S. 631 as \nan amendment to the pending Department of the Environment Act (S. 171) \nin an attempt to urge the Senate to act on health care reform. My \namendment was defeated 65 to 33 on a procedural motion, but the Senate \nhad finally been forced to contemplate action on health care reform.\n  On the first day of the 104th Congress, January 4, 1995, I introduced \na slightly modified version of S. 18, the Health Care Assurance Act of \n1995 (also S. 18), which contained provisions similar to those \nultimately enacted in the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation, including \ninsurance market reforms, an extension of the tax deductibility of \nhealth insurance for the self employed, and tax deductibility of long \nterm care insurance.\n  I continued these efforts in the 105th Congress, with the \nintroduction of Health Care Assurance Act of 1997 (S. 24), which \nincluded market reforms similar to my previous proposals with the \naddition of a new Title I, an innovative program to provide vouchers to \nStates to cover children who lack health insurance coverage. I also \nintroduced Title I of this legislation as a stand-alone bill, the \nHealthy Children's Pilot Program of 1997 (S. 435) on March 13, 1997. \nThis proposal targeted the approximately 4.2 million children of the \nworking poor who lacked health insurance at that time. These are \nchildren whose parents earn too much to be eligible for Medicaid, but \ndo not earn enough to afford private health care coverage for their \nfamilies. This legislation would have established a $10 billion/5 year \ndiscretionary pilot program to cover these uninsured children by \nproviding grants to States. Modeled after Pennsylvania's \nextraordinarily successful Caring and BlueCHIP programs, this \nlegislation was the first Republican-sponsored child health insurance \nbill during the 105th Congress.\n  I was encouraged that the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, signed into \nlaw on August 5, 1997, included a combination of the best provisions \nfrom many of the child health insurance proposals throughout this \nCongress. The new legislation allocated $24 billion over five years to \nestablish State Child Health Insurance Programs, funded in part by a \nslight increase in the cigarette tax.\n  On the first day of the 106th Congress, I again introduced the Health \nCare Assurance Act of 1999, also designated S. 24. This bill contained \nsimilar insurance market reforms, as well as new provisions to augment \nthe new State Child Health Insurance Program, to assist individuals \nwith disabilities in maintaining quality health care coverage, and to \nestablish a National Fund for Health Research to supplement the funding \nof the National Institutes of Health. All these new initiatives, as \nwell as the market reforms that I supported previously, work toward the \ngoals of covering more individuals and stemming the tide of rising \nhealth costs.\n  My commitment to the issue of health care reform across all \npopulations has been consistently evident during my tenure in the \nSenate, as I have taken to this floor and offered health care reform \nbills and amendments on countless occasions. I will continue to stress \nthe importance of the Federal government's investment in and attention \nto the system's future.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I can personally report on the miracles \nof modern medicine. Seven and one half years ago, an MRI detected a \nbenign tumor (meningioma) at the outer edge of my brain. It was removed \nby conventional surgery, with five days of hospitalization and five \nmore weeks of recuperation.\n  When a small regrowth was detected by a follow-up MRI in June 1996, \nit was treated with high powered radiation using a remarkable device \ncalled the\n\n[[Page S271]]\n\n``Gamma Knife.'' I entered the hospital on the morning of October 11, \n1996, and left the same afternoon, ready to resume my regular schedule. \nLike the MRI, the Gamma Knife is a recent innovation, coming into \nwidespread use only in the past decade.\n  In July 1998, I was pleased to return to the Senate after a \nrelatively brief period of convalescence following heart bypass \nsurgery. This experience again led me to marvel at our health care \nsystem and made me more determined than ever to support Federal funding \nfor biomedical research and to support legislation which will \nincrementally make health care available to all Americans.\n\n  My concern about health care has long pre-dated my own personal \nbenefits from the MRI and other diagnostic and curative procedures. As \nI have previously discussed, my concern about health care began many \nyears ago and has been intensified by my service on the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, which \nI now have the honor to chair.\n  My own experience as a patient has given me deeper insights into the \nAmerican health care system beyond my perspective from the U.S. Senate. \nI have learned: (1) our health care system, the best in the world, is \nworth every cent we pay for it; (2) patients sometimes have to press \ntheir own cases beyond doctors' standard advice; (3) greater \nflexibility must be provided on testing and treatment; (4) our system \nhas the resources to treat the 43.9 million Americans currently \nuninsured, but we must find the way to pay for it; and (5) all \nAmericans deserve the access to health care from which I and others \nwith coverage have benefitted.\n  I have long been convinced that our Federal budget of $1.8 trillion \ncould provide sufficient funding for America's needs if we establish \nour real priorities. Over the past eight years, I believe we have \nlearned a great deal about our health care system and what the American \npeople are willing to accept from the Federal government. The message \nwe heard loudest was that Americans do not want a massive overhaul of \nthe health care system. Instead, our constituents want Congress to \nproceed at a slower pace and to target what is not working in the \nhealth care system while leaving in place what is working.\n  As I have said both publicly and privately, I had been willing to \ncooperate with the Clinton Administration in solving the health care \nproblems facing our country. However, I found many important areas \nwhere I differed with President Clinton's approach to solutions and I \ndid so because I believed that the proposals would have been \ndeleterious to my fellow Pennsylvanians, to the American people, and to \nour health care system as a whole. Most importantly, as the President \nproposed in 1993, I did not support creating a large new government \nbureaucracy because I believe that savings should go to health care \nservices and not bureaucracies.\n  On this latter issue, I first became concerned about the potential \ngrowth in bureaucracy in September 1993 after reading the President's \n239-page preliminary health care reform proposal. I was surprised by \nthe number of new boards, agencies, and commissions, so I asked my \nlegislative assistant, Sharon Helfant, to make me a list of all of \nthem. Instead, she decided to make a chart. The initial chart depicted \n77 new entities and 54 existing entities with new or additional \nresponsibilities.\n  When the President's 1,342-page Health Security Act was transmitted \nto Congress on October 27, 1993, my staff reviewed it and found an \nincrease to 105 new agencies, boards, and commissions and 47 existing \ndepartments, programs and agencies with new or expanded jobs. This \nchart received national attention after being used by Senator Bob Dole \nin his response to the President's State of the Union address on \nJanuary 24, 1994.\n  The response to the chart was tremendous, with more than 12,000 \npeople from across the country contacting my office for a copy; I still \nreceive requests for the chart nearly eight years later. Groups and \nassociations, such as United We Stand America, the American Small \nBusiness Association, the National Federation of Republican Women, and \nthe Christian Coalition, reprinted the chart in their publications--\namounting to hundreds of thousands more in distribution. Bob Woodward \nof the Washington Post later stated that he thought the chart was the \nsingle biggest factor contributing to the demise of the Clinton health \ncare plan. And, as recently as the November 1996 election, my chart was \nused by Senator Dole in his presidential campaign to illustrate the \nneed for incremental health care reform as opposed to a big government \nsolution.\n  With the history of the health care reform debate in mind and \nbuilding on my previous efforts, I am again introducing an incremental \nbill which would provide quality health care without adversely \naffecting the many positive aspects of our health care system. It is \nmore prudent to implement targeted reforms and then act later to \nimprove upon what we have done. I call this trial and modification. We \nmust be careful not to damage the positive aspects of our health care \nsystem upon which more than 194.7 million Americans justifiably rely.\n  The legislation I am introducing today has three objectives: (1) to \nprovide affordable health insurance for those now not covered; (2) to \nreduce health care costs for all Americans; and (3) to improve coverage \nfor underinsured individuals, families, and children.\n  This bill includes provisions to expand the Medicaid program to cover \nhigher income individuals than currently allowed, to encourage the \nformation of small group insurance purchasing arrangements, to expand \naccess to health insurance for children, to improve health benefits for \nindividuals with disabilities, to strengthen preventive health benefits \nunder the Medicare program, to increase access to prenatal care and \noutreach for the prevention of low birth weight babies, to strengthen \npatients' rights regarding medical care at the end of life, to expand \naccess to primary and preventive health services, to reform the COBRA \nlaw, to enhance our investment in outcomes research, to reduce the \nincidence of medical errors, and to establish a national fund for \nhealth research as a supplement to the National Institutes of Health \nbudget.\n\n  Taken together, I believe the reforms proposed in the Health Care \nAssurance Act of 2001 will both improve the quality of health care \ndelivery and will help ease the escalating costs of health care in this \ncountry.\n  This new initiative, which was not contained in my previous version \nof this legislation, would guarantee coverage for individuals earning \nup to 133 percent of the Federal poverty level ($11,105 for a single/\n$22,676 for a family of four) and would give states the option to cover \nindividuals earning up to 200 percent of poverty ($16,700 for a single/\n$34,100 for a family of four). This population is generally deemed \nundesirable by private insurers, and since these low-income individuals \nare ineligible for Medicaid, they currently remain uninsured.\n  The provisions in this title advance the recent joint proposal by the \nHealth Insurance Association of America and Families USA, two groups \nwhich have traditionally been on opposing ends of health policy \ndebates. Recognizing the rising number of Americans who lack health \ninsurance, these groups took the unprecedented step in crafting a set \nof basic policy goals on which Congress may build consensus and get \nsomething done for the uninsured. Currently, Medicaid only guarantees \ncoverage for pregnant women and infants who earn up to 133 percent of \nthe poverty level. Beyond that population, the Federal mandate varies \nacross age, income, and disability status; for instance, there are \ndifferent federal mandates for preschool age children than for school-\nage children and for disabled individuals. Further, current law does \nnot allow any Federal contributions for coverage of people ages 16-18 \nor for adults with children. I recognize that states may certainly \nchoose to establish programs to cover these and other categories of \nlow-income people, but usually will not do so without Federal help.\n  Title II of the bill builds on the State Child Health Insurance \nProgram (SCHIP), the program established in the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, which allocated $24 billion over five years to increase health \ninsurance coverage for children. The SCHIP program gives\n\n[[Page S272]]\n\nStates the option to use federally funded grants to provide vouchers to \neligible families to purchase health insurance for their children, or \nto expand Medicaid coverage for those uninsured children, or a \ncombination of both. This title would increase the income eligibility \nto families with incomes at or below 235 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel ($40,067 annually for a family of four). The Health Care \nFinancing Administration reported that nearly two million children were \nenrolled in the SCHIP program during fiscal year 1999. The \nAdministration's goal is to enroll five million more children in the \nprogram by the end of fiscal year 2002. This provision would allow \neligibility for approximately another 850,000 uninsured children.\n  Title III assists another of our Nation's most vulnerable populations \nby improving the delivery of care for individuals with long-term \ndisabilities. This title would allow for Medicaid reimbursement for \ncommunity-based attendant care services, as an alternative to \ninstitutionalization, for eligible individuals who require such \nservices based on functional need, without regard to the individual's \nage or the nature of the disability. The most recent data available \ntell us that 6.64 million individuals receive care for disabilities \nunder the Medicaid program.\n  This title builds on S. 1935, legislation I introduced during the \n106th Congress with Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa. Such a change in \nMedicaid law is desperately needed given the Supreme Court's recent \nruling in Olmstead v. L.C., 119 S. Ct. 2176 (1999): the Americans with \nDisabilities Act (ADA) requires States, in some circumstances, to \nprovide community-based treatment to persons with mental disabilities \nrather than placement in institutions. This decision and several lower \ncourt decisions have pointed to the need for a structured Medicaid \nattendant-care services benefit in order to meet obligations under the \nADA.\n  I am pleased to report that my fiscal year 2001 Labor, HHS, and \nEducation Appropriations bill provided $50 million for ``Real Choice, \nSystems Change'' grants for states to fund initiatives for systems \nimprovements and to provide long term services and supports, including \ncommunity-based attendant care. In addition, $20 million was provided \nto continue demonstration projects on Medicaid coverage of community-\nbased attendant care services. Title III of this bill expands and \nauthorizes the programs we have been funding as demonstration projects \nin order to establish a permanent infrastructure for the new benefit.\n  The next title contains provisions to make it easier for small \nbusinesses to buy health insurance for their workers by establishing \nvoluntary purchasing groups. It also obligates employers to offer, but \nnot pay for, at least two health insurance plans that protect \nindividual freedom of choice and that meet a standard minimum benefits \npackage. It extends COBRA benefits and coverage options to provide \nportability and security of affordable coverage between jobs.\n\n  Specifically, Title IV extends the COBRA benefit option from 18 \nmonths to 24 months. COBRA refers to a measure which was enacted in \n1985 as part of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \n(COBRA '85) to allow employees who leave their job, either through a \nlay-off or by choice, to continue receiving their health care benefits \nby paying the full cost of such coverage. By extending this option, \nsuch unemployed persons will have enhanced coverage options, \nparticularly when compared to what they would be able to buy in the \nindividual insurance market.\n  In addition, options under COBRA are expanded to include plans with \nlower premiums and higher deductibles of either $1,000 or $3,000. This \nprovision is incorporated from legislation introduced in the 103rd \nCongress by Senator Phil Gramm and will provide an extra cushion of \ncoverage options for people in transition. According to Senator Gramm, \nwith these options, the typical monthly premium paid for a family of \nfour would drop by as much as 20 percent when switching to a $1,000 \ndeductible and as much as 52 percent when switching to a $3,000 \ndeductible.\n  This title also includes a provision which would extend to 36 months \nthe time period for COBRA coverage for a child who is no longer a \ndependent under a parent's health insurance policy. Uninsured workers \ntend to be concentrated among those under age 35, although the average \nage of uninsured workers is increasing. EBRI statistics indicate that \n24 percent of young adults between the ages of 18 and 24 were without \ncoverage in 1998. This provision would allow those who are no longer \ndependents on their parents' plan to have a more secure safety net.\n  With respect to the uninsured and underinsured, my bill would permit \nindividuals and families to purchase guaranteed, comprehensive health \ncoverage through purchasing groups. Health insurance plans offered \nthrough the purchasing groups would be required to meet basic, \ncomprehensive standards with respect to benefits.\n  My bill would also create health insurance purchasing groups for \nindividuals wishing to purchase health insurance on their own. In \ntoday's market, such individuals often face a market where coverage \noptions are not affordable. Purchasing groups will allow small \nbusinesses and individuals to buy coverage by pooling together to form \npurchasing groups, and choose from insurance plans that provide \ncomprehensive benefits, with guaranteed enrollment, renewability, and \nequal pricing through community rating, adjusted by age and family \nsize.\n  Title IV of my bill also includes an important provision to give the \nself employed 100 percent deductibility of their health insurance \npremiums. The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill extended the deductibility of \nhealth insurance for the self employed to 80 percent by 2006. The \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Omnibus Appropriations Act for \nfiscal year 1999 both contained new phase-in scales for health \ninsurance deductibility for the self-employed. Currently, self-employed \npersons may deduct 60 percent of their health insurance costs through \n2002, to be fully deductible in 2003. My bill would speed up the phase-\nin: health insurance costs would be 70 percent deductible in 2001 and \nfully deductible in 2002, thereby giving the currently 3.1 million \nself-employed Americans who are uninsured a better incentive to \npurchase coverage.\n  The provisions contained in this portion of my bill are vital, as \nEBRI statistics tell us that 60 percent of all uninsured workers in \n1998 were either self-employed or were working in small private-sector \nfirms. The disparity is further demonstrated by the fact that 31 \npercent of workers in private-sector firms with fewer than 25 employees \nwere uninsured, compared with only 13 percent of workers in private-\nsector firms with 1000 or more employees.\n  It is anticipated that the increased costs to employers electing to \ncover their employees as provided under Title IV in my bill would be \noffset by the administrative savings generated by development of the \nsmall employer purchasing groups. Such savings have been estimated at \nlevels as high as $9 billion annually. In addition, by addressing some \nof the areas within the health care system that have exacerbated costs, \nsignificant savings can be achieved and then redirected toward direct \nhealth care services.\n  Although our existing health care system suffers from serious \nstructural problems, common sense steps can be taken to head off the \nremaining problems before they reach crisis proportions. Title V of my \nbill includes initiatives which will enhance primary and preventive \ncare services aimed at preventing disease.\n  Each year about 7.6 percent of babies born in the United States are \nborn with a low birth weight, multiplying their risk of death and \ndisability. Most of the deaths which do occur are preventable. Although \nthe infant mortality rate in the United States fell to an all-time low \nin 1989, and the rate decreased by 28 percent between 1988 and 1998, \ntoo many babies continue to be born of low birth weight. The Executive \nDirector of the National Commission To Prevent Infant Mortality put it \nthis way: ``More babies are being born at risk and all we are doing is \nsaving them with expensive technology.''\n  It is a human tragedy for a child to be born weighing 16 ounces with \nattendant problems which last a lifetime. I first saw one pound babies \nin 1984 when I was astounded to learn that Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, \nhad the highest infant mortality rate of African-American babies of any \ncity in the\n\n[[Page S273]]\n\nUnited States. I wondered how that could be true of Pittsburgh, which \nhas such enormous medical resources. It was an amazing thing for me to \nsee a one pound baby, about as big as my hand. However, I am pleased to \nreport that as a result of successful prevention initiatives like the \nfederal Healthy Start program, Pittsburgh's infant mortality has \ndecreased 20 percent.\n\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that \nbetween $1.1 billion and $2.5 billion per year could be saved if the \nnumber of low birth weight children were reduced by 82,000 births. We \nknow that in most instances, prenatal care is effective in preventing \nlow birth weight babies. Numerous studies have demonstrated that low \nbirth weight that does not have a genetic link is most often associated \nwith inadequate prenatal care or the lack of prenatal care. The short \nand long-term costs of saving and caring for infants of low birth \nweight is staggering. In the most recent available study on the costs \nof low birth weight babies, the Office of Technology Assessment in 1988 \nconcluded that $8 billion was expended in 1987 for the care of 262,000 \nlow birth weight infants in excess of that which would have been spent \non an equivalent number of babies born of normal birth weight, averted \nby earlier or more frequent prenatal care.\n  To improve pregnancy outcomes for women at risk of delivering babies \nof low birth weight, my legislation would strengthen the Healthy Start \nprogram to reduce infant mortality and the incidence of low birth \nweight births, as well as to improve the health and well-being of \nmothers and their families, pregnant women and infants. Funds are \nawarded under this program with the goal of developing and coordinating \neffective health care and social support services for women and their \nbabies.\n  I initiated action that led to the creation of the Healthy Start \nprogram in 1991, working with the Bush Administration and Senator \nHarkin. As Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee with \njurisdiction over the Department of Health and Human Services, I have \nworked with my colleagues to ensure the continued growth of this \nimportant program. In 1991, we allocated $25 million for the \ndevelopment of 15 demonstration projects. This number grew to 22 in \n1994, to 75 projects in 1998, and the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration expects this number to continue to increase. For both \nfiscal years 2000 and 2001, we secured $90 million for this vital \nprogram.\n  Title V also provides increased support to local educational agencies \nto develop and strengthen comprehensive health education programs, and \nto Head Start resource centers to support health education training \nprograms for teachers and other day care workers. Many studies indicate \nthat poor health and social habits are carried into adulthood and often \npassed on to the next generation. To interrupt this tragic cycle, our \nnation must invest in proven preventive health education programs.\n  Title V also expands the authorization of a variety of public health \nprograms, such as breast and cervical cancer prevention, childhood \nimmunizations, family planning, and community health centers. These \nexisting programs are designed to improve public health and prevent \ndisease through primary and secondary prevention initiatives. It is \nessential that we invest more resources in these programs now if we are \nto make any substantial progress in reducing the costs of acute care in \nthis country.\n  As Chairman of the Labor, HHS and Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I have greatly encouraged the development of prevention \nprograms which are essential to keeping people healthy and lowering the \ncost of health care in this country. In my view, no aspect of health \ncare policy is more important. Accordingly, my prevention efforts have \nbeen widespread. Specifically, I joined my colleagues in efforts to \nensure that funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n(CDC) increased $2.92 billion or 290 percent since 1989, for a fiscal \nyear 2001 total of $3.92 billion. We have also worked to increase \nfunding for CDC's breast and cervical cancer early detection program to \n$176 million in fiscal year 2001, almost one and a half times its 1993 \ntotal.\n  I have also supported programs at CDC which help children. CDC's \nchildhood immunization program seeks to eliminate preventable diseases \nthrough immunization and to ensure that at least 90 percent of 2 year \nolds are vaccinated. The CDC also continues to educate parents and \ncaregivers on the importance of immunization for children under two \nyears. Along with my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, I have \nhelped ensure that funding for this important program totaled $532.5 \nmillion for fiscal year 2001. The CDC's lead poisoning prevention \nprogram annually identifies about 50,000 children with elevated blood \nlevels and places those children under medical management. The program \nprevents the amount of lead in children's blood from reaching dangerous \nlevels and is currently funded at $36 million.\n  In recent years, we have also strengthened funding for Community \nHealth Centers, which provide immunizations, health advice, and health \nprofessions training. These Centers, administered by the Health \nResources and Services Administration, provide a critical primary care \nsafety net to rural and medically underserved communities, as well as \nuninsured individuals, migrant workers, the homeless, residents of \npublic housing, and Medicaid recipients. For fiscal year 2001, these \nCenters received over $1.2 billion.\n  As former Chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence and \ncurrent Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee with jurisdiction \nover non-defense biomedical research, I have worked to transfer CIA \nimaging technology to the fight against breast cancer. Through the \nOffice of Women's Health within the Department of Health and Human \nServices, I secured a $2 million contract in fiscal year 1996 for a \nresearch consortium led by the University of Pennsylvania to perform \nthe first clinical trials testing the use of intelligence technology \nfor breast cancer detection. My Appropriations Subcommittee has \ncontinued to provide funds to continue these clinical trials.\n\n  I have also been a strong supporter of funding for AIDS research, \neducation, and prevention programs. Funding for Ryan White AIDS \nprograms has increased from $757.4 million in 1996 to $1.6 billion for \nfiscal year 2001. Within the fiscal year 2001 funding, $65 million was \nincluded for pediatric AIDS programs and $589 million for the AIDS Drug \nAssistance Program (ADAP). AIDS research at the NIH totaled $742.4 \nmillion in 1989, and has increased to an estimated $2.1 billion in \nfiscal year 2001.\n  The health care community continues to recognize the importance of \nprevention in improving health status and reducing health care costs. \nThe Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Consolidated Omnibus \nAppropriations Act of fiscal year 2001 established new and enhanced \npreventive benefits within the Medicare program, such as flu shots, \nbone mass measurements, yearly mammograms, biennial pap smears and \npelvic exams, and coverage of colonoscopy for high risk patients. \nHowever, some of these ``wellness'' benefits have cost obligations, \nsuch as copayments or deductibles. In this bill, I have also included \nprovisions which refine and strengthen preventive benefits within the \nMedicare program, including coverage of yearly pap smears, pelvic \nexams, and screening and diagnostic mammography with no copayment or \nPart B deductible; and coverage of insulin pumps for certain Type I \nDiabetics.\n  The proposed expansions in preventive health services included in \nTitle V of my bill are conservatively projected to save approximately \n$2.5 billion per year or $12.5 billion over five years. It is clearly \ndifficult to quantify today the savings that will surely be achieved \nwhen future generations of children are truly educated in a range of \nhealth-related subjects.\n  Title VI of my bill would establish a federal standard and create \nuniform national forms concerning a patient's right to decline medical \ntreatment. Nothing in my bill mandates the use of uniform forms. \nRather, the purpose of this provision is to make it easier for \nindividuals to make their own choices and determination regarding their \ntreatment during this vulnerable and highly personal time. Studies have \nalso indicated that advance directives do\n\n[[Page S274]]\n\nnot increase health care costs. Data indicate that end-of-life costs \naccount for 10 percent of total health expenditures and 28 percent of \ntotal Medicare expenditures. Loose projections indicate that a 10 \npercent savings made in the final days of life would result in \napproximately $10 billion of savings in medical costs per year, and \nabout $4.7 billion in savings for Medicare alone.\n  However, economic considerations are not and should not be the \nprimary reasons for using advance directives. They provide a means for \npatients to exercise their autonomy over end-of-life decisions. A study \ndone at the Thomas Jefferson University Medical College in Philadelphia \ncited research which found that about 90 percent of the American \npopulation has expressed interest in discussing advance directives. \nHowever, even more recent studies indicate that living wills would be \nused by many more Americans if they were better understood. My bill \nwould provide information on an individual's rights regarding living \nwills and advanced directives, and would make it easier for people to \nhave their wishes known and honored. In my view, no one has the right \nto decide for anyone else what constitutes appropriate medical \ntreatment to prolong a person's life. Encouraging the use of advance \ndirectives will ensure that patients are not needlessly and unlawfully \ntreated against their will. No health care provider would be permitted \nto treat an adult contrary to the adult's wishes as outlined in an \nadvance directive. However, in no way would the use of advance \ndirectives condone assisted suicide or any affirmative act to end human \nlife.\n  The next title addresses the unique barriers to coverage which exist \nin both rural and urban medically underserved areas. Within \nPennsylvania, such barriers result from a lack of health care providers \nin rural areas, and other problems associated with the lack of coverage \nfor indigent populations living in inner cities. Title VII of my bill \nimproves access to health care services for these populations by: (1) \nexpanding Public Health Service programs and training more primary care \nproviders to serve in such areas; (2) increasing the utilization of \nnon-physician providers, including nurse practitioners, clinical nurse \nspecialists and physician assistants, through increased reimbursements \nunder the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and (3) increasing support \nfor education and outreach.\n  I believe these provisions will also yield substantial savings. A \nstudy of the Canadian health system utilizing nurse practitioners \nprojected savings of 10 to 15 percent of all medical costs. While our \nsystem is dramatically different from that of Canada, it may not be \nunreasonable to project annual savings of five percent, or $57.5 \nbillion, from an increased number of primary care providers in our \nsystem. Again, experience will raise or lower this projection.\n  Outcomes research is another area where we can achieve considerable \nlong term health care savings while also improving the quality of care. \nAccording to most outcomes management experts, it is estimated that \nabout 25 to 30 percent of medical care is inappropriate or unnecessary. \nDr. Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of the New England Journal of \nMedicine, also stated that 20 to 30 percent of health care procedures \nare either inappropriate, ineffective or unnecessary.\n\n  I joined my colleagues in recognizing this important area of research \nby supporting passage of legislation reauthorizing the Agency for \nHealthcare Research and Quality (formerly the Agency for Health Care \nPolicy and Research. The renamed agency, dubbed ``AHRQ,'' is authorized \nto expand outcomes research necessary for the development of medical \npractice guidelines and for increased access to consumer information. \nIn order to boost funding for this vital area of research, title VIII \nof my bill would establish a trust fund for medical treatment outcomes \nresearch, capitalized by a .001 cent tax on total U.S. health insurance \npremiums collected. This trust fund would be specifically authorized \nfor use by AHRQ to supplement its outcomes research mission. Based on \nthe Health Care Financing Administration's 1998 health spending review, \nprivate health insurance premiums totaled $375 billion. As provided in \nmy bill, a surcharge would generate $375 million for an outcomes \nresearch fund.\n  Also included in this title is my ``Medical Errors Reduction Act,'' \nwhich I introduced in the 106th Congress with Senators Harkin and \nInouye, in response to the November 29, 1999, Institute of Medicine \n(IOM) report, ``To Err Is Human: Building a Safer Health System.'' The \nreport concluded that medical mistakes have led to numerous injuries \nand deaths, affecting an estimated three to four percent of all \nhospital patients. The IOM report also concluded that health care is a \ndecade or more behind other high-risk industries in its attention to \nensuring basic safety.\n  According to the IOM, at least 44,000 Americans die each year as a \nresult of medical errors, and the number may be as high as 98,000--\nwhich catapults medical errors to the fifth leading cause of death \nnationwide. This total outnumbers deaths from motor vehicle accidents, \nbreast cancer, and AIDS. Further, medical errors resulting in injury \nare estimated to cost the nation between $17 billion and $29 billion, \nincluding additional health care costs, lost income, lost household \nproduction, and disability costs.\n  The IOM findings are startling and beg for national attention to \ndetermine ways to reduce the number of medical errors. On December 13, \n1999, I chaired a hearing of the Labor, HHS, Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee to hear details of IOM's report findings. On January 25, \n2000, I chaired a joint Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee/Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing to consider mandatory \nand voluntary reporting requirements and to begin to determine ways to \nreduce medical errors.\n  Specifically, my proposal would make grants available to states so \nthey can establish their own error reporting systems and would \nestablish 15 competitively-awarded research demonstration projects in \nrural and urban areas throughout the country. These projects would \nemploy new and proven technologies and enhance staff training to \ndetermine ways to reduce errors. The provision also requires the \nSecretary of HHS to provide patient education programs to all \nindividuals covered by Federal health plans.\n  I am pleased to report that my Appropriations Subcommittee has \nalready taken some critical first steps to reduce the incidence of \ndeaths and injuries related to medical errors. In fiscal year 2001, $50 \nmillion has been provided to explore opportunities for a better \nunderstanding of the systemic problems in health care, in the hope that \nwe can dramatically reduce the incidence of medical errors. The \nresearch initiatives include a focus on developing guidance to assist \nin States' development of data collection systems so that national \ntrends can be determined and analyzed. In addition, the Committee has \nencouraged health care providers to explore the use of technologies and \nother methods in reducing medical errors.\n  Nursing home care is another significant issue which must be \naddressed. Spending on long term care totaled $115 billion in 1997, and \nover 40 percent of that cost was borne by the Medicaid program. Despite \nthese large public expenditures, the elderly face significant uncovered \nliability for long term care. Title IX of my bill would provide a tax \ncredit for premiums paid to purchase private long-term care insurance. \nOther tax incentives and reforms provided in my bill to make long term \ncare insurance more affordable include: (1) allowing employees to \nselect long-term care insurance as part of a cafeteria plan and \nallowing employers to deduct this expense; (2) excluding from income \ntax the life insurance savings used to pay for long term care; and (3) \nsetting standards for long term care insurance that reduce the bias \nthat currently favors institutional care over community and home-based \nalternatives.\n  The final title of my bill would create a national fund for health \nresearch within the Department of the Treasury, to supplement the \nmonies appropriated for the National Institutes of Health. To \ncapitalize this fund, health insurance companies would be required to \ncontribute 1 percent of all health insurance premiums received. This \ncreative proposal was first developed by my distinguished colleagues, \nSenators Mark Hatfield and Tom Harkin. Their idea is a sound one and \nought to be\n\n[[Page S275]]\n\nadopted. To this end, Senator Harkin and I introduced the National Fund \nfor Health Research Act on March 13, 1997 (S. 441) and August 5, 1999 \n(S. 1504). I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Harkin to \nenact a biomedical research fund this Congress.\n\n  While precision is again impossible, my proposal could conceivably \nachieve a net annual savings of between $74 billion to $86 billion. The \nsavings are totaled as follows: $9 billion in small employer market \nreforms coupled with employer purchasing groups; $2.5 billion for \npreventive health services; $17 to $29 billion for reducing costs \nassociated with reducing medical errors; $10 billion from advanced \ndirectives; $57.5 billion from increasing primary care providers; and \n$2.9 billion by reducing administrative costs. The costs would be \nconservatively estimated to be $2.8 billion for long term care tax \ncredits, approximately $15 billion for community-based attendant care \nservices under Medicaid, and $7 billion for general Medicaid expansion. \nExperience and more detailed analysis of the affected populations will \nrequire modification of these projections, and I am prepared to work \nwith my colleagues to develop implementing legislation and to press for \nfurther action in the important area of health care reform.\n  The provisions which I have outlined today contain my ideas for a \nframework to provide affordable, high quality health care for all \nAmericans. I am opposed to rationing health care. I do not want \nrationing for myself, for my family, or for America. In my judgment, we \nshould not scrap, but rather we should build upon our current health \ndelivery system. We do not need the overwhelming bureaucracy that \nPresident Clinton and other Democratic leaders proposed in 1993 to \naccomplish this. I believe we can provide care for the 43.9 million \nAmericans who are now not covered and reduce health care costs for \nthose who are covered within the currently growing $1.15 trillion in \nhealth care spending. Mr. President, the time has come for concerted \naction in this arena.\n  I urge the Congressional leadership, including the appropriate \ncommittee chairmen, to move this legislation and other health care \nbills forward promptly. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nthe bill, a summary, and a list of my health reform bills be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 24\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Proper adjustment shall be \n     made in amounts subsequently transferred to the extent prior \n     estimates were in excess of or less than the amounts required \n     to be transferred.\n       (4) Definition.--As used in this subsection, the term \n     ``health plan'' means a group health plan (as defined in \n     section 2791(a) of the Public Health Service Act and any \n     individual health insurance (as defined in section 2791(b)(5) \n     of such Act) operated by a health insurance issuer.\n       (c) Obligations From Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the provisions of paragraph \n     (4), with respect to the amounts made available in the Fund \n     in a fiscal year, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall distribute--\n       (A) 2 percent of such amounts during any fiscal year to the \n     Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health \n     to be allocated at the Director's discretion for the \n     following activities:\n       (i) for carrying out the responsibilities of the Office of \n     the Director, including the Office of Research on Women's \n     Health and the Office of Research on Minority Health, the \n     Office of Rare Disease Research, the Office of Behavioral and \n     Social Sciences Research (for use for efforts to reduce \n     tobacco use), the Office of Dietary Supplements, and the \n     Office for Disease Prevention; and\n       (ii) for construction and acquisition of equipment for or \n     facilities of or used by the National Institutes of Health;\n       (B) 2 percent of such amounts for transfer to the National \n     Center for Research Resources to carry out section 1502 of \n     the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 \n     concerning Biomedical and Behavioral Research Facilities;\n       (C) 1 percent of such amounts during any fiscal year for \n     carrying out section 301 and part D of title IV of the Public \n     Health Service Act with respect to health information \n     communications; and\n       (D) the remainder of such amounts during any fiscal year to \n     member institutes and centers, including the Office of AIDS \n     Research, of the National Institutes of Health\n\n[[Page S293]]\n\n     in the same proportion to the total amount received under \n     this section, as the amount of annual appropriations under \n     appropriations Acts for each member institute and Centers for \n     the fiscal year bears to the total amount of appropriations \n     under appropriations Acts for all member institutes and \n     Centers of the National Institutes of Health for the fiscal \n     year.\n       (2) Plans of allocation.--The amounts transferred under \n     paragraph (1)(D) shall be allocated by the Director of the \n     National Institutes of Health or the various directors of the \n     institutes and centers, as the case may be, pursuant to \n     allocation plans developed by the various advisory councils \n     to such directors, after consultation with such directors.\n       (3) Grants and contracts fully funded in first year.--With \n     respect to any grant or contract funded by amounts \n     distributed under paragraph (1), the full amount of the total \n     obligation of such grant or contract shall be funded in the \n     first year of such grant or contract, and shall remain \n     available until expended.\n       (4) Trigger and release of monies and phase-in.--\n       (A) Trigger and release.--No expenditure shall be made \n     under paragraph (1) during any fiscal year in which the \n     annual amount appropriated for the National Institutes of \n     Health is less than the amount so appropriated for the prior \n     fiscal year.\n       (B) Phase-in.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall phase-in the distributions required under paragraph (1) \n     so that--\n       (i) 25 percent of the amount in the Fund is distributed in \n     the first fiscal year for which funds are available;\n       (ii) 50 percent of the amount in the Fund is distributed in \n     the second fiscal year for which funds are available;\n       (iii) 75 percent of the amount in the Fund is distributed \n     in the third fiscal year for which funds are available; and\n       (iv) 100 percent of the amount in the Fund is distributed \n     in the fourth and each succeeding fiscal year for which funds \n     are available.\n       (d) Budget Treatment of Amounts in Fund.--The amounts in \n     the Fund shall be excluded from, and shall not be taken into \n     account, for purposes of any budget enforcement procedure \n     under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 or the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Health Care Assurance Act of 2001--Summary\n\n     Title I: Expanded Medicaid Coverage for Low-Income Individuals\n\n       Current law only guarantees coverage for pregnant women and \n     infants who earn up to 133% of the Federal level poverty \n     ($11,105 for a single/$22,676 for a family of four). Beyond \n     that population, the Federal mandate varies across age, \n     income, and disability status; for instance, there are \n     different federal mandates for preschool age children than \n     for school-age children and for disabled individuals. \n     Further, current law does not allow any Federal contributions \n     for coverage for individuals who earn up to 133% of the \n     federal poverty line, regardless of age or other status. \n     States would then have the option, as they have under the \n     State Child Health Insurance Programs (SCHIP), to cover \n     individuals all the way up to 200% of the federal poverty \n     level ($16,700 for a single/$34,100 for a family of four). \n     Unlike SCHIP, however, the states will not receive an \n     enhanced Federal match.\n\n        Title II: Expanded State Child Health Insurance Program\n\n       This title will expand upon the State Child Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP), the new program established in the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which allocates $24 billion/five \n     years to increase health insurance coverage for children. The \n     SCHIP program gives States the option to use federally funded \n     grants to provide vouchers to eligible families to purchase \n     health insurance for their children, or to expand Medicaid \n     coverage for those uninsured children, or a combination of \n     both. These grants are distributed to participating States \n     based on the number of uninsured children residing there. \n     This title would increase the income eligibility to families \n     with incomes at or below 235% of the Federal poverty level \n     ($40,067 annually for a family of four).\n\n      Title III: Expanded Health Services for Disabled Individuals\n\n       Expansion of Community-Based Attendant Care Services and \n     Supports: Medicaid currently covers the costs associated with \n     institutional care for disabled individuals. In an effort to \n     improve the delivery of care and the comfort of those with \n     long-term disabilities, this section would allow for \n     reimbursement for community-based attendant care services and \n     supports, instead of institutionalization, for eligible \n     individuals who require such services based on functional \n     need, without regard to the individual's age or the nature of \n     the disability.\n\n         Title IV: General Health Insurance Coverage Provisions\n\n       Tax Equity for the Self-Employed: Under current law, self-\n     employed persons may deduct 60% of their health insurance \n     costs through 2002, and those costs would be fully deductible \n     in 2003. However, all other employees may already deduct 100% \n     of such costs. Title III would speed up the phase-in: health \n     insurance costs would be 70% deductible in 2001 and fully \n     deductible in 2002, thereby giving the currently 3.1 million \n     self-employed Americans who are uninsured a better incentive \n     to purchase coverage.\n       Small Employer and Individual Purchasing Groups: \n     Establishes voluntary small employer and individual \n     purchasing groups designed to provide affordable, \n     comprehensive health coverage options for such employers, \n     their employees, and other uninsured and underinsured \n     individuals and families. Health plans offering coverage \n     through such groups will: (1) provide a standard, \n     actuarially equivalent health benefits package; (2) adjust \n     community rated premiums by age and family size in order \n     to spread risk and provide price equity to all; and (3) \n     meet certain other guidelines involving marketing \n     practices.\n       Standard Benefits Package: The standard package of benefits \n     would include a variation of benefits permitted among \n     actuarially equivalent plans developed through the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). The standard \n     plan will consist of the following services when medically \n     necessary or appropriate: (1) medical and surgical services; \n     (2) medical equipment; (3) preventive services; and (4) \n     emergency transportation in frontier areas.\n       COBRA Portability Reform: For those persons who are \n     uninsured between jobs and for insured persons who fear \n     losing coverage should they lose their jobs, Title III \n     reforms the existing COBRA law by: (1) extending to 24 months \n     the minimum time period in which COBRA may cover individuals \n     through their former employers' plan, and extending to 36 \n     months the time period in which a child who is no longer a \n     dependent under a parent's health insurance policy may \n     receive coverage; (2) expanding coverage options to include \n     plans with a lower premium and a $1,000 deductible--saving a \n     typical family of four 20% in monthly premiums--and plans \n     with a lower premium and a $3,000 deductible--saving a family \n     of four 52% in monthly premiums.\n\n             Title V: Primary and Preventive Care Services\n\n       New Medicare preventive Care Services: The health care \n     community continues to recognize the importance of prevention \n     in improving health status and reducing health care costs. \n     This provision institutes new preventive benefits within the \n     Medicare program, and refines and strengthens existing ones. \n     Under this provision, Medicare would cover yearly pap smears, \n     pelvic exams, and screening and diagnostic mammography for \n     women, with no copayment of part B deductible; and cover \n     insulin pumps for certain Type I Diabetics.\n       Primary Health and Education Assistance Programs: The \n     Department of Health and Human Service administers many \n     programs designed to increase access to primary and \n     preventive care. This provision provides increased \n     authorization for several existing preventive health programs \n     such as breast and cervical cancer prevention, Healthy Start \n     project grants aimed at reducing infant mortality and low \n     weight births and to improve the health and well-being of \n     mothers and their families, pregnant women and infants, and \n     childhood immunizations. This section also authorizes a new \n     grant program for local education agencies and pre-school \n     programs to provide comprehensive health education, and \n     reauthorizes the Adolescent Family Life (AFL) program (Title \n     XX) for the first time since 1984. The AFL program provides \n     funding for initiatives focusing directly on abstinence \n     education.\n\n         Title VI: Patient's Right to Decline Medical Treatment\n\n       Improves the effectiveness and portability of advance \n     directives by strengthening the federal law regarding patient \n     self-determination and establishing uniform federal forms \n     with regard to self-determination.\n\n            Title VII: Primary and Preventive Care Providers\n\n       Encourages use of non-physician providers such as nurse \n     practitioners, physician assistants, and clinical nurse \n     specialists by increasing direct reimbursement under Medicare \n     and Medicaid without regard to the setting where services are \n     provided. Title VI also seeks to encourage students early on \n     in their medical training to pursue a career in primary care \n     and it provides assistance to medical training programs to \n     recruit such students.\n\n                      Title VIII: Cost Containment\n\n       Investment in Outcomes Research: The recently renamed \n     Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (formerly the \n     Agency for Health Care Policy and Research) is authorized to \n     expand outcomes research necessary for the development of \n     medical practice guidelines and for increased access to \n     consumer information. In order to boost funding for this \n     vital area of research, title VIII of my bill would establish \n     a trust fund for medical treatment outcomes research, \n     capitalized by a .001 cent tax on total U.S. health insurance \n     premiums collected. This trust fund would be specifically \n     authorized for use by the Agency for Healthcare Research and \n     Quality to supplement its currently authorized outcomes \n     research mission.\n       Reducing Medical Errors: A recently released Institute of \n     Medicine (IOM) report, ``To Err Is Human: Building a Safer \n     Health System,'' concluded that medical mistakes have led to \n     numerous injuries and deaths, affecting an estimated three to \n     four percent of all hospital patients. The IOM report also \n     concluded that health care is a decade or more behind other \n     high-risk industries in its attention to ensuring basic \n     safety. This provision would make grants available to states \n     so they can establish their own error reporting systems and \n     would establish 15 competitively-awarded research \n     demonstration\n\n[[Page S294]]\n\n     projects in rural and urban areas throughout the country. Of \n     the 15 facilities participating in the demonstrations: 5 will \n     be required to inform HHS of any medical errors, 5 will not \n     be required to inform HHS of medical errors, and 5 will be \n     required to inform HHS as well as the patient and/or his \n     family of any medical errors.\n       The Secretary of HHS would be required to report to the \n     Congress on the results of the demonstration projects, \n     focusing on best practices and costs/benefits of applying \n     these practices nationwide. These projects would employ new \n     and proven technologies and enhance staff training to \n     determine ways to reduce errors. The provision also requires \n     the Secretary of HHS to provide patient education programs to \n     all individuals covered by Federal health plans.\n\n   Title IX: Tax Incentives for Purchase of Qualified Long-Term Care \n                               Insurance\n\n       Increases access to long-term care by: (1) establishing a \n     tax credit for amounts paid toward long-term care services of \n     family members; (2) excluding life insurance savings used to \n     pay for long-term care from income tax; (3) allowing \n     employees to select long-term care insurance as part of a \n     cafeteria plan and allowing employers to deduct this expense; \n     (4) setting standards that require long-term care to \n     eliminate the current bias that favors institutional care \n     over community and home-based alternatives.\n\n               Title X: National Fund for Health Research\n\n       Authorizes the establishment of a National Fund for Health \n     Research to supplement biomedical research through the \n     contributions of 1% of premiums collected by health insurers. \n     Funds will be distributed to the National Institutes of \n     Health's member institutes and centers in the same proportion \n     as the amount of appropriations they receive for the fiscal \n     year.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        31 Health Care Bills Introduced by Senator Arlen Specter\n\n\n                  98th Congress 1/3/83 through 1/2/85\n\n       (1) S. 811: The Health Care for Displaced Workers Act of \n     1983 (3/15/83)\n       (2) S. 2051: The Health Care Cost Containment Act of 1983 \n     (11/4/83)\n\n\n                  99th Congress 1/3/85 through 1/2/87\n\n       (3) S. 379: The Health Care Cost Containment Act of 1985 \n     (2/5/85)\n       (4) S. 1873: The Community Based Disease Prevention and \n     Health Promotion Projects Act of 1985 (11/21/85)\n\n\n                  100th Congress 1/3/87 through 1/2/89\n\n       (5) S. 281: The Aid to Families and Employment Transition \n     Act (1/6/87)\n       (6) S. 1871: The Pediatric Acquired Immunodeficiency \n     Syndrome (AIDS) Resource Centers Act (11/17/87)\n       (7) S. 1872: The Minority Acquired Immunodeficiency \n     Syndrome (AIDS) Awareness and Prevention Projects Act (11/17/\n     87)\n\n\n                  101st Congress 1/3/89 through 1/2/91\n\n       (8) S. 896: The Pediatric AIDS Resource Centers Act (5/2/\n     89)\n       (9) S. 1607: Authorization of the Office of Minority Health \n     (9/12/89)\n\n\n                  102nd Congress 1/3/91 through 1/5/93\n\n       (10) S. 1122: The Long-Term Care Incentives Act of 1991 (5/\n     22/91)\n       (11) S. 1214: The Change in Designation of Lancaster \n     County, PA, for Purposes of Medicare Services (6/4/91)\n       (12) S. 1864: The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia \n     Medical Research Facility Act (10/23/91)\n       (13) S. 1995: The Health Care Access and Affordability Act \n     of 1991 (11/20/91)\n       (14) S. 2028: The Women Veteran's Health Equity Act of 1991 \n     (11/22/91)\n       (15) S. 2029: Self-Funding of Veteran's Administrative \n     Health Care Act (11/22/91)\n       (16) S. 2188: Rural Veterans Health Care Facilities Act (2/\n     5/92)\n       (17) S. 3176: The Health Care Affordability and Quality \n     Improvement Act of 1992 (8/12/92)\n       (18) S. 3353: The Deferred Acquisition Cost Act (10/6/92)\n\n\n                 103rd Congress 1/5/93 through 12/11/94\n\n       (19) S. 18: The Comprehensive Health Care Act of 1993 (1/\n     21/93)\n       (20) S. 631: The Comprehensive Access and Affordability \n     Health Care (3/23/93)\n\n\n                 104th Congress 1/4/95 through 10/3/96\n\n       (21) S. 18: The Health Care Assurance Act of 1995 (1/4/95)\n       (22) S. 1716: The Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence \n     Education Act of 1996 (4/29/96)\n\n\n                 105th Congress 1/7/97 through 10/21/98\n\n       (23) S. 24: The Health Care Assurance Act of 1997 (1/21/97)\n       (24) S. 435: The Healthy Children's Pilot Program Act of \n     1997 (3/13/97)\n       (25) S. 934: The Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence \n     Education Act of 1997 (6/18/97)\n       (26) S. 999: Authorizing the Department of Veteran's \n     Affairs to Specify the Frequency of Screening Mammograms (7/\n     9/97)\n\n\n                106th Congress 1/19/99 through 12/15/00\n\n       (27) S. 24: The Health Care Assurance Act of 1999 (1/19/99)\n       (28) S. 836: The Access to Women's Health Care Act of 1999 \n     (4/20/99)\n       (29) S. 1402: The Veterans Benefits and Health Care \n     Improvement Act of 2000 (7/20/99)\n       (30) S. 2015: The Stem Cell Research Act of 2000 (1/31/00)\n       (31) S. 2038: The Medical Error Reduction Act of 2000 (2/8/\n     00)\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Schumer, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 25. A bill to provide for the implementation of a system of \nlicensing for purchasers of certain firearms and for a record of sale \nsystem for those firearms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n            firearm licensing and record of sale act of 2001\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last year on Mother's Day, supporters \nof sensible gun laws came together by the hundreds of thousands to \nparticipate in the Million Mom March and say to Congress: ``Enough is \nEnough.''\n  Those women, men and children all shared a common purpose: The \npassage of sensible gun laws--laws that will hopefully help save lives.\n  The primary stated goal of the Million Mom March was to push for \nlegislation to license gun owners and keep track of guns. We know it \nwill be a long process of educating the Congress and the public on this \nissue. But we will not give in until we succeed. So today I rise, along \nwith Senators Schumer and Boxer, to reintroduce the ``Firearm Licensing \nand Record of Sale Act,'' which I believe represents a common-sense \napproach to guns and gun violence in America.\n  Mr. President, in this country, when you want to hunt, you get a \nhunting license; when you want to fish, you get a fishing license. But \nwhen you want to buy a gun, no license is necessary. That makes no \nsense.\n  We register cars and license drivers. We register pesticides and \nlicense exterminators. We register animal carriers and researchers, we \nregister gambling devices. And we register a whole host of other goods \nand activities--even ``international expositions'' must be registered \nwith the Bureau of International Expositions!\n  But when it comes to guns and gun owners--no license and no \nregistration, despite the loss of more than 32,000 lives a year from \ngun violence.\n  To this end, my staff and I worked for months with law enforcement \nofficials and other experts in drafting the bill we introduced last \nyear. And since that time, we have refined the bill, corrected some \nvague sections, and made it even more clear what the bill would do, and \nwhat it would not do.\n  Upon enactment of this legislation, anyone purchasing a handgun or \nsemi-automatic weapon that takes detachable ammunition magazines will \nbe required to have a license. Shotguns and a large number of common \nhunting guns are not covered by the requirements of this bill.\n  Current owners of these weapons will have up to 10 years to obtain a \nlicense, on a rolling basis, much like many states now handle drivers \nlicenses.\n  The bill sets up a federal system, but allows states to opt out if \nthey adopt a system at least as effective as the federal program.\n  Under this bill, anyone wishing to obtain a firearm license will need \nto go to a federally licensed firearms dealer. There are currently more \nthan 100,000 such dealers across the country--to put that in some \nperspective, there are four times more gun dealers in America than \nthere are McDonald's restaurants in the entire world. Operating the \nfederal licensing system through these licensed dealers will minimize \nthe burden on those wishing to obtain a license.\n  If a state opts-out of the federal program, an individual will go to \na State-designated entity, like a local sheriff, local police \ndepartment, or even Department of Motor Vehicles. It will all depend on \nwhere the state feels is best.\n  Either way, the purchaser will then need to:\n  Provide information as to date and place of birth and name and \naddress;\n  Submit a thumb print;\n  Submit a current photograph;\n  Sign, under penalty of perjury, that all of the submitted information \nis true and that the applicant is qualified under Federal law to \npossess a firearm; Pass a written firearms safety test, requiring \nknowledge of the safe storage and handling of firearms, the legal \nresponsibilities of firearm ownership, and other factors as determined \nby the state or federal authority;\n  Sign a pledge to keep any firearm safely stored and out of the hands \nof juveniles (this pledge will be backed up by criminal penalties of up \nto three years in jail for anyone failing to do so);\n  Undergo state and federal background checks.\n\n[[Page S295]]\n\n  Licenses will be renewable every five years, and can be revoked at \nany time if the licensee becomes disqualified under federal law from \nowning or possessing a gun.\n  And Mr. President, the fee for a license cannot exceed $25.\n  Once the bill takes effect, all future sales and transfers of \nfirearms falling within the scope of the bill will have to be recorded \nthrough a federally licensed firearms dealer, with an accompanying NICS \nbackground check. That way, law enforcement agencies will have easier \naccess to information leading to the arrest of persons who use guns in \ncrime.\n  The bill covers both handguns and other guns that are semi-automatic \nand can accept detachable magazines.\n  The legislation covers handguns because statistically, these guns are \nused in more crimes than any other. In fact, approximately 85 percent \nof all firearm homicides involve a handgun.\n  And the legislation also covers semi-automatic firearms that can \naccept detachable magazines, because these are the kind of assault \nweapons that have the potential to destroy the largest number of lives \nin the shortest period of time.\n  A gun that can take a detachable magazine can also take a large \ncapacity magazine. Combine that with semi-automatic, rapid fire, and \nyou have a deadly combination--as we have seen time and again in recent \nyears.\n  Put simply, this legislation will cover those firearms that represent \nthe greatest threat to the safety of innocent men, women and children \nin this nation.\n  Common hunting rifles, shotguns and other firearms that cannot accept \ndetachable magazines will remain exempt.\n  Penalties will vary depending on the severity of the violation. But \nin no case will gun owners face jail time simply because they forgot to \nget a license:\n  Those who fail to get a license will face fines of between $500 (for \na first offense) and $5,000 for subsequent offenses.\n  Failing to report a change of address or the loss of a firearm will \nalso result in penalties between $500 and $5,000, because this system \nworks best for law enforcement when the perpetrators of gun crime can \nbe quickly traced and arrested;\n  Dealers who fail to maintain adequate records will face up to 2 years \nin prison--dealers know their responsibilities, and this will give law \nenforcement the tools necessary to root out bad dealers and prevent the \nstraw purchases and other violations of law that allow criminals easy \naccess to a continuing flow of guns;\n  And adults who recklessly or knowingly allow a child access to a \nfirearm face up to three years in prison if the child uses the gun to \nkill or seriously injure another person. In this way, the bill truly \nputs a new sense of responsibility onto gun owners in America.\n  Mr. President, law enforcement in California tells me that a \nlicensing and record of sale system like the one I am introducing today \nwill help law enforcement, upon recovery of a firearm used in crime, to \ntrack the gun down to the person who sold it, and then to the person \nwho bought it.\n  And this legislation also sets in place a method through which we can \nbetter attempt to ensure that gun owners are responsible and trained in \nthe use and care of their dangerous possessions.\n  We have tried to minimize the burden of this bill at every turn:\n  The licensing process will take place through federally licensed \nfirearms dealers--as I mentioned earlier, there are currently more than \n100,000 in this country;\n  The fee for a license will be only $25;\n  Current gun owners will have as many as ten years to get a license, \non a rolling basis, and guns now in homes will not have to be \nregistered;\n  Future gun transfers will simply be recorded by licensed dealers--as \nthey are now--and a system will be put in place to allow the quick \ntracing of guns used in crime. Gun owners themselves will not have to \nregister their old guns or send any paperwork to the government.\n  This nation is awash in guns--there are more than 200 million of them \nin the United States. The problem of gun violence is not going away, \nand accidental deaths from firearms rob us of countless innocents each \nyear.\n  Too many lives are lost every year simply because gun owners do not \nknow how to use or store their firearms--particularly around children. \nIn fact, according to a study released in 1999, in 1996 alone there \nwere more than 1,100 unintentional shooting deaths and more than 18,000 \nfirearm suicides--many of which might have been prevented if the person \nintent on suicide did not have easy access to a gun owned by somebody \nelse. It is my hope that the provisions of this bill, particularly with \nregard to child access prevention, will begin the process of making it \nharder for children and others to gain easy access to firearms.\n  As I said, I know that this bill will not pass overnight. We have a \nlong process of education ahead of us. But the American people are with \nus. The facts are with us. And common sense is with us.\n  I thank the Senate for its consideration of this measure, and I look \nforward to working with each of my colleagues to move this bill forward \nin the coming months.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 25\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the manufacture, distribution, and importation of \n     firearms is inherently commercial in nature;\n       (2) firearms regularly move in interstate commerce;\n       (3) firearms trafficking is so prevalent and widespread in \n     and among the States that it is usually impossible to \n     distinguish between intrastate trafficking and interstate \n     trafficking;\n       (4) to the extent that firearms trafficking is intrastate \n     in nature, it arises out of and is substantially connected \n     with a commercial transaction, which, when viewed in the \n     aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce;\n       (5) because the intrastate and interstate trafficking of \n     firearms are so commingled, full regulation of interstate \n     commerce requires the incidental regulation of intrastate \n     commerce; and\n       (6) it is in the national interest and within the role of \n     the Federal Government to ensure that the regulation of \n     firearms is uniform among the States, that law enforcement \n     can quickly and effectively trace firearms used in crime, and \n     that firearms owners know how to use and safely store their \n     firearms.\n\n[[Page S296]]\n\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act and the amendments \n     made by this Act are--\n       (1) to protect the public against the unreasonable risk of \n     injury and death associated with the unrecorded sale or \n     transfer of qualifying firearms to criminals and youth;\n       (2) to ensure that owners of qualifying firearms are \n     knowledgeable in the safe use, handling, and storage of those \n     firearms;\n       (3) to restrict the availability of qualifying firearms to \n     criminals, youth, and other persons prohibited by Federal law \n     from receiving firearms; and\n       (4) to facilitate the tracing of qualifying firearms used \n     in crime by Federal and State law enforcement agencies.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Department of Energy Authorization Act to \nauthorize the Secretary of Energy to impose interim limitations on the \ncost of electric energy to protect consumers from unjust and \nunreasonable prices in the electric energy market; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          amending the department of energy authorization act\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this bill \ntoday to address problems with the California energy market and the \nunwillingness of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take the \nnecessary action.\n  Last week, the lights went off in California and the governor \ndeclared a state of emergency. More than 1 million businesses and \nhomeowners throughout the state lost power. Computers shut off, ATMs \nstopped dispensing cash, traffic lights went dark and heaters went \ncold, jeopardizing public safety, the economy, and people's lives.\n  The situation continues to worsen, and the prognosis for the future \nis dire. Unfortunately, the problem is not just limited to California. \nPG and Southern California Edison, our two largest blue chip \nutilities are on the brink of bankruptcy and have lost billions. The \nstate's economy has also lost billions from work stoppages that seem to \noccur every single workday.\n  As goes California so goes the rest of the country, I believe. \nCalifornia is the 6th largest economy in the world. Already financial \ninstitutions and banks that have underwritten the debts of our \nutilities are being saddled with their own problems due to the \nuncertainty over whether they will be paid.\n  Those who believe that California deserves its present plight because \nof the state's deregulation bill are near-sighted. California passed a \nvery flawed de-regulation bill in 1996. It was flawed because it relied \nalmost entirely on a free market and assumed that there will always be \nadequate energy supply. What has resulted is an uncompetitive market \nand an absence of adequate supply.\n  I believe California shares a major responsibility here and I am \nencouraged that the state legislature is beginning to take action. \nHowever, the federal government also has a major responsibility because \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Federal Power Act \nholds the only authority over energy generators and marketers. The \nstate cannot address this.\n  Unfortunately, the FERC, even after concluding that rates in \nCalifornia are ``unjust and unreasonable,'' has failed to take the \nnecessary action to solve the crisis. I am thus proposing legislation \ntoday to empower the Secretary of Energy to take the same action \navailable to the FERC in instances when FERC has failed to take \ndecisive action. Individual states would be able to opt out of any \norder from the Secretary as this bill is aimed at helping those states \nthat need and want help.\n  I urge the Senate to take up and pass this bill as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Thompson, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Schumer, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Reed, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Wyden, Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Stabenow, and Ms. \n        Cantwell):\n  S. 27. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nprovide bipartisan campaign reform; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n                      campaign reform legislation\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, today we confront yet again a very serious \nchallenge to our political system, as dangerous in its debasing effect \non our democracy as war and depression have been in the past. And it \nwill take the best efforts of every public-spirited American to defeat \nit. We must overcome the cynicism that is growing rampant in our \nsociety. We must pass campaign reform legislation.\n  That is why first I want to thank our cosponsors for being here \ntoday. They are proof that momentum is on our side and that we will \npass campaign reform legislation and finally follow the American \npeople's will. Action on this issue is long overdue and I am hopeful \nthat this year will present us with our best opportunity yet to achieve \npassage of meaningful campaign reform.\n  Our legislation is simple, bi-partisan, and achieves three primary \nobjectives that will go far to reform our electoral system.\n  The bill: Bans soft money for usage in federal elections; Requires \nincreased disclosure of electioneering communications by so-called \nindependent organizations in a constitutional and clear manner (the \nSnowe-Jeffords language); and Codifies the Supreme Court's Beck \ndecision, a court decision effectively ignored by the previous Clinton \nAdministration and now, under this Act, a decision which would be \nstrictly enforced.\n  After one of the closest elections in our nation's history, there's \none thing the American people are unanimous about--they want their \ngovernment back. We can to that by ridding politics of large, \nunregulated contributions\n\n[[Page S299]]\n\nthat give special interests a seat at the table while average Americans \nare stuck in the back of the room. The Senate needs to act early on \ncampaign finance reform so we can achieve meaningful reform and restore \nthe public's faith in their government.\n  This is not a perfect bill. It does not attempt to solve all the \nevils that plague our campaign system. But we will not let perfect be \nthe enemy of progress. We expect amendments to be offered to this \nlegislation and we fully expect that many of those amendments will be \nconstructive and add to our efforts. We look forward to that kind of \npositive debate.\n  Second, whatever bill passes, it must treat our corporate and union \nconstituencies alike. We must resist any measures that skew this bill \nin favor of any one group. The soft money ban in this bill affects both \ncorporations and unions.\n  And for my Republican friends, I want to emphasize again, if this \nbill passes, the $100,000-plus union soft money checks to the \nDemocratic Party will no longer exist. According to the Washington \nPost, the ``biggest donor of soft money in the (last) campaign was the \nAmerican Federal of State, County, and Municipal Employees (which) gave \nthe Democratic National Committee $1.27 million in last October and \nearly November. AFSCME's soft money total for the election cycle was \n$6.3 million.'' Passage of this bill will end this practice once and \nfor all.\n  The key to our success now lies with a fair and open debate on this \nsubject. In the past, we have been denied any constructive debate on \nthis matter. I am hopeful that Senators Lott and Daschle and the co-\nsponsors of the bill can construct a fair unanimous consent agreement \nthat will allow the Senate to take up and consider numerous amendments, \nwork its will, and craft legislation that can and will be signed into \nlaw by the President. That is now our singular goal. And I am confident \nit can be achieved.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can soon take up and pass this crucial \nlegislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to once again \nintroduce a campaign reform bill with my friend and colleague, the \nSenator from Arizona. This year we have an important new cosponsor, the \nsenior Senator from Mississippi, Senator Thad Cochran, so this bill \nwill be known as the McCain-Feingold-Cochran campaign reform bill.\n  This is the fourth Congress in which Senator McCain and I have \nintroduced a bill. We have made progress each year, and now we are \ncloser than ever to finishing the job for the American people. The time \nfor campaign finance reform to pass the Congress and become law has now \ncome Mr. President. And Senator McCain and I are going to dedicate \nourselves to this issue like never before to make it happen.\n  The bill we are introducing today is broader than S. 1593, the bill \nwe took to the floor in October 1999, but narrower than S. 26, the \nMcCain-Feingold bill that was introduced in the beginning of the last \nCongress. Our bill this year consists of a soft money ban, the Snowe-\nJeffords language on issue ads, the Beck provision on union dues, and a \nfew other provisions that will provide credibility to this reform bill \nas it's passed into law. Very significant in my mind is a clear \nprohibition on political fundraising in federal office buildings. This \nis a strong base bill for reform, but we are ready and willing to \nentertain the suggestions and proposals of all 98 other Senators. Each \nof us in this body is an expert on this issue, and I know that many of \nmy colleagues have innovative ideas on how to improve our election \nlaws. Any amendment that adds to this bill in a positive way and and \ndoesn't undercut its basic principles will be given every \nconsideration.\n  One provision on which we will not compromise is the ban on soft \nmoney. The bill here is as tough and comprehensive as possible, leaving \nno room for the soft money abuses we have seen in the last decade. \nObviously, loopholes will develop over time, but I am satisfied that \nthis bill closes the soft money system down and anticipates at least \nsome of the clever schemes that might be developed to avoid the ban. In \nthe last election cycle, we saw over $500 million in soft money raised \nby the political parties. This system is a scandal that we must \neliminate now.\n  The bill includes the Snowe-Jeffords language on issue ads. This \nprovision will have a major impact on labor union ads, but it is fair \nand balanced between unions and corporations. It will have minimal \nimpact on established advocacy groups like National Right to Life and \nthe Sierra Club because they have a significant small donor base, but \nit will prevent corporations and unions from laundering money through \nsuch groups. It allows groups to continue to run these ads as long as \nthey use only individual money and disclose the large donors to the \neffort. The provision covers only phony issue ads on radio and TV, not \ndirect mail, phone banks, or newspapers, or the Internet, but we are \nopen to working with all sides to work out a fair and balanced way to \nbroaden its coverage if that is what the Senate wants to do.\n  Similarly, we are open to proposals that will require additional \ndisclosure of election related spending by unions, corporations, and \nadvocacy groups. But they must treat all players in this system evenly \nand fairly.\n  That brings me to the issue that has received a lot of attention in \nrecent weeks, so called ``paycheck protection.'' In the past, this has \nbeen a poison pill to reform, but with the changes in the Senate, we \nclearly have the votes to defeat the extreme and one-sided ``paycheck \nprotection proposals that have been offered in the past. We will hold \nthe President and those working with him to the standard that he \nhimself has enunciated any proposal has to be fair and balanced. Our \nbill is currently fair and balanced. It treats unions and corporations \nequally. The paycheck protection proposals we have seen in the past are \nnot fair and balanced. They attack only one player in the election \nsystem labor unions.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to a real debate early this year, not \nonly on our bill but on amendments that my colleagues want to offer. I \nam happy to meet with any Senator who wants to discuss a reform \nproposal. If we all work together, this process can yield a campaign \nreform bill that we will be proud of, and we can start out this new \nCongress by cleaning up our elections and ridding our system of the \ncorrupting of soft money.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, Senator Feingold and I and others--a \nbipartisan group of Senators and friends from the House, Congressman \nShays and Congressman Meehan--just had a press conference announcing \nour intentions. I don't intend to make a statement, except to express \nmy deep and sincere appreciation for my partner, Senator Feingold, who \nsomeday will be written about in another book called profiles in \ncourage for his willingness to stand up to the special interests at a \ntime when his own candidacy was at risk if he did not do so.\n  I thank Senator Feingold, and I look forward to continuing to work \ntogether on this issue. I believe we see a light at the end of the \ntunnel, which is an old phrase from the Vietnam war, uttered by one of \nour civilian leaders during that war. I remind Senator Feingold that \nwhen told of that, a soldier in the field said, ``Yes, the light at the \nend of the tunnel is a train.'' We hope that is not the case in this \nparticular scenario.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \nkind remarks. I am happy to be back with him on this effort. As John \nMcCain has said many times, we know that every Member of the Senate is \nan expert on this issue. Every Member has ideas about how we should \nreform the campaign finance system. What we want out of this is an \nopportunity for an open amending process so the Senate as a whole can \nfashion a bill to send to the President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be left open for \nfurther cosponsors throughout the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friends from \nArizona and from Wisconsin in introducing the McCain-Feingold-Cochran \nbill today. They have worked very hard and very\n\n[[Page S300]]\n\neffectively to bring the attention of not only the Senate but the \nAmerican people to bear on this issue and this important need for \nreform. I am convinced that we are well advised to take this \nlegislation up at an early date in this session of the Congress.\n  The impressions of the last election are fresh on everybody's mind. \nOne that sticks with me very strongly is that candidates were \noverwhelmed in this process by the expenditures of soft money by groups \nbuying ads, some attacking candidates, supporting others, without the \nAmerican public knowing who these groups were, what their goals and \nintentions were, where the money was coming from, or how it was being \nspent. That has to be corrected, and it ought to be corrected.\n  The purpose of the campaign finance laws was to let the American \npeople know from where the money was coming, how it was being used, how \nmuch money was being raised by the candidates and spent by the \ncandidates. We have now lost the right to know because of the loopholes \nthat have been developed and perfected by those who are involving \nthemselves in the election process.\n  I am not against freedom of speech. We want everybody to be able to \nhave their say, but we have a right to know how much they are spending \nand from where the money is coming. I think that is a fundamental part \nof this legislation, and I hope the Senate will take it up and pass it \nin the near future.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McCain-Feingold \nbipartisan campaign finance reform bill of 2001. I am very proud to be \nan original cosponsor of this legislation which goes a long way towards \nreforming our campaign system.\n  I have long supported campaign finance reform. When I ran for the \nSenate from Maine in 1996 I promised my constituents that I would be a \nstrong advocate for campaign finance reform. That pledge led to my \ndecision to cosponsor the campaign finance reform that was introduced \nin 1997 by Senators McCain and Feingold.\n  Unfortunately, comprehensive campaign finance reform efforts have \nbeen thwarted in the past two Congresses. This time, though, we have \nreason for optimism due to new and renewed support.\n  The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001 takes a number of \nimportant steps towards fixing a broken system. First and foremost, the \nbill closes the most glaring loophole in our campaign finance laws by \nbanning the unlimited, unregulated contributions known as ``soft \nmoney.'' ``Soft money'' has made the current law's restrictions and \ncontributions from individuals, corporations, and unions essentially \nmeaningless. Second, the bill requires disclosure by the sponsors of \ncertain issue ads that corporations and labor unions run in the period \nleading up to an election. Third, the bill codifies the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Communication Workers of America v. Beck to ensure that \nnonunion members are not obligated to subsidize the political \nactivities of labor unions. And finally, the bill makes it clear that \nforeign nationals may not contribute any funds--hard or soft--to \nfederal, state, or local elections.\n  My home State of Maine has a deep commitment to preserving the \nintegrity of the electoral system and ensuring that all Mainers have an \nequal political voice. Mainers have backed their commitment to an open \npolitical process in both word and deed. In many regions of Maine, town \nmeetings in which all citizens are invited to debate issues and make \ndecisions are still prevalent. This is unvarnished, direct democracy. \nMaine's tradition of town meetings and equal participation rejects the \nnotion that wealth dictates political discourse. Maine citizens feel \nstrongly about reforming our federal campaign laws, as do I.\n  The problem with soft money was painfully evident during the 1997 \nhearings by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, chaired by my \ngood friend, Senator Thompson. During those investigations, we heard \nfrom one individual who gave $325,000 to the Democratic National \nCommittee in order to secure a picture with the President of the United \nStates. We also heard from the infamous Roger Tamraz who testified that \nthe $300,000 he spend to gain access to the White House was not enough \nand that, next time, he would spend $600,000. And we heard of \nindividuals, such as Chinese cigarette magnate Ted Sioeng, who \norchestrated nearly $600,000 in political contributions during the 1996 \nelection cycle. Sioeng, we later discovered, was a self-described agent \nof the Chinese government.\n  Soft money donations soared in the 2000 presidential election cycle, \nnearly doubling from $262 million in 1996 to $488 million in 2000. At \nthe same time, regulated, hard money donations increased a little more \nthan 10-percent. Soft money, then, is the crest of the wave that has \nswamped our campaign finance system and shaken public confidence in our \ngovernment. I applaud the bipartisan efforts of Senators McCain and \nFeingold and pledge my continued support to see this legislation become \nlaw this year.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the \nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001 to discuss my thoughts and hopes \non the actions the Senate will hopefully be taking in the coming months \non this important issue.\n  First, let me thank the sponsors of the legislation, Senators McCain \nand Feingold, for their tireless perseverance to enact campaign finance \nreform. Without their hard work and vast knowledge, we would not be at \nthis important point. The time has come to schedule a full and open \ndebate on this important issue. I look forward to hearing and debating \nthe many ideas of my colleagues and believe the Senate should strive to \nshow why we are considered the greatest deliberative body in the world \nby fully debating this important topic.\n  Mr. President, I was first elected to Congress following the \nWatergate scandal, right around the time Congress last enacted \ncomprehensive reform of our campaign finance system. I have watched \nwith growing dismay during my over twenty-five years in Congress as the \nnumber of troubling examples of problems in our current campaign \nfinance system have increased. These problems have led to a perception \nby the public that a disconnect exists between themselves and the \npeople that they have elected. I believe that this perception is a \npivotal factor behind the disturbingly low voter turnouts that have \nplagued national elections.\n  While some may point to surveys that list campaign finance reform as \na low priority for the electorate, I believe that the public actually \nstrongly supports Congress debating and enacting comprehensive reform. \nIt is important to reverse the trend of shrinking voter turnout by re-\nestablishing the connection between the public and us, their elected \nrepresentatives, by passing comprehensive campaign finance reform.\n  It is time to restore the public's confidence in our political \nsystem.\n  It is time to increase disclosure requirements and ban soft money.\n  It is time to work together to pass meaningful campaign finance \nreform.\n  As I said earlier, I look forward to a full and open debate on the \nissue of campaign finance reform including the amendments that will be \noffered. At the end of this debate, the Senate should be able to pass \ncomprehensive campaign finance reform. That to me is the most important \naspect of any bill the Senate may pass, it must be comprehensive. If we \nfail to address the problems facing our campaign finance system with a \ncomprehensive balanced package we will ultimately fail in our mission \nof reforming the system. Closing one loophole, without addressing the \nothers in a systematic way, will not do enough to correct the current \ndeficiencies, and may in fact create new and unintended consequences.\n  Mr. President, we have all seen first-hand the problems with the \ncurrent state of the law as it relates to sham issue advertisements. I \nhave focused much time and effort on developing a legislative solution \non this topic with my colleague Senator Olympia Snowe, and was pleased \nthat this solution was adopted by the Senate during the 1998 debate on \ncampaign finance reform. I was also proud to cosponsor the \ncomprehensive campaign finance bill Senators McCain and Feingold \nintroduced last Congress that included this legislative solution.\n  I feel strongly that the legislation the Senate must ultimately vote \non include some kind of changes to the current law concerning sham \nissue advertisements. I feel that we have crafted a\n\n[[Page S301]]\n\nreasonable, constitutional approach to this problem and am extremely \npleased that this legislative solution is again included in the bill we \nintroduce today.\n  That does not mean, though, that we will stop working with our \ncolleagues to craft additional, and perhaps different, ideas to address \nthe problems with the current law on sham issue advertisements. My \nultimate goal is to create a comprehensive campaign finance bill that \nwill garner the support of at least 60 Senators, and hopefully more.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to a full and open debate on this \nimportant issue, and pledge to continue working with my colleagues to \nenact comprehensive campaign finance reform into law this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 28. A bill to guarantee the right of all active duty military \npersonnel, merchant mariners, and their dependents to vote in Federal, \nState, and local elections; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration and the Committee on Rules and Administration, jointly.\n\n\n                   MILITARY VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, along with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, I \nam introducing legislation today which will ensure that active duty \nmilitary personnel and their dependents will never lose their right to \nvote in Federal, State, and local elections. The Military Voting Rights \nAct of 2001 will guarantee that those men and women who protect our \nfreedom are not denied one of the basic rights upon which that freedom \nis based.\n  I initially introduced this legislation in response to an outrageous \ncase in my home state of Texas in which a federal district court, in a \nsuit brought under federal law and supported by federal tax dollars, \nthrew out 800 absentee ballots cast by military personnel in two \nclosely-contested local elections in Val Verde County. While a state \ncourt ultimately restored the military votes, the case clearly \ndemonstrated that military personnel who are away from their legal \nresidence on official orders are at risk of losing their right to vote. \nIn fact, based upon current statistics compiled by the Congressional \nResearch Service and the Department of Defense, over 40 percent of our \ntroops on active duty are residents of states that have no specific \nlegislative provisions protecting their fundamental right to vote in \nstate and local elections.\n  As the Val Verde County case demonstrates, absent specific \nlegislative protection, valid absentee votes cast by military personnel \nwill be ripe targets for attack by those seeking to overturn the \nresults of close elections. I find it unconscionable that American \nmilitary personnel, who stand ready to fight and die for our nation, \nrisk losing their right to vote as a consequence of their military \nservice. To protect our military personnel from any such injustice, I \nagain introduce this legislation in the Senate and ask my colleagues to \nsupport its immediate passage. Those Americans who volunteer to protect \nour freedom by serving in our Armed Forces should not be denied the \nright to vote in any election.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 28\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Voting Rights Act \n     of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for 100 percent of the health insurance costs of self-\nemployed individuals; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          self-employed health insurance fairness act of 2001\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a measure that has \nbroad bipartisan support. Today, with my colleague from Illinois, \nSenator Durbin, I am introducing legislation addressing what is a top \nconcern of small business owners in this country. That is the \navailability of health care.\n  For the past three Congresses, we have worked to level the playing \nfield for America's self-employed by ensuring that they can deduct 100 \npercent of their health insurance premiums. Large corporations, \nbusinesses, and other organizations can deduct 100 percent of what they \npay, but small businesses, up until recently, have been severely \nlimited in what they can deduct.\n  The legislation Senator Durbin and I are introducing today, the Self-\nEmployed Health Insurance Act of 2001, will end finally one of the most \nglaring inequities that has existed in our tax law.\n  I have had the pleasure of serving for over 4 years now as chairman \nof the Senate Committee on Small Business. Throughout, one of my top \npriorities has been to ensure full deductibility of health insurance \nfor the self-employed. We have made some progress. Most notably, in the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we broke through the longstanding cap on \nthe deduction to provide 100-percent deductibility. In 1998, we passed \nlegislation to speed up the date that self-employed can fully deduct \ntheir health insurance costs to 2003 and increase the deductible \namounts in the intervening years.\n  We realize the problem with budget scoring has postponed the \neffective date of this measure, but I have talked to too many small \nbusiness people who tell us they cannot wait until 2003 to get sick or \nto go to 2003 without having coverage for themselves and their \nemployees. The self-employed still cannot afford, in many instances, \nhealth insurance without 100-percent deductibility. They should not \nhave to wait any longer. It is time for us to unite behind this \nbipartisan issue and get this job done.\n  Let me give you a fact, Mr. President. With a self-employed able to \ndeduct only 60 percent of their health insurance costs today and only \n70 percent next year, it probably will come as no surprise to any of us \nthat almost a quarter, 24.2 percent, of the self-employed business \nowners in Missouri do not have health insurance. In fact, 4.8 million \nAmericans live in families headed by a self-employed individual and \nhave no health insurance. Those families include more than 1 million \nchildren who lack adequate health care insurance coverage.\n  The bill Senator Durbin and I are introducing today addresses this \nsituation by making 100-percent deductibility begin this year. Full \ndeductibility will make health insurance affordable to the self-\nemployed and help them get themselves and their families\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\nthe kind of health insurance coverage they should have.\n  This measure also corrects another inequity in the law affecting \nself-employed who try to provide health insurance for themselves, their \nfamilies, and their employees. It deals with an issue I raised in the \nlast Congress.\n  Under the current law, the self-employed lose all the health \ninsurance deduction if they are eligible to participate in another \nplan, whether or not they actually participate. This provision affects \nself-employed individuals such as Steve Hagan in my hometown of Mexico, \nMO. Steve is a financial planner who runs his own small business. \nAlthough he has a group medical plan for his employees, Steve cannot \ndeduct the medical cost of covering himself or his family simply \nbecause his wife is eligible for health insurance through her employer.\n\n  The inequity is clear. Why should he be able to deduct the cost of \nhealth insurance for his employees but not for himself and his family? \nWhat if the insurance available through his wife's employer does not \nmeet the needs of their family?\n  Besides being patently unfair, this is also an enormous trap for the \nunwary. Imagine the small business owner who learns that she can now \ndeduct 60 percent of her health insurance costs this year, and with the \nextra deduction, she can finally afford a group medical plan for \nherself and her employees.\n  Then later in the year, her husband gets a new job that offers health \ninsurance. Suddenly, her self-employed health insurance deduction is \ngone. Sadly, she is left with two choices. She can bear the entire \nburden of her family's coverage, or she can terminate the insurance \ncoverage for all her employees, which will likely increase due to \ncoverage of fewer employees under the plan. The Tax Code should not \nforce small business owners into this kind of ``no win'' situation when \nthey try to provide insurance coverage for their employees and \nthemselves.\n  This bill eliminates this problem by clarifying that the self-\nemployed health insurance deduction is limited only if the self-\nemployed person actually participates in a subsidized health insurance \nplan offered by a spouse's employer or through a second job. It is \nsimply a matter of fairness. It makes common sense. We ought to take \nthis step right now.\n  It is a commonsense measure that answers the urgent plea of small \nbusinesses for fairness in the Tax Code. It has been on the ``must do'' \nlist of the national small business groups for too long. And when I \nhosted the National Women's Small Business Summit this past summer, in \nKansas City, it was at the top of the list among the recommendations we \nreceived.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity to work together. Let's take this \nopportunity and finish the job.\n  I had initially offered a list of 21 original cosponsors. I ask \nunanimous consent that, in addition to those cosponsors, the following \nSenators be added: The Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi; the Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Lugar; the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts; the Senator \nfrom Maine, Ms. Collins; the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter; \nand the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill and a \ndescription of its provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 29\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Self-Employed Health \n     Insurance Fairness Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEDUCTION FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS OF SELF-EMPLOYED \n                   INDIVIDUALS INCREASED.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 162(l)(1) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to special rules for health insurance \n     costs of self-employed individuals) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(1) Allowance of deduction.--In the case of an individual \n     who is an employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(1), \n     there shall be allowed as a deduction under this section an \n     amount equal to the amount paid during the taxable year for \n     insurance which constitutes medical care for the taxpayer, \n     the taxpayer's spouse, and dependents.''\n       (b) Clarification of Limitations on Other Coverage.--The \n     first sentence of section 162(l)(2)(B) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to read as follows: \n     ``Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any taxpayer for any \n     calendar month for which the taxpayer participates in any \n     subsidized health plan maintained by any employer (other than \n     an employer described in section 401(c)(4)) of the taxpayer \n     or the spouse of the taxpayer.''\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2000.\n                                  ____\n\n\nS. 29--Self-Employed Health Insurance Fairness Act of 2001--Description \n                             of Provisions\n\n  The bill amends section 162(l)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code to \nincrease the deduction for health-insurance costs for self-employed \nindividuals to 100% beginning on January 1, 2001. Currently the self-\nemployed can only deduct 60% of these costs. The deduction is not \nscheduled to reach 100% until 2003, under the provisions of the Omnibus \nConsolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1998, \nwhich was signed into law in October 1998. The bill is designed to \nplace self-employed individuals on an equal footing with large \nbusinesses, which can currently deduct 100% of the health-insurance \ncosts for all of their employees.\n  The bill also corrects a disparity under current law that bars a \nself-employed individual from deducting any of his or her health-\ninsurance costs if the individual is eligible to participate in another \nhealth-insurance plan. This provision affects self-employed individuals \nwho are eligible for, but do not participate in, a health-insurance \nplan offered through a second job or through a spouse's employer. That \ninsurance plan may not be adequate for the self-employed business \nowner, and this provision prevents the self-employed from deducting the \ncosts of insurance policies that do meet the specific needs of their \nfamilies. In addition, this provision provides a significant \ndisincentive for self-employed business owners to provide group health \ninsurance for their employees. The bill ends this disparity by \nclarifying that a self-employed person loses the deduction only if he \nor she actually participates in another health-insurance plan.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nMissouri, to introduce ``The Self-Employed Health Insurance Fairness \nAct of 2001'', as our first order of business for the new Congress. We \nhave both been working on this issue for many years now and are hopeful \nthat we can finally get the bill fully enacted this year. In past \nyears, we have each introduced very similar bills and this year we are \ncombining our efforts by introducing this bipartisan bill, which we \nintend to pursue vigorously throughout this Congress.\n  This bill would allow the self-employed to take a full tax deduction \nfor their health insurance premiums as of December 31, 2000. \nCorporations already can take a full deduction for these expenses and \nthis bill would level the playing field by allowing the self-employed \nto take the same full deduction. This bill would mean that the farmer \nand the agribusiness would be treated the same.\n  Under current law, the self-employed may only deduct 60 percent of \ntheir health insurance premiums this year. The deductibility will \nincrease to 70 percent in 2002 and 100 percent in 2003. I am committed \nto seeing the self-employed receive equal treatment sooner rather than \nlater.\n  The self-employed pay over 30 percent more for their health insurance \nthan those insured by group health plans. This makes it much harder for \nthem to afford health insurance. More than 22 percent of the self-\nemployed were without health insurance in 1999, compared to 17.5 \npercent of other workers. That means that 4.8 million self-employed \nAmericans went without health insurance in 1999.\n  In Illinois, 17 percent of the self-employed were without health \ninsurance in 1999, up from 14 percent in 1996. The vast majority of \nthese individuals are members of low-income working families. Fifty-\nthree percent of the self-employed living on less than $20,000 in \nIllinois are without health insurance. This compares with 34 percent of \nother Illinois working families with the same low income level. Almost \n50 percent of those self-employed individuals who were without health \ninsurance at some\n\n[[Page S303]]\n\ntime during 1995, went without health insurance for the entire year. In \ncomparison, 62 percent of government workers saw their lack of coverage \nend within 4 months or less.\n  Overall, the self-employed pay more for health insurance and are \ntherefore more likely to be uninsured, and they remain uninsured longer \nthan other workers. This is exacerbated by their unequal treatment by \nthe tax code. Congress should move expeditiously to level the playing \nfield and help more hard-working, self-employed individuals and their \nfamilies to afford the health insurance that they need and deserve.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today, as an original cosponsor of \nS. 29, the Self-Employed Health Insurance Fairness Act of 2001, to \nspeak about the importance of making health insurance a more affordable \noption for self-employed Americans. The legislation moves forward--by \ntwo years--the effective date for making health insurance fully \ndeductible for self-employed taxpayers. In the early 1990s, I authored \nbills to ensure that the deduction--then 25 percent--would not expire. \nWe won that battle, and throughout the 1990s I consistently fought for \nincreases in the deductible amount. Finally, in 1997, we enacted \nlegislation to allow full, 100 percent deductibility of health \ninsurance for the self-employed, phased in by 2003.\n  Mr. President, in these times of surpluses, as we reap the benefits \nof our fiscal discipline, the self-employed farmers, ranchers, and \nentrepreneurs in Montana and across the country deserve this important \ntax relief today. My small business and self-employed constituents \nconstantly tell me that purchasing health insurance is one of the \nthings they would most like to be able to do at their business. It is \nsimply unfair that large businesses are allowed to deduct 100 percent \nof their employees' health insurance costs, while the self-employed \nmust wait until 2003 for this privilege. In this country, we have a \nsystem of health insurance that encourages Americans to purchase health \ninsurance through their employer. Allowing self-employed purchasers of \nhealth insurance the same deduction permitted to large employers \nadheres to those concepts and adds a measure of tax equity.\n  I thank Senators Durbin and Bond for so actively pursuing enactment \nof this legislation. I believe the time is right to allow full \ndeductibility of health insurance for the hard-working self-employed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Edwards):\n  S. 30. A bill to strengthen control by consumers over the use and \ndisclosure of their personal financial and health information by \nfinancial institutions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n              FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to address a very important issue: the \nprotection of every American's personal, sensitive, financial \ninformation that is held by their financial institutions.\n  Few Americans understand that, under Federal law, a financial \ninstitution could take information it obtains about a customer through \nhis or her transactions, and sell or transfer that information to an \naffiliated company without the customer being able to object. And the \ncustomer has no right to get access to or correct that information.\n  The amount of information that could be disclosed is enormous. It \nincludes: savings and checking account balances; certificate of deposit \nmaturity dates and balances; any check an individual writes; any check \nthat is deposited into a customer's account; stock and mutual fund \npurchases and sales; and life insurance payouts.\n  In considering this issue, I start with the threshold question: whose \ninformation is it? Is it the individual's or the institution's? I \nbelieve this information belongs to the individual.\n  To help alleviate the concerns of American consumers, I am \nintroducing legislation that would give customers the right to choose \nwhether their financial institutions should be allowed to transfer this \ndate for unintended uses. I am pleased that Senators Leahy, Dodd, Reed, \nKerry, Harkin and Edwards are joining me in co-sponsoring the Financial \nInformation Privacy Protection Act of 2001. I want to particularly \nrecognize Senator Leahy, chairman of the Democratic Privacy Caucus, for \nhis strong leadership on the privacy issue over the years.\n  This bill seeks to protect a fundamental right of privacy for every \nAmerican who entrusts his or her highly sensitive and confidential \nfinancial information to a financial institution. Every American should \nat least have the opportunity to say ``no'' if he or she does not want \nthat nonpublic information disclosed. Every American should have the \nright to have especially sensitive information held by his or her \nfinancial institution kept confidential unless consent is given. Every \nAmerican should be allowed to make certain that the information is \naccurate and, if it is not, have it corrected. And, put quite simply, \nthese rights should be enforced.\n  The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2001 would \naccomplish these objectives.\n  Today's technology makes it easier, faster, and less costly than ever \nfor institutions to have immediate access to large amounts of customer \ninformation; to analyze that data; and to send that data to others. \nWith the passage of financial services modernization legislation in \n1999, banks, securities firms and insurance firms are now allowed to \naffiliate and offer their multiple products to each other's customers. \nAs a result, many financial institutions are warehousing large amounts \nof sensitive information and sharing it throughout the affiliate \nstructure without the customer being fully informed of what financial \ninformation is being disclosed or the purposes for which it will be \nused. While cross-marketing can bring new and beneficial products to \nreceptive consumers, it can also result in unwanted invasions of \npersonal privacy.\n  Surveys have consistently shown that the public is widely concerned \nabout its privacy. For example, a recent AARP survey found that 96% of \nrespondents were unwilling to let a company freely share their \nfinancial information with other financial companies. The survey also \nasked, ``[w]ho owns financial information provided in a business \ntransaction?'' and 93% of respondents answered that the information \nbelongs to the ``customer'' while only 4% answered that it belongs to \nthe `'business'' (and 3% said they did not know).\n  Congress has already protected citizens' privacy on prior occasions. \nIn response to public concerns, Congress passed privacy laws \nrestricting companies' disclosure of customer information without \ncustomer consent, such as in the Cable Communications Policy Act and \nthe Video Privacy Protection Act. Yet while video rentals and cable \ntelevision selections are prohibited by law from being disclosed, \nmillions of Americans cannot object to disclosure of their financial \ntransactions to their financial institutions' affiliates and certain \nother financial companies for purposes inconsistent with those for \nwhich they gave their data.\n  Other important privacy concerns, such as the privacy of bankruptcy \ncourt records, fall outside of this bill. Last week, the Clinton \nadministration published a study ``Financial Privacy in Bankruptcy'' \nwith important recommendations that should be carefully considered. I \ncommend the Administration for its many efforts to protect individuals' \nright to privacy.\n  Along with medical records, financial records rank among the kinds of \npersonal data Americans most expect will be kept confidential. However, \nthe privacy of even highly sensitive financial information has been \nincreasingly put at risk with the move to an economy in which the \nselling or sharing of consumers' personal information is highly \nprofitable--and legal.\n  The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2001 contains key \nfinancial privacy protections that are consistent with the expectations \nof Americans and good business practices.\n  The Act would provide consumers with:\n  An ``opt out'' for affiliate sharing, allowing customers to object to \nfinancial institutions sharing their financial data with all affiliated \nfirms.\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\n  An ``opt in'' for sharing some types of sensitive financial or \nmedical information. A financial institution would need to have a \nconsumer's affirmative consent before releasing his or her medical \ninformation or personal spending habits (e.g., credit card charges, \ncheck payees) to either an affiliate or an unaffiliated third party.\n  Rights of access and correction. A consumer would be able to see the \ninformation to be released and correct material errors. To preclude \nabuse of this protection, the bill allows the institution to charge for \naccess to this information.\n  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, enacted in November 1999, contains some \nlimited Federal financial privacy protections for consumers. While an \nimportant beginning, these protections fail to meet the expectations of \nAmericans. It does not contain the important protections that I have \njust referred to. Many groups have criticized the current law as \ninadequate. I agree.\n  This bill would not affect Section 507 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, \nwhich I authored, which provides that these Federal privacy protections \ndo not pre-empt stronger State privacy laws. States with citizens who \nwant stronger privacy protections than contained in Federal law would \nstill be able to enact such laws.\n  A number of consumer groups, including Consumers Union, Consumer \nFederation of America, Consumer Action, Privacy Times, United Auto \nWorkers and U.S. Public Interest Research Group, have stated their \nsupport of this bill. Mr. President, I would ask that their letter of \nendorsement be included at the end of my remarks. Professor Peter \nSwire, Professor of Law at Ohio State University and formerly the \nClinton Administration's Chief Counselor for Privacy, has said: ``The \nbill is carefully crafted to provide the greatest protections for the \nmost sensitive financial information. At the same time, the bill helps \ncreate an efficient financial system by allowing the use of information \nin situations where the risk to privacy is minimal.''\n  The issue of financial privacy cuts across philosophical lines.\n  For example, Mrs. Phyllis Schlafly and the Eagle Forum have spoken \nout for financial privacy protections even stronger than those \ncontained in this bill. She has written, ``Some banks shamelessly admit \nthey profile their customers so the bank can advise telemarketers which \nproducts a customer might like. But why should banks be able to make \nsecret profits off of customers' personal information such as deposits, \nchecks, phone numbers or credit card numbers? Many of us don't want to \nbe solicited by any telemarketers.''\n  Columnist William Safire has written frequently about the need for \nstronger privacy protections. For instance, in an editorial in the New \nYork times of October 30, 2000, Mr. Safire pointed out that many people \nare concerned about financial records, and other records, ``being \npassed around by conglomerated banks, insurance companies and H.M.O.'s. \nPersonal freedom is diminished when the most intimate secrets can be \nmonitored by employers and merchants.''\n  As we proceed in an age of technological advances and cross-industry \nmarketing of financial services, we need to be mindful of the privacy \nconcerns of the American public. Consumers who wish to keep their \nsensitive financial information private should be given a right to do \nso. The passage of the financial information Privacy Protection Act of \n2001 would be a major step toward that goal. Congress can and should \nprovide that privacy protection by giving consumers, at a minimum, the \nrights of consent and access.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 30\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Prior to \n     prescribing such regulations, the Federal Trade Commission \n     shall consult with the Federal banking agencies referred to \n     in paragraph (1) of this subsection in order to ensure, to \n     the extent possible, comparability and consistency with the \n     regulations issued by the Federal banking agencies under that \n     paragraph.''.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 January 22, 2001.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: We are writing in support of the \n     introduction of the Financial Information Privacy Act of \n     2001. If passed this legislation will correct many of the \n     shortcomings of the Gramm-Leach-Biley Act. The Financial \n     Privacy Act will be a significant improvement for consumers \n     by requiring financial institutions to obtain a consumer's \n     consent before sensitive financial and medical data is \n     shared, extending privacy protections to the sharing of \n     information among affiliated companies, and allowing \n     consumers to have access to the information about them that \n     is held by financial institutions.\n       The GLB's privacy provisions are grossly inadequate. Mere \n     notice that data is being collected with a limited ability of \n     consumers to prevent the sharing of personal data--one that \n     is riddled with loopholes--fail to provide the privacy \n     protections that American consumers want and deserve. Instead \n     of protecting personal privacy, GLB protects the ability of \n     the financial services industry to collect and use personal \n     information about their customers with virtually no \n     restrictions.\n       As personal privacy continues to erode, it is vital that \n     consumers be given strong privacy protections. The current \n     trend of favoring the appetite of business interests over the \n     privacy of individuals must be reversed.\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\n     If a financial institution cannot convince its customers that \n     the sharing of their personal information will be safe and \n     beneficial to them, then the financial institution should not \n     be allowed to share that information.\n       The Financial Privacy Act is a step in advancing some of \n     the Fair Information Principles supported by our \n     organizations in the context of financial services. We will \n     continue to seek the strongest possible privacy safeguards \n     for Americans, including expanded medical privacy \n     protections, limitations on initial collection practices, and \n     increased enforcement mechanisms. Those protections may even \n     go beyond those in this bill.\n       We appreciate your introducing this important legislation \n     and look forward to working with you on future legislative \n     efforts to protect the privacy of all Americans.\n         Ken McEldowney, Consumer Action.\n         Travis Plunkett, Consumer Federation of America.\n         Frank Torres, Consumers Union.\n         Jason Catlett, Junkbusters.\n         Even Hendricks, Privacy Times.\n         Mary Rouleau, United Auto Workers.\n         Edmund Mierzwinski, US Public Interest Research Group.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be a original \ncosponsor of the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2001. \nI am delighted to join Senator Sarbanes, the ranking member of the \nSenate Banking Committee, who is a real leader in the Senate on \nprotecting personal financial information.\n  In November 1999, President Clinton signed into law the landmark \nFinancial Modernization Act, which updated our financial laws and opens \nup the financial services industry to become more competitive, both at \nhome and abroad. Many of my colleagues and I supported that legislation \nbecause we believe it will benefit businesses and consumers. It is \nalready making it easier for banking, securities, and insurance firms \nto consolidate their services, cut expenses and offer more products at \na lower cost to all. But this consolidation also raises new concern \nabout our financial privacy.\n  New conglomerates in the financial services industry are offering a \nwidening variety of services, each of which may require a customer to \nprovide financial, medical or other personal information. Nothing in \nthe new law prevents these new subsidiaries or affiliates of financial \nconglomerates from sharing this information for uses beyond those the \ncustomer thought he or she was providing it. For example, the new law \nhas no requirement for the consumer to control whether these new \nfinancial subsidiaries or affiliates sell, share, or publish \ninformation on savings account balances, certificates of deposit \nmaturity dates and balances, stock and mutual fund purchases and sales, \nlife insurance payouts or health insurance claims. That is wrong.\n  I believe the Financial Information Privacy Protection Act of 2001 \nshould serve as the foundation for model financial privacy legislation \nthat Congress enacts into law this year. This bill is a common sense \napproach that can attract both consumers and the industry.\n  Privacy is one of our most vulnerable rights in the information age. \nDigitalization of information offers tremendous benefits but also new \nthreats. Some in Congress are content to punt the privacy issue down \nthe field for another year. The public disagrees. People know that the \nlonger we dawdle, the harder it will be to halt the erosion of privacy. \nA year is an eternity in the digital age.\n  The right of privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by \nthe Constitution of the United States. But today, the American people \nare growing more and more concerned over encroachments on their \npersonal privacy. To return personal financial privacy to the control \nof the consumer, this legislation would create the following rights in \nFederal law.\n  New Right To Opt-out of Information Sharing By Affiliates. The new \nfinancial modernization law permits consumers to say no to information \nsharing, selling or publishing among third parties in many cases, but \nnot among affiliated firms. The Financial Information Privacy Act of \n2001 would require financial conglomerates, which will only grow under \nthe new modernization law, to expand this protection to give consumers \nthe right to notify it (opt-out) to stop all information sharing, \nselling or publishing of personal financial information among all third \nparties and affiliates.\n  New Right For Consumers To Opt-In For Sharing of Medical Information \nand Personal Spending Habits. The Financial Information Privacy \nProtection Act of 2001 would require financial firms to get the \naffirmative consent (opt-in) of consumers before a firm could gain \naccess to medical information within a financial conglomerate or share \ndetailed information about a consumer's personal spending habits.\n  New Right To Access and Correct Financial Information. The Financial \nInformation Privacy Protection Act of 2001 would give consumers the \nright to review and correct their financial records, just like \nconsumers today may review and correct their credit reports.\n  New Right To Privacy Policy Up Front. The Financial Information \nPrivacy Protection Act of 2001 would require financial firms to provide \ntheir privacy policies to consumers before committing to a customer \nrelationship, not after. In addition, the bill's new rights would be \nenforced by federal banking regulators, the Federal Trade Commission \nand state attorney generals.\n  Unfortunately, if you have a checking account, you may have a \nfinancial privacy problem. Your bank may sell or share with business \nallies information about who you are writing checks to, when, and for \nhow much. And even if you tell your bank to stop, it can ignore you \nunder current law. This legislation returns to consumers the power to \nstop the selling or sharing of personal financial information.\n  Americans ought to be able to enjoy the exciting innovations of this \nburgeoning information era without losing control over the use of their \nfinancial information. The Financial Information Privacy Protection Act \nof 2001 updates United States privacy laws to provide these \nfundamentals protections of personal financial information in the \nevolving financial services industry. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 31. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to phase out \nthe estate and gift taxes over a 10-year period; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n             Estate and Gift Tax Rate Reduction Act of 2001\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I reintroduce a bill that I feel \nis of vital importance to farmers and family business owners, the \nEstate and Gift Tax Rate Reduction Act of 2001.\n  This bill is based on legislation I introduced in the 105th Congress \nand the 106th Congress. Unfortunately, the 105th Congress adjourned \nbefore we could debate and pass this bill and President Clinton vetoed \nsimilar legislation during the 106th Congress. Since then, I have heard \nfrom numerous Coloradans and National organizations and am fully aware \nthat the problems the bill would correct still exist. In fact, I have \nheard from hundreds of Coloradans and constituents from other states \nregarding this burdensome and overreaching tax. I believe that \neliminating this tax is a fundamental issue of fairness. Death should \nnot be an event government prospers from.\n  Estate and gift taxes remain a burden on American families, \nparticularly those who pursue the American dream of owning their own \nbusiness. That is because family-owned businesses and farms are hit \nwith the highest tax rate when they are handed down to descendants--\noften immediately following the death of a loved one. Families ought to \nbe encouraged, not discouraged, from building successful farms, ranches \nand businesses and keeping the ownership of those enterprises within \nthe families that worked to make them successful.\n  These taxes, and the financial burdens and difficulties they create \ncome at the worst possible time. Making a terrible situation worse is \nthe fact that the rate of this estate tax is crushing, reaching as high \nas 55 percent for the highest bracket. That's higher than even the \nhighest income tax rate bracket of 39 percent. Furthermore, the tax is \ndue as soon as the business is turned over to the heir, allowing no \ntime for financial planning or the setting aside of money to pay the \ntax bills. Estate and gift taxes right now are one of the leading \nreasons why the number of family-owned farms and businesses are \ndeclining; the burden of this tax is just too much to bear.\n  This tax sends the troubling message that families should either sell \nthe business while they are still alive, in order to spare their \ndescendants this huge tax after their passing, or run-down the value of \nthe business, so that\n\n[[Page S308]]\n\nit won't make it into the higher tax brackets. This is not how America \nwas built. Private investment and initiative have historically been a \nstrong part of our American heritage and we should encourage those \nvalues, not tax successful family businesses into submission.\n  That is why I again introduce this bill and will fight for its \npassage during the 107th Congress. It will gradually eliminate this tax \nby phasing it out--reducing the amount of the tax 5% each year, \nbeginning with the highest rate bracket of 55%, until the tax rate \nreaches zero. Several states have already adopted similar plans, and I \nbelieve we ought to follow their example. We need to change the message \nwe are sending to farmers and family business owners. Leading \norganizations agree, and have continuously endorsed this legislation. \nIn fact, over 100 organizations, like the National Federation of \nIndependent Business and the Farm Bureau, have joined together to form \nthe Family Business Estate Tax Coalition, which strongly endorsed this \nbill during the 106th Congress.\n  Mr. President, this tax should be eliminated across the board, and I \nask my colleagues to help in working to achieve that goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Estate and Gift Tax Rate \n     Reduction Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) estate and gift tax rates, which reach as high as 55 \n     percent of a decedent's taxable estate, are in most cases \n     substantially in excess of the tax rates imposed on the same \n     amount of regular income and capital gains income; and\n       (2) a reduction in estate and gift tax rates to a level \n     more comparable with the rates of tax imposed on regular \n     income and capital gains income will make the estate and gift \n     tax less confiscatory and mitigate its negative impacts on \n     American families and businesses.\n\n     SEC. 3. PHASEOUT OF ESTATE AND GIFT TAXES.\n\n       (a) Repeal of Estate and Gift Taxes.--Subtitle B of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to estate and gift \n     taxes) is repealed effective with respect to estates of \n     decedents dying, and gifts made, after December 31, 2011.\n       (b) Phaseout of Tax.--Subsection (c) of section 2001 of \n     such Code (relating to imposition and rate of tax) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(3) Phaseout of tax.--In the case of estates of decedents \n     dying, and gifts made, during any calendar year after 2001 \n     and before 2012--\n       ``(A) In general.--The tentative tax under this subsection \n     shall be determined by using a table prescribed by the \n     Secretary (in lieu of using the table contained in paragraph \n     (1)) which is the same as such table; except that--\n       ``(i) each of the rates of tax shall be reduced (but not \n     below zero) by the number of percentage points determined \n     under subparagraph (B), and\n       ``(ii) the amounts setting forth the tax shall be adjusted \n     to the extent necessary to reflect the adjustments under \n     clause (i).\n       ``(B) Percentage points of reduction.--\n\n                                                          The number of\n``For calendar year:                              percentage points is:\n  2002...........................................................5 ....\n\n  2003..........................................................10 ....\n\n  2004..........................................................15 ....\n\n  2005..........................................................20 ....\n\n  2006..........................................................25 ....\n\n  2007..........................................................30 ....\n\n  2008..........................................................35 ....\n\n  2009..........................................................40 ....\n\n  2010..........................................................45 ....\n\n  2011..........................................................50.....\n\n       ``(C) Coordination with paragraph (2).--Paragraph (2) shall \n     be applied by reducing the 55 percent percentage contained \n     therein by the number of percentage points determined for \n     such calendar year under subparagraph (B).\n       ``(D) Coordination with credit for state death taxes.--\n     Rules similar to the rules of subparagraph (A) shall apply to \n     the table contained in section 2011(b) except that the number \n     of percentage points referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) shall \n     be determined under the following table:\n\n                                                          The number of\n``For calendar year:                              percentage points is:\n  2002......................................................1\\1/2\\ ....\n\n  2003...........................................................3 ....\n\n  2004......................................................4\\1/2\\ ....\n\n  2005...........................................................6 ....\n\n  2006......................................................7\\1/2\\ ....\n\n  2007...........................................................9 ....\n\n  2008.....................................................10\\1/2\\ ....\n\n  2009..........................................................12 ....\n\n  2010.....................................................13\\1/2\\ ....\n\n  2011........................................................15.''....\n\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to estates of decedents dying, and gifts made, \n     after December 31, 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 32. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to clarify the \nremedial jurisdiction of inferior Federal courts; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                   judicial taxation prohibition act\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprohibit Federal judges from imposing a tax increase as a judicial \nremedy.\n  It has always been my firm belief that Federal judges exceed the \nboundaries of their limited jurisdiction under the Constitution when \nthey order new taxes or order increases in existing tax rates.\n  The Founding Fathers clearly understood that taxation was a role for \nthe legislative branch and not the judicial branch. Article I of the \nConstitution lists the legislative powers, one of which is that ``the \nCongress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes.'' Article III \nestablishes the judicial powers, and the power to tax is nowhere \ncontained in Article III.\n  The Federalist Papers are also clear in this regard. in Federalist \nNo. 48, James Madison explained that ``the legislative branch alone has \naccess to the pockets of the people.'' In Federalist No. 78, Alexander \nHamilton stated, ``The judiciary . . . has no influence over . . . the \npurse, no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the \nsociety, and can take no active resolution whatever.''\n  In 1990, in the case of Missouri v. Jenkins, five members of the \nSupreme Court stated in dicta that although a Federal judge could not \ndirectly raise taxes, he could order the local government to raise \ntaxes. There is no difference between a judge raising taxes and a judge \nordering a legislative official to raise taxes. I am hopeful that, if \nthe issue were directly before the Court today, a majority of the \ncurrent membership of the Court would reject that dicta and hold that \nFederal judges do not have the power to order that taxes be raised. \nHowever, in the event the Court does not correct this error, I am \nintroducing the Judicial Taxation Prohibition Act, which would prohibit \njudges from raising taxes. I have introduced it in every Congress since \nthe Supreme Court's misguided decision was issued, and I intend to do \nso until it is corrected. This legislation is essential to affirm the \nseparation of powers.\n  There is a simple reason why this distinction between the branches of \ngovernment is so important and must remain clear. The legislative \nbranch is responsible to the people through the democratic process. \nHowever, the judicial branch is composed of individuals who are not \nelected and have life tenure. By design, the members of the judicial \nbranch do not depend on the popular will for their offices. They are \nnot accountable to the people. They simply have no business setting the \nrate of taxes the people must pay. For a judge to order that taxes be \nincreased amounts to taxation without representation. It is entirely \ncontrary to the understanding of the Founding Fathers.\n  The phrase ``taxation without representation'' recalls an important \ntime in American history that is worth repeating in some detail. The \nConstitution can best be understood by referencing the era in which it \nwas adopted.\n  Not since Great Britain's ministry of George Grenville in 1765 have \nthe American people faced the assault of taxation without \nrepresentation as now authorized in the Jenkins decision. As part of \nhis imperial reforms to tighten British control in the colonies, \nGrenville pushed the Stamp Act through the Parliament in 1765. This Act \nrequired excise duties to be paid by the colonists in the form of \nrevenue stamps affixed to a variety of legal documents. This action \ncame at a time when the colonies were in an uproar over the Sugar Act \nof 1764 which levied duties on certain imports such as sugar, indigo, \ncoffee, and linens.\n  The ensuing firestorm of debate in America centered on the power of \nBritain to tax the colonies. James Otis, a young Boston attorney, \nechoed the opinion of most colonists stating that the parliament did \nnot have power to tax the colonies because Americans had no \nrepresentation in that body. Mr.\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\nOtis had been attributed with the statement in 1761 that ``taxation \nwithout representation is tyranny.''\n\n  In October 1765, delegates from nine states were sent to New York as \npart of the Stamp Act Congress to protest the new law. It was during \nthis time that John Adams wrote in opposition to the Stamp Act, ``we \nhave always understood it to be a grand and fundamental principle * * * \nthat no free man shall be subject to any tax to which he has not given \nhis own consent, in person or by proxy.'' A number of resolutions were \nadopted by the Stamp Act Congress protesting the acts of Parliament. \nOne resolution stated, ``It is inseparably essential to the freedom of \na people * * * that no taxes be imposed on them, but with their own \nconsent, given personally or by their representatives.'' The \nresolutions concluded that the Stamp Act had a ``manifest tendency to \nsubvert the rights and liberties of the colonists.''\n  Opposition to the Stamp Act was vehement throughout the colonies. \nWhile Grenville's successor was determined to repeal the law, the \nsocial, economic, and political climate in the colonies brought on the \nAmerican Revolution. The principles expressed during the earlier crisis \nagainst taxation without representation became firmly imbedded in our \nFederal Constitution of 1787.\n  I recognize that some say this legislation is unconstitutional. They \nargue that the Congress does not have the authority under Article III \nto limit and regulate the jurisdiction of the inferior Federal courts. \nThis argument has no basis in the Constitution or common sense.\n  Article III, Section 1, of the Constitution provides jurisdiction to \nthe lower Federal courts as the ``Congress may from time to time ordain \nand establish.'' There is no mandate in the Constitution to confer \nequity jurisdiction to the inferior Federal courts. Congress has the \nflexibility under Article III to ``ordain and establish'' the lower \nFederal courts as it deems appropriate. This basic premise has been \nupheld by the Supreme Court in a number of cases including Lawcourt v. \nPhillips, Lauf v. E.G. Skinner and Co., Kline v. Burke Construction \nCo., and Sheldon v. Sill.\n  In other words, the Congress was expressly granted the authority to \nestablish lower Federal courts, which it did. What the Congress has \nbeen given the power to do, it can certainly decide to stop doing. By \npassing this bill, the Congress would simply be limiting the \njurisdiction of the lower Federal courts in a small area.\n  It is also important to note that this legislation would not restrict \nthe power of the Federal courts to remedy Constitutional wrongs. \nClearly, the Court has the power to order a remedy for a Constitutional \nviolation that may include expenditures of money by Federal, State, or \nlocal governments. This bill simply requires that if the Court orders \nthat money be spent, it is for the legislative body to decide how to \ncomply with that order. The legislative body may choose to raise taxes, \nbut it also may choose to cut spending or sell assets. That choice of \nhow to come up with the money should always be for the legislature to \ndecide. I believe it is clear under Article III that the Congress has \nthe authority to restrict the remedial jurisdiction of the Federal \nCourts in this fashion.\n  Mr. President, the dispositive issue presented by the Jenkins \ndecision is whether the American people want, as a matter of national \npolicy, to be exposed to taxation without their consent by an \nindependent and insulated judiciary. I most assuredly believe they do \nnot.\n  Mr. President, how long will it be before a Federal judge orders tax \nincreases to build new highways or prisons? I do not believe the \nFounding Fathers had this type of activism in mind when they \nestablished the judicial branch of government.\n  Judicial activism is a matter of great concern to me and has been for \nmany years. I have always felt that Federal judges must strictly adhere \nto the principle that it is their role to interpret the law and not \nmake the law. This simple principle is fundamental to our system of \ngovernment.\n  The American people deserve a response to the Jenkins decision. We \nmust provide protection against the imposition of taxes by an \nunelected, unaccountable judiciary. We must not permit this blatant \nviolation of the separation of powers. We have a duty to right this \nwrong.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 32\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Judicial Taxation \n     Prohibition Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title II of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to \nexclude prisoners from the requirements of that title and section; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress an undue burden that has arisen out of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act.\n  The purpose of the ADA was to give disabled Americans the opportunity \nto fully participate in society and contribute to it. This was a worthy \ngoal. But even legislation with the best of intentions often has \nunintended consequences. I submit that one of those is the application \nof the ADA to state and local prisoners throughout America.\n  In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled in Pennsylvania Department of \nCorrections v. Yeskey [118 S.Ct. 1952 (1998)] that the\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\nADA applies to every state prison and local jail in this country. To no \navail, the Attorneys General of most states, as well as numerous state \nand local organizations, had joined with Pennsylvania in court filings \nto oppose the ADA applying to prisoners.\n  Prior to the Supreme Court ruling, the circuit courts were split on \nthe issue. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, my home circuit, had \nforcefully concluded that the ADA, as well as its predecessor and \ncompanion law, the Rehabilitation Act, did not apply to state \nprisoners. The decision focused on federalism concerns and the fact \nthat the Congress did not make clear that it intended to involve itself \nto this degree in an activity traditionally reserved to the states.\n  However, the Supreme Court did not agree, holding that the language \nof the Act is broad enough to clearly cover state prisons. It is not an \nissue on the Federal level because the Federal Bureau of Prisons \nvoluntarily complies with the Act. The Supreme Court did not say \nwhether applying the ADA to state prisons exceeded the Congress's \npowers under the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, but we \nshould not wait on the Supreme Court to consider this argument before \nacting. Although it was rational for the Supreme Court to read the \nbroad language of the ADA the way it did, it is far from clear that we \nin the Congress considered the application of this sweeping new social \nlegislation in the prison environment.\n  The Seventh Circuit has recognized that the ``failure to exclude \nprisoners may well have been an oversight.'' The findings and purpose \nof the law seem to support this. The introductory language of the ADA \nstates, ``The Nation's proper goals regarding individuals with \ndisabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, \nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency'' to allow ``people \nwith disabilities * * * to compete on an equal basis and to pursue \nthose opportunities for which our free society is justifiably famous.'' \nOf course, a prison is not a free society, as the findings and purpose \nof the Act envisioned. Indeed, it is quite the opposite. In short, as \nthe Ninth Circuit explained, ``The Act was not designed to deal \nspecifically with the prison environment; it was intended for general \nsocietal application.''\n  In any event, now that the Supreme Court has spoken, it is time for \nthe Congress to confront this issue. The Congress should act now to \nexempt state and local prisons from the ADA. That is why I am again \nintroducing the State and Local Prison Relief Act, as I did soon after \nthe Supreme Court decided the Yeskey case in 1998.\n  The State and Local Prison Relief Act would exempt prisons from the \nrequirements of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act for prisoners. More \nspecifically, it exempts any services, accommodations, programs, \nactivities or treatment of any kind regarding prisoners that may \notherwise be required by the Acts. Through this language, I wish to \nmake entirely clear that the bill is not intended to exempt prisons \nfrom having to accommodate disabled legal counsel, visitors, or others \nwho are not inmates. Also, the fact that the bill applies to Title II \nof the ADA should make clear that it is not intended to exempt prison \nhiring practices for non-inmate employees. The bill is intended only to \napply to prisoners.\n\n  I firmly believe that if we do not act, the ADA will have broad \nadverse implications for the management of penal institutions. \nPrisoners will file an endless number of lawsuits demanding special \nprivileges, which will involve Federal judges in the intricate details \nof running our state and local prisons.\n  Mr. President, we should continuously remind ourselves that the \nConstitution created a Federal government of limited, enumerated \npowers. Those powers not delegated to the Federal government were \nreserved to the states or the people. As James Madison wrote in \nFederalist No. 45, ``the powers delegated to the Federal government are \nfew and definite. . . . [The powers] which are to remain in the State \ngovernments are numerous and indefinite.'' The Federal government \nshould avoid intrusion into matters traditionally reserved for the \nstates. We must respect this delicate balance of power. Unfortunately, \nfederalism is more often spoken about than respected.\n  Although the entire ADA raises federalism concerns, the problem is \nespecially acute in the prison context. There are few powers more \ntraditionally reserved for the states than crime. The criminal laws \nhave always been the province of the states, and the vast majority of \nprisoners have always been housed in state prisons. The First Congress \nenacted a law asking the states to house Federal prisoners in their \njails for fifty cents per month. The first Federal prison was not built \nuntil over 100 years later, and only three existed before 1925.\n  Even today, as the size and scope of the Federal government has grown \nimmensely, only about 6% of prisoners are housed in Federal \ninstitutions. Managing that other 94% is a core state function. As the \nSupreme Court has stated, ``Maintenance of penal institutions is an \nessential part of one of government's primary functions--the \npreservation of societal order through enforcement of the criminal law. \nIt is difficult to imagine an activity in which a State has a stronger \ninterest, or one that is more intricately bound up with state laws, \nregulations, and procedures.''\n  The primary function of prisons is to house criminals. Safety and \nsecurity are the overriding concerns of prison administration. The \nrules and regulations, the daily schedules, the living and working \narrangements--these all revolve around protecting prison employees, \ninmates, and the public. But the goal of the ADA essentially is to take \naway any barrier to anyone with any disability. Accommodating inmates \nin the manner required by the ADA will interfere with the ability of \nprison administrators to keep safety and security their overriding \nconcern.\n  For example, a federal court in Pennsylvania ruled that a prisoner \nwho disobeyed a direct order could not be punished because of the ADA. \nThe judge said it was okay for a prisoner to return to his cell after \nhe was told not to by a guard, saying the prisoner was justified in \nrefusing to comply because he was doing so to relieve stress built up \ndue to his Tourette's Syndrome.\n  The practical effect of the ADA will be that prison officials will \nhave to grant special privileges to certain inmates and to excuse \nothers from complying with generally-applicable prison rules. For \nexample, a federal judge ordered an Iowa prison to install cable \ntelevision in a disabled inmate's cell because the man had difficulty \ngoing to the common areas to watch TV. After much public protest, the \nruling was eventually reversed.\n  The ADA presents a perfect opportunity for prisoners to try to beat \nthe system, and use the courts to do it. There are over 1.7 million \ninmates in state prisons and local jails, and the numbers are rising \nevery year. Indeed, the total prison population has grown about 6.5% \nper year since 1990. Prisons have a substantially greater percentage of \npersons with disabilities that are covered by the ADA than the general \npopulation, including AIDS, mental retardation, psychological \ndisorders, learning disabilities, drug addiction, and alcoholism. \nFurther, administrators control every aspect of prisoners' lives, such \nas assigning educational opportunities, recreation, and jobs in prison \nindustries. Combine these facts, and the possibilities for lawsuits are \nendless.\n  For example, in most state prison systems, inmates are classified and \nassigned based in part on their disabilities. This helps administrators \nmeet the disabled inmates' needs in a cost-effective manner. However, \nunder the ADA, prisoners probably will be able to claim that they must \nbe assigned to a prison without regard to their disability. Were it not \nfor their disability, they may have been assigned to the prison closest \nto their home, and in that case, every prison would have to be able to \naccommodate every disability. That could mean every prison having, for \nexample, mental health treatment centers, services for hearing-impaired \ninmates, and dialysis treatment. The cost is potentially enormous.\n\n  A related expense is attorney's fees. The ADA has incentives to \nencourage private litigants to vindicate their rights in court. Any \nplaintiff, including an inmate, who is only partially successful can \nget generous attorney's fees and monetary damages, possibly including \neven punitive damages. In one\n\n[[Page S311]]\n\nADA class action lawsuit in California, the state has paid the \nprisoners' attorneys over $2 million, with hourly fees as high as $300.\n  Applying the ADA to prisons is the latest unfunded Federal mandate \nthat we are imposing on the states.\n  Adequate funding is hard for prisons to achieve, especially in state \nand local communities where all government funds are scarce. The public \nis angry about how much money must be spent to house prisoners. Even \nwith prison populations rising, the people do not want more of their \nmoney spent on prisoners. Often, there is simply not enough money to \nmake the changes in challenged programs to accommodate the disabled. If \nprison administrators do not have the money to change a program, they \nwill probably have to eliminate it. Thus, accommodation could mean the \nelimination of worthwhile educational, recreational, and rehabilitative \nprograms, making all inmates worse off.\n  Apart from money, accommodation may mean modifying the program in \nsuch a way as to take away its beneficial purpose. A good example is \nthe Supreme Court's Yeskey case itself. Yeskey was declared medically \nineligible to participate in a boot camp program because he had high \nblood pressure. So, he sued under the ADA. The boot camp required \nrigorous physical activity, such as work projects. If the program has \nto be changed to accommodate his physical abilities, it may not meet \nits basic goals, and the authorities may eliminate it. Thus, the result \ncould be that everyone loses the benefit of an otherwise effective \ncorrectional tool.\n  Another impact of the ADA may be to make an already volatile prison \nenvironment even more difficult to control. Many inmates are very \nsensitive to the privileges and benefits that others get in a world \nwhere privileges are relatively few. Some have irrational suspicions \nand phobias. An inmate who is not disabled may be angry if he believes \na disabled prisoner is getting special treatment, without rationally \naccepting that the law requires it, and could take out his anger on \nothers around him, including the disabled prisoner.\n  We must keep in mind that it is judges who will be making these \npolicy decisions. To apply the Act and determine what phrases like \n``qualified individual with a disability'' mean, judges must involved \nthemselves in intricate, fact-intensive issues. Essentially, the ADA \nrequires judges to micromanage prisons. Judges are not qualified to \nsecond-guess prison administrators and make these complex, difficult \ndecisions. Prisons cannot be run by judicial decree.\n  In applying Constitutional rights to prisoners, the Supreme Court has \ntried to get away from micromanagement and has viewed prisoner claims \ndeferentially in favor of the expertise of prison officials. It has \nstated that we will not ``substitute our judgment on difficult and \nsensitive matters of institutional administration for the \ndeterminations of those charged with the formidable task of running a \nprison. This approach ensures the ability of corrections officials to \nanticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the \nintractable problems of prison administration, and avoids unnecessary \nintrusion of the judiciary into problems particularly ill suited to \nresolution by decree.''\n  Take for example a case from the Fourth Circuit, my home circuit, \nfrom 1995. The Court explained that a morbidly obese inmate presented \ncorrections officials ``with a lengthy and ever-increasing list of \nmodifications which he insisted were necessary to accommodate his obese \ncondition. Thus, he demanded a larger cell, a cell closer to support \nfacilities, handrails to assist him in using the toilet, wider \nentrances to his cell and the showers, non-skid matting in the lobby \narea, and alternative outdoor recreational activities to accommodate \nhis inability to stand or walk for long periods.'' It is not workable \nfor judges to resolve all of these questions.\n\n  It is noteworthy that a primary purpose of the Prison Litigation \nReform Act was to stop judges from micromanaging prisons and to reduce \nthe burdens of prison litigation. As the Chief Justice of the Supreme \nCourt recognized last year, the PLRA is having some success. However, \nthis most recent Supreme Court decision will hamper that progress.\n  Moreover, the ADA delegated to Federal agencies the authority to \ncreate regulations to implement the law. In response, the Federal \nbureaucracy has created extremely specific and detailed mandates. \nRegarding facilities, they dictate everything from the number of water \nfountains to the flash rates of visual alarms. State and local \ncorrectional authorities must fall in line behind these regulations. In \nyet another way, we have the Justice Department exercising regulatory \noversight over our state and local communities.\n  Prisons are fundamentally different from other places in society. \nPrisoners are not entitled to all of the rights and privileges of law-\nabiding citizens, but they often get them. They have cable television. \nThey have access to better gyms and libraries than most Americans. The \nlist goes on.\n  The public is tired of special privileges for prisoners. Applying the \nADA to prisons is a giant step in the wrong direction. Prisoners will \nabuse the ADA to get privileges they were previously denied, and the \nreason will be the overreaching hand of the Federal government. We \nshould not let this happen.\n  Mr. President, the National Government has gone full circle. We have \ngone from asking the states to house Federal prisoners to dictating to \nthe states how they house their own prisoners. There must be some end \nto the powers of the Federal government, and to the privileges it \ngrants the inmates of this Nation. I propose that we start by passing \nthis important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks a copy of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 33\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to eliminate a requirement for a unanimous verdict in \ncriminal trials in Federal courts; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  LEGISLATION TO ALLOW FEDERAL CRIMINAL CONVICTION ON A 10-2 JURY VOTE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nallow juries to convict criminals on a 10-2 jury vote rather than a \nunanimous vote.\n  It is my belief that this change to the Federal Rules of Criminal \nProcedure will bring about increased efficiency and finality in our \nNation's Federal court system while maintaining the integrity of the \npursuit of justice.\n  This legislation is consistent with the Supreme Court ruling \nconcerning unanimity in jury verdicts, specifically in Apodaca v. \nOregon [406 U.S. 404 (1972)]. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled \nthat the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a jury trial does not require \nthat the jury's vote be unanimous. The Supreme Court affirmed an Oregon \nlaw that permitted what I am proposing--a 10-2 conviction in criminal \nprosecutions.\n  Mr. President, clearly there is no constitutional mandate for the \ncurrent requirement under the Federal Rules of a jury verdict by a \nunanimous vote. The origins of the unanimity rule are not easy to \ntrace, although it may date back to the latter half of the 14th \ncentury. One theory proffered is that defendants had few other rules to \nensure a fair trial and a unanimous jury vote\n\n[[Page S312]]\n\nfor conviction compensated for other inadequacies at trial. Of course, \ntoday the entire trial process is heavily tilted towards the accused \nwith many, many safeguards in place to ensure that the defendant \nreceives a fair trial.\n  It is interesting that a unanimity requirement was considered by our \nFounding Fathers as part of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution, \nbut it was rejected. The proposed language for the Sixth Amendment, as \nintroduced by James Madison in the House of Representatives, provided \nfor trial by jury as well as a ``requisite of unanimity for \nconviction.'' The language eventually adopted by the Congress and the \nStates in the Sixth Amendment provides ``the right to a speedy and \npublic trial, by an impartial jury,'' but does not specify any \nrequirement on conviction. This was a wise decision.\n  It is clear that ``trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to \nthe American scheme of justice,'' as the Supreme Court has stated. \nJuries are representative of the community and their solemn duty is to \nhear the evidence, deliberate, and decide the case after careful review \nof the facts and the law. As the Supreme Court has noted, a jury can \nresponsibly perform this function if allowed to decide the case by a \nmargin that is less than unanimous.\n  This change for jury verdicts in the Federal courts will reduce the \nlikelihood of a single juror corrupting an otherwise thoughtful and \nreasonable deliberation of the evidence. It is not easy to adequately \nscreen a juror for potential bias before they are selected to serve on \na jury. This cannot be done with absolute certainty. We should work to \nprevent one such juror from having the power to prevent justice from \nbeing served.\n  One juror should not have the power to allow a criminal to go free in \nthe face of considerable opposition from his peers on the jury. Even if \na defendant is tried again after one or two jurors hold out against \nconviction, a new trial is very costly and time-consuming. Most \nimportantly, a new trial substantially delays justice for the victims \nand society.\n  It is important to note that this new rule could also work to the \nadvantage of someone on trial. Currently, if there is a hung jury, a \nprosecutor has the power to retry a defendant. This is true even if \nonly one juror believed the defendant was guilty. Under this new rule, \nif at least ten jurors concluded that the defendant was not guilty, he \nwould be acquitted and could not be forced to endure a new trial. This \nrule has the potential to benefit either side as it brings finality to \na criminal case.\n  In other words, there are cases where a requirement of unanimity \nproduced a hung jury where, had there been a non-unanimous allowance, \nthe jury would have voted to convict or acquit. Yet, in either \ninstance, the defendant is accorded his constitutional right of a \njudgment by his peers. It is my firm belief that this legislation will \nnot undermine the pillars of justice or result in the conviction of \ninnocent persons.\n  Moreover, I believe the American people will strongly support this \nreform to allow a 10-2 decision. This is one way the Congress can help \nfight crime and promote criminal justice.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Congress will support this important \nproposal. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in its \nentirety in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 34\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AMENDMENT OF RULE 31 OF THE FEDERAL RULES OF \n                   CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Rule 31(a) of the Federal Rules of \n     Criminal Procedure is amended by striking ``unanimous'' and \n     inserting ``by five-sixths of the jury''.\n       (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to cases pending or commenced on or after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 35. A bill to provide relief to America's working families and to \npromote continued economic growth by returning a portion of the tax \nsurplus to those who created it; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   Tax cut with a purpose act of 2001\n\n  Sen. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today with my \ncolleague, Senator Miller of Georgia, to provide tax relief for \nAmerica's families by returning a portion of the tax surplus to the \nworking men and women who are responsible for creating it.\n  Our proposal consists of the core elements of the plan that President \nBush outlined during his campaign for the Presidency. There are three \nprinciple components: Lower income tax rates for all Americans, relief \nfrom the marriage tax penalty, and repeal of the death tax. The bill \nreplaces the current tax rate structure with rates of 10, 15, 25, and \n33 percent. Lower income Americans get a larger percentage cut in \nrates, higher income Americans get a smaller reduction, but obviously \nthis is a tax cut for taxpayers.\n  The next provision of the bill begins the effort to repeal the \nmarriage penalty. There is no reason in America that people who meet \nand fall in love should have to pay $1,400 a year in additional taxes \nas the price of getting married. Senator Miller and I are for love and \nmarriage, and we don't think they ought to be taxed.\n  The final major provision of the bill is repeal of the death tax. A \ndeath tax is double taxation in which people work their whole lives, \nbuild up a business or a family farm, and pay taxes on every penny they \nearn. Yet when they die, their children have to sell the business or \nthe family farm in order to give the government up to 55 cents out of \nevery dollar of its value. This is fundamentally unfair.\n  Finally, since our President was elected three things have happened, \nand every one of them argues for this package of tax cuts. No. 1, the \neconomy is weaker and investment is falling off. Secondly, our \nestimates of the budget surplus have gone up, not down. And lastly, \nthat surplus is being spent at an unprecedented rate.\n  We believe that Congress should enact the Bush tax plan, continue to \npay down the debt, and resist the urge to spend the tax surplus so that \nwe can return a portion of it to the working men and women who produced \nit.\n  Mr. Miller. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with Senator \nGramm as a sponsor of this important piece of legislation, first \nbecause it is an opportunity to reach across party lines and really \npractice bipartisanship, not just talk about it. But I'm even more \npleased to be a cosponsor because of the far-reaching consequences of \nthis bill.\n  Right now, our taxes have never been higher. Right now, our surplus \nhas never been greater. To me, it's just common sense you deal with the \nfirst by using the second.\n  Remember that old Elvis Presley song, ``Return to Sender.'' Well, \nthat's what we want to do with this overpayment of taxes.\n  As some of you know, I've been in politics for a long time, and I \nthought I had seen it all. But when I came to Washington last year I \nwas not prepared for the shock of just how matter of factly Congress \nate into the surplus, gobbled it up indiscriminately and without \nhesitation on both sides of the aisle.\n  I couldn't believe it and it became clear to me that if we don't send \nthis overpayment of taxes back to those who paid it, much of it will be \nfrittered away, and I think most Americans have enjoyed as much of that \nas they can stand.\n  Some of my colleagues talk of ``targeted'' tax cuts, and I respect \ntheir opinion, I respect them. But here's how I think about that: who \nare we to pick and choose and cull and select and single out among our \ntaxpayers.\n  Who are we to play ``eeny, meany, miney, mo,'' with them. All of them \ncombined have paid more than it takes to run this government. And all \nof them combined should get a break from this oppressive tax structure \nof ours.\n  This plan would make our tax code more progressive by cutting federal \nincome taxes for people all across the income spectrum, and the largest \npercentage cuts would go to those Americans who earn the least. Under \nthis proposal, six million families will no longer pay any federal \nincome taxes at all. That's one out of five families with children.\n\n  Any time I look at a tax cut, I always apply it to the family I grew \nup in: a single parent with two children. Under\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\nthe current rate, that single parent begins paying taxes when she earns \n$21,300. Under this plan, she would not become a taxpayer until her \nearnings reach $31,300.\n  Lower taxes gives Americans a better chance at a better standard of \nliving. It can mean the difference between renting or buying a home. \nToday, it can be the difference between being able, or not being able, \nto pay your heating bill.\n  No one in America should have to work more than four months out of a \nyear to pay the IRS, and in peacetime, the federal government should \nnever take more than 33% out of anyone's pay check.\n  I also believe this tax cut could help provide some needed insurance \nagainst a long-lasting economic slow down. But most importantly, and \nwhy I'm here, is that I agree with President Bush that the taxpayers \nare much better judges of how to spend their own money than we are.\n  When I was governor of Georgia, I was proud that in my state we cut \ntaxes by more than a billion dollars. As a U.S. Senator, I'm looking \nforward to cutting taxes in this nation by more than a trillion \ndollars.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. THURMOND:\n  S. 36. A bill to amend title 1, United States Code, to clarify the \neffect and application of legislation; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n      AN ACT TO CLARIFY THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nclarify the application and effect of legislation which the Congress \nenacts.\n  My act is simple and straightforward. It provides that unless future \nlegislation expressly states otherwise, new enactments shall be applied \nprospectively and shall not create private rights of action. This will \nsignificantly reduce unnecessary litigation and court costs, and will \nbenefit both the public and our judicial system.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to tackle a persistent problem \nthat is easy to prevent. When Congress enacts a bill, the legislation \noften does not indicate whether it is to be applied retroactively or \nwhether it creates private rights of action. The failure of the \nCongress to address these issues in each piece of legislation results \nin unnecessary confusion and uncertainty. This uncertainty leads to \nlawsuits, thereby contributing to the high cost of litigation and the \ncongestion of our courts.\n  In the absence of clear action by the Congress on its intent \nregarding these critical threshold questions, the outcome is left up to \nthe courts. Whether a law applies to conduct that occurred before the \neffective date of the Act and whether a private person has been granted \nthe right to sue on their own behalf in civil court under an Act can be \ncritical or even dispositive of a case. Even if the issue is only one \naspect of a case and it is raised early in a lawsuit, a decision that \nthe lawsuit can proceed generally cannot be appealed until the end of \nthe case. If the appellate court eventually rules that one of these \nissues should have prevented the trial, the litigants have been put to \nsubstantial burden and unnecessary expense which could have been \navoided.\n  Currently, courts attempt to determine the intent of the Congress in \ndeciding the effect and application of legislation in this regard. \nThus, courts look first and foremost to the statutory language. If a \nstatute expressly provides that it is retroactive or creates a private \ncause of action, that dictate is followed. Further, courts apply a \npresumption that legislation is not retroactive. This is an entirely \nappropriate, longstanding rule because, absent mistake or an emergency, \nfundamental fairness generally dictates that conduct should be assessed \nunder the rules that existed at the time the conduct took place. There \nis a similar presumption that the Congress did not intend to create \nrights beyond those that it expressly includes in its legislation.\n\n  If the intent of Congress is not clear from the statute, courts \ngenerally look to legislative history, statutory structure, and \npossibly other sources of Congressional intent. This is where the \nunnecessary complexity and confusion is created. Sources other than \nstatutory language are to varying degrees less reliable in predicting \nCongressional intent. They are much more difficult to interpret and may \neven be contradictory. The more sources for the course to analyze and \nthe more vague the standard for review, the more likely courts will \nreach different results. Under current practice, trial courts around \nthe country reach conflicting and inconsistent results on these issues, \nas do appellate courts when the issues are appealed.\n  The problem of whether legislation is retroactive was dramatically \nillustrated after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. District \ncourts and courts of appeal all over the country were required to \nresolve whether the 1991 Act should be applied retroactively, and the \nissue ultimately was considered by the Supreme Court. However, by the \ntime the Court resolved the issue in 1994, well over 100 lower courts \nhad ruled on this question and, although most had not found \nretroactivity, their decisions were inconsistent. Countless litigants \nacross the country expended substantial resources debating this \nthreshold procedural issue.\n  All this litigation arose from a statute that contained no language \nproviding that it be retroactive. To conclude that the provision of the \nstatute in issue in the case was not to be applied retroactively, the \nmajority opinion of the Court took 39 pages in the United States \nReporter to explain why. It undertook a detailed analysis that \ndemonstrates the unnecessary complexity of the current standard. It is \nno wonder that some Supreme Court justices argued in this case that a \ncourt should look only to whether the language of the statute expressly \nprovides for retroactivity. That is what I propose. If my law had been \nin effect, the litigation would have been averted, while the outcome \nwould have been exactly the same as the Supreme Court decided.\n  Under my bill, newly enacted laws are not to be applied retroactively \nand do not create a private right of action, unless the legislation \nexpressly provides otherwise. It is important to note that my bill does \nnot in any way restrict the Congress on these important issues. The \nCongress may override this presumption by simply stating when it wishes \nlegislation to be retroactive or create new private rights of action.\n  It is clear that this legislation would save litigants and our \njudicial system millions and millions of dollars by avoiding a great \ndeal of uncertainty and litigation. The Administrative Office of the \nCourts has expressed support for this important clarification to the \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, if we are truly concerned about relieving the backlog \nof cases in our courts and reducing the costs of litigation, we should \nhelp our judicial system to focus its limited time and resources on \nresolving the merits of disputes, rather than deciding these \npreliminary matters. We hear numerous complaints about overworked \njudges and crowded dockets. This is a simple and straightforward way to \ndo something about it. The Congress can help reduce the Federal \ncaseload and help simplify the law. We should act on this important \nreform promptly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 36\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a charitable deduction for contributions of food inventory; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n           the good samaritan hunger relief tax incentive act\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Leahy, \nFitzgerald, Harkin, Roberts, Dodd, DeWine, Reid, Santorum, and Bayh to \nintroduce the Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act, \nbipartisan legislation aimed at increasing food donations to our \nnation's food banks. Next week, Congressman Tony Hall, who has been a \nleader in Congress in the fight against hunger, will introduce \ncompanion legislation in the House of Representatives. This bill would \nprovide important incentives for farmers, restaurant owners, and \ncorporations to donate food to front-line organizations that serve the \nhungry.\n  The demand on our nation's food banks, church pantries, soup kitchens \nand shelters continues to rise. According to an August 2000 report on \nHunger Security by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 31 million \nAmericans (around 10 percent of our citizens) are living on the edge of \nhunger. One segment of our population--families with incomes between 50 \nand 130 percent of the poverty level--has experienced an increase in \nthe number of households that are food insecure since 1995. This study \nconfirms what food bank managers and workers have been telling me--\nwhile many families are moving from welfare to work, these families are \nstill vulnerable to hunger and are using food banks to supplement their \nnutritional needs.\n  Unfortunately, many food banks cannot meet this increased demand for \nfood. A December 1999 study by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that \nrequests for emergency food assistance increased by an average of 18 \npercent in American cities over the previous year and that 21 percent \nof emergency food requests could not be met.\n  These figures are troubling because of the enormous amount of food \nthat goes unused annually. The United States Department of Agriculture \nestimates that up to 96 billion pounds of food goes to waste each year \nin the United States. If a small percentage of this wasted food could \nbe redirected to food banks, we could make important strides in our \nfight against hunger.\n  In many ways, current law is a hindrance to food donations. The tax \ncode provides corporations with a special deduction for donations to \nfood banks, but it excludes farmers, ranchers, and restaurant owners \nfrom the same tax incentive. For many of these businesses, it is more \ncost effective to throw away food than to donate it to charity.\n  The Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Tax Incentive Act would address this \ninequity by extending the special deduction to all business taxpayers \nand by increasing it to the fair market value of the donation. The \nhunger relief community believes that these changes will markedly \nincrease food donations. One Hoosier food bank, Second Helpings of \nIndianapolis, estimates that this legislation will cause an additional \n400,000 pounds of food to be donated to its coffers.\n  This bipartisan legislation, which enjoys the support of Republicans \nand Democrats alike, has been endorsed by a diverse set of \norganizations, including America's Second Harvest Food Banks, the \nSalvation Army, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National \nFarmers Union, the National Restaurant Association, the Grocery \nManufacturers of America, At-Sea Processors Association, California \nEmergency Foodlink, Council of Chain Restaurants, National Cattlemen's \nBeef Association, National Fisheries Association, and the National Milk \nProducers Federation.\n  Last year, this legislation unanimously passed the Senate as part of \nan agricultural tax amendment offered by Senator Grassley to H.R. 8, \nthe Death Tax Elimination Act. Although the measure was ultimately \nstripped from the underlying legislation, the vote indicated strong \nsupport for this legislation in the Senate.\n  I am hopeful that Congress will thoughtfully address the hunger \nproblem in the U.S. by passing this bill into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 38. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit former \nmembers of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected disability \nrated as total to travel on military aircraft in the same manner and to \nthe same extent as retired members of the Armed Forces are entitled to \ntravel on such aircraft; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n    Extend travel on military aircraft to disabled military retirees\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President today I am reintroducing a bill which is of \ngreat importance to a group of patriotic Americans. This legislation is \ndesigned to extend space-available travel privileges on military \naircraft to those who have been totally disabled in the service of our \ncountry.\n  Currently, retired members of the Armed Forces are permitted to \ntravel on a space-available basis on non-scheduled military flights \nwithin the continental United States, and on scheduled overseas flights \noperated by the Military Airlift Command. My bill would provide the \nsame benefits for veterans with 100 percent service-connected \ndisabilities.\n  We owe these heroic men and women who have given so much to our \ncountry a debt of gratitude. Of course, we can never repay them for the \nsacrifices they have made on behalf of our nation, but we can surely \ntry to make their lives more pleasant and fulfilling. One way in which \nwe can help is to extend military travel privileges to these \ndistinguished American veterans. I have received numerous letters from \nall over the country attesting to the importance attached to this issue \nby veterans. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues show their concern and \njoin me in saying ``thank you'' by supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 38\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am honored to introduce the \nPublic Safety Medal of Valor Act.\n  It is a bill intended to enhance recognition of an important segment \nof our public servants.\n  These are the men and women who engage in the law enforcement and \npublic safety duties that benefit our communities every day.\n  I introduced this bill early in the 106th Congress, and the Senate \npassed it unanimously in May 1999.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee deliberated on a similar piece of \nlegislation, H.R. 46, and reported a version with amendments. \nUnfortunately, after the Senate passed H.R. 46 in the last days of the \n106th Congress, there was not time for the House to act.\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\n  Today I submit the bill as introduced in the 106th Congress, and hope \nmy colleagues will join me again in seeking its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 40. A bill entitled ``The Careers to Classrooms Act of 2001''; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                   careers to classrooms act of 2001\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have another bill to introduce. This \nis cosponsored by Senators Frist and Crapo. It is the Careers to \nClassrooms Act of 2001. Once again, this is a bill that has already \nbeen passed by Congress, but it has never made it into law. I am very \nhopeful that this President will sign a comprehensive reauthorization \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and included in that I \nhope will be Careers to Classrooms.\n  There is no question that many, if not most, of our States are facing \nhuge teacher shortages. This is one of the most critical needs in our \npublic schools today. It is most pressing in our inner-city and rural \ncommunities.\n  Ironically, the biggest enemy to hiring a sufficient number of \nteachers is our booming economy. A recent college graduate with a \ndegree in math might expect to make $25,000 to $35,000 in a starting \nposition as a high school math teacher. That same graduate could easily \nmake twice that much in the private sector, especially in the red hot \ncomputer field. We have some issues we have to deal with--increasing \nteacher salaries, increasing teacher benefits--and we know that, but \nthere is more we can do.\n  What we need in our public school systems in America is more \ncreativity. What we want to do with our reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act is to put more incentives for \ncreativity in our public schools.\n  I am a total product of public education. I grew up in La Marque, TX, \na small town of about 15,000 in Galveston County, and attended and \ngraduated from its public schools. Then I attended the University of \nTexas and the University of Texas Law School. You will find no bigger \nadvocate for public education than this Senator. I owe so much of what \nI am to the teachers who took the time to help me become the best that \nI could be.\n  Teachers are the backbone of our schools. You can design a state-of-\nthe-art, fully computerized school connected to the Internet 24 hours a \nday with every modern textbook and piece of science equipment, but at \nthe end of the day, if you do not have quality teachers, all of that \nequipment really does not mean that much.\n  Adding to the growth in the population of our public schools is an \neffort in many public school systems to hire more teachers to reduce \nclass size. The approach I am putting forth today will ensure that more \nteachers are available, more can be hired, and that they are better \nteachers, qualified teachers, teachers with real world experience and \nknowledge that can be taken into the classroom.\n  Careers to Classrooms builds upon a tremendously successful \nDepartment of Defense program that takes experienced, qualified \nmilitary service men and women and helps them transition into the \nclassroom as teachers. That program is known as Troops to Teachers. it \nhas placed over 4,000 qualified, certified teachers in our Nation's \npublic schools, including over 600 in my home State of Texas.\n  The Troops to Teachers Program seeks out and helps place into schools \nmembers of the military with at least 10 years of military service and \nskills in high-need areas, such as math, science, computers, and \nlanguages. Typically, these experienced service personnel obtain their \ncertification in a year or less utilizing one of the many different \nalternative certification programs now in place in over 40 States.\n  My provision essentially builds upon this proven model and extends it \nto the application in the context of civilian professionals and others \nwith skills. What we want to do in Careers to Classrooms is take \nindividuals with demonstrable skills in high-need areas and give them a \nchance to go into the teaching profession, especially mid-level \nprofessionals who would like to change careers and go into teaching.\n  The program would provide limited stipend assistance for individuals \nenrolled in State alternative certification programs, and those who \nagreed to teach in rural schools, schools with the most pressing \nteacher shortages and schools with the highest percentages of students \nfrom low-income families, would also get stipends to help them with \nthis alternative certification to get them in the classroom faster than \nif they were going through the whole college course and curriculum that \nincludes all of the teacher education courses.\n  High-need schools would also receive funding assistance to help \ncompensate for the added teacher mentoring, training, and other costs \nassociated with bringing-in prospective teachers under an alternative \ncertification process.\n  Our legislation specifies priority disciplines in which we want to \nfocus to recruit teachers. In particular, the proposal emphasizes \nsciences, math, computer literacy, and foreign languages. These are \nwhere our teacher shortages are most acute.\n  I particularly thank my colleague from Tennessee, Senator Frist, who \nsuggested adding outstanding recent college graduates to be eligible to \nparticipate in the Careers to Classrooms proposal. Senator Frist \ncorrectly pointed out that in addition to encouraging midlevel career \nprofessionals, we want to have these young, top-flight college \ngraduates who did not go through their college's education degree \nprogram but who do have the academic achievement and the mastery of \nthese skills to be able to become excellent teachers.\n  I also thank Senator Crapo of Idaho who has also been helpful in \nadding the provision that encourages individuals to go into our rural \nareas with this Careers-to-Classrooms-added incentive to become \nteaching professionals.\n  Our Nation's parents and teachers do not need more Federal control, \nthey do not need more bureaucracy, they do not need more red tape. What \nthey need is to be empowered with greater choices and options to find \nthe education path that is best for them. We need to make those options \navailable to them, to do so in a way that is new, that is innovative, \nthat is flexible. Simply heaping more money on failed systems and \nprograms has been exhaustively proven to lead to failure. The policies \nof the past have failed.\n  No. What we need to do is work with our new Secretary of Education, \nRod Paige, who has made creativity the benchmark of his success in the \npublic schools in Houston, TX. We need to go forward in a bipartisan \nCongress, with President Bush, to make public education the best \neducation in our country.\n  Careers to Classrooms will put our qualified teachers in the \nclassroom. It will give them the ability to be certified in an \nalternative certification program very quickly so that they will be a \nresource to our young people.\n  We want to encourage more people to go into the teaching profession \nbecause if we do not have good teachers, we are not going to have a \nsuccessful country. We will not have young people able to go into our \ngreat economy and the opportunities that our economy would offer if \nthey do not have the basic skills that are given by good teachers.\n  I hope this year Careers to Classrooms will become law. I hope we \nwill see more and more of the qualified people in our country decide to \ntake up the teaching profession and be mentors and role models and \nteachers to our young people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Rockfeller, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n        Conrad, Mr. Graham, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Torricelli, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 41.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my friend \nSenator Baucus and many of our Finance Committee colleagues today in \nintroducing legislation that would permanently extend the research and \nexperimentation tax credit.\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\n  Over the past 10 years, our nation has experienced the longest and \nstrongest peacetime period of economic expansion in our history. Over \nthis past decade, the standard of living for all Americans has \nincreased markedly while millions of new jobs have been created. At the \nsame time, our federal budget outlook has been transformed from one of \nlarge and increasing deficits into the indefinite future to one of \nmultitrillion dollar surpluses for at least the next ten years.\n  Much of the cause of this economic expansion that has so blessed the \nUnited States is due to a strong surge in our productivity rate. This \nincrease in productivity has allowed the economy to continue to grow at \na rapid pace without the increase in inflation that usually accompanies \nsuch growth.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan, and dozens of leading economists have all heralded the \nincrease in our productivity as a key to our economic good times--and \nto their continuance. A major factor of this increase in productivity, \nMr. President, is spending on research and development. This is what \nour bill today is all about.\n  An August 1999 study commissioned by the National Association of \nManufacturers concluded that as much as two-thirds of productivity \ngains is due to technological advances. These advances, in turn, fuel \neconomic growth. The standard model of economic growth argues that one-\nthird of growth in private-sector output is attributable to advances in \ntechnology. In the manufacturing sector, as much as two-thirds of \ngrowth can be attributed to technological advances. Moreover, this \ncontribution is expected to increase over the next decade.\n  It seems clear to me that if we want to keep our economy strong and \ngrowing, it is vital that we keep up and even increase these advances \nin technology. How do we do this? The answer is simple. Our nation must \ncontinue to invest in research and development, both at the public \nlevel, and especially in the private sector.\n  I believe the best way to ensure that private-sector investment in \nresearch and development continues at the healthy rate needed to fuel \nthe productivity gains of the future is to permanently extend the \ncurrent-law research and experimentation credit. This tax provision is \na proven and a cost-effective incentive to increase private-sector R \nspending.\n  Studies have shown that the R tax credit significantly increases \nresearch and development expenditures. The marginal effect of one \ndollar of the R credit stimulates approximately one dollar of \nadditional private research and development spending over the short-run \nand as much as two dollars of extra investment over the long-run.\n  Congress has recognized the vital role the R credit has played in \nspurring increased research spending by extending the credit ten times \nsince its inception in 1981. For most of those years, Congress was \nnever able to find the funds to pay for a permanent extension of the \ncredit, due to budget constraints. Fortunately, Congress passed a five-\nyear extension in 1999 that will keep the credit alive until 2004.\n  However, Mr. President, permanence is essential to the effectiveness \nof this credit. Research and development projects typically take a \nnumber of years and may even last longer than a decade. As our business \nleaders plan these projects, they need to know whether or not they can \ncount on the R tax credit. The continual uncertainty surrounding the \ncredit has induced businesses to allocate significantly less to \nresearch than they otherwise would if they were assured the tax credit \nwould be available. This uncertainty undermines the entire purpose of \nthe credit and has stifled its full potential for inducing research \nspending. For the government and the American people to maximize the \nreturn on their investment in U.S.-based research spending, this credit \nmust be made permanent.\n  In the business community, the development of new products, \ntechnologies, medicines, and ideas can result in either success or \nfailure. Investments carry a risk. The R tax credit helps ease the \ncost of incurring these risks. Whereas foreign nations heavily \nsubsidize research with public dollars, the United States has typically \nrelied less on direct public funds and more on private sector \nincentives. The R tax credit has the potential to be an even more \neffective incentive if it were made permanent.\n  I am aware that not every company that invests in research and \ndevelopment in the U.S. can take advantage of the regular R tax \ncredit. As the credit's base period recedes and business cycles change, \nthe current credit is out of reach for some companies that still incur \nsignificant research expenditures. To help solve this problem Congress \nenacted the Alternative Incremental Research Credit to help businesses \nthat do not qualify for the R tax credit. To improve the \neffectiveness of this alternative credit, we have included a proposal \nto slightly increase each of its three incentive levels.\n\n  A permanent extension of this credit may seem costly in terms of lost \nrevenue. However, when you consider the value that this investment will \ncreate for our economy, it is a bargain. In fact, one study estimates \nthat a permanent R credit would result in our Gross Domestic Product \nincreasing by $10 billion after five years and by $31 billion after 20 \nyears.\n  Moreover, making the credit permanent will encourage more companies \nto locate their research activities within the United States. This will \nlead to more jobs and higher wages for U.S. workers. We must recognize \nthat international competition is fierce. Many other countries offer \nsignificant enticements to prompt companies to move research activities \nwithin their borders. If we fail to ensure at least a level playing \nfield, many companies will begin to consider moving their research \nactivities abroad and we could lose thousands of precious high-paying \njobs.\n  Findings from a study conducted by Coopers & Lybrand show that \nworkers in every state will benefit from higher wages if the R tax \ncredit is made permanent. Payroll increases as a result of gains in \nproductivity stemming from the credit have been estimated to exceed $60 \nbillion over the next 12 years. Furthermore, greater productivity from \nadditional R will increase overall economic growth in every state in \nthe Union.\n  My home state of Utah is a good example of how state economies \nbenefit from the research tax credit. Utah is home to a large number of \nfirms who invest a high percentage of their revenue on research and \ndevelopment.\n  For example, between Salt Lake City and Provo lies one of the world's \nbiggest stretches of software and computer engineering firms. This \narea, which was named ``Software Valley'' by Business Week, is a \nsignificant example of one of a growing number of thriving high tech \ncommercial regions outside California's Silicon Valley. Newsweek \nmagazine included Utah among the top ten information technology centers \nin the world. The Utah Information Technologies Association estimates \nthat Utah's IT industry consists of more than 2,500 IT vendor \nenterprises and more than 1,000 eBusiness enterprises, employing tens \nof thousands and bringing billions of dollars to Utah's economy.\n  In addition, Utah is home to about 700 biotechnology and biomedical \nfirms that employ nearly 9,000 workers. Research and development are \nthe reasons these companies exist. Not only do these companies need to \ncontinue conducting a high quality level of research, but this research \nfeeds other industries and, ultimately, consumers. Just ask the \npatients who have benefitted from new drugs or therapies.\n  In all, Mr. President there are more than 80,000 employees working in \nUtah's thousands of technology based companies. Many other states have \nexperienced similar growth in high technology businesses. Research and \ndevelopment is the lifeblood of these firms and hundreds of thousands \nlike them throughout the nation.\n  During the ten times in the past 20 years that Congress has extended \nthe R credit for a short time, the ostensible reason has been a lack \nof revenue. The excuse we give to constituents is that we didn't have \nthe money to extend the bill permanently. Ironically, it costs at least \nas much in terms of lost revenue, in the long run, to enact short-term \nextensions as it does to extend it permanently.\n  With the latest projections of the on-budget surplus, for one year, \nfor five\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\nyears, and for ten years, this excuse is gone. There is simply no valid \nreason that this credit should not be extended on a permanent basis.\n  Moreover, now is the time to extend the provision permanently. By \nmaking the research credit permanent now, we will send a strong signal \nto the business community that a new era of stronger support for \nresearch has dawned.\n  The timing could not be better because, as I mentioned, many research \nprojects, especially those in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, must \nbe planned and budgeted for months and even years in advance. The more \nuncertain the long-term future of the research credit is, the smaller \nthe potential of the credit to stimulate increased research. Simply \nknowing of the reliability of a permanent research credit will give a \nboost to the amount of research performed, even before the current \ncredit expires in 2004.\n  A permanent R credit has wide support in both the Senate and the \nHouse. Last year, this body passed by a vote of 98-1 an amendment that \nwould have permanently extended the credit. Unfortunately, all \namendments were ultimately stripped from the underlying bill. The bill \nwe are introducing today is identical to legislation introduced earlier \nthis month by Representatives Nancy Johnson and Robert Matsui. The \nidentical bill in the 106th Congress was cosponsored by 164 other \nmembers of that body. Moreover, the permanent extension of the credit \nis a major provision in President Bush's tax cut plan, and was \nsupported by both former President Clinton and by Al Gore.\n  In conclusion Mr. President, if we fail to make the R tax credit \npermanent, we are limiting the potential growth of our economy. How can \nwe expect the American economy to hold its lead in the global economic \nrace if we allow other countries to take the edge in innovation? Making \nthe tax credit permanent will keep American business ahead of the pack. \nIt will speed economic growth. New technology resulting from American \nresearch and development will continue to improve the standard of \nliving for every person in the U.S. and also worldwide.\n  Simply put, the costs of not making the R tax credit permanent are \nfar greater than the costs of making it permanent. As we begin the new \nmillennium, we cannot afford to let the American economy slow down. Now \nis the time to send a strong message to our companies and to the world \nthat America intends to retain its position as the world's foremost \ninnovator.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 41\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join with \nmy colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, and my other colleagues on the \nSenate Finance Committee, to introduce this bill, which is so vitally \nimportant to American businesses competing in the global marketplace. I \nam particularly pleased that this bill includes as original cosponsors \na majority of members of the Senate Finance Committee. This legislation \nis bipartisan and bicameral. A companion bill was introduced--on the \nvery first day of this Congress--in the House of Representatives by \nCongresswoman Nancy Johnson and Congressman Robert Matsui.\n  Our nation is the world's undisputed leader in technological \ninnovation, a position that would not be possible absent U.S. \ncompanies' commitment to research and development. Investment in \nresearch is an investment in our Nation's economic future, and it is \nappropriate that both the public and private sector share the costs \ninvolved, as we share in the benefits. The credit provided through the \ntax code for research and experimentation expenses provides a modest \nbut critical incentive for companies to conduct their research in the \nUnited States, thus creating high-skilled, high-paying jobs for \nAmerican workers.\n  The R credit has played a key role in placing the United States \nahead of its competition in developing and marketing new products. \nEvery dollar that the Federal government spends on the R tax credit \nis matched by another dollar of spending on research over the short run \nby private companies, and two dollars of spending over the long run. \nOur global competitors are well aware of the importance of providing \nincentives for research, and many provide more generous tax treatment \nfor research and experimentation expenses than does the United States. \nAs a result, Japanese and German spending on non-defense R as a \npercentage of GDP has grown, while U.S. spending has remained \nrelatively flat since 1985. The R credit is instrumental in keeping \nresearch dollars in the United States and we must do all we can to make \nsure it remains an effective incentive by eliminating the on-again, \noff-again treatment.\n  The benefits of the credit, though certainly significant, have been \nlimited over the years by the fact that the credit has been temporary. \nIn addition to the numerous times that the credit has been allowed to \nlapse only to be extended retroactively, the 1996 extension left a 12-\nmonth gap during which the credit was not available. This unprecedented \nlapse sent a troubling signal to the U.S. companies and universities \nthat have come to rely on the government's longstanding commitment to \nthe credit. Let me be clear: companies are under-investing in research \nbecause there has been continued uncertainty about the credit's life. \nMuch of the economic gains we enjoy now is the direct result of \nresearch, technology and innovation undertaken in prior decades. If \ncurrent indicators are accurate in their warning of a slowdown in our \neconomy, then now is appropriate time to send a strong signal to our \nresearch-intensive industries. We must demonstrate our long-term \ncommitment to U.S.-based research by finally putting an end to all \nuncertainty and making the R credit permanent.\n\n  Much research and development takes years to mature. Companies must \nmake their commitment to research projects often five or ten years into \nthe future. The more uncertain the future of the credit, the fewer \nadditional research projects will be started. If companies evaluating \nresearch projects cannot rely on the seamless continuation of the \ncredit, then they are less likely to invest on research in this country \nand less likely to put money into cutting-edge technological innovation \nthat is critical to keeping us in the forefront of global competition.\n  Our country is locked in a fierce battle for high-paying \ntechnological jobs in the global economy. As more nations succeed in \ncreating educationally advanced workforces and join the U.S. as high-\ntechnology manufacturing centers, they become more attractive to \ncompanies trying to penetrate foreign markets. Multinational companies \nsometimes find that moving both manufacturing and basic research \nactivities overseas is necessary if they are to remain competitive. The \nuncertainty of the R credit factors into their economic calculations, \nand makes keeping these jobs in the U.S. more difficult.\n  According to a 1998 study conducted by Coopers & Lybrand, making the \nR credit permanent will provide a substantial positive stimulus to \ninvestment, wage-growth, productivity, and overall economic activity \nfor this country. Payroll increases from gains in productivity are \nestimated to total $64 over the period 1998 through 2010. In\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\nthe year 2010 alone, the payroll increase is estimated to total nearly \n$12 billion.\n  Also according to the study, Gross State Product, which is the basic \nmeasure of economic activity in a state, will rise overall by nearly \n$58 billion between 1998 and 2010 as a result of a permanent credit. \nNearly three-fifths of this increase nationally is attributable to \nadditional value added by industries that generally do not perform R \nthemselves, but benefit from the R done by companies in other \nindustries.\n  Gains in payroll and in Gross State Product are not limited to states \nregarded as centers for technological innovation. Although such regions \nof the country certainly benefit from the credit, each and every state \nwill profit in some measurable way from the credit since all sectors of \nthe economy--agriculture, mining, basic manufacturing, and high-tech \nservices--benefit from productivity improvements resulting from the \nadditional research and development caused by the credit.\n  My own state of Montana is an excellent example of this economic \nactivity. According to the 1998 study, the total increase in payroll \ndue to the R credit for the years 1998-2010 is estimated to be just \nover $250 million. Neither of these increases place Montana in the top \ntier of states benefitting from the credit. However, looking beyond \nthese numbers, the impact of the credit in Montana is substantial. In \n1995, 12 of every 1,000 private sector workers were employed directly \nby high-tech firms in Montana. Almost 400 establishments provided high-\ntechnology services, at an average wage of $34,500 per year. These jobs \npaid 77 percent more than the average private sector wage in 1995 of \n$19,500 per year. Many of these jobs would never have been created \nwithout the assistance of the R credit. And many more jobs in Montana \nare dependent upon the growth and stability of the high-tech sector. \nAlthough the cumulative numbers may not be high in comparison with \nother states, the impact of the R credit on Montana's economy is \nclear.\n\n  The American Bar Association Section of Taxation, the American \nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants Tax Division, and the Tax \nExecutives Institute urge making the credit permanent. In their view, \nuncertainty in the tax law breeds complexity. The constant need to \nextend the R credit and other Code provisions adds confusion to the \nlaw and, in many cases, undermines the policy reasons for enacting the \nincentives in the first place. This is so because the provisions are \nintended to encourage particular activities but uncertainty surrounding \nwhether the provisions will be extended leaves taxpayers unable to plan \nfor those activities. The on-again, off-again nature of these \nprovisions, coupled in some cases with retroactive enactment (which \noften necessitates the filing of an amended return), contributes \nmightily to the complexity of the law.\n  Senator Hatch and I are not newcomers to this issue. We have jointly \nintroduced bills to make the R credit permanent in previous \nCongresses only to end up with short-term extensions. Last year, we \ncame close. During consideration of the bill to repeal the estate tax \n(H.R. 8) last July, the Senate voted 98 to 1 in favor of making the R \ntax credit permanent.\n  This year, we hope to be successful. The hard work we have done to \nbring our budget into balance is finally beginning to pay off, and the \nprojected budget surpluses gives us an opportunity to think carefully \nabout how best to allocate our resources. Making the R credit \npermanent is a wise use of budget dollars because of the direct \npositive impact on economic growth and productivity. This is not just a \ncorporate issue. The real winners from past research investments have \nbeen the American people--in higher wage jobs, higher standards of \nliving, and better health and lifestyle. This is a use of tax dollars \nthat benefits all of us who are working to expand employment, increase \nwages and keep our Nation at the cutting edge of technological \ndevelopment. We were gratified to see that a permanent R credit was \nincluded in the tax plan on which President Bush campaigned, and I \nsincerely hope we can work together to finally make this year the year \nwe fulfill our commitment to long-term, U.S.-based research.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 43.

Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \nenable those former prisoners of war who have been separated honorably \nfrom their respective services and who have been rated as having a 30 \npercent service-connected disability to have the use of both the \nmilitary commissary and post exchange privileges. While I realize it is \nimpossible to adequately compensate one who has endured long periods of \nincarceration at the hands of our nation's enemies, I do feel this \ngesture is both meaningful and important to those concerned.

Mr. President, today I introduce an amendment that would \nchange the existing law regarding the designated position and grade for \nthe Chief Nurses of the United States Army, the United States Navy, and \nthe United States Air Force. Currently, the Chief Nurses of these three \nbranches of the military are only one-star general officer grades; this \nlaw would change the current grade to Major General in the Army and Air \nForce, and Rear Admiral (upper half) in the Navy.\n  Our military Chief Nurses have a tremendous responsibility--their \nscope of duties include peacetime and wartime health care doctrine, and \nstandards and policy for all nursing personnel within their respective \nbranches. They are responsible for thousands of Army, Navy, and Air \nForce officer and enlisted nursing personnel in the active, reserve, \nand guard components of the military. This level of responsibility \ncertainly supports the need to change the grade for the Chief Nurses, \nwhich would ensure that they have an appropriate voice in Defense \nHealth Program executive management.\n  Organizations are best served when the leadership is composed of a \nmix of specialties--of equal rank--bring their unique talents to the \npolicy setting and decision-making process. I believe it is time to \nensure that military health care organizations utilize the expertise \nand unique contributions of the military Chief Nurses.\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  S. 44\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code, to \nauthorize the use of clinical social workers to conduct evaluations to \ndetermine work-related emotional and mental illnesses; to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n            clinical social workers' recognition act of 2001\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Clinical \nSocial Workers' Recognition Act of 2001 to correct a continuing problem \nin the Federal Employees Compensation Act. This bill will also provide \nclinical social workers the recognition they deserve as independent \nproviders of quality mental health care services.\n  Clinical social workers are authorized to independently diagnose and \ntreat mental illnesses through public and private health insurance \nplans across the nation. However, Title V, United States Code, does not \npermit the use of mental health evaluations conducted by clinical \nsocial workers for use as evidence in determining workers' compensation \nclaims brought by federal employees. The bill I am introducing corrects \nthis problem.\n  It is a sad irony that federal employees may select a clinical social \nworker through their health plans to provide mental health services, \nbut may not go to this professional for workers' compensation \nevaluations. The failure to recognize the validity of evaluations \nprovided by clinical social workers unnecessarily limits federal \nemployees' selection of a provider to conduct the workers' compensation \nmental health evaluations.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that would \nexempt from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund excise taxes air \ntransportation by helicopters of individuals and cargo for the purpose \nof conducting removal and environmental restoration activities relating \nto unexploded ordnance on the island of Kahoolawe.\n  The Kahoolawe Island Unexploded Ordnance Clearance and Environmental \nRestoration Project is authorized under Title X of the Fiscal Year 1994 \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act. The island of Kahoolawe is \nuninhabited, and it served as a bombing range for the Department of \nDefense until 1990. The Department of Defense is currently in the \nprocess of cleaning up and restoring Kahoolawe for its eventual return \nto the State of Hawaii by 2003.\n  The Airport and Airway Trust Fund excise taxes help support our \nnation's air traffic systems and airport infrastructures. However, \nthere are no airports or landing zones on Kahoolawe that receive \nbenefits from the Trust Fund. In addition, the taxes place an undue \nburden on the air transportation services provided to the Kahoolawe \nClearance Project. Compared to a normal airline whose aircraft make \nfewer\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\ntrips per day over much longer distances, the services provided to the \nproject are very frequent, with many trips over very short distances.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief for the conversion of cooperative housing corporations into \ncondominiums; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\ntax relief for the conversion of cooperative housing corporations into \n                              condominiums\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that \nwould amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow Cooperative \nHousing Corporations (Co-ops) to convert to condominium forms of \nownership without any immediate tax consequences.\n  Under current law, a conversion from cooperative shareholding to \ncondominium ownership is taxable at a corporate level as well as an \nindividual level. The conversion is treated as a corporate liquidation, \nand therefore taxed accordingly. In addition, a capital gains tax is \nlevied on any increase between the owner's basis in the co-op share \npre-conversion and the market value of the condominium conversion \nbecause the owner is being taxed on a transaction that is nothing more \nthan a change in the form of ownership. While the Internal Revenue \nService concedes that there are no discernible advantages to society \nfrom the cooperative form of ownership, it does not view federal tax \nstatutes as having the flexibility to allow co-ops to reorganize freely \nas condominiums.\n  In cooperative housing, real property ownership is vested in a \ncorporation, with shares of stock for each apartment unit, that are \nsold to buyers. The corporation then issues a proprietary lease \nentitling the owner of the stock to the use of the unit in perpetuity. \nBecause the investment is in the form of a share of stock, investors \nsometimes lose their entire investment as a result of debt incurred by \nthe corporation in construction and development. In addition, due to \nthe structure of a cooperative housing corporation, a prospective \npurchaser of shares in the corporation from an existing tenant-\nstockholder has difficulty obtaining a mortgage financing for the \npurchase. Furthermore, tenant-stockholders of cooperative housing also \nencounter difficulties in securing bank loans for the full value of \ntheir investment.\n  As a result, owners of cooperative housing are increasingly looking \ntoward conversion to condominium ownership regimes. Condominium \nownership permits each owner of a unit to directly own the unit itself, \neliminating the cooperative housing dilemmas of corporate debt that \nsupersedes the investment of cooperative housing share owners, and \nother financial concerns.\n  The legislation I introduce today will remove the penalty of double \ntaxation of the conversion from the cooperative housing to condominium \nownership, and will greatly benefit co-op owners across the nation. I \nurge my colleagues to consider and support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 48\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NONRECOGNITION OF GAIN OR LOSS ON DISTRIBUTIONS BY \n                   COOPERATIVE HOUSING CORPORATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 216(e) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to distributions by cooperative \n     housing corporations) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(e) Distributions by Cooperative Housing Corporations.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in regulations--\n       ``(A) no gain or loss shall be recognized to a cooperative \n     housing corporation on the distribution by such corporation \n     of a dwelling unit to a stockholder in such corporation if \n     such distribution is in exchange for the stockholder's stock \n     in such corporation, and\n       ``(B) no gain or loss shall be recognized to a stockholder \n     of such corporation on the transfer of such stockholder's \n     stock in an exchange described in subparagraph (A).\n       ``(2) Basis.--The basis of a dwelling unit acquired in a \n     distribution to which paragraph (1) applies shall be the same \n     as the basis of the stock in the cooperative housing \n     corporation for which it is exchanged, decreased in the \n     amount of any money received by the taxpayer in such \n     exchange.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to distributions after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS:\n  S. 49.

Mr. President, I am proud to introduce a piece of \nlegislation important to my State, the ``Alaska Wetlands Conservation \nAct.''\n  The legislation I submit today is identical to that introduced in the \n106th Congress, except for a minor addition relative to silviculture. \nThe new language simply clarifies the existing exemption for normal \nsilviculture activities as applied to lands owned by Alaska Native \ncorporations established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act (``ANCSA'')\n  Congress in enacting the ANCSA intended and expected that Native \ntimber holdings would be subject to harvesting. In fact, most Native \ntimber lands are former national forest lands that, at the time of the \nenactment of ANCSA in 1971, were part of an ``established'' or \n``ongoing'' silviculture program for that forest.\n  I hope my colleagues will support my State and its Native peoples as \nwe pursue this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 51.

Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce legislation to \nauthorize the autonomous functioning of clinical psychologists and \nclinical social workers within the Medicare comprehensive outpatient \nrehabilitation facility program.\n  In my judgment, it is unfortunate that Medicare requires clinical \nsupervision of the services provided by certain health professionals \nand does not allow them to function to the full extent of their state \npractice licenses. Those who need the services of outpatient \nrehabilitation facilities should have access to a wide range of social \nand behavioral science expertise. Clinical psychologists and clinical \nsocial workers are recognized as independent providers of mental health \ncare services under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the \nCivilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, the \nMedicare (Part B) Program, and numerous private insurance plans. This \nlegislation will ensure that these qualified professionals achieve the \nsame recognition\n\n[[Page S321]]\n\nunder Medicare comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 51\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \namend Title XVIII of the Social Security Act to correct discrepancies \nin the reimbursement of clinical social workers covered through \nMedicare, Part B. The three proposed changes contained in this \nlegislation clarify the current payment process for clinical social \nworkers and establish a reimbursement methodology for the profession \nthat is similar to other health care professionals reimbursed through \nthe Medicare program.\n  First, this legislation sets payment for clinical social worker \nservices according to a fee schedule established by the Secretary. \nSecond, it explicitly states that services and supplies furnished by a \nclinical social worker are a covered Medicare expense, just as these \nservices are covered for other mental health professionals in Medicare. \nThird, the bill allows clinical social workers to be reimbursed for \nservices provided to a client who is hospitalized.\n  Clinical social workers are valued members of our health care \nprovider network. They are legally regulated in every state of the \nnation and are recognized as independent providers of mental health \ncare throughout the health care system. I believe it is time to correct \nthe disparate reimbursement treatment of this profession under \nMedicare.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 52\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of services provided by nursing school clinics \nunder State Medicaid programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   Nursing School Clinics Act of 2001\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nursing \nSchool Clinics Act of 2001. This measure builds on our concerted \nefforts to provide access to quality health care for all Americans by \noffering grants and incentives for nursing schools to establish primary \ncare clinics in underserved areas where additional medical services are \nmost needed. In addition, this measure provides the opportunity for \nnursing schools to enhance the scope of student training and education \nby providing firsthand clinical experience in primary care facilities.\n  Primary care clinics administered by nursing schools are university \nor nonprofit entity primary care centers developed mainly in \ncollaboration with university schools of nursing and the communities \nthey serve. These centers are staffed by faculty and staff who are \nnurse practitioners and public health nurses. Students supplement \npatient care while receiving preceptorships provided by college of \nnursing faculty and primary care physicians, often associated with \nacademic institutions, who serve as collaborators with nurse \npractitioners. To date, the comprehensive models of care provided by \nnursing clinics have yielded excellent results, including significantly \nfewer emergency room visits, fewer hospital inpatient days, and less \nuse of specialists, as compared to conventional primary health care.\n  This bill reinforces the principle of combining health care delivery \nin underserved areas with education of advanced practice nurses. To \naccomplish these objectives, Title XIX of the Social Security Act would \nbe amended to designate that the services provided in these nursing \nschool clinics are reimbursable under Medicaid. The combination of \ngrants and the provision of Medicaid reimbursement furnishes the \nincentives and operational resources to establish the clinics.\n  In order to meet the increasing challenges of bringing cost-effective \nand quality health care to all Americans, we must consider and debate \nvarious proposals, both large and small. Most importantly, we must \napproach the issue of health care with creativity and determination, \nensuring that all reasonable avenues are pursued. Nurses have always \nbeen an integral part of health care delivery. The Nursing School \nClinics Act of 2001 recognizes the central role they can perform as \ncare givers to the medically underserved.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                 S. 53\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to amend \nTitle 18 of the United States Code to allow our nation's clinical \nsocial workers to use their mental health expertise on behalf of the \nfederal judiciary by conducting psychological and psychiatric exams.\n  I feel that the time has come to allow our nation's judicial system \nto have access to a wide range of behavioral science and mental health \nexpertise.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to revise \ncertain provisions relating to the appointment of professional \npsychologists in the Veterans Health Administration, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n              veteran's health administration act of 2001\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I introduce legislation today to amend \nChapter 74 of Title 38, United States Code, to revise certain \nprovisions relating to the appointment of clinical and professional \npsychologists in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The VHA has \na long history of maintaining a staff of the very best health care \nprofessionals to provide care to those men and women who have served \nour country in the Armed Forces.\n  Recently, a distressing situation regarding the care of our veterans \nhas come to my attention: the recruiting and retention of psychologists \nin the VHA of the Department of Veterans Affairs has become a \nsignificant problem.\n  The Congress has recognized the important contribution of the \nbehavioral sciences in the treatment of several conditions afflicting a \nsignificant portion of our veterans. Programs related to homelessness, \nsubstance abuse, and post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have \nreceived funding from the Congress in recent years.\n  Psychologists, as behavioral science experts, are essential to the \nsuccessful implementation of these programs. Consequently, the high \nvacancy and turnover rates for psychologists in the VHA might seriously \njeopardize these programs and will negatively impact overall patient \ncare in the VHA.\n  Recruitment of psychologists by the VHA is hindered by a number of \nfactors including a pay scale that is not commensurate with private \nsector rates together with a low number of clinical and professional \npsychologists appearing on the register of the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM). Most new hires have no post-doctoral experience, and \nare hired immediately after a VHA internship. Recruitment, when \nsuccessful, takes up to sic months or longer.\n  Retention of psychologists in the VHA system poses an even more \nsignificant problem. I have been informed that almost 40 percent of VHA \npsychologists have five years or less of post-doctoral experience. \nPsychologists leave the VHA system after five years because they have \nalmost reached peak levels for salary and professional advancement. \nUnder the present system, psychologists cannot be recognized, or \nappropriately compensated, for excellence or for taking on additional \nresponsibilities such as running treatment programs.\n  In effect, the current system for hiring psychologists in the VHA \nsupports mediocrity, not excellence and mastery. Our veterans with \nbehavioral and mental health disorders deserve better psychological \ncare from more experienced professionals than they are now receiving.\n  Currently, psychologists are the only doctoral level health care \nproviders in the VHA who are not included in Title 38. This is without \nquestion a significant factor in the recruitment and retention \ndifficulties that I have mentioned. Title 38 appointment authority for \npsychologists would help ameliorate the recruitment and retention \nproblems. The length of time needed to recruit psychologists could be \nshortened by eliminating the requirement for applicants to be rated by \nthe OPM. This would also encourage the recruitment of applicants who \nare not recent VHA interns by reducing the amount of time between \nidentifying a desirable applicant and being able to offer that \napplicant a position.\n  It is expected that problems in retention will be greatly alleviated \nby the implementation of a Title 38 system that offers financial \nincentives for psychologists to pursue professional development. \nAchievements that would merit salary increases include such activities \nas assuming supervisory responsibilities for clinical programs, \nimplementing innovative clinical treatments that improve the \neffectiveness and efficiency of patient care, making significant \ncontributions to the science of psychology, earning the ABPP diplomate \nstate, and becoming a Fellow of the American Psychological Association.\n  The addition of psychologists to Title 38, as proposed by this \namendment, would provide relief for the retention and recruitment \nissues and enhance the quality of care for our veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 62\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing a private relief \nbill on behalf of Donald C. Pence of Stanford, North Carolina, for \ncompensation for the failure of the Department of Veterans Affairs to \npay dependency and indemnity compensation to Kathryn E. Box, the now-\ndeceased mother of Donald C. Pence. It is rare that a federal agency \nadmits a mistake. In this case, the Department of Veterans Affairs has \nadmitted that a mistake was made and explored ways to permit payment \nunder the law, including equitable relief, but has found no provisions \nauthorizing the Department to release the remaining benefits that were \nunpaid to Mrs. Box at the time of her death. My bill would correct this \ninjustice, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 63\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RELIEF OF DONALD C. PENCE.\n\n       (a) Relief.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay, out \n     of any moneys in the Treasury\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\n     not otherwise appropriated, to Donald C. Pence, of Sanford, \n     North Carolina, the sum of $31,128 in compensation for the \n     failure of the Department of Veterans Affairs to pay \n     dependency and indemnity compensation to Kathryn E. Box, the \n     now-deceased mother of Donald C. Pence, for the period \n     beginning on July 1, 1990, and ending on March 31, 1993.\n       (b) Limitation on Fees.--Not more than a total of 10 \n     percent of the payment authorized by subsection (a) may be \n     paid to or received by agents or attorneys for services \n     rendered in connection with obtaining such payment, any \n     contract to the contrary notwithstanding. Any person who \n     violates this subsection shall be fined not more than $1,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 65. A bill to amend title VII of the Public Health Service Act to \nensure that social work students or social work schools are eligible \nfor support under the certain programs to assist individuals in \npursuing health careers and programs of grants for training projects in \ngeriatrics, an to establish a social work training program; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n        Amendment to Title VII of the Public Health Service Act\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on behalf of our nation's clinical social \nworkers, I am introducing legislation to amend the Public Health \nService Act. This legislation would (1) establish a new social work \ntraining program; (2) ensure that social work students are eligible for \nsupport under the Health Careers Opportunity Program; (3) provide \nsocial work schools with eligibility for support under the Minority \nCenters of Excellence programs; (4) permit schools offering degrees in \nsocial work to obtain grants for training projects in geriatrics; and \n(5) ensure that social work is recognized as a profession under the \nPublic Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Act.\n  Despite the impressive range of services social workers provide to \npeople of this national, few federal programs exit to the provide \nopportunities for social work training in health and mental health \ncare. This legislation would (1) provide funding for existing social \nwork training programs or fellowships for individuals who plan to \nspecialize in, practice, or teach social work; (2) help disadvantaged \nstudents earn graduate degrees in social work with a concentration in \nhealth or mental health; (3) provide new resources and opportunities in \nsocial work training for minorities; and (4) encourage schools of \nsocial work to expand programs in geriatrics.\n  Social workers have long provided quality mental health services to \nour citizens and continue to be at the forefront of establishing \ninnovative programs to service our disadvantaged populations. I believe \nit is important to ensure that the special expertise social workers \nposses continue to be available to the citizens of this nation. This \nbill, by providing financial assistance to schools of social work and \nsocial work students, acknowledges the long historic and critical \nimportance of the services provided by social work professionals. I \nbelieve it is time to provide them with the cognition they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                 S. 65\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Physical and \nOccupational Therapy Education Act of 2001. This legislation will \nincrease educational opportunities for physical therapy and \noccupational therapy practitioners in order to meet the growing demand \nfor the valuable services they provide in our communities.\n  Several factors contribute to the present need for federal support in \nthis area. The rapid aging of our nation's population, the demands of \nthe AIDS crisis, increasing emphasis on health promotion and disease \nprevention, and the growth of home health care has increased the demand \nfor physical and occupational therapy services. This demand has \nexceeded our ability to educate an adequate number of physical \ntherapists and occupational therapists.\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\nIn addition, technological advances are allowing injured and disabled \nindividuals to survive conditions that would have proven fatal in past \nyears.\n  An inadequate number of physical therapists has led to an increased \nreliance on foreign-educated, non-immigrant temporary workers (H-1B \nvisa holders). The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform has identified \nphysical therapy and occupational therapy as having the highest number \nof H-1B visa holders in the United States, second only to computer \nspecialists.\n  In addition to the shortage of practitioners, a shortage of faculty \nimpedes the expansion of established education programs. The critical \nshortage of doctoral-prepared occupational therapists and physical \ntherapists has resulted in a depleted pool of potential faculty. This \nbill would assist in the development of qualified faculty by giving \npreference to grant applicants seeking to develop and expand post-\nprofessional programs for the advanced training of physical and \noccupational therapists.\n  The legislation I introduce today would provide necessary assistance \nto physical and occupational therapy programs throughout the country. \nThe investment we make will help reduce America's dependence on foreign \nlabor and create highly-skilled, high-wage employment opportunities for \nAmerican citizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 66\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \namend Title VII of the Public Health Service Act to establish a \npsychology post-doctoral program.\n  Psychologists have made a unique contribution in reaching out to the \nnation's medically underserved populations. Expertise in behavioral \nscience is useful in addressing grave concerns such as violence, \naddiction, mental illness, adolescent and child behavioral disorders, \nand family disruption. Establishment of a psychology post-doctoral \nprogram could be an effective way to find solutions to these issues.\n  Similar programs supporting additional, specialized training in \ntraditionally underserved settings have been successful in retaining \nparticipants to serve the same populations. For example, mental health \nprofessionals who have participated in these specialized federally \nfunded programs have tended not only to meet their repayment \nobligations, but have continued to work in the public sector or with \nthe underserved.\n  While a doctorate in psychology provides broad-based knowledge and \nmastery in a wide variety of clinical skills, specialized post-doctoral \nfellowship programs help to develop particular diagnostic and treatment \nskills required to respond effectively to underserved populations. For \nexample, what appears to be poor academic motivation in a child \nrecently relocated from Southeast Asia might actually reflect a \ncultural value of reserve rather than a disinterest in academic \nlearning. Specialized assessment skills enable the clinician to \ninitiate effective treatment.\n  Domestic violence poses a significant public health problem and is \nnot just a problem for the criminal justice system. Violence against \nwomen results in almost 100,000 days of hospitalization, 30,000 \nemergency room visits and 40,000 visits to physicians each year. Rates \nof child and spouse abuse in rural areas are particularly high, as are \nthe rates of alcohol abuse and depression in adolescents. A post-\ndoctoral fellowship program in the psychology of the rural populations \ncould be of special benefit in addressing these problems.\n  Given the demonstrated success and effectiveness of specialized \ntraining programs, it is incumbent upon us to encourage participation \nin post-doctoral fellowships that respond to the needs of the nation's \nunderserved.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 67\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. GRANTS FOR FELLOWSHIPS IN PSYCHOLOGY.\n\n       Part C of title VII of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 293k et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 749.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation today to \nmodify Title VII of the U.S. Public Health Service Act in order to \nprovide students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with the \nopportunity to participate in various health professions loan programs.\n  Providing students enrolled in graduate psychology programs with \neligibility for financial assistance in the form of loans, loan \nguarantees, and scholarships will facilitate a much-needed infusions of \nbehavioral science expertise into our community of public health, \nproviders. There is a growing recognition of the valuable contribution \nbeing made by psychologists toward solving some of our nation's most \ndistressing problems.\n  The participation of students from all backgrounds and clinical \ndisciplines is vital to the success of health care training. The Title \nVII programs play a significant role in providing financial support for \nthe recruitment of minorities, women, and individuals from economically \ndisadvantaged backgrounds. Minority therapists have an advantage in the \nprovision of critical services to minority populations because often \nthey can communicate with clients in their own language and cultural \nframework. Minority therapists are more likely to work in community \nsettings where ethnic minority and economically disadvantaged \nindividuals are most likely to seek care. It is critical that continued \nsupport be provided for the training of individuals who provide health \ncare services to underserved communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 68\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nhealth care practitioners in rural areas with training in preventive \nhealth care, including both physical and mental care, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n           rural preventive health care training act of 2001\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nPreventive Health Care Training Act of 2001, a bill that responds to \nthe dire need of our rural communities for quality health care and \ndisease prevention programs.\n  Almost one fourth of Americans live in rural areas and frequently \nlack access to adequate physical and mental health care. As many as 21 \nmillion of the 34 million people living in undeserved rural areas are \nwithout access to a primary care provider. Even in areas where \nproviders do exist, there are numerous limits to access, such as \ngeography, distance, lack of transportation, and lack of knowledge \nabout available resources. Due to the diversity of rural populations, \nlanguage and cultural obstacles are often a factor in the access to \nmedical care.\n  Compound these problems with limited financial resources, and the \nresult is that many Americans living in rural communities go without \nvital health care, especially preventive care. Children fail to receive \nimmunizations and routine checkups. Preventable illnesses and injuries \noccur needlessly, and lead to expensive hospitalizations. Early \nsymptoms of emotional problems and substance abuse go undetected, and \noften develop into full-blown disorders.\n  An Institute of Medicine (IOM) report entitled, ``Reducing Risks for \nMental Disorders; Frontiers for Preventive Intervention Research,'' \nhighlights the benefits of preventive care for all health problems. The \ntraining of health care providers in prevention is crucial in order to \nmeet the demand for care in underserved areas. Currently, rural health \ncare providers lack preventive care training opportunities.\n  Interdisciplinary preventive training of rural health care providers \nmust be encouraged. Through such training, rural health care providers \ncan build a strong educational foundation from the behavioral, \nbiological, and psychological sciences. Interdisciplinary team \nprevention training will also facilitate operations at sites with both \nhealth and mental health clinics by facilitating routine consultation \nbetween groups. Emphasizing the mental health disciplines and their \nservices as part of the health care team will contribute to the overall \nhealth of rural communities.\n  The Rural Preventive Health Care Training Act of 2001 would implement \nthe risk-reduction model described in the IOM study. This model is \nbased on the identification of risk factors and targets specific \ninterventions for those risk factors.\n  The human suffering caused by poor health is immeasurable, and places \na huge financial burden on communities, families, and individuals. By \nimplementing preventive measures to reduce this suffering, the \npotential psychological and financial savings are enormous.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 69\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE TRAINING.\n\n       Part D of title VII of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 294 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 754 \n     the following:\n\n[[Page S327]]\n\n     ``SEC. 754A.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to improve the \nhydroelectric licensing process by granting the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission statutory authority to better coordinate \nparticipation by other agencies and entities, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        HYDROELECTRIC LICENSING PROCESS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill, and I send it \nto the desk.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce is the Hydroelectric Licensing \nProcess Improvement Act of 2001. As its title suggests, the purpose of \nthe bill is to improve the process by which non-federal hydroelectric \nprojects are licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  I introduced an identical bill early in the 106th Congress. Several \nhearings were held on the bill in both the Senate and House. I \nintroduce this bill today with the full understanding that the bill may \nundergo some changes as a result of collaboration with my colleague \nSenator Bingaman and others on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. At the end of the last Congress, Senator Bingaman offered to \nwork with me in a bipartisan fashion to successfully report this bill \nout of Committee in the 107th Congress. I enthusiastically look forward \nto working with him to ensure that this bill gets the necessary \nattention to move smoothly and with appropriate speed through the \nCommittee process.\n  Mr. President, hydropower represents ten percent of the energy \nproduced in the United States, and approximately 85% of all renewable \nenergy generation. This is a significant portion of our nation's \nelectricity, produced without air pollution or greenhouse gas \nemissions, and it is accomplished at relatively low cost.\n  The Commission for many years since its creation in 1920, controlled \nour nation's water power potential with uncompromising authority. \nHowever, over the years, a number of environmental statutes, amendments \nto the Federal Power Act, Commission regulations, licensing and policy \ndecisions, and several critical court decisions, has made the \nCommission's licensing process extremely costly, time consuming, and, \nat times, arbitrary. Indeed, the current Commission licensing program \nis burdened with mixed mandates and redundant bureaucracy and prone to \ngridlock and litigation.\n  Under current law, several federal agencies are required to set \nconditions for licenses without regard to the effects those conditions \nhave on project economics, energy benefits, impacts on greenhouse gas \nemissions and values protected by other statutes and regulations. Far \ntoo often we have agencies fighting agencies and issuing inconsistent \ndemands.\n  The consequent delays in processing hydropower applications result in \nsignificant business costs and lost capacity. For example, according to \na September 1997 study of the U.S. Department of Energy, since 1987, of \n52 peaking projects relicensed by the Commission, four projects \nincreased capacity, and 48 decreased capacity. In simple terms, those \n48 projects became less productive as a result of the relicensing \nprocess at the Commission than they were prior to relicensing. Ninety-\ntwo percent of the peaking projects since 1987 lost capacity.\n  In addition, faced with the uncertainties currently plaguing the \nrelicensing process, some existing licensees are contemplating \nabandonment of their projects. This is of concern to the nation because \ntwo-thirds of all non-federal hydropower capacity is up for relicensing \nin the next fifteen years. This concern has been exacerbated in the \nlast several months by the catastrophic energy supply crisis \nexperienced by California and the rest of the West. By the year 2010, \n220 projects will be subject to the relicensing process.\n  Publicly owned hydropower projects constitute nearly 50% of the total \ncapacity that will be up for renewal. The problems resulting in lost \ncapacity, coupled with the momentous changes occurring in the \nelectricity industry and the increasing need for emission free sources \nof power, all underscore\n\n[[Page S329]]\n\nthe need for Congressional action to reform hydroelectric licensing.\n  Moreover, the loss of a hydropower project means more than the loss \nof clean, efficient, renewable electric power. Hydropower projects \nprovide drinking water, flood control, fish and wildlife habitat, \nirrigation, transportation, environmental enhancement funding and \nrecreation benefits. Also, due to its unique load-following capability, \npeaking capacity and voltage stability attributes, hydropower plays a \ncritical role in maintaining our nation's reliable electric service.\n  My bill will help remedy the inefficient and complex Commission \nlicensing process by ensuring that federal agencies involved in the \nprocess act in a timely and accountable manner.\n  My bill does not change or modify any existing environmental laws, \nnor remove regulatory authority from various agencies. It does not call \nfor the repeal of mandatory conditioning authority of appropriate \nfederal agencies. Rather, it requires participating agencies to \nconsider, and be accountable for, the full effects of their actions \nbefore imposing mandatory conditions on a Commission issued license.\n  It is clear to me and many of my colleagues here in the Senate that \nhydropower is at risk. Clearly, one of the most important tasks for \nenergy policymakers in the 21st Century is to develop an energy \nstrategy that will ensure an adequate supply of reasonably priced, \nreliable energy to all American consumers in an environmentally \nresponsible manner. The relicensing of non-federal hydropower can and \nshould continue be an important and viable element in this strategy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a section-\nby-section analysis appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 71\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hydroelectric Licensing \n     Process Improvement Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) hydroelectric power is an irreplaceable source of \n     clean, economic, renewable energy with the unique capability \n     of supporting reliable electric service while maintaining \n     environmental quality;\n       (2) hydroelectric power is the leading renewable energy \n     resource of the United States;\n       (3) hydroelectric power projects provide multiple benefits \n     to the United States, including recreation, irrigation, flood \n     control, water supply, and fish and wildlife benefits;\n       (4) in the next 15 years, the bulk of all non-Federal \n     hydroelectric power capacity in the United States is due to \n     be relicensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission;\n       (5) the process of licensing hydroelectric projects by the \n     Commission--\n       (A) does not produce optimal decisions, because the \n     agencies that participate in the process are not required to \n     consider the full effects of their mandatory and recommended \n     conditions on a license;\n       (B) is inefficient, in part because agencies do not always \n     submit their mandatory and recommended conditions by a time \n     certain;\n       (C) is burdened by uncoordinated environmental reviews and \n     duplicative permitting authority; and\n       (D) is burdensome for all participants and too often \n     results in litigation; and\n       (6) while the alternative licensing procedures available to \n     applicants for hydroelectric project licenses provide \n     important opportunities for the collaborative resolution of \n     many of the issues in hydroelectric project licensing, those \n     procedures are not appropriate in every case and cannot \n     substitute for statutory reforms of the hydroelectric \n     licensing process.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to achieve the objective of \n     relicensing hydroelectric power projects to maintain high \n     environmental standards while preserving low cost power by--\n       (1) requiring agencies to consider the full effects of \n     their mandatory and recommended conditions on a hydroelectric \n     power license and to document the consideration of a broad \n     range of factors;\n       (2) requiring the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \n     impose deadlines by which Federal agencies must submit \n     proposed mandatory and recommended conditions to a license; \n     and\n       (3) making other improvements in the licensing process.\n\n     SEC. 4.

STUDY OF SMALL HYDROELECTRIC PROJECTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission shall submit to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources of the Senate and the Committee on Commerce \n     of the House of Representatives a study of the feasibility of \n     establishing a separate licensing procedure for small \n     hydroelectric projects.\n       (b) Definition of Small Hydroelectric Project.--The \n     Commission may by regulation define the term ``small \n     hydroelectric project'' for the purpose of subsection (a), \n     except that the term shall include at a minimum a \n     hydroelectric project that has a generating capacity of 5 \n     megawatts or less.\n\n  Section-by-Section Analysis of the Hydroelectric Licensing Process \n                        Improvement Act of 2001\n\n       Section 1: Short Title. The legislation may be referred to \n     as the Hydroelectric Licensing Process Improvement Act of \n     2001.\n       Section 2: Findings. Hydropower is a vital renewable energy \n     resource, providing clean, economic and reliable electricity. \n     Hydropower projects also provide recreation, irrigation, \n     flood control, water supply and fish and wildlife benefits. \n     The bulk of all non-Federal hydro projects are coming up for \n     relicensing by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n     (FERC) in the next 15 years. The hydroelectric licensing \n     process does not produce optimal decisions, because agencies \n     participating in the process fail to consider the full \n     effects of mandatory and recommended license conditions. The \n     process is inefficient, in part because of delays in the \n     submission of mandatory and recommended conditions, and \n     environmental reviews are uncoordinated. As a result, the \n     process is burdensome for all participants, and prone to \n     litigation. While alternative licensing procedures are \n     available and can lead to the collaborative resolution of \n     issues in some relicensings, they are not appropriate in all \n     circumstances, and are not a substitute for needed statutory \n     reform.\n       Section 3: Purpose. The purpose of the legislation is to \n     achieve the objective of relicensing hydroelectric power \n     projects to maintain high environmental standards while \n     preserving low cost power. This purpose will be achieved \n     through statutory reforms to improve the licensing process by \n     (1) requiring agencies to consider key factors, and document \n     their consideration of those factors, when developing \n     mandatory and recommended license conditions; (2) requiring \n     FERC to set deadlines for the submission of agency \n     conditions; and (3) making other process improvements.\n       Section 4(a): Process for Consideration by Federal Agencies \n     of Conditions to Licenses. The legislation would create a new \n     section 32 of the Federal Power Act (FPA), specifying the \n     process for consideration by Federal agencies of conditions \n     to hydroelectric project licenses.\n       Definitions: New FPA section 32(a) would define \n     ``condition'' and ``consulting agency'' as used in section \n     32. ``Condition'' refers to conditions for projects on \n     Federal reservations determined under FPA section 4(e) and \n     fishway prescriptions determined under FPA section 18. \n     ``Consulting agencies'' are the agencies with authority to \n     determine conditions under sections 4(e) and 18.\n       Factors to be Considered: New FPA section 32(b) would \n     require consulting agencies to consider the impact of \n     conditions on: economic and power values; electric generating \n     capacity and system reliability; air quality, including \n     impacts on greenhouse gas emissions; and drinking, flood \n     control, irrigation, navigation or recreation water supply. \n     In addition, agencies would be required to consider the \n     compatibility of their conditions with other conditions that \n     will be included in the license, including, if available, \n     mandatory conditions of other agencies. Further, agencies \n     would be required to consider means to ensure that conditions \n     address only direct project environmental impacts, and do so \n     at the lowest cost to the project. Agencies must create \n     written documentation of their consideration of these issues, \n     and submit the documentation to FERC along with the \n     condition.\n       Scientific Review: New FPA section 32(c) would require that \n     each condition be subjected to appropriately substantiated \n     scientific review based on current empirical data or field-\n     tested data and subjected to peer review.\n       Relationship to Impacts on Federal Reservation: New FPA \n     section 32(d) would require that conditions determined under \n     FPA section 4(e) be directly and reasonably related to the \n     impacts of the project within the Federal reservation.\n       Administrative Review: New FPA section 32(e) would require \n     that proposed conditions be provided to applicants at least \n     90 days prior to the deadline for filing a license \n     application. Prior to submitting proposed conditions to the \n     Commission, consulting agencies must offer the license \n     applicant an opportunity to obtain administrative review of \n     the condition before an administrative law\n\n[[Page S331]]\n\n     judge or other independent reviewing body. The administrative \n     review would consider the reasonableness of the proposed \n     condition, in light of its effects on the energy and economic \n     values of the project, and the agency's compliance with the \n     requirements imposed in section 32. Administrative review \n     must be completed within 180 days of a request for review \n     from the applicant. If it is not, the Commission is \n     authorized to treat the condition as a recommendation is \n     treated under FPA section 10(j). If an agency reviewing body \n     decides that a proposed condition is unreasonable or that the \n     requirements of the new FPA section 32 are not met, it must \n     explain its decision and remand the matter to the agency for \n     further action. The reviewing body may recommend curative \n     actions. Finally, the consulting agency, following \n     administrative review, would be required to either withdraw \n     the condition, formulate a condition that follows the \n     recommendations of the administrative review body, or \n     otherwise comply with section 32. When the condition is \n     submitted to the Commission, the consulting agency would be \n     required to include any record on administrative review and \n     documentation of any action taken after administrative \n     review.\n       Submission of Final Condition: After a license application \n     is filed, new FPA section 32(f) would require FERC to \n     establish a deadline for the submission to the Commission of \n     final conditions. The deadline would be no later than one \n     year after the date on which the Commission gives notice that \n     the license application is ready for environmental review \n     (subject to one 30 day extension by FERC). If the consulting \n     agency fails to comply with the deadline, the agency would \n     not have authority to recommend or establish a condition. The \n     legislative language restates FERC's current authority under \n     its regulations to propose or establish license conditions in \n     place of the defaulting agency in such a situation.\n       Analysis by the Commission: New section 32(g) would require \n     FERC to conduct an economic analysis of conditions to \n     determine whether a condition would render the project \n     uneconomic. In addition, in exercising its authority under \n     section 10(j) to reject a recommendation that is inconsistent \n     with the Federal Power Act, the Commission would be required \n     to consider whether 10(j) recommendations are consistent with \n     the provisions of sections 32 (b) and (c) (consideration \n     of factors and scientific review).\n       Commission Determination on Effect of Conditions: New \n     section 32(h) would require the Commission, if requested on \n     rehearing by a license applicant, to make a written \n     determination on whether a condition (1) is in the public \n     interest (measured by the impact of the condition on the \n     energy, economic and resource considerations enumerated in \n     section 32(b); (2) was subject to scientific review as \n     required in section 32(c); (3) relates to direct project \n     impacts within the reservation (if applicable); (4) is \n     reasonable; (5) is supported by substantial evidence; and (6) \n     is consistent with the Federal Power Act and other license \n     terms and conditions.\n       Section 4(b): Conforming and Technical Amendments: This \n     section makes certain technical changes in FPA sections 4(e) \n     and 18 to reflect the new requirements of section 32.\n       Section 5: Coordinated Environmental Review Process: A new \n     section 33 would be added to the Federal Power Act to confirm \n     the FERC's responsibilities as the lead agency for \n     environmental reviews of hydroelectric projects under the \n     National Environmental Policy Act.\n       Lead Agency Responsibility: New FPA section 33(a) would \n     confirm FERC's responsibility to conduct a single, \n     consolidated environmental review for each project or, if \n     appropriate, for multiple projects located in the same area. \n     This language assures that the legislation does not preclude \n     a single environmental review being done for multiple \n     projects.\n       Consulting Agencies: New FPA section 33(b) would impose a \n     limitation on consulting agencies seeking to perform a \n     separate environmental review for conditions submitted in \n     accordance with new FPA section 32. This language is designed \n     to avert agency reviews that would duplicate the consolidated \n     environmental review conducted by FERC.\n       Deadlines: New FPA section 33(c) would require the \n     Commission to set deadlines that provide opportunity for \n     input on environmental reviews by federal, state and local \n     agencies.\n       Section 6: Study of Small Hydroelectric Projects. Within 18 \n     months of the date of enactment, FERC must complete a study \n     of the feasibility of establishing a separate licensing \n     procedure for small hydroelectric projects. The study would \n     be submitted to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources and \n     House Commerce Committees. The term ``small hydroelectric \n     project'' would be defined by FERC, and shall include \n     projects with generating capacity of 5 megawatts or less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. BINGAMAN:\n       S. 72. A bill to amend the National Energy Conservation \n     Policy Act to enhance and extend authority relating to energy \n     savings performance contracts of the Federal Government; to \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                        expanding ESPC authority\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation, to amend the National Energy Conservation Policy Act of \n1986. This legislation, the ``Energy Efficient Cost Savings Improvement \nAct of 2001,'' which I previously introduced on December 14, 2000 as S. \n3277 and was accepted by unanimous consent, will improve the current \nlaw by enhancing and extending the authority relating to energy savings \nperformance contracts of the Federal Government. The benefit to the \ntaxpayer will be not only the realization of greater cost savings as \nthey pertain to older, inefficient Federal buildings but, more \nimportantly, the reduction in the waste of monies spent trying to \nimprove these buildings when other, more cost effective alternatives \nare available.\n  The National Energy Conservation Policy Act, as amended by the Energy \nPolicy Act of 1992, established a mandate for energy savings in Federal \nbuildings and facilities. Aggressive energy conservation goals were \nsubsequently established by Executive Order 12902, stating that, by \n2005, Federal agencies must reduce their energy consumption in their \nbuildings by 30 percent per square foot when compared to 1985 levels. \nExecutive Order 13123 increased this goal to 35 percent by 2010.\n  To help attain these objectives, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 \ncreated Energy Savings Performance Contracting (ESPC), which offered a \nmeans of achieving this energy reduction goal at no capital cost to the \ngovernment. That's right--no capital cost to the government, since ESPC \nis an alternative to the traditional method of Federal appropriations \nto finance these types of improvements in Federal buildings. Under the \nESPC authority, Federal agencies contract with energy service companies \n(ESCO), which pay all the up-front costs. These costs relate to \nevaluation, design, financing, acquisition, installation, and \nmaintenance of energy efficient equipment; altered operation and \nmaintenance improvements; and technical services. The ESCO guarantees a \nfixed amount of energy cost savings throughout the life of the contract \nand is paid directly from those cost savings. Agencies retain the \nremainder of the cost savings for themselves and, at the end of the \ncontract, ownership of all property, along with the additional cost \nsavings, reverts to the Federal government. Currently, contracts may \nrange up to 25 years. Over the entire contract period, Federal monies \nare neither required nor appropriated for the improvements.\n  But, as innovative as the ESPC alternative may be, there is one area \nin which it falls short--and that is, how to avoid wasting valuable \nfunds improving energy efficiency in a building that has long since \npassed its useful life. How do you justify energy conservation measures \nin buildings that are in constant need of maintenance or repair? \nFacilities that, no matter how much money is invested for renovation, \nwill never meet existing building code requirements? You may save money \nby improving energy efficiency, but then turn around and reinvest even \nlarger amounts in operating and maintaining a very old facility. \nSomewhere there has to be a point where we decide there must be other \nalternatives--and that is exactly what my legislation offers.\n  Mr. President, the most important element of my legislation is in the \nway it proposes to fund the construction of replacement Federal \nfacilities. The legislation builds upon the existing Energy Savings \nPerformance Contracting and takes it one logical step further--to \ninclude savings anticipated from operation and maintenance efficiencies \nof a new replacement Federal building. Perhaps the easiest way to \nexplain the benefits of this change is by citing an example. In my home \nstate of New Mexico, the Department of Energy Albuquerque Operations \noffice resides in a complex of buildings constructed originally as Army \nbarracks during the Korean War. Although these facilities have been \nrenovated and modified throughout the years, they remain energy \ninefficient and require high maintenance and operation costs when \ncompared to more contemporary buildings. What's more, over the next \nseven years, the Operations office will institute additional \nmodifications to meet compliance requirements for seismic, energy \nsavings, and other facility infrastructure concerns (maintenance, \nenvironmental, safety and health, etc.) at a cost of $34.2 million. \nEven with these modifications, we end up with a\n\n[[Page S332]]\n\nmodernized 50-year old building that will continue to require expensive \nmaintenance dollars. The estimate to replace the office complex with a \nnew facility, by the way, is $35.3 million. While Congress cannot \nafford to appropriate funds to build a new facility, we're willing to \nspend--no, we're forced to waste--almost as much in maintaining an old \none.\n  As requested by the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2000, \nthe Department of Energy conducted a feasibility study for replacing \nthe Albuquerque Operations office using an ESPC. The results of the \nstudy are enlightening, for it demonstrated that by using anticipated \nenergy, operations, and maintenance efficiencies of a new replacement \nbuilding over the old one, the cost savings alone pay for the new \nfacility. What's more, the analysis forecasts that after the annual \nESPC loan payment is made to the contractor, there is a $1 million per \nyear surplus. Over a 25-year contract, the savings to the taxpayer is \n$25 million.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to draw your attention to the broader \nimplications that this legislation has for Federal agencies and \ntaxpayers alike. The application of authority created by this \nlegislation in the replacement of other Federal buildings could result \nin billions of dollars of avoided waste. Simply by considering \noperation and maintenance cost savings, we would reap a double benefit \nof newer facilities and much needed improvements to the Federal \ninfrastructure at a fraction of the cost. And, since ESCOs typically \nuse local companies to provide construction services, this type of \nprogram would have a very beneficial effect on local economies.\n  There is certainly enough work within the Federal government to move \nforward on this ESPC legislation. To this end, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the bill.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 72\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is customary for me to introduce \nlegislation on the first day of a new Congress that addresses what \ncountless Americans believe are our Nation's most serious social \nproblems. These problems are not new--and the solutions are familiar--\nbut I shall nonetheless devote a few moments to explaining the \nimportance of these bills, and why, more than ever, it is so crucial to \ncorrect a number of permissive social policies that are creating a \nmoral and spiritual crisis in our country.\n  During the past several years, Mr. President, I have been delighted \nthat the responsible fiscal policies of the Republican Congress, \ncoupled with strong and stable monetary policy engineered by the \nFederal Reserve, has proved a successful combination for the economy. \nThe resulting expansion--fueled not by government but by the limitless \nentrepreneurial energy of the American people--has been highly \ngratifying.\n  But while the American people have been largely optimistic about the \nstate of the economy, there is a curious dichotomy between those \npositive feelings and their unease about the state of American society. \nBecause for every positive report Americans read on the financial page, \nthere seems to be utterly horrifying stories elsewhere, stories which \ndetail a moral sickness at the heart of our culture, stories which \nchronicle the devaluation of human life in our society, symbolized by \nthe tragic 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade.\n  Two years ago, I told the story of the young New Jersey woman who in \nMay of 1997 gave birth to an infant in a public bathroom stall during \nher senior prom. She promptly strangled her newborn baby boy, placed \nhis little body in a trash can, adjusted her makeup, and returned to \nthe dance floor.\n  The American people were justly shocked by such callousness, and I \nwas even more stunned to learn that stories of a similar nature are \ncommon.\n  Consider the following examples reported in the media in December of \nthe year 2000.\n  Portland Oregonian, December 5, 2000: ``A teen-ager accused of \ndrowning her newborn baby in the bathtub at a family gathering in July \nin Eagle Creek pleaded guilty on Monday to second-degree \nmanslaughter.''\n  Chicago Tribune, December 9, 2000: ``A 21-year-old Fox Lake man \npleaded guilty Friday to first-degree murder in the death of his \ngirlfriend's 2-month-old daughter, who authorities said was brutally \nshaken and thrown during the last days of her life.\n  Orlando Sentinel, December 24, 2000: ``A 17-month-old baby has died \nafter his stepfather beat the infant in the head with his fists.\n  News Tribune (Tacoma, Washington), December 1, 2000: ``A Lakewood \nmother and her live-in boyfriend have been charged with homicide-by-\nabuse in the mid-September death of the woman's 2-month-old son.''\n\n  Salt Lake Tribune, December 5, 2000: The mother of a newborn boy \nfound dead after being abandoned in a shed at a St. George amusement \npark was bound over Monday for trial on a charge of first-degree \nmurder.\n  Should we really be surprised, Mr. President, that a Nation that not \nonly\n\n[[Page S333]]\n\ntolerates, but actively defends the practice of partial birth abortion \nwould produce these gruesome headlines? And should we be surprised that \nthe extraordinary level of disrespect for human life to which America \nhas fallen has not been limited to infant abuse on the part of \ncaregivers, but now pervades every part of our society?\n  In fact, Mr. President, the abortion-on-demand zealots holding sway \nover the media and much of the intellectual and political establishment \nare becoming ever more brazen in their assault on the unborn. Just this \nmonth, the National Abortion Rights Action League, known as NARAL, \nbegan an outrageously offensive television advertising campaign seeking \nto cloak the divisive practice of abortion under the guise of \npatriotism. Amidst images of families and children, and accompanied by \nstirring music, the text of the advertisement falsely treats this \npainful procedure as a cause for celebration. ``What's life,'' the \ncommercial asks, ``without choice?''\n  The deliberate destruction of the most innocent, most helpless human \nbeings imaginable has nothing whatsoever to do with ``life.''\n  We have a moral crisis in our country. But too often, the mainstream \nmedia doesn't seek to remedy our decaying culture; they actually \ncelebrate it. During the past two years, the FOX network has become \nnotorious for trivializing our most cherished institutions with so-\ncalled ``reality entertainment'' programs like ``Who Wants to Marry a \nMulti-Millionaire'' and its most recent assault on good taste, \n``Temptation Island''.\n  On this program, which debuted just weeks ago, contestants--or \nperhaps I should say exhibitionists--exchange their real-life \nrelationships for promiscuous affairs, solely to divert the viewing \npublic. And instead of responding with outrage--or at the very least, \nindifference--a sizeable portion of the American public rewarded the \nprogram with high ratings.\n  It is increasingly apparent that American society has lost its \nmoorings. But too many politicians blithely suggest that government and \nmorality are not and should not be related; too many producers in \nHollywood claim that the filth that passes for entertainment does not \ncorrupt our culture; and too many educators claim the academy does not \nhave a place in addressing the difference between right and wrong.\n  Mr. President, they are the ones who are wrong. We fool ourselves and \nwe fool the public if we suggest that there is no connection between \nthe business we do in Congress and the state of public morality in our \nsociety. We are the caretakers of our own culture. And we must not \nshrink from the responsibility of passing laws that promote what is \nright and prevent what is wrong in our society.\n  When we make good choices, such as passing comprehensive welfare \nreform, the American people are rewarded with declining welfare \ncaseloads with a corresponding decrease in crime and poverty. When \nCongress pursues responsible fiscal policy and balances the budget, it \nis possible to return to the American people more of their hard-earned \nmoney in the form of a tax cut.\n  In short, Mr. President, good laws help make good societies. And that \nis the reason I continue to introduce bills in each and every Congress \nthat limit the modern tragedy of abortion and its insidious effects; \nthat allow for voluntary prayer in schools; that take steps to end the \nscourge of drug use among our children; and that make sure our civil \nrights laws treat Americans as individuals rather than faceless members \nof racial groups, religious groups, or of a certain gender.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these six bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 73\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the voluntary School Prayer Protection Act \nwill make sure that student-initiated prayer is treated the same as all \nother student-initiated free speech--which the U.S. Supreme Court has \nupheld as constitutionally protected so long as it is done in an \nappropriate time, place and manner such that it ``does not materially \ndisrupt the school day.'' [Tinker v. Des Moines School District, 393 \nU.S. 503.]\n  Under this bill, school districts could not continue--in \nconstitutional ignorance--enforcing blanket denials of students' rights \nto voluntary prayer and religious activity in the schools. For the \nfirst time, schools would be faced with real consequences for making \nuninformed and unconstitutional decisions prohibiting all voluntary \nprayer. The bill creates a complete system of checks and balances to \nmake sure that school districts do not shortchange their students one \nway or the other.\n  This proposal, Mr. President, prevents public schools from \nprohibiting constitutionally protected voluntary student-initiated \nprayer. It does not mandate school prayer and suggestions to the \ncontrary are simply in error. Nor does it require schools to write any \nparticular prayer, or compel any student to participate in prayer. It \ndoes not prevent school districts from establishing appropriate time, \nplace, and manner restrictions on voluntary prayer--the same kind of \nrestrictions that are placed on other forms of speech in the schools.\n  What this proposal will do is prevent school districts from \nestablishing official policies or procedures with the intent of \nprohibiting students from exercising their constitutionally protected \nright to lead, or participate in, voluntary prayer in school.\n\n\n                 schoolchildren's health protection act\n\n  Mr. President, there is a significant question pending before the \nSenate: should schools receiving federal funds be able to distribute \n``morning after pills''--also identified as abortion pills--to \nschoolchildren? The answer is unequivocally no. Which is why I am\n\n[[Page S335]]\n\nintroducing the Schoolchildren's Health Protection Act. This pivotal \nlegislation will put an end to elementary and secondary schools \nreceiving federal funds from distributing ``morning after pills'' to \nschoolchildren as young as 12 years old.\n  The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has not only confirmed that \nFederal law permits school-based health clinics receiving federal \nfamily planning money to distribute ``Morning-after pills,'' but CRS \nhas also reported that at least 180 schools in America are in fact \ndistributing these abortion pills to schoolchildren. Obviously, Mr. \nPresident, we are no longer just talking about condoms being handed out \nat school.\n  What's more is that federal law currently allows schools to provide \nthese abortion-inducing drugs to children behind the backs of parents. \nIn a handful of cases, the federal courts have struck down parental \nconsent laws, ruling that any federal family planning program trumps a \nstate or county parental consent statute because federal law prohibits \nparental consent requirements.\n  Just as disturbing, if not more so, Mr. President, is that schools \ndistributing ``morning after pills'' are placing the health of these \nyoung children in jeopardy. In fact, the manufacturer--PREVEN--warns \nthat ``Morning after pills'' can cause severe health risks, such as: \nblood clots; liver tumors; elevated blood pressure; heart attacks and \nstrokes.\n  It is well worth noting that the current policy in the majority of \nU.S. public schools prohibits the distribution of aspirin to \nschoolchildren unless parental consent is given. Yet, here we are \nlegally permitting schools to secretly provide these dangerous abortion \npills to minors without the knowledge of parents.\n  Under this bill, this unethical practice will no longer continue. \nPlanned Parenthood and its cronies will no longer be able to use public \nschool facilities to covertly get abortion pills into the mouths of \nchildren.\n  As Americans may recall, I offered a similar bill in amendment form \nlast Congress to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, which rightfully \npassed both the Senate and the House. Even though this language was not \nincluded in the final budget deal struck last year, I am hopeful \nCongress will revisit this issue once more, and put a complete end to \nthe unthinkable practice of giving children abortion pills at school.\n\n\n                   Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act\n\n  Mr. President, the Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act has several \ngoals. First, it puts the Senate on record as declaring that one, every \nabortion destroys deliberately the life of an unborn child; two, that \nthe U.S. Constitution sanctions no right to abortion; and three, that \nRoe v. Wade was incorrectly decided.\n  Second, this legislation will prohibit Federal funding to pay for, or \npromote, abortion. Further, this legislation proposes to de-fund \nabortion permanently, thereby relieving Congress of annual legislative \nbattles about abortion restrictions in appropriation bills.\n  Third, the Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act proposes to end \nindirect Federal funding for abortions by one, prohibiting \ndiscrimination, at all federally funded institutions, against citizens \nwho as a matter of conscience object to abortion and two, curtailing \nattorney fees in abortion-related cases.\n  Fourth, this bill proposes that appeals to the Supreme Court be \nprovided as a right if and when any lower Federal court declares \nrestrictions on abortion unconstitutional, thus effectively assuring \nSupreme Court reconsideration of the abortion issue.\n  Mr. President, I believe this bill begins to remedy some of the \ndamage done to America by the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. \nI continue to believe that a majority of my colleagues will one day \nagree, and I will never give up doing everything in my power to protect \nthe most vulnerable Americans of all: the unborn.\n\n\n                      Civil Rights of Infants Act\n\n  In 1989, our distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, Senator \nGordon Humphrey, first called attention to the incredibly brutal \npractice of abortions performed solely because prospective parents \nprefer a child of a gender different from that of the baby in the \nmother's womb.\n  The Civil Rights in Infants Act makes sure nobody could ever act upon \nthis unthinkable decision by specifically amending title 42 of the \nUnited States Code governing civil rights. Anyone who administers an \nabortion for the purpose of choosing the gender of the infant will be \nsubject to the same laws which protects any other citizen who is a \nvictim of discrimination.\n  Nobody--even the most radical feminists--can ignore the absurdity of \ndenying a child the right to life simply because the parents happened \nto prefer a child of the opposite gender. I hope the 106th Congress \nwill swiftly act to fulfill the desires of the American people, who \nrightfully believe it is immoral to destroy unborn babies simply \nbecause the parents demand a child of a different gender.\n\n\n                      Civil Rights Restoration Act\n\n  Mr. President, the last of these bills is entitled the Civil Rights \nRestoration Act. Specifically, this legislation prevents Federal \nagencies, and the Federal courts, from interpreting title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964 to allow an employer to grant preferential \ntreatment in employment to any group or individual on account of race.\n  This proposal prohibits the use of racial quotas once and for all. \nDuring the past several years, almost every Member of the Senate--and \nthe President of the United States--have proclaimed that they are \nopposed to quotas. This bill will give Senators an opportunity to \nreinforce their statements by voting in a rollcall vote against quotas.\n  Mr. President, this legislation emphasizes that from here on out, \nemployers must hire on a race neutral basis. They can reach out into \nthe community to the disadvantaged and they can even have businesses \nwith 80 percent or 90 percent minority workforces as long as the \nmotivating factor in employment is not race.\n  This bill clarifies section 703(j) of title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964 to make it consistent with the intent of its authors, \nHubert Humphrey and Everett Dirksen. Let me state it for the Record:\n\n       It shall be an unlawful employment practice for any entity \n     that is an employer, employment agency, labor organization, \n     or joint labor-management committee subject to this title to \n     grant preferential treatment to any individual or group with \n     respect to selection for, discharge from, compensation for, \n     or the terms, conditions, or privileges of, employment or \n     union membership, on the basis of the race, color, religion, \n     sex, or national origin of such individual or group, for any \n     person, except as provided in subsection (e) or paragraph \n     (2).\n       It shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an \n     entity described in paragraph (1) to recruit individuals of \n     an under-represented race, color, religion, sex, or national \n     origin, to expand the applicant pool of the individuals \n     seeking employment or union membership with the entity.\n\n  Specifically, this bill proposes to make part (j) of Section 703 of \nthe 1964 Civil Rights Act consistent with subsections (a) and (d) of \nthat section. It contains the identical language used in those sections \nto make preferential treatment on the basis of race (that is, quotas) \nan unlawful employment practice.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear that this legislation does not make \noutreach programs an unlawful employment practice. Under language \nsuggested years ago by the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Bob Dole, \na company can recruit and hire in the inner city, prefer people who are \ndisadvantaged, create literacy programs, recruit in the schools, \nestablish day care programs, and expand its labor pool in the poorest \nsections of the community. In other words, expansion of the employee \npool is specifically provided for under this act.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is necessary because in the 37 years \nsince the passage of the Civil Rights Act, the Federal Government and \nthe courts have combined to corrupt the spirit of the Act as enumerated \nby both Hubert Humphrey and Everett Dirksen, who made clear that they \nwere unalterably opposed to racial quotas. Yet in spite of the clear \nintent of Congress, businesses large and small must adhere to hiring \nquotas in order to keep the all-powerful federal government off their \nbacks. This bill puts an end to that sort of nonsense once and for all.\n\n\n                        safe schools act of 2001\n\n  Mr. President, the protection of the most vulnerable among us--our \nchildren--is the highest responsibility of government. Government's \nobligation to protect our children from harm is\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\nnowhere more important than while they are in the care of public \nemployees at school. Tragically, in too many of America's classrooms, \nthis fundamental responsibility is not being met.\n  That is why I have worked with other concerned Senators in recent \nyears to introduce and promote the Safe Schools Act. During the 106th \nCongress, the Senate passed the Act as an amendment to other \nlegislation. Regrettably, neither of the bills it was attached to \nsuccessfully navigated both the conference and final floor \nconsideration processes.\n  The Safe Schools Act directly confronts the issue of illegal drug use \nand juvenile violence by equalizing the treatment of students who \nchoose to carry either felonious quantities of illegal drugs or \nfirearms to a public school. When enacted, this legislation will \nprovide a consistent federal policy with respect to the possession of \nboth firearms and illegal drugs in America's public school classrooms.\n  For students and parents, the message of the Safe Schools Act is that \nthere are serious consequences for anyone willingly choosing to violate \nthe law and to jeopardize the safety and security of their fellow \nstudents, teachers, and school personnel.\n  Mr. President, by enacting the Gun-Free Schools Act in 1994, the \nfederal government encouraged states to adopt a stringent uniform \nstandard with respect to students who willingly chose to carry a \nfirearm to school. The act did this by conditioning eligibility for \nfederal education dollars on state adoption of a policy requiring the \nexpulsion for not less than one year of any student who brought a \nfirearm to school. The Safe Schools Act extends this same common sense \npolicy to any student who willingly takes a felonious quantity of \nillegal drugs to school.\n  Recently, some authorities have reported a modest reduction in \ncriminal activity at our schools. While this news is encouraging, we \ncan not satisfy ourselves with modest reductions. Instead, we should \ndemand that every student be educated in a safe and crime-free \nclassroom. Achieving this goal requires that we do more to eliminate \ndrug-related activity from our nation's classrooms.\n  Anyone who doubts this need only review the latest results from the \nNational Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education survey, or \nPRIDE survey as it is called, which found that:\n  Gun-toting students were twenty-four times more likely to use cocaine \nthan those who didn't bring a gun to school;\n  Gang members were nineteen times more likely to use cocaine than non-\ngang members;\n  Students who threatened others were six times more likely to be \ncocaine users than others.\n  Faced with the clear relationship between school violence and drugs \nin our classrooms, it should be evident that we must do more to protect \nAmerica's school children.\n  In deciding what to do, I believe that we should respect the advice \nof those who are daily confronted with the variety of evils that result \nfrom the increasing availability of drugs in our classrooms--our \nstudents, teachers and school administrators. When surveyed, these \ngroups have reported overwhelming support for the approach embodied in \nthe Safe Schools Act.\n  Mr. President, students consistently say that the number one problem \nthey face is the scourge of illegal drugs. Perhaps even more disturbing \nis the fact that students of all ages, including elementary ages, \nreport that drugs are readily available to them.\n  The Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia \nUniversity has documented the extent of this national tragedy by \ndocumenting that two-thirds (66%) of students report going to schools \nwhere students keep, use and sell drugs and that over half (51%) of \nhigh school students believe that the drug problem is getting worse.\n  Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join with me and build on \nthe progress that we made last Congress in addressing this vital issue. \nIt is undeniable that reducing drug activity at schools will result in \na better learning environment, increased discipline, and a reduction in \nviolence. It is long past time to take action to restore schools that \nare secure and conducive to the education of the vast majority of \nstudents who are eager to learn. America's students and teachers \ndeserve nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I do not pretend that enacting this legislation will \nsolve all of the pathologies of modern society. But taken as a whole, \nthey seek to turn the tide of the increasing apathy--and in some cases, \noutright hostility--toward moral and spiritual principles that have \nmarked social policy at the turn of the century.\n  The Founding Fathers knew what would become of a society that ignores \ntraditional morality. I have often quoted the parting words of advice \nour first President, George Washington, left his beloved new Nation. He \nreminded his fellow citizens:\n\n       Of all the dispensations and habits which lead to political \n     prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. \n     In vain would that man claim the tribute to patriotism who \n     should labor to subvert these great pillars of human \n     happiness.\n\n  Mr. President, that distinguished world leader, Margaret Thatcher, \nhighlighted for us the words of Washington's successor, John Adams, who \nsaid ``our Constitution was designed only for a moral and religious \npeople. It is wholly inadequate for the government of any other.''\n  Our Founding Fathers understood well the intricate relationship \nbetween freedom of responsibility. They knew that the blessings of \nliberty engendered certain obligations on the part of a free people--\nnamely, that citizens conduct their actions in such a way that society \ncan remain cohesive without excessive government intrusion. The \nAmerican experiment would never have succeeded without the traditional \nmoral and spiritual values of the American people--values that allow \npeople to govern themselves, rather than be governed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Wellstone, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Akaka, \n        Mr. Breaux, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Reid, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 77.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Paycheck Fairness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Women have entered the workforce in record numbers.\n       (2) Even today, women earn significantly lower pay than men \n     for work on jobs that require equal skill, effort, and \n     responsibility and that are performed under similar working \n     conditions. These pay disparities exist in both the private \n     and governmental sectors. In many instances, the pay \n     disparities can only be due to continued intentional \n     discrimination or the lingering effects of past \n     discrimination.\n       (3) The existence of such pay disparities--\n       (A) depresses the wages of working families who rely on the \n     wages of all members of the family to make ends meet;\n       (B) prevents the optimum utilization of available labor \n     resources;\n       (C) has been spread and perpetuated, through commerce and \n     the channels and instrumentalities of commerce, among the \n     workers of the several States;\n       (D) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n     commerce;\n       (E) constitutes an unfair method of competition in \n     commerce;\n       (F) leads to labor disputes burdening and obstructing \n     commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce;\n       (G) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods \n     in commerce; and\n       (H) in many instances, may deprive workers of equal \n     protection on the basis of sex in violation of the 5th and \n     14th amendments.\n       (4)(A) Artificial barriers to the elimination of \n     discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex \n     continue to exist more than 3 decades after the enactment of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) \n     and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.).\n       (B) Elimination of such barriers would have positive \n     effects, including--\n\n[[Page S337]]\n\n       (i) providing a solution to problems in the economy created \n     by unfair pay disparities;\n       (ii) substantially reducing the number of working women \n     earning unfairly low wages, thereby reducing the dependence \n     on public assistance; and\n       (iii) promoting stable families by enabling all family \n     members to earn a fair rate of pay;\n       (iv) remedying the effects of past discrimination on the \n     basis of sex and ensuring that in the future workers are \n     afforded equal protection on the basis of sex; and\n       (v) ensuring equal protection pursuant to Congress' power \n     to enforce the 5th and 14th amendments.\n       (5) With increased information about the provisions added \n     by the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and wage data, along with more \n     effective remedies, women will be better able to recognize \n     and enforce their rights to equal pay for work on jobs that \n     require equal skill, effort, and responsibility and that are \n     performed under similar working conditions.\n       (6) Certain employers have already made great strides in \n     eradicating unfair pay disparities in the workplace and their \n     achievements should be recognized.\n\n     SEC. 3.

and\n       (2) by inserting before the semicolon the following: ``, or \n     has inquired about, discussed, or otherwise disclosed the \n     wages of the employee or another employee, or because the \n     employee (or applicant) has made a charge, testified, \n     assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, \n     proceeding, hearing, or action under section 6(d)''.\n       (e) Enhanced Penalties.--Section 16(b) of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 216(b)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting after the first sentence the following: \n     ``Any employer who violates section 6(d) shall additionally \n     be liable for such compensatory or punitive damages as may be \n     appropriate, except that the United States shall not be \n     liable for punitive damages.'';\n       (2) in the sentence beginning ``An action to'', by striking \n     ``either of the preceding sentences'' and inserting ``any of \n     the preceding sentences of this subsection'';\n       (3) in the sentence beginning ``No employees shall'', by \n     striking ``No employees'' and inserting ``Except with respect \n     to class actions brought to enforce section 6(d), no \n     employee'';\n       (4) by inserting after the sentence referred to in \n     paragraph (3), the following: ``Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of Federal law, any action brought to enforce \n     section 6(d) may be maintained as a class action as provided \n     by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.'';

A bill to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \norder refunds of unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory or \npreferential rates or changes for electricity, to establish cost-based \nrates for electricity sold at wholesale in the Western Systems \nCoordinating Council, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               california electricity crisis legislation\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill relating to \nthe electricity crisis in California. As a result of deregulation, \nCalifornians are confronting higher electricity prices and an \nunreliable supply\n  Last week, Northern California experienced rolling blackouts. \nChildren were trapped in elevators. Manufacturing plans had to shut \ndown, costing millions of dollars. Entire agricultural crops can be \ndestroyed with a blackout. Obviously, this situation does not just \naffect Californians but can impact the entire nation's economy.\n  The bill I am introducing today is similar to legislation I \nintroduced last fall with Representative Bob Filner. The California \nElectricity Consumers Relief Act would establish a Western Regional Cap \nfor electricity rates.\n  The electricity shortage experienced by California in recent months, \nclearly demonstrates that a price cap must be imposed on the entire \nWestern United States to be effective. If the price for electricity is \nhigher in other Western states than California, then a generator \nchooses to sell power outside of California. A regional price cap will \nbeing some stability to the market by ensuring a reliable supply for \nthe entire Western region, so that no state will confront a shortage.\n  I urge Congress to bring an end to this crisis. We must now act to \nbring Californians and other Western states what they need--an adequate \nsupply of electricity at a fair and reasonable price. By implementing \nthis region-wide cap, we can address a major cause of California's \nenergy crisis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 81. A bill to express the policy of the United States regarding \nthe United States relationship with Native Hawaiians, to provide a \nprocess for the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian government and the \nrecognition by the United States of the Native Hawaiian government, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                      NATIVE HAWAIIANS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill on behalf \nof myself and my friend and colleague, Senator Inouye. This measure is \nof significant importance to the people of Hawaii, particularly to the \nindigenous peoples of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians. This measure clarifies \nthe political relationship between Native Hawaiians and the United \nStates by extending the federal policy of self-determination and self-\ngovernance to Native Hawaiians.\n  The United States has declared a special responsibility for the \nwelfare of the native peoples of the United States, including Native \nHawaiians. Congress has recognized Native Hawaiians as the aboriginal, \nindigenous, native peoples of Hawaii and has passed over 150 statutes \naddressing the conditions of Native Hawaiians. The measure that we are \nintroducing today extends the federal policy of self-determination and \nself-governance to Native Hawaiians by authorizing a process of \nreorganization of a Native Hawaiian government for the purposes of a \nfederally recognized government-to-government relationship with the \nUnited States. This measure establishes parity in federal policies \ntowards American Indians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians.\n  The political relationship between Native Hawaiians and the United \nStates has been a topic of discussion in Hawaii for many, many years. A \nsignificant portion of the discussion has centered around the history \nof Hawaii's indigenous peoples and the role of the United States in \nthat history. In 1993, Congress passed Public Law 103-150, the Apology \nResolution, which extended an apology on behalf of the United States to \nNative Hawaiians for the United States' role in the overthrow of the \nKingdom of Hawaii. The Apology Resolution also expressed the commitment \nof Congress and the President to acknowledge the ramifications of the \noverthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and to support reconciliation \nefforts between the United States and Native Hawaiians.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to inform you that the reconciliation \nprocess is ongoing. The reconciliation process is an incremental \nprocess of dialogue between Native Hawaiians and the United States to \naddress a number of longstanding issues arising out of the overthrow of \nthe Kingdom of Hawaii. I look forward to working with the Bush \nAdministration as we continue this important process.\n  On October 23, 2000, a joint report was issued by the Departments of \nthe Interior and Justice on the reconciliation process. The report was \nbased on public consultations held in Hawaii in December 1999 between \nofficials from the Interior and Justice Departments and Native \nHawaiians. The report recommends that Native Hawaiians have self-\ndetermination over their own affairs within the framework of federal \nlaw, as do Native American tribes. The measure we are introducing \ntoday, Mr. President is consistent with this recommendation.\n  This measure does not create a political relationship between Native \nHawaiians and the United States. The political relationship has existed \nsince Hawaii's inception as a territory. Rather, the measure we \nintroduce today clarifies the existing political relationship between \nHawaii's indigenous peoples and the United States.\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\n  This measure authorizes a process for the reorganization of the \nNative Hawaiian government for the purposes of a federally recognized \ngovernment-to-government relationship. The measure authorizes Native \nHawaiians to resolve many issues in developing the organic governing \ndocuments, including the issue of membership or citizenship in the \nreorganized government. This bill also establishes an office within the \nDepartment of the Interior to focus on Native Hawaiian issues. The \noffice would serve as a liaison between Native Hawaiians and the United \nStates during the reconciliation process and would provide assistance \nduring the process of reorganization of the Native Hawaiian government. \nFederal programs currently administered with other federal agencies \nwould remain with those agencies.\n  An identical version of the measure was introduced during the 106th \nCongress. The House of Representatives passed the measure with \nbipartisan support. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs reported the \nmeasure favorably. Unfortunately, the Senate did not consider the \nmeasure prior to the adjournment of the last Congress.\n  Mr. President, I would like to clarify some misconceptions regarding \nthis important measure. First, this measure is not being introduced to \ncircumvent the 1999 United States Supreme Court decision in the case of \nRice v. Cayetano. The Rice case was a voting rights case whereby the \nSupreme Court held that the State of Hawaii must allow all citizens of \nHawaii to vote for the Board of Trustees of a quasi-state agency, the \nOffice of Hawaiian Affairs.\n  The Office of Hawaiian Affairs was established by citizens of the \nState of Hawaii as part of the 1978 State of Hawaii Constitutional \nConvention. The State constitution was amended to create the Office of \nHawaiian Affairs as a means to give expression to the right of self-\ndetermination and self-governance for Hawaii's indigenous peoples, \nNative Hawaiians. The Office of Hawaiian Affairs administers programs \nand services for Native Hawaiians. The State constitution provided for \n9 trustees who were Native Hawaiian to be elected by Native Hawaiians. \nFollowing the Supreme court's ruling in Rice v. Cayetano, the elections \nwere not only open to all citizens in the State of Hawaii, but non-\nHawaiians were deemed eligible to serve on the Board of Trustees. \nWhereas the Rice case dealt with voting rights and the State of Hawaii, \nthe measure we introduce today addresses the federal policy of self-\ndetermination and self-governance and does not involve the Office of \nHawaiian Affairs.\n\n  This measure does not establish entitlements or special treatment for \nNative Hawaiians based on race. This measure focuses on the political \nrelationship afforded to Native Hawaiians based on the United States' \nrecognition of Native Hawaiians as the aboriginal, indigenous peoples \nof Hawaii. As we all know, the United States' history with its \nindigenous peoples has been dismal. In recent decades, however, the \nUnited States has engaged in a policy of self-determination and self-\ngovernance with its indigenous peoples. Government-to-government \nrelationships provide indigenous peoples with the opportunity to work \ndirectly with the federal government on policies affecting their lands, \nnatural resources and many other aspects of their well-being. While \nfederal policies towards Native Hawaiians have paralleled that of \nNative American Indians and Alaska Natives, the federal policy of self-\ndetermination and self-governance, has not yet been extended to Native \nHawaiians. This measure extends this policy to Native Hawaiians, thus \nfurthering the process of reconciliation between Native Hawaiians and \nthe United States.\n  This measure does not impact program funding for American Indians and \nAlaska Natives. Federal programs for Native Hawaiian health, education \nand housing are already administered by the Departments of Health and \nHuman Services, Education, and Housing and Urban Development.\n  In addition, this measure has strong support from indigenous peoples \nwithin the United States. The National Congress of American Indians and \nAlaska Federation of Natives have both passed resolutions in support of \na government-to-government relationship between Native Hawaiians and \nthe United States. Similar resolutions have been passed by the Japanese \nAmerican Citizens' League and the National Education Association. The \nmeasure is also supported by the Hawaii State Legislature, which passed \na resolution supporting a federally recognized government-to-government \nrelationship.\n  This measure does not preclude Native Hawaiians from seeking \nalternatives in the international arena. Instead, this measure focuses \non self-determination within the framework of federal law and seeks to \nestablish equality in the federal policies extended towards American \nIndians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians.\n  This measure is critical to the people in Hawaii because it begins a \nprocess to address many longstanding issues facing Hawaii's indigenous \npeoples and the State of Hawaii. By resolving these matters, we begin a \nprocess of healing, a process of reconciliation not only within the \nUnited States, but within the State of Hawaii. These issues are deeply \nrooted in the history of Hawaii. The time has come for us to begin to \nresolve these differences in order to be able to move forward together \nas one.\n  Mr. President, I cannot emphasize enough how significant this measure \nis for the State of Hawaii. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact this critical measure for the State of Hawaii and \nindigenous peoples in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the text of this \nmeasure be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 81\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Constitution vests Congress with the authority to \n     address the conditions of the indigenous, native people of \n     the United States.\n       (2) Native Hawaiians, the native people of the Hawaiian \n     archipelago which is now part of the United States, are \n     indigenous, native people of the United States.\n       (3) The United States has a special trust relationship to \n     promote the welfare of the native people of the United \n     States, including Native Hawaiians.\n       (4) Under the treaty making power of the United States, \n     Congress exercised its constitutional authority to confirm a \n     treaty between the United States and the government that \n     represented the Hawaiian people, and from 1826 until 1893, \n     the United States recognized the independence of the Kingdom \n     of Hawaii, extended full diplomatic recognition to the \n     Hawaiian government, and entered into treaties and \n     conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and \n     navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.\n       (5) Pursuant to the provisions of the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42), the United \n     States set aside 203,500 acres of land in the Federal \n     territory that later became the State of Hawaii to address \n     the conditions of Native Hawaiians.\n       (6) By setting aside 203,500 acres of land for Native \n     Hawaiian homesteads and farms, the Act assists the Native \n     Hawaiian community in maintaining distinct native settlements \n     throughout the State of Hawaii.\n       (7) Approximately 6,800 Native Hawaiian lessees and their \n     family members reside on Hawaiian Home Lands and \n     approximately 18,000 Native Hawaiians who are eligible to \n     reside on the Home Lands are on a waiting list to receive \n     assignments of land.\n       (8) In 1959, as part of the compact admitting Hawaii into \n     the United States, Congress established the Ceded Lands Trust \n     for 5 purposes, 1 of which is the betterment of the \n     conditions of Native Hawaiians. Such trust consists of \n     approximately 1,800,000 acres of land, submerged lands, and \n     the revenues derived from such lands, the assets of which \n     have never been completely inventoried or segregated.\n       (9) Throughout the years, Native Hawaiians have repeatedly \n     sought access to the Ceded Lands Trust and its resources and \n     revenues in order to establish and maintain native \n     settlements and distinct native communities throughout the \n     State.\n       (10) The Hawaiian Home Lands and the Ceded Lands provide an \n     important foundation for the ability of the Native Hawaiian \n     community to maintain the practice of Native Hawaiian \n     culture, language, and traditions, and for the survival of \n     the Native Hawaiian people.\n       (11) Native Hawaiians have maintained other distinctly \n     native areas in Hawaii.\n       (12) On November 23, 1993, Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. \n     1510) (commonly known as the Apology Resolution) was enacted \n     into law, extending an apology on behalf of the United States \n     to the Native people of Hawaii for the United States role in \n     the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n       (13) The Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow \n     of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active \n     participation of agents and citizens of the United States and\n\n[[Page S340]]\n\n     further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never \n     directly relinquished their claims to their inherent \n     sovereignty as a people over their national lands to the \n     United States, either through their monarchy or through a \n     plebiscite or referendum.\n       (14) The Apology Resolution expresses the commitment of \n     Congress and the President to acknowledge the ramifications \n     of the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii and to support \n     reconciliation efforts between the United States and Native \n     Hawaiians; and to have Congress and the President, through \n     the President's designated officials, consult with Native \n     Hawaiians on the reconciliation process as called for under \n     the Apology Resolution.\n       (15) Despite the overthrow of the Hawaiian government, \n     Native Hawaiians have continued to maintain their separate \n     identity as a distinct native community through the formation \n     of cultural, social, and political institutions, and to give \n     expression to their rights as native people to self-\n     determination and self-governance as evidenced through their \n     participation in the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.\n       (16) Native Hawaiians also maintain a distinct Native \n     Hawaiian community through the provision of governmental \n     services to Native Hawaiians, including the provision of \n     health care services, educational programs, employment and \n     training programs, children's services, conservation \n     programs, fish and wildlife protection, agricultural \n     programs, native language immersion programs and native \n     language immersion schools from kindergarten through high \n     school, as well as college and master's degree programs in \n     native language immersion instruction, and traditional \n     justice programs, and by continuing their efforts to enhance \n     Native Hawaiian self-determination and local control.\n       (17) Native Hawaiians are actively engaged in Native \n     Hawaiian cultural practices, traditional agricultural \n     methods, fishing and subsistence practices, maintenance of \n     cultural use areas and sacred sites, protection of burial \n     sites, and the exercise of their traditional rights to gather \n     medicinal plants and herbs, and food sources.\n       (18) The Native Hawaiian people wish to preserve, develop, \n     and transmit to future Native Hawaiian generations their \n     ancestral lands and Native Hawaiian political and cultural \n     identity in accordance with their traditions, beliefs, \n     customs and practices, language, and social and political \n     institutions, and to achieve greater self-determination over \n     their own affairs.\n       (19) This Act provides for a process within the framework \n     of Federal law for the Native Hawaiian people to exercise \n     their inherent rights as a distinct aboriginal, indigenous, \n     native community to reorganize a Native Hawaiian government \n     for the purpose of giving expression to their rights as \n     native people to self-determination and self-governance.\n       (20) The United States has declared that--\n       (A) the United States has a special responsibility for the \n     welfare of the native peoples of the United States, including \n     Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) Congress has identified Native Hawaiians as a distinct \n     indigenous group within the scope of its Indian affairs \n     power, and has enacted dozens of statutes on their behalf \n     pursuant to its recognized trust responsibility; and\n       (C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to \n     administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to \n     the State of Hawaii.\n       (21) The United States has recognized and reaffirmed the \n     special trust relationship with the Native Hawaiian people \n     through--\n       (A) the enactment of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide \n     for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union'', \n     approved March 18, 1959 (Public Law 86-3; 73 Stat. 4) by--\n       (i) ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands \n     formerly held by the United States, and mandating that those \n     lands be held in public trust for 5 purposes, one of which is \n     for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians; and\n       (ii) transferring the United States responsibility for the \n     administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of \n     Hawaii, but retaining the authority to enforce the trust, \n     including the exclusive right of the United States to consent \n     to any actions affecting the lands which comprise the corpus \n     of the trust and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42) that are \n     enacted by the legislature of the State of Hawaii affecting \n     the beneficiaries under the Act.\n       (22) The United States continually has recognized and \n     reaffirmed that--\n       (A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the aboriginal, native people who exercised \n     sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands;\n       (B) Native Hawaiians have never relinquished their claims \n     to sovereignty or their sovereign lands;\n       (C) the United States extends services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their unique status as the aboriginal, native \n     people of a once sovereign nation with whom the United States \n     has a political and legal relationship; and\n       (D) the special trust relationship of American Indians, \n     Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to the United States \n     arises out of their status as aboriginal, indigenous, native \n     people of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a series of bills \nintended to address the burden that estate taxes place on our economy. \nThe estate tax hinders entrepreneurial activity and job creation in \nmany economic sectors.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I have held hearings \non the impact of the estate tax on farmers, ranchers, and rural \ncommunities. The effects of inheritance taxes are far reaching in the \nagricultural community. Citing personal experiences, witnesses \ndescribed how the estate tax discourages savings, capital investment, \nand job formation.\n  One such story came from a Hoosier, Mr. Woody Barton. He is a fifth \ngeneration tree farmer living in the house his great grandparents built \nin 1885. I visited his 300 acres of forested property recently and can \nattest to their beauty. Typical of many farmers, Mr. Barton is over 65 \nyears old and wants to leave this legacy to his four children. But he \nfears that the estate tax may cause his children to strip the timber \nand then sell the land in order to pay the estate tax bill. His \ngrandmother logged a portion of the land in 1939 to pay the debts that \ncame from the death of her husband. In essence, each generation must \nbuy back the hard work and dedication of their ancestors from the \nfederal government. Mr. Barton believes, and I agree, that the actions \nof Congress have more impact on the outcome of his family's land than \nhis own planning and investment. This should not be the case.\n  The estate tax falls disproportionately on our agricultural \nproducers. Ninety-five percent of farms and ranch operations are sold \nproprietorships or family partnerships, subjecting a vast majority of \nthese businesses to the threat of inheritance taxes. According to USDA \nfigures farmers are six times more likely to face inheritance taxes \nthan other Americans. And commercial farm estates--those core farms \nthat produce 85 percent of our nation's agricultural products-are \nfifteen times more likely to pay inheritance taxes than other \nindividuals.\n  The threat of estate taxes to family farms will become even more \nprevalent if nothing is done. With the average farmer approaching 60 \nyears of age, farm families throughout the country are about to \nconfront the burden of estate taxes as they prepare to pass their farm \nonto the next generation. Recently, the USDA estimated that between \n1992 and 2002, more than 500,000 farmers will have retired. Demographic \nstudies indicate that a quarter of all farmers could confront the \ninheritance tax during the next 20 years.\n  In light of this problem, today I offer several bills to provide \nrelief to those impacted by the estate tax. This is the third \nconsecutive Congress that I have offered this series of bills on the \nfirst day of bill introduction. I am optimistic that this will be the \nCongress that will finally repeal the estate tax.\n  My first bill would repeal the estate and gift taxes outright. My \nsecond bill would phase out the estate tax over five years by gradually \nraising the unified credit each year until the tax is repealed after \nthe fifth year. My third bill would immediately raise the effective \nunified credit to $5 million. My last bill would raise the gift tax \nexemption from $10,000 to $25,000.\n  I believe that the best option is a simple repeal of the estate tax. \nHowever, even if the estate tax is not repealed, the unified credit \nmust be raised significantly. Despite our most recent success in \nraising the exemption level, inflation has caused a growing percentage \nof estates to be subjected to the estate tax. My second bill is \nintended to highlight this point and provide a gradual path to repeal. \nMy third bill focuses on relieving the estate tax burden that falls \ndisproportionately on farmers and small business owners. By raising the \nexemption amount to $5 million, 96 percent of estates with farm assets \nand 90 percent of estates with non-corporate business assets would not \nhave to pay estate taxes, according to the IRS. The final bill raising \nthe gift tax exemption from $10,000 to $25,000 would provide Americans \nwith an additional tool for passing productive assets to the next \ngeneration. This level has not been adjusted since 1982.\n  Despite its modest beginnings in 1916, the estate tax has mushroomed \ninto an exorbitant tax on death that discourages savings, economic \ngrowth, and job formation by blocking the accumulation of \nentrepreneurial capital and by breaking up family businesses and farms. \nWith the highest marginal rate at 55 percent, more than half of an \nestate can go directly to the government. By the time the inheritance \ntax is levied on families, their assets have already been taxed at \nleast once. This form of double taxation violates perceptions of \nfairness in our tax system.\n  If we are sincere about boosting economic growth, we must consider \nwhat effect the estate tax has on a business owner deciding whether to \ninvest in new capital goods or hire a new employee. The Heritage \nFoundation estimates that repealing the estate tax would annually boost \nour economic output by $11 billion, create 145,000 new jobs and raise \npersonal income by $8 billion. These figures underscore the current \nweight of this tax on our economy.\n  One might expect that for all the economic disincentives caused by \nthe estate tax, it must at least provide a sizable contribution to the \nU.S. Treasury. But in reality, the estate tax only accounts for about 1 \npercent of federal taxes. It cannot be justified as an indispensable \nrevenue raiser. Given the blow delivered to job formation and economic \ngrowth, the estate tax may even cost the Treasury money. Our nation's \nability to crease new jobs, new opportunities, and new wealth is \ndamaged as a result of our insistence on collecting a tax that earns \nless than 1 percent of our revenue.\n  But this tax affects more than just the national economy. It affects \nhow we as a nation think about community, family, and work. Small \nbusinesses and farms represent much more than assets. They represent \nyears of toil and entrepreneurial risk taking. They also represent the \nhopes that families have for their children. Part of the American Dream \nhas always been to build up a business, farm, or ranch so that economic \nopportunities and a way of life can be passed on to one's children and \ngrandchildren.\n  I know first-hand about the dangers of this tax to agriculture. My \nfather died when I was 24, leaving his 604-acre farm in Marion County, \nIndiana, to his family. I helped manage the farm, which had built up \nconsiderable debts during my father's illness. Fortunately, after a \nnumber of years, we were successful in working out the financial \nproblems and repaying the money. We were lucky; that farm remains in \nour family. But many of today's farmers and small business owners are \nnot so fortunate. Only about 30 percent of businesses are transferred \nfrom parent to child, and only about 12 percent of businesses make it \nto a grandchild.\n  Mr. President, I was delighted that during the last Congress we were \nable to pass the Death Tax Elimination Act. Despite its ultimate veto, \nthis legislative step was an important one and will hopefully carry \nover momentum to this congress. As we take up this issue again in the \ncoming months, the bills that I have introduced will provide \npolicymakers with a range of options as they seek to mitigate the \nburdens of the estate tax. Doing so will lead to expanded investment \nincentives and job creation and will reinvigorate an important part of \nthe American Dream. I am hopeful that Senators will join me in the \neffort to free small businesses, family farms, and our economy from \nthis counterproductive tax. I ask unanimous consent that my four bills \nbe printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S344]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 82\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Estimates indicate that as many as 70 \n     percent of small businesses do not make it to a second \n     generation and nearly 90 percent do not make it to a third.\n       (7) Eliminating the estate tax would lift the compliance \n     burden from farmers and family businesses.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan incentive to ensure that all Americans gain timely and equitable \naccess to the Internet over current and future generations of broadband \ncapability; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    Broadband Tax Credit Legislation\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nBroadband Internet Access Act of 2001. The convergence of computing and \ncommunications has changed the way America interacts and does business. \nIndividuals, businesses, schools, libraries, hospitals, and many \nothers, reap the benefits of networked communications more and more \neach year. However, where in the past access to low bandwidth telephone \nfacilities met our communications needs, today many people and \norganizations need the ability to transmit and receive large amounts of \ndata quickly--as part of electronic commerce, distance learning, \ntelemedicine, and even for mere access to many web sites.\n  In some areas of the country companies are building networks that \nmeet today's broadband need as fast as they can. Technology companies \nare fighting to roll out the current generation of broadband facilities \nas quickly as they can in urban and suburban areas. They are tearing up \nstreets to install fiber optics, converting cable TV facilities to \nbroadband telecom applications, developing incredible new DSL \ntechnologies that convert regular copper telephone wires into broadband \npowerhouses.\n  Other areas are not as fortunate. In rural and inner city areas \naccess to even the current generation of broadband communications is \nharder to come by. In fact, there are only a few broadband providers \noutside the prosperous areas of big cities and suburban areas \nnationwide. This is because in many cases rural areas are more \nexpensive to serve. Terrain is difficult. Populations are widely \ndispersed. Importantly, many of our current broadband technologies \ncannot serve people who live more than eighteen thousand feet from a \nphone company's central office--which is the case for most rural \nAmericans. In inner cities, companies may believe that lower household \nincome levels will not support a market for their services, so they \nchose not to invest in these communities.\n  The implications for the country if we allow this broadband disparity \nto continue are alarming. Organizations in traditional robust \ncommunications and computing regions, often located in prosperous urban \nand suburban communities, will be able to reap the rewards of a \nnetworked economy. Organizations in other areas, often in rural areas \nas in inner cities, including many areas in my State of West Virginia, \nwill suffer the consequences of being unable to take advantage of the \nastounding power of broadband networked computing.\n  Just as companies that employ technological advances are decimating \ntheir less technologically savvy competitors, businesses in \ninfrastructure-rich areas may soon decimate competitors in \ninfrastructure-poor areas. This is just as true as rural and inner city \nstudents, workers trying to gain new skills, and regular individuals \nwho want to participate in the New Economy in other ways compete \nagainst their non-rural peers. The result could be disastrous for \nAmericans who live in rural areas or in our inner cities: job loss, tax \nrevenue loss, brain drain, and business failure concentrated in their \ncommunities.\n  Denying Americans who live in rural areas and inner cities a chance \nto participate in the New Economy is also bad for the national economy. \nBusinesses will be forced to locate their operations and hire their \nemployees in urban locations that have adequate broadband \ninfrastructure, rather than in rural or inner city locations that are \notherwise more efficient due to the location of their customers or \nsuppliers, a stable or better workforce, and cheaper production \nenvironments. Additionally, without adequate infrastructure, the \nbusinesses and individuals in these communications infrastructure poor \nareas are less likely to be integrated into the national electronic \nmarketplace. Their absence would put a damper on the growth of the \ndigital economy for everyone--not just for those in rural areas.\n  Therefore, we must do everything we can to ensure that broadband \ncommunications are available to all areas of the country--rural and \ninner city as well as the prosperous urban and suburban communities. \nThe Broadband Internet Access Act of 2001 addresses this problem.\n  The Act would give companies the incentive to build current \ngeneration broadband facilities in rural areas by using a very focused \ntax credit. It would offer any company that invests in broadband \nfacilities in rural or inner city areas a ten percent tax credit over \nthe next five years. This tax credit will help fight the growing \ndisparity in technology I just described.\n  The credit is also restricted to investments needed for high-speed \nbroadband telecommunications services. This means that only powerful \nbroadband services are covered. Companies cannot claim that inferior \nservices qualify for the credit. Only facilities that can download data \nat a rate of speed of 1.5 megabytes per second, and upload data at 200 \nkilobytes per second qualify.\n  In addition, the bill provides a 20 percent tax credit for companies \nthat invest in next generation broadband services. These powerful new \nservices, that can deliver data capacities of 22 megabytes per second \ndownload and 5 megabytes per second upload will be the infrastructure \nthe new economy depends as the digital economy matures. We need to \nreward the companies who have the foresight to invest in these next \ngeneration broadband services--they will benefit the whole country.\n  The Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000 is part of the solution to \nthe critically important digital divide problem. Rural Americans and \nAmericans living in inner cities deserve the chance to participate in \nthe New Economy. Without access to broadband services they will not \nhave this chance. I hope that the Members of this body will support \nthis important bill.\n  For those who want even more details, I ask unanimous consent that \nAttachment One to this statement, titled Broadband Internet Access Tax \nCredit, be made part of the Record. This attachment is a detailed \nexplanation of the tax credit based on an analysis of the similar \nBroadband Internet Access Act of 2000, from the 106th Congress. We will \nhopefully have a more updated explanation that reflects changes to the \nbill for the 107th Congress very soon.\n  There being no objection, the attachment ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  Broadband Internet Access Tax Credit\n\n                       (New sec. 48A of the Code)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       Present law does not provide a credit for investments in \n     telecommunications infrastructure.\n\n\n                        explanation of provision\n\n       The bill provides a credit to 10 percent of the qualified \n     expenditures incurred by the taxpayer with respect to \n     qualified equipment\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\n     with which ``current generation'' broadband services are \n     delivered to subscribers in rural and underserved areas. In \n     the addition, the bill provides a credit equal to 20 percent \n     of the qualified expenditures incurred by the taxpayer with \n     respect to qualified equipment with which ``next generation'' \n     broadband services are delivered to subscribers in rural \n     areas, underserved areas, and to residential subscribers.\n       Current generation broadband services is defined as the \n     transmission of signals at a rat of at least 1.5 million bits \n     per second to the subscriber and at a rate of at least \n     200,000 bits per second from the subscriber. Next generation \n     broadband services is defined as the transmission of signals \n     at a rate of at least 22 million bits per second to the \n     subscriber and at a rate of at least 5 million bits per \n     second from the subscriber. Taxpayers will be permitted to \n     substantiate their satisfaction of the required transmission \n     rates through statistically significant test data \n     demonstrating satisfaction of the required transmission \n     rates, by providing evidence that all relevant subscribers \n     were provided with a written guarantee that the required \n     transmission rates would be satisfied, or through any other \n     reasonable method. For this purpose, the fact that certain \n     subscribers are not able to access such services at the \n     required transmission rates due to limitations in equipment \n     outside of the control of the provider, or in equipment other \n     than qualified equipment, shall not be taken into account.\n       A rural area is any census tract which is not within 10 \n     miles of any incorporated or census designated place with a \n     population of more than 25,000 and which is not within a \n     county with a population density of more than 500 people per \n     square mile. An underserved area is any census tract which is \n     located in an empowerment zone, enterprise community, renewal \n     zone or low-income community. A residential subscriber is any \n     individual who purchases broadband services to be delivered \n     to his or her dwelling.\n     Qualified expenditures\n       Qualified expenditures are those amounts otherwise \n     chargeable to the capital account with respect to the \n     purchase and installation of qualified equipment for which \n     depreciation is allowable under section 168. Qualified \n     expenditures are those that are incurred by the taxpayer \n     after December 31, 2001, and before January 1, 2006.\n       The expenditures are taken into account for purposes of \n     claiming the credit in the first taxable year in which \n     broadband service is delivered to at least 10 percent of the \n     specified type of subscribers which the qualified equipment \n     is capable of serving in an area in which the provider has \n     legal or contractual area access rights or obligations. For \n     this purpose, it is intended that the subscribers which the \n     equipment is capable of serving will be determined by the \n     least capable link in the system. For example, if a system \n     has a packet switch capable of serving 10,000 subscribers, \n     followed by a digital subscriber line access multiplexer \n     (``DSLAM'') capable of serving only 2,000 subscribers, then \n     the area which the equipment is capable of serving is the \n     area served by the 2,000 DSLAM lines.\n       Although the credit only applies with respect to qualified \n     expenditures incurred during specified periods, the fact that \n     the expenditures are not taken into account until a later \n     period will not affect the taxpayer's eligibility for the \n     credit. For example, if a taxpayer incurs qualified \n     expenditures with respect to equipment providing next \n     generation broadband services in 2004, but the taxpayer \n     does not satisfy the 10 percent subscription threshold \n     until 2005, the taxpayer will be eligible for the credit \n     in 2005 (assuming the other requirements of the bill are \n     satisfied). To substantiate their satisfaction of the 10 \n     percent subscription threshold, taxpayers will be required \n     to provide such information as is required by the \n     Secretary, which may include relevant customer date or \n     evidence of independent certification.\n       In the case of a taxpayer that incurs expenditures for \n     equipment capable of serving both subscribers in qualifying \n     areas and other areas, qualified expenditures are determined \n     by multiplying otherwise qualified expenditures by the ratio \n     of the number of potential qualifying subscribers to all \n     potential subscribers the qualified equipment would be \n     capable of serving, as determined by the least capable link \n     in the system. Taxpayers may use any reasonable method to \n     determine the relevant total potential subscriber population, \n     based on the most recently published census data. In \n     addition, for purposes of substantiating the total potential \n     subscriber population which equipment is capable of serving, \n     taxpayers will be required to provide such information as is \n     required by the Secretary, which may include manufacturer's \n     equipment ratings or evidence of independent certification.\n     Qualified equipment\n       Qualified equipment must be capable of providing broadband \n     services at any time to each subscriber who is utilizing such \n     services. It is intended that this standard would be \n     satisfied if a subscriber utilizing broadband services \n     through the equipment is able to receive the specified \n     transmission rates in at least 99 out of 100 attempts.\n       In the case of a telecommunications carrier, qualified \n     equipment is equipment that extends from the last point of \n     switching to the outside of the building in which the \n     subscriber is located. In the case of a commercial mobile \n     service carrier, qualified equipment that extends from the \n     customer side of a mobile telephone switching office to a \n     transmission/reception antenna (including the antenna) of the \n     subscriber. In the case of a cable operator or open video \n     system operator, qualified equipment is equipment that \n     extends from the customer side of the headend to the outside \n     of the building in which the subscriber is located. In the \n     case of a satellite carrier or other wireless carrier (other \n     than a telecommunications carrier), qualified equipment is \n     equipment that extends from a transmission/reception antenna \n     (including the antenna) to a transmission/reception antenna \n     on the outside of the building used by the subscriber. In \n     addition, any packet switching equipment deployed in \n     connection with other qualified equipment is qualified \n     equipment, regardless of location, provided that it is the \n     last such equipment in a series as part of transmission of a \n     signal to a subscriber or the first in a series in the \n     transmission of a signal from a subscriber. Finally, \n     multiplexing and demultiplexing equipment and other equipment \n     making associated applications deployed in connection with \n     other qualified equipment is qualified equipment only if it \n     is located between qualified packet switching equipment and \n     the subscriber's premises.\n       Although a taxpayer must incur the expenditures directly in \n     order to qualify for the credit, the taxpayer may provide the \n     requisite broadband services either directly or indirectly. \n     For example, if a partnership constructs qualified equipment \n     or otherwise incurs expenditures, but the requisite services \n     are provided by one or more of its partners, the partnership \n     will be eligible for the credit (assuming the other \n     requirements of the bill are satisfied). It is anticipated \n     that the Secretary will issue regulations or other published \n     guidance demonstrating how the requirements of the bill are \n     satisfied in such situations.\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n       The provision is effective for expenditures incurred after \n     December 31, 2001.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a bill I \nsupported last Congress along with over half of the members in this \nbody. The bill, the Broadband Internet Access Act of 2001, creates tax \nincentives for the deployment of broadband (high-speed) Internet \nservices to rural, low-income, and residential areas.\n  This bill will ensure that all Americans gain timely and equitable \naccess to the Internet over current and future generations of broadband \ncapability.\n  The legislation provides graduated tax credits to companies that \nbring qualified telecommunication capabilities to targeted areas. It \ngrants a 10-percent credit for expenditures on equipment that provide \ncurrent generation bandwidth of 1.5 million bits per second (mbps) \ndownstream and .2 mbps upstream to subscribers in rural and low-income \nareas, and a 20-percent credit for delivery of next generation 22 mbps \ndownstream and 5 mbps upstream to these customers and other residential \nsubscribers.\n  This bill has been endorsed by a number of organizations, including \nBell Atlantic, MCI/Worldcom, Corning Incorporated, the National \nTelephone Cooperative Association, the Association for Local \nTelecommunications Services, the United States Distance Learning \nAssociation, and the Imaging Science and Information Systems Center at \nGeorgetown University Medical Center.\n  Mr. President, in a few short years, the Internet has grown \nexponentially to become a mass medium used daily by over 100 million \npeople worldwide. The explosion of information technology has created \nopportunities undreamed of by previous generations. In my home state of \nMontana, companies such as Healthdirectory.com and Vanns.com are taking \nadvantage of the global markets made possible by the stunning reach of \nthe Internet.\n  The pace of broadband deployment to rural America must be accelerated \nfor electronic commerce to meet its full potential however. Broadband \naccess is as important to our small businesses in Montana as water is \nto agribusiness.\n  I am aware of all of the recent discussion regarding the ``digital \ndivide'' and I am very concerned that the pace of broadband deployment \nis greater in urban than rural areas. However, there is some positive \nand exciting news on this front as well. The reality on the ground \nshows that some of the ``gloom and doom'' scenarios are far from the \ncase. By pooling their limited resources, Montana's independent and \ncooperative telephone companies are doing great things. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 89. A bill to enhance the illegal narcotics control activities of \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n[[Page S347]]\n\n                     Drug-Free America Act of 2001\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the ``Drug-\nFree America Act of 2001.'' As many of my colleagues know, drug use by \nthe children in our country continues to be a serious concern of mine. \nThe ``Drug-Free America Act'' offers a series of initiatives that I \nbelieve will support efforts across the board to discourage drug use at \nall levels in America.\n  Mr. President, I've said it before, but it bears repeating. Somewhere \nalong the way, we lost the clear, consistent message that the only \nproper response to drugs is to say an emphatic ``no.'' We're supposed \nto be more sophisticated. More tolerant. More willing to listen to \nnotions of making dangerous drugs more available. What all of this \n``more'' has meant is that we have more young people using more drugs \nat younger ages. Today we are competing with a drug culture that tells \nour children ``drugs are cool,'' that ``drug are safe.'' Drugs are \nbeing more aggressively marketed, and are presented as being ``user \nfriendly''.\n  We cannot remain silent. I look forward with working with President \nBush in providing the resources and message necessary to let everyone \nknow that drugs are bad, that drugs will damage your brain and your \nbody, and that drug use will hurt you, your friends, your family, your \ncommunity, and your future.\n  The drug problem confronting our country is not static. \nMethamphetamine, Ecstasy, and other new drugs pose different challenges \nand require different solutions than the heroin and cocaine epidemics. \nTreatment, education, prevention, and law enforcement efforts must all \nbe strengthened and updated. The National Institutes of Health have \nsome exciting research efforts underway that could really make a \ndifference as we try to reclaim the lives of our fellow citizens who \nhave been seduced by the false pleasures of drug use. There are several \neducation and prevention initiatives that we can strengthen to support \nthe educators, counselors, community activists, and parents who work \nhard every day to keep our children and our communities drug free. We \nshould support ongoing efforts by the National Guard Counterdrug \nDirectorate, and re-authorize the U.S. Customs Service, our Nation's \noldest law enforcement agency. We need to believe in our future. I \nbelieve that by working together, we can, we will make a difference. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in working to address this important \nproblem before it becomes any worse.\n  Left unanswered, we will see another generation of young lives \nblighted. We will see families torn up by a widening circle of hurt \nfrom drug use. We saw what a similar wave of drug use did to us and to \na generation of young people in the 1960s and 1970s. We are smarter \nnow, we have better tools and better knowledge. We cannot afford to go \nthrough this again. I hope we can begin today to renew our commitment \nto a drug free future for our young people. I have said this in \nnumerous town meetings, and I now say it here, ``working together, we \ncan make a difference.''\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Drug-Free America \nAct, and look forward to working with my colleagues on these important \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. President, I send this bill to the desk, and request that it be \nprinted in the appropriate place in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 89\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Illegal drugs cost America more than $70,000,000,000 \n     annually. These costs include lost productivity, as well as \n     money spent for drug treatment, illnesses related to drug \n     use, crime prevention and enforcement, and welfare.\n       (2) Federal, State, and local governments spend more than \n     $30,000,000,000 annually to combat illegal drugs and the \n     consequences of illegal drugs.\n       (3) The estimated total expenditure by Americans on illicit \n     drugs in 1993 was $48,700,000,000. The vast majority of these \n     illegal drugs are produced overseas and then smuggled into \n     the United States by major criminal organizations.\n       (4) The estimated worldwide potential of coca net \n     production in 1996 was 303,600 metric tons, and in the same \n     year, the worldwide coca cultivation was 209,700 hectares.\n       (5) The production of opium has also been increasing for at \n     least the past 10 years, and reached a new high in 1996 of \n     4,212 metric tons. Production throughout the world has led to \n     an increase in the heroin addict population of the United \n     States, bringing it to a new high of more than 600,000 \n     people.\n       (6) Money laundering constitutes a serious challenge to the \n     maintenance of law and order throughout the hemisphere and \n     poses a threat to stability, reliability, and the integrity \n     of governments, financial systems, and commerce.\n       (7) Money laundering of illegal drug profits is an integral \n     part of the drug trafficking process, creating an obstacle in \n     fighting drugs. It is estimated that $100,000,000,000 to \n     $300,000,000,000 in United States currency is laundered each \n     year.\n       (8) Certification pursuant to the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 is an essential tool in United States foreign policy. \n     Through the certification process there has been improvement \n     in cooperation levels that demonstrates the importance of \n     holding countries responsible for being major producing, \n     transit, and money laundering countries.\n       (9) The major criminal organizations that traffic in \n     illegal narcotics are international in scope and extremely \n     flexible in their activities, and are becoming increasingly \n     sophisticated in their methods of operation. Their influence \n     reaches to the highest levels of some foreign governments.\n\n[[Page S348]]\n\n       (10) The threat of corruption at all levels of government \n     remains a significant concern when dealing with many nations. \n     Explosive corruption in a number of countries is undermining \n     domestic processes and the rule of law. United States \n     assistance and the pressure of decertification have \n     encouraged many countries to take corruption seriously.\n       (11) The production and trafficking of illegal narcotics \n     presents a threat to United States interests, both domestic \n     and foreign. Drugs are a corrosive influence on our children, \n     our values, and our Government.\n\n                   TITLE I--DOMESTIC DEMAND REDUCTION\n\n     SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Domestic Narcotic Demand \n     Reduction Act of 2001''.\n\n                Subtitle A--Drug Treatment and Research\n\n     SEC. 111.

ADOLESCENT THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY TREATMENT \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Adolescent Therapeutic Community Treatment Programs Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Of the adolescents that currently need substance abuse \n     treatment services, only 20 percent of such adolescents are \n     receiving such services.\n       (2) Providing alcohol and drug treatment services reduces \n     health care, welfare, and criminal justice costs.\n       (3) Studies have found that completion of substance abuse \n     treatment services produces sustained reductions in drug use, \n     welfare dependency, crime, and unemployment.\n       (4) The National Institute of Justice Arrestee Drug Abuse \n     Monitoring drug testing program found that more than half of \n     juvenile male arrestees tested positive for at least 1 drug \n     in 1998.\n       (5) The 1999 Monitoring the Future study showed that more \n     than half of the teenagers in the United States have tried an \n     illicit drug by the time such teenagers finish high school, \n     and more than 28 percent of such teenagers have tried an \n     illicit drug by the time such teenagers are in eighth grade.\n       (6) According to the 1999 National Household Survey on Drug \n     Abuse, the average age of new heroin users has dropped from \n     26.0 years of age in 1992 to 21.3 years of age in 1998.\n       (7) Studies have shown that intervention at an early stage \n     of addiction is essential in stopping an increasingly \n     frequent drug user from becoming an addict. Whether \n     voluntarily or through legal or parental pressure, the sooner \n     a drug user enters into a well-designed treatment program, \n     the more likely such treatment is to be effective. Voluntary \n     participation in substance abuse programs is not necessary in \n     order to successfully treat a drug user.\n       (c) Program Authorized.--The Secretary shall award \n     competitive grants to treatment providers who administer \n     treatment programs to enable such providers to establish \n     adolescent residential substance abuse treatment programs \n     that provide services for individuals who are between the \n     ages of 14 and 21.\n       (d) Preference.--In awarding grants under subsection (c), \n     the Secretary shall consider the geographic location of each \n     treatment provider and give preference to such treatment \n     providers that are geographically located in such a manner as \n     to provide services to addicts from non-metropolitan areas.\n       (e) Duration of Grants.--For awards made under subsection \n     (c), the period during which payments are made may not exceed \n     5 years.\n       (f) Restrictions.--A treatment provider receiving a grant \n     under subsection (c) shall not use any amount of the grant \n     under this section for land acquisition or a construction \n     project.\n       (g) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to preclude qualifying faith-based treatment \n     providers from receiving a grant under subsection (c).\n       (h) Application.--A treatment provider that desires a grant \n     under subsection (c) shall submit an application to the \n     Secretary at such time, in such manner, and containing such \n     information as the Secretary may require.\n       (i) Use of Funds.--A treatment provider that receives a \n     grant under subsection (c) shall use funds received under \n     such grant to provide substance abuse services for \n     adolescents, including--\n       (1) a thorough psychosocial assessment;\n       (2) individual treatment planning;\n       (3) a strong education component integral to the treatment \n     regimen;\n       (4) life skills training;\n       (5) individual and group counseling;\n       (6) family services;\n       (7) daily work responsibilities; and\n       (8) community-based aftercare, providing 6 months of \n     treatment following discharge from a residential facility.\n       (j) Treatment Type.--The Therapeutic Community model shall \n     be used as a basis for all adolescent residential substance \n     abuse treatment programs established under this section, \n     which shall be characterized by--\n       (1) the self-help dynamic, requiring youth to participate \n     actively in their own treatment;\n       (2) the role of mutual support and the therapeutic \n     importance of the peer therapy group;\n       (3) a strong focus on family involvement and family \n     strengthening;\n       (4) a clearly articulated value system emphasizing both \n     individual responsibility and responsibility for the \n     community; and\n       (5) an emphasis on development of positive social skills.\n       (k) Report by Provider.--Not later than 1 year after \n     receiving a grant under this section, and annually \n     thereafter, a treatment provider shall prepare and submit to \n     the Secretary a report describing the services provided \n     pursuant to this section.\n       (l) Report by Secretary.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 3 months after receiving \n     all reports by providers under subsection (k), and annually \n     thereafter, the Secretary shall prepare and submit a report \n     containing information described in paragraph (2) to--\n       (A) the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \n     of the Senate;\n       (B) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;\n       (C) the United States Senate Caucus on International \n     Narcotics Control;\n       (D) the Committee on Commerce of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (E) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (F) the Committee on Government Reform of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) Content.--The report described in paragraph (1) shall--\n       (A) outline the services provided by providers pursuant to \n     this section;\n       (B) evaluate the effectiveness of such services;\n       (C) identify the geographic distribution of all treatment \n     centers provided pursuant to this section, and evaluate the \n     accessibility of such centers for addicts from rural areas \n     and small towns; and\n       (D) make recommendations to improve the programs carried \n     out pursuant to this section.\n       (m) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Adolescent residential substance abuse treatment \n     program.--The term ``adolescent residential substance abuse \n     treatment program'' means a program that provides a regimen \n     of individual and group activities, lasting ideally not less \n     than 12 months, in a community-based residential facility \n     that provides comprehensive services tailored to meet the \n     needs of adolescents and designed to return youth to their \n     families in order that such youth may become capable of \n     enjoying and supporting positive, productive, drug-free \n     lives.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services.\n       (3) Therapeutic community.--The term ``Therapeutic \n     Community'' means a highly structured residential treatment \n     facility that--\n       (A) employs a treatment methodology;\n       (B) relies on self-help methods and group process, a view \n     of drug abuse as a disorder affecting the whole person, and a \n     comprehensive approach to recovery;\n       (C) maintains a strong educational component; and\n       (D) carries out activities that are designed to help youths \n     address alcohol or other drug abuse issues and learn to act \n     in their own best interests, as well as in the best interests \n     of their peers and families.\n       (n) Authorization of appropriations.--There are authorized \n     be appropriated to carry out this section--\n       (1) $21,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       (2) $42,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       (3) $63,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       (4) $84,000,000 for fiscal year 2005; and\n       (5) $105,000,000 for fiscal year 2006.\n\n     SEC. 114. RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROGRAM IN FEDERAL PRISONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In April 2000, there were more than 140,000 inmates in \n     the Federal prison system.\n       (2) In April 2000, nearly 30 percent of Federal inmates \n     were serving sentences ranging between 5 and 10 years, and \n     just over 58 percent of such inmates, or 61,547 persons, were \n     serving time for a drug related offense.\n       (3) A March 2000 report by the Office of National Drug \n     Control Policy reported that in 1999 illicit drug users--\n       (A) were 16 times more likely than non-users to be arrested \n     and booked for larceny or theft;\n       (B) were more than 14 times more likely to be arrested and \n     booked for driving under the influence, drunkenness, and \n     liquor law violations; and\n       (C) were more than 9 times more likely to be arrested and \n     booked for assault.\n       (4) According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \n     Uniform Crime Reports, drugs\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\n     are one of the main factors leading to the total number of \n     all homicides.\n       (5) In a 1999 study, the Bureau of Prisons reported that--\n       (A) offenders who completed a residential drug abuse \n     treatment program and had been released for a minimum of 6 \n     months were less likely to be arrested and use illegal drugs \n     than inmates who did not participate in such program; and\n       (B) only 3.3 percent of such offenders who completed such \n     program were likely to be arrested within the first 6 months \n     that such offenders were in the community.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to increase \n     residential drug abuse treatment units in Federal prisons to \n     reduce the number of criminal offenders who are rearrested or \n     who use illegal drugs after release from prison.\n       (c) Program Authorized.--The Director of the Federal Bureau \n     of Prisons shall use funds made available under this section \n     to establish residential drug abuse treatment units in \n     Federal prisons.\n       (d) Requirements.--A residential drug abuse treatment unit \n     that receives funds under this section shall--\n       (1) maintain not less than 1,000 hours of activities during \n     a 1-year period;\n       (2) maintain a staff of such unit in which there is not \n     more than 1 staff member per 12 inmates;\n       (3) provide intensive treatment activities for all inmates \n     in the residential drug treatment program, including \n     individual and group therapy, specialty seminars, self \n     improvement group counseling, and education, work skills \n     training, and other programs; and\n       (4) have frequent, regular, and random drug testing for \n     inmates and staff.\n       (e) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $2,500,000 for \n     each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003.\n\n     SEC. 115. COUNTER-DRUG TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT CENTER.\n\n       (a) Study of Heroin Use in the United States.--\n       (1) In general.--Using amounts appropriated pursuant to the \n     authorization of appropriations in subsection (c)(1), the \n     Counter-Drug Technology Assessment Center (CTAC) of the \n     Office of National Drug Control Policy shall carry out a \n     study on the number of individuals in the United States who \n     engaged in sustained use of heroin.\n       (2) Basis for study.--The study under paragraph (1) shall \n     be based on the study entitled ``A Plan for Estimated the \n     Number of `Hardcore' Drug Users in the United States''.\n       (b) Counter-Drug Technology Initiatives.--Using amounts \n     appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations \n     in subsection (c)(2), the Counter-Drug Technology Assessment \n     Center of the Office of National Drug Control Policy shall--\n       (1) conduct outreach for purposes of reducing duplication \n     of activities among Federal, State, and local entities \n     regarding counterdrug technologies;\n       (2) develop and implement mechanisms for monitoring and \n     coordinating such activities; and\n       (3) assist in the transfer of such technologies to State \n     and local law enforcement agencies under the Technology \n     Transfer Program.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is hereby \n     authorized to be appropriated for the Counter-Drug Technology \n     Assessment Center of the Office of National Drug Control \n     Policy for fiscal year 2002 the following:\n       (1) $15,000,000 for purposes of the study required by \n     subsection (a).\n       (2) $15,000,000 for purposes of activities under subsection \n     (b).\n\n     SEC. 116.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A child that has a positive relationship with both \n     parents is less likely to use illegal drugs.\n       (2) Family activities, such as eating dinners together and \n     spending quality time together, can reduce the risk that a \n     child engaged by such activities will use illegal drugs.\n       (3) Most parents today work and have little opportunity to \n     spend quality time with their children.\n       (4) Many families are headed by single parents who work all \n     day and do not have enough time to spend with their children.\n       (5) The 1999 Parent's Resource Institute for Drug Education \n     study (referred to in this section as the ``PRIDE study'') \n     reported that more than 4,000,000 students who are between \n     the ages 11 and 18 used drugs regularly, and more than \n     1,000,000 of such students used an illegal drug every day.\n       (6) The PRIDE study found that students with parents who \n     talked to them about drug use had a 37 percent lower drug use \n     rate than students with parents who did not talk to them \n     about drug use.\n       (7) The 1999 Monitoring the Future study found that nearly \n     55 percent of high school seniors in the United States had \n     used an illicit drug in the past month.\n       (8) A 1999 Mellman Group study found that--\n       (A) 56 percent of the population in the United States \n     believed that drug use was increasing in 1999;\n       (B) 92 percent of the population viewed illegal drug use as \n     a serious problem in the United States; and\n       (C) 73 percent of the population viewed illegal drug use as \n     a serious problem in their communities.\n\n     SEC. 122.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Drug-Free Families Act \n     of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 132. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that in \n     1962, less than 1 percent of the nation's adolescents had \n     ever tried an illicit drug. By 1979, drug use among young \n     people had escalated to the highest levels in history: 34 \n     percent of adolescents (ages 12-17), 65 percent of high \n     school seniors (age 18), and 70 percent of young adults (ages \n     18-25) had used an illicit drug in their lifetime.\n       (2) Drug use among young people was not confined to initial \n     trials. By 1979, 16 percent of adolescents, 39 percent of \n     high school seniors, and 38 percent of young adults had used \n     an illicit drug in the past month. Moreover, 1 in 9 high \n     school seniors used marijuana daily.\n       (3) In 1979, the year the largest number of seniors used \n     marijuana, their belief that marijuana could hurt them was at \n     its lowest (35 percent) since surveys have tracked these \n     measures.\n       (4) Three forces appeared to be driving this escalation in \n     drug use among children and young adults. Between 1972 and \n     1978, a nationwide political campaign conducted by drug \n     legalization advocates persuaded 11 State legislatures to \n     ``decriminalize'' marijuana. (Many of those States have \n     subsequently ``recriminalized'' the drug.) Such legislative \n     action reinforced advocates' assertion that marijuana was \n     ``relatively harmless.''\n       (5) The decriminalization effort gave rise to the emergence \n     of ``head shops'' (shops for ``heads,'' or drug users--``coke \n     heads,'' ``pot heads,'' ``acid heads,'' etc.) which sold drug \n     paraphernalia--an array of toys, implements, and \n     instructional pamphlets and booklets to enhance the use of \n     illicit drugs. Some 30,000 such shops were estimated to be \n     doing business throughout the nation by 1978.\n       (6) In the absence of Federal funding for drug education \n     then, most of the drug education materials that were \n     available proclaimed that few illicit drugs were addictive \n     and most were ``less harmful'' than alcohol and tobacco and \n     therefore taught young people how to use marijuana, cocaine, \n     and other illicit drugs ``responsibly''.\n       (7) Between 1977 and 1980, 3 national parent drug-\n     prevention organizations--National Families in Action, PRIDE, \n     and the National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth \n     (now called the National Family Partnership)--emerged to help \n     concerned parents form some 4,000 local parent prevention \n     groups across the nation to reverse all of these trends in \n     order to prevent children from using drugs. Their work \n     created what has come to be known as the parent drug-\n     prevention movement, or more simply, the parent movement. \n     This movement set 3 goals: to prevent the use of any illegal \n     drug, to persuade those who had started using drugs to stop, \n     and to obtain treatment for\n\n[[Page S351]]\n\n     those who had become addicted so that they could return to \n     drug-free lives.\n       (8) The parent movement pursued a number of objectives to \n     achieve these goals. First, it helped parents educate \n     themselves about the harmful effects of drugs, teach that \n     information to their children, communicate that they expected \n     their children not to use drugs, and establish consequences \n     if children failed to meet that expectation. Second, it \n     helped parents form groups with other parents to set common \n     age-appropriate social and behavioral guidelines to protect \n     their children from exposure to drugs. Third, it encouraged \n     parents to insist that their communities reinforce parents' \n     commitment to protect children from drug use.\n       (9) The parent movement stopped further efforts to \n     decriminalize marijuana, both in the States and at the \n     Federal level.\n       (10) The parent movement worked for laws to ban the sale of \n     drug paraphernalia. If drugs were illegal, it made no sense \n     to condone the sale of toys and implements to enhance the use \n     of illegal drugs, particularly when those products targeted \n     children. As town, cities, counties, and States passed anti-\n     paraphernalia laws, drug legalization organizations \n     challenged their Constitutionality in Federal courts until \n     the early 1980's, when the United States Supreme Court upheld \n     Nebraska's law and established the right of communities to \n     ban the sale of drug paraphernalia.\n       (11) The parent movement insisted that drug-education \n     materials convey a strong no-use message in compliance with \n     both the law and with medical and scientific information that \n     demonstrates that drugs are harmful, particularly to young \n     people.\n       (12) The parent movement encouraged others in society to \n     join the drug prevention effort and many did, from First Lady \n     Nancy Reagan to the entertainment industry, the business \n     community, the media, the medical community, the educational \n     community, the criminal justice community, the faith \n     community, and local, State, and national political leaders.\n       (13) The parent movement helped to cause drug use among \n     young people to peak in 1979. As its efforts continued \n     throughout the next decade, and as others joined parents to \n     expand the drug-prevention movement, between 1979 and 1992 \n     these collaborative prevention efforts contributed to \n     reducing monthly illicit drug use by two-thirds among \n     adolescents and young adults and reduced daily marijuana use \n     among high-school seniors from 10.7 percent to 1.9 percent. \n     Concurrently, both the parent movement and the larger \n     prevention movement that evolved throughout the 1980's, \n     working together, increased high school seniors' belief that \n     marijuana could hurt them, from 35 percent in 1979 to 79 \n     percent in 1991.\n       (14) Unfortunately, as drug use declined, most of the 4,000 \n     volunteer parents groups that contributed to the reduction in \n     drug use disbanded, having accomplished the job they set out \n     to do. But the absence of active parent groups left a vacuum \n     that was soon filled by a revitalized drug-legalization \n     movement. Proponents began advocating for the legalization of \n     marijuana for medicine, the legalization of all Schedule I \n     drugs for medicine, the legalization of hemp for medicinal, \n     industrial and recreational use, and a variety of other \n     proposals, all designed to ultimately attack, weaken, and \n     eventually repeal the nation's drug laws.\n       (15) Furthermore, legalization proponents are also \n     beginning to advocate for treatment that maintains addicts on \n     the drugs to which they are addicted (heroin maintenance for \n     heroin addicts, controlled drinking for alcoholics, etc.), \n     for teaching school children to use drugs ``responsibly,'' \n     and for other measures similar to those that produced the \n     drug epidemic among young people in the 1970's.\n       (16) During the 1990's, the message embodied in all of this \n     activity has once again driven down young people's belief \n     that drugs can hurt them. As a result, the reductions in drug \n     use that occurred over 13 years reversed in 1992, and \n     adolescent drug use has more than doubled.\n       (17) In 1970, 40.5 percent of women in the workforce were \n     married. By 1997, that percentage has climbed to 61.6 \n     percent, meaning fewer parents have time to volunteer. Many \n     families are headed by single parents. In some families no \n     parents are available, and grandparents, aunts, uncles, or \n     foster parents are raising the family's children.\n       (18) Recognizing that these challenges make it much more \n     difficult to reach parents today, several national parent and \n     family drug-prevention organizations have formed the Parent \n     Collaboration to address these issues in order to build a new \n     parent and family movement to prevent drug use among \n     children.\n       (19) Motivating parents and parent groups to coordinate \n     with local community anti-drug coalitions is a key goal of \n     the Parent Collaboration, as well as coordinating parent and \n     family drug-prevention efforts with Federal, State, and local \n     governmental and private agencies and political, business, \n     medical and scientific, educational, criminal justice, \n     religious, and media and entertainment industry leaders.\n\n     SEC. 133.

TETHERED AEROSTAT RADAR SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Drug traffickers exploit openings in the United States \n     detection and monitoring network. Tethered Aerostat Radar \n     Systems (TARS) are a critical element in closing potential \n     routes for drug smuggling.\n       (2) The Tethered Aerostat Radar System, a network of 11 \n     radar sites, serves as an important component of the \n     counterdrug mission of the United States by providing low \n     altitude radar surveillance, detection, and monitoring \n     capabilities to military and law enforcement entities. \n     Failure to operate the TARS system results in a degraded \n     counterdrug capability for the United States.\n       (3) Most of the illicit drugs consumed in the United States \n     enter the country over the Southwest, Gulf of Mexico, or \n     Florida borders. The United States will not have complete \n     coastal radar coverage to combat counterdrug threats unless \n     the entire Tethered Aerostat Radar System network is \n     standardized and maintained, including the Tethered Aerostat \n     Radar System sites in Matagorda, Texas, Morgan City, \n     Louisiana, and Horseshoe Beach, Florida.\n       (4) The Department of Defense, the lead Federal agency for \n     detection and monitoring, is responsible for fulfilling the \n     surveillance, detection, and monitoring mission in support of \n     counterdrug operations.\n       (5) The Department of Defense's current budget allocation \n     for the Tethered Aerostat Radar System is inadequate. At \n     present, 3 sites are not in operation because of the \n     expiration of their life cycle.\n       (b) Responsibility for Tethered Aerostat Radar System.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall take all necessary actions to \n     ensure that the 11 sites that comprise the Tethered Aerostat \n     Radar System network are placed under the policy direction of \n     the Drug Enforcement Policy and Support office of the \n     Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low \n     Intensity Conflict.\n       (c) Limitation on Transfer.--The Secretary shall cease all \n     activities relating to the transfer of responsibility for the \n     Tethered Aerostat Radar System program to any entity outside \n     the Department of Defense.\n       (d) Report on Status.--(1) The Secretary shall annually \n     submit to the congressional defense committees and the United \n     States Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control a \n     report on the status of the Tethered Aerostat Radar System \n     network.\n       (2) In this subsection, the term ``congressional defense \n     committees'' means the following:\n       (A) The Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations of \n     the Senate.\n       (B) The Committees on Armed Services and Appropriations of \n     the House of Representatives.\n       (e) Authorization.--There is hereby authorized to be \n     appropriated for the requirements of the 11-site network of \n     the Tethered Aerostat Radar System, including standardization \n     of the sites located along the Gulf of Mexico of the United \n     States, amounts as follows:\n       (1) For fiscal year 2002, $76,000,000.\n       (2) For fiscal year 2003, $48,500,000.\n       (2) For fiscal year 2004, $40,500,000.\n       (3) For fiscal year 2005, $44,700,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 90. A bill authorizing funding for nanoscale science and \nengineering research and development at the Department of Energy for \nfiscal years 2002 through 2006; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                    NANOSCIENCE AND NANOENGINEERING\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce a bill \nauthorizing the Secretary of Energy to provide for a long term \ncommitment in its Office of Science to the area of nanoscience and \nnanoengineering. This new area is of fundamental importance for \nmaintaining our global economic leadership in energy technology as well \nin areas such as microchip design, space and transportation, medicines \nand biomedical devices. The fields of nanoscience and nanoengineering \nas so new and broad in their reach that no one industry can support \nthem. They are a perfect example how we in Congress can make a \ndifference to support our nation's technological leadership, a key \nelement of the 21st century global economy.\n  The fields of nanoscience and engineering encompass the ability to \ncreate new states of matter by prepositioning the atoms that make up \ntheir structure. The physical features that nanoscale R will develop \nare on the order of about 10 nanometers or 1000 times smaller than the \ndiameter of a human hair. What we are talking about is making materials \nand devices not be miniaturization, which is a top down approach. \nNanoscience is the bottom up fabrication of materials, atom by atom. \nWhen you build materials at this level, amazing things begin to happen. \nWe are talking about microchips whose features will shrink by a factor \nof 100 below where industry projects they will be in the year 2010. \nThese chip features will lead to radical breakthroughs in\n\n[[Page S356]]\n\nspeed, cost and density of information storage. In the field of \nmedicine and health, we are talking about drugs whose routes of \ndelivery are literally at the molecular level. It will be possible to \ncustom build proteins and other biological materials for future \nbiomedical devices. In the field of energy efficiency, batteries and \nfuel cells can be built with storage capacities far exceeding our \ncurrent state of the art. In the transportation industry, it will be \npossible to make ultra strong and light materials reducing the weight \nin airplanes, cars and space vehicles. All these breakthroughs in the \ndiverse industries I have discussed will keep the United States' as a \nglobal leader in the 21st century economy.\n  The Department of Energy and its Office of Science are uniquely \nsuited to support this critical research. The Office of Science has \nbeen at the forefront of conducting nanotechnology research for the \npast decade through its broad array of materials, physics, chemistry \nand biology programs. This authorization bill will carry forth four \nbroad objectives of the Office of Science's existing nanotechnology \neffort, (1) attain a fundamental understanding of nanoscale phenomena, \n(2) achieve the ability to design bulk materials with desired \nproperties using nanoscale manipulation, (3) study how living organisms \nproduce materials naturally by arranging their atomic structure and \nimplement it into the design process for nanomaterials, (4) develop \nexperimental and computer tools with a national infrastructure to carry \nout nanoscience. Let me briefly comment on the fourth area in this \nlist. The Office of Science is the nation's leader in developing and \nmanaging national user facilities across the broad range of physical \nsciences. It would be a natural progression for the Office of Science \nto develop similar user facilities to advance nanoscience. These \nfacilities, located across the United States, will contain unique \nequipment and computers which will be accessible to individuals as well \nas multi-disciplinary teams. In the past, Office of Science national \nuser facilities have served as crossing points between the transition \nfrom fundamental science to industrial capability. I expect that these \nnanoscience user facilities will serve as a similar transition point \nfrom long term fundamental research into applied industrial know-how. \nAccordingly, in this authorization bill I have allotted portions of the \nyearly budget towards developing these unique user facilities.\n  This bill is an important first step in a combined national \nnanoscience effort which will help to maintain the technological edge \nof our U.S. industry. I encourage my House colleagues in the Science \nCommittee to also consider this bill with the possibility of joint \nhearings so that we may be enlightened on nanoscience's full potential. \nI also hope that the other federal R agencies will make similar \ncommitments in their areas of expertise. Maintaining this edge, by \npromoting these long term and high risk investigations is something \nwhich we cannot expect in the short time frame world of today's \nindustry. It is critical that our U.S. government step into this void, \nparticularly in the area of nanoscience, and provide the necessary \nintellectual capital to propel our national economy as a leader in the \n21st century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      By Mr. Gramm (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Domenici, Mr. Kyl, Mr. McCain, and Mrs.  Boxer):\n  S. 92. A bill to authorize appropriations for the United States \nCustoms Service for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                       PROTECTION OF U.S. BORDERS\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Hutchison, Bingaman, \nDomenici, Kyl, McCain, and Boxer, I am introducing legislation today \nwhich will authorize the United States Customs Service to acquire the \nnecessary personnel and technology to reduce delays at our border \ncrossings with Mexico and Canada to no more than 20 minutes, while \nstrengthening our commitment to interdict illegal narcotics and other \ncontraband.\n  This bill represents the progress that we made in this regard in the \nlast Congress, and it builds on efforts that we first initiated in the \n105th Congress. This legislation passed the Senate unanimously on \nAugust 5, 1999, and a similar bill passed the House of Representatives \non May 25, 1999, by a vote of 410-2. In addition to the resources \ndedicated to our nation's land borders, this bill also incorporates the \nefforts of Senators Grassley and Graham in adding resources for \ninterdiction efforts in the air and along our coastline, provisions \nthat were passed by the Senate in last year's bill.\n  I am very concerned about the impact of narcotics trafficking on \nTexas and the nation and have worked closely with federal and state law \nenforcement officials to identify and secure the necessary resources to \nbattle the onslaught of illegal drugs. At the same time, however, our \ncurrent enforcement strategy is burdened by insufficient staffing, a \ngross underuse of vital interdiction technology, and is effectively \nclosing the door to legitimate trade.\n  At a time when NAFTA and the expanding world marketplace are making \nit possible for us to create more commerce, freedom and opportunity for \npeople on both sides of the border, it is important that we eliminate \nthe border crossing delays that are stifling these goals. In order for \nall Americans to fully enjoy the benefits of growing trade with Mexico \nand Canada, we must ensure that the Customs Service has the resources \nnecessary to accomplish its mission. Customs inspections should not be \nobstacles to legitimate trade and commerce. Customs staffing needs to \nbe increased significantly to facilitate the flow of substantially \nincreased traffic on both the Southwestern and Northern borders, and \nthese additional personnel need the modern technology that will allow \nthem to inspect more cargo, more efficiently. The practical effect of \nthese increases will be to open all the existing primary inspection \nlanes where congestion is a problem during peak hours and to enhance \ninvestigative capabilities on the Southwest border.\n  Long traffic lines at our international crossings are \ncounterproductive to improving our trade relationship with Mexico and \nCanada. This bill is designed to shorten those lines and promote \nlegitimate commerce, while providing the customs Service with the means \nnecessary to tackle the drug trafficking operations that are now \nrampant along the 1,200-mile border that my State shares with Mexico. I \nwill be speaking further to my colleagues about this initiative and \nurge their support for this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 93. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nrequire disclosure of certain disbursements made for electioneering \ncommunications, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n                            campaign reform\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill along with my \nfriend and colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, to ensure that we \nwill have balanced, comprehensive campaign finance reform that doesn't \nclose one loophole while leaving another open. It is a bipartisan \napproach to a burgeoning segment of undisclosed and unregulated \ncampaign activity that will only get worse if left unchecked.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am offering is based on a provision this \nbody added to the McCain-Feingold bill three years ago, and a bill we \nintroduced in the 106th Congress. With that amendment, the Senate \nfinally went on record as having a majority in support of campaign \nfinance reform. In fact, 53 senators cast a vote supporting the \ncombined approach of a soft money ban and a sound, constitutional \napproach to addressing a veritable explosion in unregulated, so-called \n``issue ads''.\n  Senator Jeffords and I crafted this measure because we wanted \ncampaign finance reform; we wanted a bill that represented the best \npossible policy; and we wanted a package that could bridge the \npolitical gap that had opened between supporters and opponents.\n  On the one hand, we had Republicans concerned that McCain-Feingold, \nas it stood, might not have done enough to focus on the use of the \nunion dues for political purposes. On the other hand, we had Democrats \nwho didn't want unions signaled out and wanted corporate money to be \naddressed as well.\n\n[[Page S357]]\n\n  That's the context in which we set out to carefully construct a \nmeasure that would withstand constitutional scrutiny, address some of \nthe most egregious abuses, and focus on areas where we know the Supreme \nCourt has already allowed us to go--disclosure, and a prohibition on \nunion and corporation money for electioneering. Indeed, the compromise \nlanguage eventually adopted was supported by groups like Common Cause \nand Public Citizen, and by the bill's sponsors themselves.\n  I would also like to enter into the record a portion of a March 1, \n1998 Washington Post editorial that said,'' The (Snowe-Jeffords) \namendment was a reminder of how good a bill might be in reach if only \nthere were the political will, and willing leadership, to write it.'' \nThe editorial went on to say that ``that's the sort of compromise that \nthe legislative process at its best produces.''\n  I am pleased that a provision based directly on that amendment is now \nincluded in the McCain-Feingold bill being introduced today, and of \nwhich I am an original cosponsor. I think the provision strengthens the \nMcCain-Feingold bill in terms of providing balance and more \ncomprehensive approach to reform.\n  Mr. President, I have stood on the Senate floor and spoken of the \nburgeoning problem this bill seeks to address. And I have said that, if \nwe do nothing, the situation will only get worse. Well, it has gotten \nworse, and let me just take a moment before describing what the bill \nwill do to detail why this bill is necessary in the first place.\n\n  What I'm talking about here are broadcast advertisements the sole \npurpose of which is to influence federal elections, but that require no \ndisclosure and have none of the restrictions that for decades have been \nplaced on other forms of campaigning. These are broadcast ads that \nmasquerade as informational or educational, but are really ``stealth \nadvocacy'' ads for or against candidates.\n  According to estimates by the Annenberg Public Policy center which \nhas been extensively studying this trend, in the 2000 elections over \n$400 million was spent on these so-called ``issue ads''--many of which \nare blatant attempts to influence federal elections, and everyone knows \nit. And that number--which is four times what was estimated for the \nlast presidential election cycle, I might add, may be just the tip of \nthe iceberg. Because we simply don't know all the money that's being \nspent.\n  So how do we address the problem?\n  The Snowe-Jeffords approach is simple and straightforward. First, we \nrequire disclosure on all groups and individuals running broadcast ads \nwithin 30 days of a primary and 60 days of any election that mention \nthe name of a federal candidate. And second, a ban on the use of union \nor corporate treasury money to pay for these ads.\n  That's what this boils down to, Mr. President. Disclosure, \ndisclosure, disclosure. In fact, nothing in this bill prevents anyone \nfrom running any ads at any time saying anything they want.\n  All we say is, if you spend more than $10,000 per year on these \nbroadcast ads you can't use union or corporation money. That's the only \nban on anything in this bill. And we require you to disclose who is \nbankrolling the ads if they give $500 or more.\n  We developed this approach in consultation with noted constitutional \nscholars and reformers such as Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise \nInstitute Joshua Rosenkrantz, Director of the Brennan Center for \nJustice at NYU, and Daniel Ortiz, John Allan Love Professor of Law at \nthe University of Virginia School of Law. The bill is narrowly and \ncarefully crafted, and based on the precept that the Supreme Court has \nmade clear that, for constitutional purposes, campaigning--which make \nno mistake, these ads do--is different from other speech.\n  Corporations have been banned from direct involvement in campaigns \nsince the Tillman Act of 1907--unions were first addressed in the \nSmith-Connally Act of 1943 and the prohibition was finally made \npermanent in 1947 with the Taft-Hartley Act.\n  Under Snowe-Jeffords, unions and corporations still have a voice in \nfederal elections through the appropriate avenue--a political action \ncommittee to which individuals voluntarily contribute up to the amount \nallowed by law. They just can't use unlimited shareholder monies or \nmoney from union coffers to fund the ads--a logical extension of \ncurrent law.\n  As for disclosure, the Brennan Center analysis has concluded that, \n``Congress is permitted to demand that the sponsor of an electioneering \nmessage disclose the amount spent on the message and the sources of the \nfunds.''\n  It has been said in the past that this measure prohibits running \nthese ads altogether. In point of fact, anyone can run any ad saying \nanything they want at any time. They simply must not use union or \ncorporate treasury money within 30 days of a primary or 60 days before \na general election, and they must let us know who paid for them. Is \nthat too much to ask?\n  The fact is, Mr. President, we are burying our heads in the sand if \nwe do nothing about this problem. It is clearly taking elections out of \nthe hands of individuals and of candidates.\n  Certainly, there are some legitimate issue ads out there. They are \ntruly designed to inform the public, or advocate a particular position. \nWe don't effect these ads one iota. We don't want to effect these ads.\n  And certainly, people have a right to disagree with candidates, and \neven attack their positions. That is why nothing in this bill prevents \npeople from doing so. All we say is that we ought to know who is paying \nfor these ads, and that they should not be paid for with union or \ncorporation money--like any other activity that is influencing a \nfederal election.\n\n  Again, the bill only requires disclosure for large donors to all \ngroups spending more than $10,000 on ads running 30 days before a \nprimary and 60 days before a general election. And it only bans union \nand corporation treasury money from funding such ads, based on the 1907 \nand 1947 laws I mention earlier.\n  This approach has garnered majority support from the Senate in the \npast and in light of the previous elections it deserves even greater \nsupport today. We need balanced, meaningful, and comprehensive campaign \nfinance reform, and this bill is a vital component. I urge its \nconsideration.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the bill Senator Snowe and I are introducing and urge my \nSenate colleagues to join as cosponsors of this important legislation.\n  Throughout the last Congress the Senate spent many legislative hours \ndebating campaign finance reform. In fact, since my election to the \nHouse in the wake of the Watergate scandal, I have spent many long \nhours working with my colleagues to craft campaign finance reform \nlegislation that could ensure the legislative process and survive a \nconstitutional challenge. We have come close in the past, and I believe \ncircumstances still remain right for enactment of meaningful campaign \nfinance reform during this Congress.\n  I believe that the irregularities associated with our recent \ncampaigns point out the fact that current election laws are not being \nstrongly enforced or working to achieve the goals that we all have for \ncampaign finance reform. Without action, these abuses will become more \npronounced and widespread as we go from election to election.\n  The Snowe-Jeffords bill, the Advancing Truth and Accountability of \nCampaign Communications Act (ATACC), will boost disclosure requirements \nand tighten the rules on expenditures of corporate and union treasury \nfunds in the weeks preceding a primary and general election.\n  I would like to begin with a story that may help my colleagues \nunderstand the need for this legislation, and that many of my \ncolleagues may understand from their own campaigns. Two individuals are \nrunning for the Senate and have spent the last few months holding \ndebates, talking to the voters and traveling around the state. Both \ncandidates feel that they have informed the voters of their thoughts, \nviews and opinions on the issues, and that the voters can use this \ninformation to decide on which candidate they will support.\n  Two weeks before the day of the election a group called the People \nfor the Truth and the American Way, let's say, begins to run television \nadvertisements which include the picture of one of the\n\n[[Page S358]]\n\ncandidates and that candidate's name. However, these advertisements do \nnot use the express terms of ``vote for'' or ``vote against.'' These \nadvertisements discuss personal and family issues.\n  The voters do not know who this group is, who are its financial \nbackers and why they have an interest in this specific election, and \nunder our current election law the voters will not find out. Thus, even \nthough the candidates have attempted to provide the voters with all the \ninformation concerning the candidate's views on the issues, they \nwill be casting their vote lacking critical information concerning \nthese advertisements.\n\n  Some people may say that voters do not need this information. But as \nJames Madison said, ``A popular government without popular information \nis but a prologue to a tragedy or a farce or perhaps both. Knowledge \nwill forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own \ngovernors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.''\n  Mr. President, the ATACC act will arm the people with the knowledge \nthey need in order to sustain our popular government. And the need to \narm the people with this knowledge is becoming greater every year. The \namount of money spent on issue advocacy advertising is increasing over \ntime at an alarming rate. In the 1995-1996 election cycle an estimated \n$135-150 million was spent on issue advocacy, while in the 1997-1998 \ncycle an estimated $275-340 million was expended on these types of \nadvertisements. There appears to have been no slowing of expenditures \nduring the 1999-2000 election cycle as the most recent estimates show \nthe previous election cycle's total being surpassed with the final two \nmonths of campaigning, where a large proportion of these advertisements \nare run, remaining.\n  I have long believed in Justice Brandeis' statement that, ``Sunlight \nis said to be the best of disinfectants.'' The disclosure requirements \nin the ATACC act are narrow and tailored to provide the electorate with \nthe important pertinent information they will need to make an informed \ndecision. Information included on the disclosure statement includes the \nsponsor of the advertisement, amount spent, and the identity of the \ncontributors who donated more than $500. Getting the public this \ninformation will greatly help the electorate evaluate those who are \nseeking federal office.\n  Additionally, this disclosure, or disinfectant as Justice Brandeis \nputs it, will also help deter actual corruption and avoid the \nappearance of corruption that many already feel pervades our campaign \nfinance system. This, too, is an important outcome of the disclosure \nrequirements of this bill. Getting this information into the public \npurview would enable the press, the FEC and interest groups to help \nensure that our federal campaign finance laws are obeyed. If the public \ndoesn't feel that the laws Congress passes in this area are being \nfollowed, this will lead to a greater level of disillusionment in their \nelected representatives. Exposure to the light of day of any corruption \nby this required disclosure will help reassure our public that the laws \nwill be followed and enforced.\n  While our bill focuses on disclosure, it will also prohibit \ncorporations and unions from using general treasury monies to fund \nthese types of electioneering communications in a defined period close \nto an election. Since 1907, federal law has banned corporations from \nengaging in electioneering. In 1947, that ban was extended to prohibit \nunions from electioneering as well. The Supreme Court has upheld these \nrestrictions in order to avoid the deleterious influences on federal \nelections resulting from the use of money by those who exercise control \nover large aggregations of capital. By treating both corporations and \nunions similarly we extend current regulation cautiously and fairly. \nI feel that this prohibition, coupled with the disclosure requirements, \nwill address many of the concerns my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle have raised with regards to our current campaign finance laws.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to clarify at this time some \nof the things that this bill will not do. It will not prevent grass-\nroots lobbying communications, it does not cover printed material, nor \nrequire the text or a copy of the advertisement to be disclosed. \nFinally, it does not restrict how much money can be spent on ads, nor \nrestrict how much money a group raises. These points must be expressed \nearly on to ensure that my colleagues can clearly understand what we \nare and are not attempting to do with our legislation.\n  We have taken great care with our bill to avoid violating the \nimportant principles in the First Amendment of our Constitution. This \nhas required us to review the seminal cases in this areas, including \nBuckley v. Valeo. Limiting corporate and union spending and disclosure \nrules has been an area that the Supreme Court has been most tolerant of \nregulation. We also strove to make the requirements sufficiently clear \nand narrow to overcome unconstitutional claims of vagueness and \noverbreadth.\n  Mr. President, I wish I could guarantee to my colleagues that these \nprovisions would be held constitutional, but as we found out with the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, even with near unanimous support, it \nis difficult to gauge what the Supreme Court will decide on \nconstitutional issues. However, I feel that the provisions we have \ncreated follow closely the constitutional roadmap established by the \nSupreme Court by the decisions in this area, and that it would be \nupheld.\n  I know that campaign finance reform is an area of diverse viewpoints \nand beliefs. However, I feel that the ATACC act offers a constructive \nand constitutional solution that addresses some of the problems that \nhave been expressed concerning our current campaign finance system. The \nAmerican people are watching and hoping that we will have a fair, \ninformative and productive debate on campaign finance reform. I know \nthat the proposal that Senator Snowe and I have put forward will do \njust that.\n  The electorate has grown more and more disappointed with the tenor of \ncampaigns over the last few years, and this disappointment is reflected \nin the low number of people that actually participate in what makes \nthis country and democracy great, voting. I feel that giving the voters \nthe additional information required by our legislation will help dispel \nsome of the disillusionment the electorate feels with our campaign \nsystem and reinvigorate people to participate again in our democratic \nsystem.\n  In conclusion, the very basis of our democracy requires that an \ninformed electorate participate by going to the polls and voting. The \nATACC act will through its disclosure requirements inform our \nelectorate and lead people to again participate in our democratic \nsystem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 94. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a \n5-year extension of the credit for electricity produced from wind; to \nthe Commission on Finance.\n\n\n                    extending wind power incentives\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that \nwould extend for five additional years the Federal tax incentive that \nis currently available for facilities that produce electricity from \nwind.\n  Despite all of its promise, wind energy is still a relatively \nuntapped clean source of energy in our region and across the country. \nU.S. wind energy capacity in today's electricity marketplace is about \n2,600 megawatts. That's enough to serve about 600,000 typical American \nhouseholds. In 1999, the Administration committed our country to a goal \nof producing five percent of our total electricity needs--about 80,000 \nmegawatts--from wind power by the year 2020.\n  Wind energy is one of the world's fastest growing energy \ntechnologies. As a result, wind energy can--and should--play a larger \nrole in helping this country move toward greater energy independence. \nSoaring energy prices over the past year provide a stark reminder of \nthe importance of reducing our reliance on foreign energy sources and \nkeeping a diverse energy supply here at home. In addition, for states \nlike North Dakota, wind energy offers needed economic opportunities for \nfarmers and other rural landowners.\n  North Dakota is the top-ranked state for wind energy potential and is \noften referred to as the ``Saudi Arabia'' of wind by industry experts. \nTogether, North and South Dakota could supply two-thirds of the \nnation's current electricity supply with their wind energy\n\n[[Page S359]]\n\ncapacity, according to a Department of Energy analysis.\n  Greater wind development would also bring new jobs to many rural \ncommunities. Moreover, struggling family farmers could earn an extra \n$2,000-$3,000 annually for each 750 kilowatt wind turbine placed on the \nfarm, while removing only a small fraction of land from the farmer's \noverall operation.\n  Congress and the Administration have made some important progress in \nthe effort to promote greater wind energy development. Congress has \nincreased federal funding for wind and other renewable energy research \nand development at the Department of Energy over the past several \nyears. It also has provided a substantial federal income tax credit \nthat is vital for continued private sector investment in wind \ngeneration facilities. Most recently, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture's Rural Utilities Service awarded its first-ever wind \nenergy loan a rural electric cooperative serving the Upper Midwest will \nuse to finance the construction of wind turbine generators and power \nlines to help distribute wind-generated power to rural communities.\n  Regrettably, Congress and the Administration have undermined their \nvery own efforts by failing to ensure that the federal income tax \ncredit provided to facilities producing electricity from wind is \navailable over the long term.\n  I recently cosponsored a wind energy conference in North Dakota. It \nwas attended by more than five hundred people, including developers, \nindustry experts, utility executives, rural landowners, public \nofficials and others. This was double the number of expected \nparticipants, which demonstrates the growing interest in this renewable \nenergy resource.\n  Among other things, I heard from wind energy developers who \nemphasized that one of the major obstacles to greater deployment of new \nwind technologies is the continued uncertainty surrounding the \navailability of the wind energy production tax credit. This credit is \nnow scheduled to expire at the end of the year. Industry experts tell \nme that financial lenders will soon stop providing needed capital to \nnew wind initiatives. As a result, projects already underway will \nquickly come to a halt. Many developers will simply be unable to build \nand purchase equipment, secure financing, obtain the required \nenvironmental permits and bring wind turbine generators on-line by \nyear's end.\n  One of the best ways to give developers the certainty and help they \nneed to bring new state-of-the-art wind turbines to the marketplace at \na competitive rate is to provide a sufficiently long period of time for \nthem to access the credit. That's exactly what the bill I'm introducing \ntoday would do. Specifically, my bill would extend the current \nproduction tax credit for qualifying wind facilities that are placed in \nservice on or before December 31, 2006.\n  The wind energy production tax credit has had broad bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate and the House of Representatives in previous \nyears, so I am optimistic that we can pass this legislation quickly in \nthis new Congress. I urge my Senate colleagues to cosponsor this \nlegislation and work with me to get it enacted into law as soon as \npossible. If we don't, many new wind energy initiatives will come to a \nstandstill at a time when this country can least afford it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 95. A bill to promote energy conservation investments in Federal \nfacilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                    Federal Energy Bank Legislation\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nentitled ``The Federal Energy Bank Act.'' The purpose of this \nlegislation is to provide a stable long term source of funding for \nenergy efficiency projects throughout the Federal Government. If we are \nto start the Nation on the road toward increased energy conservation we \nmust begin with the Federal Government. This bill will help provide the \nnecessary investments to make this first step toward long term energy \nconservation possible.\n  Energy policy is a raging issue for our country at this time. Natural \ngas prices are at all time highs at a time when we are becoming more \nand more dependent on gas because of its minimal impact on the \nenvironment. Gas has become of victim of its own success, as our demand \nfor the commodity has outstripped our ability in the short term to \nbring the supply to market.\n  While I do not oppose continuing fossil fuel exploration and \nextraction, we cannot drill our way out of the tight energy market. We \nmust also consider other options including conservation. Conservation \noften gets a bad rap as people think politicians are simply telling \nthem to turn down the heat and shut off the lights they aren't using. \nConservation doesn't necessarily mean hardship and darkness, it can \nalso mean new technologies that do not require us to change our habits. \nIt means using energy smarter, using it when we need it, and only as \nmuch as we need. Conservation means holding on to the energy we have, \nand not wasting it.\n  Conservation is the compliment to production. If we do a better job \nof saving energy, that means megawatts of generation that will not need \nto be built. That does not mean we do not need additional generation, \nthe situation in California makes the clear the danger of not keeping \nup with the demand, it just means that less capacity will be necessary. \nAnyone who has ever grappled with the siting issues involved with a \npower plant knows it will be difficult to build even the bare minimum \nof power generation and transmission.\n  I have long believed that our Nation must implement a sensible \nnational energy policy which emphasizes greater energy conservation and \nefficiency, as well as the development of renewable resources. This \nbill is just one step of many that need to be taken to reduce our \nenergy consumption problems. The events in the Middle East, coupled \nwith the environmental problems associated with the use of fossil \nfuels, have only increased the need for improved energy conservation. \nSimply put, we cannot continue to rely on imported oil to meet such a \nlarge part of our Nation's energy needs. This dependence places our \neconomic security at great risk. In addition, the use of oil and other \nfossil fuels contributes to global climate change, air pollution, and \nacid rain.\n  Mr. President out attempts to remedy this situation are nothing new. \nIn fact, the laws requiring significant energy use reductions are \nalready in place. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated that Federal \nagencies use cost-effective measures, with less than a 10-year payback, \nto reduce energy consumption in their facilities. President Clinton, \nwith Executive Order 13123, extended the mandate by requiring Federal \nagencies to reduce energy consumption by 35 percent by the year 2010 \ncompared to 1985 energy uses. If accomplished, this would save the \nAmerican taxpayer millions in annual energy costs and in turn put us on \nthe road to future energy savings. This would also improve our \nenvironment, our balance of trade, and our national security.\n  Mr. President, my business background has taught me that most large \npaybacks come from positive long-term investments. Unfortunately, the \nFederal Government does not traditionally take this approach. More \noften than not, it seeks short-term savings and cuts which do not \naddress the problem of energy consumption or encourage future energy \nconservation.\n  Mr. President, my bill will help address this funding shortfall. The \nbill creates a bank to fund the purchase of energy efficiency projects \nby Federal agencies and in the long run will reduce the overall amount \nof money spent on energy consumption by the Federal Government. For \neach of the fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, each Federal agency will \ncontribute an amount equal to 5 percent of its previous year's utility \ncosts into a fund or bank managed by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The Secretary of Energy will authorize loans from the bank to any \nFederal agency for use toward investment in energy efficiency projects. \nThe agency will then repay the loan, making the bank self-supporting \nafter a few years. The Secretary of Energy will also establish \nselection criteria for each energy efficiency project, determining the \nproject is cost-effective and produces a payback in 3 years or less. \nAgencies will be required to report the progress of each project with a \ncost of more than $1 million to the Secretary 1 year after \ninstallation. The Secretary will then report to Congress each year on \nall the operations of the bank.\n\n[[Page S360]]\n\n  Mr. President, this bill will provide the real dollars required to \nmake the Executive order goals a reality.\n  Mr. President, in closing I would like to thank Johnson Controls, the \nlargest public company in Wisconsin, for their continued leadership and \ninput on this bill. As a maker of energy conservation systems, Johnson \nhas provided me with the real world insights that have helped me draft \na bill that attempts to address our energy conservation needs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the full text of the bill be \nprinted in full in the Record. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill and will push for its early enactment.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 95\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my \ncolleague, the Senior Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl) as an original \ncosponsor of the Federal Energy Bank Act.\n  As a politician, the idea of the federal government ``leading by \nexample'' in the area of energy efficiency has made sense to me for a \nlong time, so much so, in fact, that in campaigning for the Senate in \n1992, I included energy efficiency in my campaign platform. I proposed \nan 82-point plan to reduce the deficit, a series of specific spending \nreductions and revenue changes which, if enacted in sum total, would \nhave eliminated the deficit.\n  Among those items, as I was a candidate for office after the passage \nof the 1992 Energy Policy Act and after the United States' signing of \nthe Framework Convention on Climate Change in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, \nwas one to encourage the federal government to implement a \ncomprehensive energy savings program for the federal government through \nenergy efficiency investments.\n  After all, I believe that if Wisconsin consumers and business have \nbeen converted to the wisdom of compact fluorescent light bulbs, \nefficient heating and cooling systems, weatherization, and energy \nsaving computers, among the wide range of potential efficiency \nimprovements, that the federal government promoting those actions \nshould\n\n[[Page S361]]\n\nalso make the same investments to the taxpayers' benefit.\n  Section 152 of the Energy Policy Act mandated that Federal agencies \nuse all cost-effective measures that could be implemented with less \nthan a 10-year payback to reduce energy consumption in their facilities \nby 20 percent by the year 2000 compared to 1985 consumption levels. \nBoth of the two previous Administrations have been committed to these \ntypes of common sense ``no-regrets'' energy savings strategies. After \ntaking office, I have learned that among the most significant \nconstraints to implementing more energy efficient practices in the \nfederal government is the lack of sufficient funds to invest in energy \nefficient equipment.\n  Section 162 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 directed the Secretary \nof Energy to conduct a detailed study of options for financing energy \nand water conservation measures in Federal facilities as required under \nthe Act and by subsequent Executive Orders. On June 3, 1997, the then \nSecretary of Energy (Mr. Pena) released that study. It documented a \nneed for a $5.7 billion financial investment between 1996 and 2005 to \nmeet the Energy Policy Act and Executive Order goals, a value which \ncould vary from a low of $4.4 billion to a high of $7.1 billion given \nvariability in both energy and water investment requirements.\n  The best estimate, according to the same study of the total federal \nfunding available to spend on energy and water efficiency improvements \nfrom various sources, including direct agency appropriations, energy \nsavings performance contracts, and utility demand-side management \nprograms, and appropriations to the Federal Energy Efficiency Fund, to \nthe federal government to meet those needs over the same time period is \n$3.7 billion. Thus, under DOE's best estimate, at the federal level we \nface a potential shortfall of funds necessary to achieve our federal \nenergy and water conservation objectives of $2 billion.\n  In order to address this shortfall, I am pleased to join as a co-\nsponsor of this legislation to create a federal energy revolving fund \nor ``energy bank.'' I hope this legislation can be one of the items on \nwhich we can reach bipartisan consensus in our efforts to develop a \nnational energy strategy this Congress.\n  Some in this body may be concerned that the existence of the current \nFederal Energy Efficiency Fund alleviates the need for additional \nfederal conservation investment. The problem with the current fund, \nwhich operates as a grant program for agencies to make efficiency \nimprovements, is that it does not contribute to the replenishment of \ncapital resources because it does not have to be paid back and is \ntherefore dependent upon appropriations.\n  Under the legislation, I join in cosponsoring with my colleague from \nWisconsin today, federal agencies will be required, to deposit 5 \npercent of their total utility payments in the proceeding fiscal year \nto capitalize the fund. After 2001, the Secretary of Energy will \ndetermine an amount necessary to ensure that the fund meets its \nobligations.\n  Agencies will then be able to get a loan from the fund to finance \nefficiency projects, which they will be responsible for repaying with \ninterest. The projects must use off-the-shelf technologies and must be \ncost effective. The best part of this approach is that the technologies \nare required to have a three-year pay back period, and, therefore, this \nlegislation achieves some modest savings for the taxpayer. CBO scores \nthis measure as saving $3 million over 5 years.\n  There is a need to improve federal procurement of energy efficient \ntechnologies, and this measure is a positive, proactive measure to \nensure that federal agencies specifically set aside funds to achieve \nthis goal. The Senior Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl) and I look \nforward to working with the administration to advance this legislation \nas a piece of the country's overall greenhouse gas reductions strategy.\n  In conclusion, I look forward to working with my Senior Senator on \nthis issue. I believe that this is a unique opportunity for Senate \ncolleagues to support legislation that is both fiscally responsible and \nenvironmentally sound.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 96. A bill to ensure that employees of traveling sales crews are \nprotected under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and under other \nprovisions of law; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                  Traveling sales crew protection act\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President almost two years have gone by since the \ntragic accident in Janesville, WI, that brought to light the abuse of \nworkers in the magazine sales industry. Since 1992, forty-two sales \npeople have been killed or injured in similar crashes. Unfortunately \ndeaths and injuries still occur. Parents are still separated from their \nchildren without knowing where they are or whether they are safe. Young \npeople are not being paid for their work, and are being falsely listed \nas independent contractors. Roving sweatshops continue to travel our \nhighways and solicit unlicenced in our neighborhoods.\n  My legislation would go a long way toward ending this sad state of \naffairs.\n  Today I have introduced legislation to crack down on abuses in the \ntraveling sales crew industry. These companies employ crews who travel \nfrom city to city selling products door to door. Often times, however, \nthese companies mistreat their workers and violate local, state, and \nfederal labor law. Because they rapidly move from state to state, \nenforcement efforts are difficult if not impossible for local \nauthorities.\n  In 1987 former Senator Roth, as part of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations looked into this industry, and was appalled at what he \nfound. Incidents of verbal and physical abuse of workers were \nwidespread. Young people were coerced into continuing to sell long \nafter they wanted to leave through threats and taunts from their \nemployers. When sellers were able to get free they were often unpaid or \ndenied the bus ticket home they were promised when they signed up.\n  The compensation system for the workers was also rigged to ensure \nthat workers could not leave. Prospective sellers were promised big \nbucks when they were recruited, but soon found that decent pay was \ndifficult to come by. Sellers were paid on a commission basis according \nto their sales, but they were also charged by the company for their \naccommodations and fined for small infractions like showing up late to \nmeetings or sleeping on the van. Salespeople were not paid in a timely \nmanner, but their earnings were kept on ``paper'' and the employees \nonly drew a daily allowance to pay for food. Employees were seldom \nallowed to see the paper work that tracked their earnings so they had \nlittle idea about how much they are entitled. Many found that they were \nnot able to keep up with the sales and fell in debt to the company. \nAfter working 12 hour days, six days a week for months, employees \nactually owed the company money! These young people became indentured \nservants, working long hours for only room and board.\n  In the thirteen years since Senator Roth's investigation, nothing has \nchanged. These abuses continue, and Congress should act.\n  I am not one to frivolously engage in regulating business, but in \nthis case the need for federal involvement is clear. Because of the \nmobility of these companies, states cannot crack down on these groups \nalone. They need federal help to eliminate the unscrupulous actors in \nthe industry.\n  The Traveling Sales Crew Protection Act would take important steps to \neliminate employers who abuse their workers. First, it would no longer \nallow minors to be employed in this line of work. Door to door sales \ncan be dangerous work and combined with the long hours and hazardous \ntravel, creates a job too dangerous for children. Second, the bill \nwould narrowly eliminate the exemption under the Fair Labor Standards \nAct for these specific kinds of operations. Covering these employees \nwith minimum wages laws and overtime requirements protects them from \nbecoming indentured servants to their employers through complex \ncompensation systems. This provision is carefully crafted to cover only \ntraveling sales crews, individuals who sell over the road, or at trade \nshows would be unaffected. Lastly the bill creates a licensing \nprocedure through the Department of Labor to monitor those engaged in \nsupervising and running these operations.\n\n[[Page S362]]\n\n  These measures are important steps forward in a nationwide effort to \neliminate this particularly abusive form of worker exploitation. I hope \nI will have my colleagues' support as I try to make the painful crash \nin Janesville, the last chapter in this shameful story.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 96\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Written notice shall \n     be posted in the facility or real property, prior to and \n     throughout the occupancy by such workers, informing such \n     workers that the applicable safety and health standards are \n     met.\n       (2) If the employer does not own or control the facility or \n     real property which is used for housing traveling sales crew \n     workers, the employer shall be responsible for ensuring that \n     the owner or operator of such facility or real property \n     complies with substantive Federal and State safety and health \n     standards applicable to that housing.

plaintiff per violation or, in the case of a \n     class action, not more than $1,000,000 for all plaintiffs in \n     the class, if the court finds any of the following:\n\n       (I) The defendant

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with respect \nto the eligibility of veterans for mortgage revenue bond financing, and \nfor other purposes; to the Commission on Finance.\n\n\n                        veterans home loan bill\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill help Wisconsin and several other States, including Oregon, Texas, \nAlaska, and California, extend one of our most successful veterans \nprograms to Persian Gulf war participants and others. This bill will \namend the eligibility requirements for mortgage revenue bond financing \nfor State veterans housing programs.\n  State run plans do an excellent job of helping vets bridge the gap to \nhome ownership, and are often more successful than our own federal \nplan. This bill gives states the tools they need to help veterans.\n  Wisconsin uses this tax-exempt bond authority to assist veterans in \npurchasing their first home. Under rules adopted by Congress in 1984, \nthis program excluded from eligibility veterans who served after 1977. \nThis bill would simply remove that restriction.\n  At a time when everyone is looking for ways to make military service \nmore appealing, we should not overlook the role state sponsored \nbenefits, like home loan programs, can reward our veterans. Wisconsin \nand the other eligible States simply want to maintain a principle that \nwe in the Senate have also strived to uphold--that veterans of the \nPersian Gulf war should not be treated less generously than those of \npast wars. This bill meets a commitment to our service members and \nlevels the benefits between Persian Gulf vets and the vets of the Cold \nWar era.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 97\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ELIGIBILITY OF VETERANS FOR MORTGAGE REVENUE BONDS \n                   DETERMINED BY STATES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (4) of section 143(l) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (defining qualified veteran) is \n     redesignated as paragraph (6) of such section and amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(6) Qualified veteran.--For purposes of this subsection, \n     the term ``qualified veteran'' means any veteran--\n       ``(A) who meets such requirements as may be imposed by the \n     State law pursuant to which qualified veterans' mortgage \n     bonds are issued,\n       ``(B) who applied for the financing before the date 30 \n     years after the last date on which such veteran left active \n     service, and\n       ``(C) in the case of financing provided by the proceeds of \n     bonds issued during the period beginning July 19, 1984, and \n     ending June 30, 2001, who served on active duty at some time \n     before January 1, 1977.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to bonds issued after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATE CAP RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 143(l) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to additional requirements for \n     qualified veterans' mortgage bonds), as amended by section \n     1(a), is amended by inserting after paragraph (3) the \n     following new paragraph:\n       ``(4) Subcap restriction.--\n       ``(A) In general.--An issue meets the requirements of this \n     paragraph only if the amount of bonds issued pursuant thereto \n     that is to be used to provide financing to mortgagors who \n     have not served on active duty at some time before January 1, \n     1977, when added to the amount of the aggregate qualified \n     veterans' mortgage bonds previously issued by the State \n     during the calendar year that is to be so used, does not \n     exceed the subcap amount.\n       ``(B) Subcap amount.--\n       ``(i) In general.--The subcap amount for any calendar year \n     is an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the State \n     veterans limit for such year.\n       ``(ii) Applicable percentage.--For purposes of clause (i), \n     the applicable percentage shall be determined under the \n     following table:\n\n                                                             Applicable\n``Calendar year:                                            Percentage:\n  2002..........................................................10 ....\n\n  2003..........................................................20 ....\n\n  2004..........................................................30 ....\n\n  2005..........................................................40 ....\n\n  2006 and thereafter........................................50.''.....\n\n       (b) Restriction on Overall State Cap.--Paragraph (3)(B) of \n     section 143(l) of such Code (relating to State veterans \n     limit) is amended by adding at the end the following flush \n     sentence:\n\n     ``But in no event shall the State veterans limit exceed \n     $340,000,000 for any calendar year after 2002.''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--The matter preceding paragraph \n     (1) of section 143(l) of such Code is amended by striking \n     ``and (3)'' and inserting ``, (3), and (4)''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to bonds issued after December 31, 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 99. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a \ncredit against tax for employers who provide child care assistance for \ndependents of their employees, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                 child care infrastructure act of 2001.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Child Care \nInfrastructure Act, along with Senator Graham of Florida. Senator \nGraham and I have both worked on child care issues for many years, and \nI am pleased that we have combined our efforts to introduce this bill \ntogether.\n  Mr. President, we have talked a great deal in recent years, as well \nas in the recent campaign, about giving working families the tools they \nneed to succeed. And while some of us may disagree on the details, I \nthink we can all agree upon one basic premise: Working couples who \ndecide to have a family should not be penalized because they both also \nchoose to keep working. But unfortunately today, many working parents \ndo not have access to one of the critical tools they need to succeed at \nwork: quality child care.\n  Working families spend a large proportion of their income on child \ncare--from 8 percent for families above the\n\n[[Page S366]]\n\npoverty line to 18 percent for those below. And nothing adds more to \nthese high costs than the dramatic shortage of quality child care in \nthis country. The Children's Defense Fund states in a recent report \nthat ``parents and experts report that child care is in short supply--\nparticularly for some age groups and for certain types of care--and \nthat some communities have little or no licensed care.''\n  This shortage of quality child care is not just inconvenient. It is \ndangerous, and could jeopardize the ability of children to succeed \nlater in life. Research on the brain has confirmed that the most \nsignificant period in a child's development and education is between \nthe years 0-3. Good early childhood programs can improve children's \nchances of long-term success in school, higher earnings as adults, and \ndecreased involvement with the criminal justice system.\n  But the lack of quality child care is not only harmful to children. \nIt places a tremendous strain on parents. Full-time child care can cost \n$4,000 to $6,000 per year, and many working families simply cannot find \naffordable, quality child care for their young children.\n  And make no mistake: the lack of reliable child care has a direct \nimpact on businesses and our economy. Parents who can't find reliable \nchild care are more likely to miss work, and the lack of stable child \ncare makes it more difficult for parents to be productive while at \nwork.\n  Clearly, we all have a stake in increasing the supply of quality \nchild care for families. It will take a sustained effort from families, \nfrom government--and yes, from businesses too--to build the child care \ninfrastructure necessary to make sure children, parents, and businesses \nsucceed.\n  My legislation brings all these players together in a simple, common-\nsense way. We provide a tax credit to businesses who are willing to \ntake action to increase the supply of quality child care. The credit is \navailable for child care activities such as:\n  Expenses related to the acquisition, expansion, or repair of an on- \nor near-site day care center, after-hours care facility, or sick-child \nfacility. This credit would also be available for a consortium of \nbusinesses that joined together to create a child care center.\n  Direct company subsidization of the operating costs of a child care \nfacility.\n  Direct company payments or reimbursements to employees for their \nchild care expenses.\n  A company's reservation for their employees of child care slots in a \nlicensed child care facility.\n  Company expenditures on training and continuing education for child \ncare workers.\n  The credit would be 25 percent for these activities, and 10 percent \nfor the cost of a company's contract with a non-profit Child Care \nResource and Referral service, which help parents locate child care in \ntheir communities. The credit is capped at $150,000 per year. \nSafeguards in the legislation ensure that the companies receive the tax \ncredits for capital expenditures that go toward facilities that stay in \noperation for several years.\n  In 1997, the Senate passed a similar proposal by a bipartisan vote of \n72-28. Versions of this tax credit have been included in most major \nchild care legislation introduced by Democrats and Republicans in the \n106th Congress, including the tax bill passed by the Senate in July of \n1999.\n  This bill makes us all partners in ensuring we have enough quality \nchild care for working families. I hope my colleagues will continue \ntheir long-time support of the child care infrastructure tax credit, \nand I look forward to working with all of you to pass it this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 99\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join my \ncolleague Senator Kohl in introducing the Child Care Infrastructure Act \nof 2001. This measure will make child care more accessible and \naffordable to the many millions of Americans who find it not only \nimportant, but necessary, to work.\n  This legislation grants tax credits to employers who assist their \nemployees with child care expenses, either by providing child care on-\nsite, reimbursing employees for the cost of child care, or establishing \na referral service to help employees locate a child care provider.\n  An employer is eligible for an income tax credit equal to 25 percent \nof its child care expenses. Expenses eligible for the credit include:\n  The cost of acquiring, constructing, rehabilitating or expanding \nemployer property used to provide employees with child care;\n  the cost of operating an employer child care facility;\n  costs incurred under a contract with a qualified child care facility \nto provide child care services to employees; and\n  to reimburse employees for the cost of child care.\n  Employers may also be eligible for a separate credit equal to 10 \npercent of child care resource and referral expenses.\n  The bill establishes an overall limit on the amount of child care \ncredits an employer can qualify to receive. That limit is $150,000 per \nyear.\n  Why is this legislation important?\n  First, the workplace has changed over the years. In 1947, one in four \nmothers with children between the ages of 6 and 17 were in the labor \nforce. By 1996, their labor force participation rate had tripled to \nnearly three in four.\n  Indeed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 65 percent of all \nwomen with children under 18 years of age are now working and that the \ngrowth in the number of working women will continue into the next \ncentury.\n  Second, child care is one of the most pressing social issues of the \nday. It impacts every family, rich or poor.\n  In June of 1998, I hosted a Florida statewide summit on child care \nwhere over 500 residents of my State shared with me their concerns and \nfrustrations on child care issues. They told me that quality child care \nis either unavailable or unaffordable.\n  Those who had found affordable child care often were faced with long \nwaiting lists.\n  They told me that working parents struggle to cope with the often \nconflicting time demands of work and child care.\n  They told me of their concerns with school-age children who often are \nat risk because before and after-school supervised care programs are \nnot readily available.\n  Mr. President, quality child care should be a concern to all \nAmericans. The care and nurturing that children receive early in life \nhas a profound influence on their future--and their future is our \nfuture.\n  In the 21st century, women will comprise more than 60 percent of all \nnew entrants into the labor market. A large proportion of these women \nare expected to be mothers of children under the age of 6.\n  The implications for employers are clear. They understand the rapidly \nchanging nature of our Nation's work force and that those employers who \ncan help their employees with child care will have a competitive \nadvantage.\n  Many smaller businesses would like to join them, but do not have the \nresources to offer child care to their employees. Our legislation would \nhelp to lower the obstacle to on-site child care.\n  Mr. President, we believe that this legislation will assist \nbusinesses in providing attractive, cost-effective tools for recruiting \nand retaining employees in a tight labor market.\n  We believe that encouraging businesses to help employees care for \nchildren will make it easier for parents to be more involved in their \nchildren's education.\n  Most of all, Mr. President, we believe that this bill is good for \nemployers and families and will go far in addressing the issue of child \ncare for working families of America. I urge all of my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 100. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe state and gift taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S368]]\n\n                       time to end the death tax\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nimmediately eliminate the estate tax. I fundamentally oppose the estate \ntax. I call it the ``death tax.'' This unfair tax has been a concern of \nmine for some time now.\n  Congress has clearly demonstrated its support for easing this burden. \nThe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 gradually increases the exemption. Last \nyear, Congress decided that further action was needed and passed a bill \nthat would have eliminated the federal estate tax. Unfortunately, \nPresident Clinton chose to veto that bill. I look forward to the \nopportunity to work with the new Administration to repeal this unfair \ntax by passing my bill.\n  The United States has one of the highest estate taxes in the world. \nWhile income tax rates have declined in recent decades, estate taxes \nhave remained high. Today, the death tax is imposed on estates with \nassets of more than $675,000. The rates begin at 37% and very rapidly \nrise to 55%. Some estates even pay a marginal rate of 60%.\n  This issue really hits home for me. Family farms and small businesses \nare two of the groups most affected by the estate tax. I grew up on my \nfamily's farm in Colorado, and I owned a small business before I came \nto Washington. So, I truly understand the concerns of those who live in \nfear of the impact that this tax will have on their legacy to their \nchildren.\n  The estate tax has resulted in the loss of family farms and family \nbusinesses across the nation. Many people work their entire lives to \nbuild a business that they can pass on to their children. When these \nhard-working businessmen and farmers pass away, their families are \noften forced to sell off the business to pay the estate tax. I see this \nas an affront to those who try to pass on the fruits of their lives' \nwork to their children.\n  The people affected by this tax are not necessarily wealthy. Many \nsmall business people are cash poor, but asset rich. For example, the \nowner of a small restaurant might have $800,000 of assets, but not much \ncash on hand. Her children will still have to pay an excessive tax on \nthe assets. The beer wholesaler, who has invested all of his revenue in \ntrucks and storage, might have more than $675,000 in assets. That does \nnot make him a cash-wealthy man. Yet, he is still subject to this so-\ncalled ``tax on the wealthy.''\n  The death tax also impacts employment and the economy. When a family-\nowned farm or a small business closes, the workers lose their jobs. \nConversely, leaving resources in the economy can create jobs. A recent \nGeorge Mason study found that if the estate tax were phased out over \nfive years, the economy would create 198,895 more jobs, and grow by an \nadditional $509 billion over a ten-year period.\n  Additionally, the estate tax is a disincentive for Americans to save \ntheir earnings. The government has created a number of tax breaks and \nother incentives for those who save their money: 401(k)s and IRAs--to \nname a few. Yet, the estate tax sends a contradictory message. \nBasically, it says, ``If you don't spend all your savings by the time \nyou die, the government will penalize you.'' This tax is no small \npenalty, either. We are talking about some very high tax rates.\n  The death tax also represents an unjust double taxation. The savings \nwere taxed initially when they were earned. Then, when the saver passes \naway, the government comes along and takes a second cut. There is no \ngood reason for the current system--other than the government's desire \nto make a profit at the already trying time of the death of a dear one.\n  The current death tax law has a greater effect on the lower end of \nthe scale than the higher. Wealthy people can afford lawyers and \nplanners to help them plan their estate. Those at the lower end of the \nestate tax scale are often unable to afford sophisticated estate \nplanning. So the current law also makes the tax somewhat regressive, \nwhich is not fair.\n  Planning and compliance with the estate tax can consume substantial \nresources. In 1995, the Gallup organization surveyed family firms. \nTwenty-three percent of owners of companies valued over $10 million \nsaid that they pay more than $50,000 per year in insurance premiums on \npolicies to help them pay the eventual bill. To plan for the estate \ntax, the firms also spent an average of $33,000 on lawyers, accountants \nand financial planners, over a period of several years. This is money \nthat could have been better spent to expand the business and create new \njobs--rather than dealing with the death tax.\n  The estate tax only raises one percent of federal revenue, yet it \ncosts farms, businesses and jobs. No American family should lose their \nfarm or business because of the federal government. I support full \nrepeal of the federal estate tax.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill, as \nwell as an article that I recently wrote, be entered into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 100\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of American in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Death Tax Termination Act of \n     2001.''\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF ESTATE AND GIFT TAXES.\n\n       Subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating \n     to estate, gift, and generation-skipping taxes) is repealed \n     effective with respect to estates of decedents dying, and \n     gifts made, after December 31, 2000.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Roll Call, Apr. 27, 1998]\n\n         Estate Tax Reform Must Be First Step to Fixing System\n\n                         (By Sen. Wayne Allard)\n\n       As we approach the new millennium, a consensus has emerged \n     in favor of significant tax reform. Some prefer the flat tax; \n     others advocate the sales tax. A third camp argues that \n     Congress should avoid a complete overhaul and instead work to \n     improve the existing system.\n       Whatever path is chosen, it should include elimination of \n     the federal estate tax. Repeal of the estate tax is the first \n     step toward a fairer and flatter tax system.\n       Congress has levied estate taxes at various times \n     throughout US history, particularly during war. The current \n     estate tax dates back to 1916, a time when many in Congress \n     were looking for ways to redistribute some of the wealth held \n     by a small number of super-rich families. This first \n     permanent estate tax had a top rate of only 10 percent, and \n     the threshold was high enough to ensure that the tax affected \n     only a tiny fraction of the population.\n       Like the rest of our tax code, it did not take long for \n     this limited tax to evolve into a more substantial burden. In \n     only the second year of the tax, the top rate was increased \n     to 25 percent. By 1935, the top rate was 70 percent, and in \n     1941, it reached an all-time high of 77 percent.\n       While income tax rates have declined in recent decades, \n     estate taxes have remained high. Today, the top estate tax \n     rate is 55 percent (a top marginal rate of 60 percent is paid \n     by some estates), and the tax is imposed on amounts above the \n     1998 exemption level of $625,000 (value above $625,000 is \n     taxed at an initial rate of 37 percent).\n       Generally, the value of all assets held at death is \n     included in the estate for purposes of assessing the tax--\n     this includes residences, business assets, stocks, bonds, \n     savings, personal property, etc. Estate tax returns are due \n     within nine months of the decedent's death (a six-month \n     extension is available), and with the exception of certain \n     closely held businesses, the tax is due when the return is \n     filed. The tax is paid by the estate rather than by the \n     beneficiary (in contrast to an inheritance tax).\n       Last year's tax bill increased the unified estate and gift \n     tax exemption from $600,000 to $1 million. However, this is \n     done very gradually and does not reach the $1 million level \n     until 2006. The bill also increased the exemption amount for \n     a qualified family-owned business to $1.3 million.\n       While both actions are a good first step, they barely \n     compensate for the effects of inflation. The $600,000 \n     exemption level was last set in 1987; just to keep pace with \n     inflation the exemption should have risen to $850,000 by \n     1997. Incremental improvements help, but we need more \n     substantial reform.\n       The United States retains among the highest estate taxes in \n     the world. Among industrial nations, only Japan has a higher \n     top rate than we do. But Japan's 70 percent rate applies to \n     an inheritance of $16 million or more. The US top rate of 55 \n     percent kicks in on estates of $3 million or more. France, \n     the United Kingdom and Ireland all have top rates of 40 \n     percent, and the average top rate of Organization for \n     Economic Cooperation and Development countries is only 29 \n     percent. Australia, Canada and Mexico presently have no \n     estate taxes.\n       The strongest argument that supporters of the estate tax \n     make is that most American families will never have to pay an \n     estate tax. While this is true, it does not justify retention \n     of a tax that causes great harm to family businesses and \n     farms, often constitutes double taxation, limits economic \n     growth\n\n[[Page S369]]\n\n     consumes significant resources in unproductive tax compliance \n     activities and raises only a tiny portion of federal tax \n     revenues. In other words, the estate tax is not worth all the \n     trouble.\n       The estate tax can destroy a family business. This is the \n     most disturbing aspect of the tax. No American family should \n     lose its business or farm because of the estate tax. Current \n     estimates are that more than 70 percent of family businesses \n     do not survive the second generation, and 87 percent do not \n     survive the third generation.\n       While there are many reasons for these high numbers, the \n     estate tax is certainly one of them. The estate tax fails to \n     distinguish between cash and non-liquid assets, and since \n     family businesses are often asset-rich and cash poor, they \n     can be forced to sell assets in order to pay the tax. This \n     practice can destroy the business outright, or leave it so \n     strapped for capital that long-term survival is jeopardized.\n       Similarly, more and more large ranches and farms are facing \n     the prospect of break-up and sale to developers in order to \n     pay the estate tax. In addition to destroying a family \n     business, this harms the environment.\n       The accounting firm Price Waterhouse recently calculated \n     the taxable components of 1995 estates. While 21 percent of \n     assets were corporate stocks and bonds, and another 21 \n     percent were mutual fund assets, fully 32 percent of gross \n     estates consisted of ``business assets'' such as stock in \n     closely held businesses, interests in non-corporate \n     businesses and farms and interests, in limited partnerships. \n     In larger estates, this portion rose to 55 percent. Clearly, \n     a substantial portion of taxable estates consists of family \n     businesses.\n       The National Center for Policy Analysis reports that a 1995 \n     survey by Travis Research Associates found that 51 percent of \n     family businesses would have significant difficulty surviving \n     the estate tax, and 30 percent of respondents said they would \n     have to sell part or all of their business. This is supported \n     by a 1995 Family Business Survey conducted by Matthew \n     Greenwald and Associates which found that 33 percent of \n     family businesses anticipate having to liquidate or sell part \n     of their business to pay the estate tax.\n       While some businesses are destroyed by the estate tax, many \n     more expend substantial resources in tax planning and \n     compliance. Those that survive the estate tax often do so by \n     purchasing expensive insurance. A 1995 Gallup survey of \n     family firms found that 23 percent of the owners of companies \n     valued at more than $10 million pay $50,000 or more per year \n     in insurance premiums on policies designed to help them pay \n     the eventual tax bill. The same survey found that family \n     firms estimated they had spent on average more than $33,000 \n     on lawyers, accountants and financial planners over a period \n     of six and a half years in order to prepare for the estate \n     tax.\n       In fact, one of the great ironies of the estate tax is that \n     an extensive amount of tax planning can very nearly eliminate \n     the tax. This results in a situation in which the very \n     wealthy can end up paying less estate tax than those of more \n     modest means.\n       As noted above, life insurance can play a big role in \n     estate planning, but there are also mechanisms such as \n     qualified personal residence trusts, charitable remainder \n     trusts, charitable lead trusts, generation-skipping trusts \n     and the effective use of annual gifts. While these mechanisms \n     may reduce the tax, they waste resources that could be put to \n     much better use growing businesses and creating jobs.\n       One of the tenets of a fair tax system is that income is \n     taxed only once. Income should be taxed when it is first \n     earned or realized; it should not be repeatedly retaxed by \n     government. The estate tax violates this tenet. At the time \n     of a person's death, much of his or her savings, business \n     assets or farm assets have already been subjected to federal, \n     state and local tax. These same assets are then taxed again \n     under the estate tax. Price Waterhouse has calculated that \n     those families who will be liable for the estate tax face the \n     prospect of nearly 73 percent of every dollar being taxed \n     away.\n       Repeal of the estate tax would benefit the economy. Without \n     the estate tax, greater business resources could be put \n     toward productive economic activities. Recently, the Center \n     for the Study of Taxation commissioned George Mason \n     University professor Richard Wagner to estimate the economic \n     impact of a phase-out of the estate tax.\n       Wagner estimated that if the tax is phased out over five \n     years beginning in 1999, the economy would create 189,900 \n     more jobs and would grow by an additional $509 billion over a \n     ten-year-period. Similarly, a recent Heritage Foundation \n     study simulated the results of an estate tax repeal under two \n     respected economic models, the Washington University Macro \n     Model, and the Wharton Econometric Model. Under both models, \n     a repeal of the tax is forecast to increase jobs and gross \n     domestic product, as well as reduce the cost of capital.\n       One might expect that with all the economic dislocation \n     associated with the estate tax that it raises a significant \n     amount of revenue or accomplishes a redistributionist social \n     policy. In fact, the revenue take is quite modest--\n     approximately one percent of federal revenue or $14.7 billion \n     in 1995. And as for social policy, the ability of the federal \n     government to equalize wealth through the estate tax may be \n     quite limited. A 1995 study published by the Rand Corporation \n     found that for the very wealthiest Americans, only 7.5 \n     percent of their wealth is attributable to inheritance--the \n     other 92.5 percent is from earnings.\n       America is a nation of tremendous economic opportunity. \n     Success is determined principally through hard work and \n     individual initiative. Our tax policy should focus on \n     encouraging greater initiative rather than on attempts to \n     limit inherited wealth.\n       The estate tax is a relic. It damages family businesses, \n     harms the economy and constitutes double taxation. It is time \n     for the estate tax to go.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 101. A bill to improve teacher quality, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                      QUALITY TEACHERS FOR ALL ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr President, today I am pleased to introduce a package \nof bills related to education for consideration in the context of the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n(``ESEA''). I believe the issue of accountability for results will be \nat the center of our debate this year so I will introduce and speak \nabout that bill separately. Nevertheless, I believe that we need to \nincrease our investment in education while increasing our expectations \nfor results from our schools. In that context, we should be sure to \ntarget that investment on problems with national implications and \nstrategies and programs that we know work. At this time, I am \nintroducing three bills that I believe meet that criteria: The Quality \nTeachers for All Act, The National Dropout Prevention Act and the \nAccess to High Standards Act. All of these bills provide support for \nefforts on the local level to raise standards for our schools, our \nteachers and our students.\n  Improving teacher quality continues to be one of my top priorities in \nthe Senate because research indicates that teacher quality is one of \nthe most important factors in student achievement. The Quality Teachers \nfor All Act addresses the fact that, although the vast majority of our \nteacher's are dedicated, professional and competent, far too many \nschools in America allow classrooms to be lead by teachers with \ninsufficient training and qualifications. Unfortunately, it is the \nschools and classrooms with the neediest children who have the largest \nnumber of unqualified teachers. While we are demanding increased levels \nof performance for our schools and our children, we must also set high \nstandards for all our teachers, including those who instruct student \nwho must overcome the greatest barriers to learning.\n  The Quality Teachers for All Act requires that all teachers in \nschools that receive Title 1 funds be fully qualified. This means that \nthey possess necessary teaching skills and demonstrate mastery in the \nsubjects that they teach. It provides that an elementary school teacher \nmust have state certification, hold a bachelor's degree and demonstrate \nsubject matter knowledge, teaching knowledge and teaching skills \nrequired to teach effectively in reading, writing, mathematics, social \nstudies, science and other elements of a liberal arts education. Middle \nand secondary school teachers must have state certification, hold a \nbachelor's degree, and demonstrate competence in all subject areas that \nthey teach. This demonstration of competence may be achieved by a high \nlevel of performance on a rigorous academic subject area test, \ncompletion of an academic major (or an equal number of courses). The \nbill ensures that low income students are not disproportionately \nimpacted by low teaching standards by requiring that teachers in high \npoverty schools be at least as well-qualified, in terms of experience \nand credentials as the instructional staff in schools served by the \nsame local educational agency that are not high poverty schools.\n  In order to help states and LEAs meet these requirements, the bill \nwill provide grants to assist states and LEAs in providing the \nnecessary education or training for individuals who are teaching \nwithout full qualifications. In addition, recognizing that some \ncommunities have difficulty attracting qualified teachers, the bill \nallows funds to be used to provide financial incentives (i.e., signing \nbonuses) for fully qualified teachers. In addition, the bill supports \nefforts to recruit new teachers by providing allowing funds to be used \nto develop alternative means of certification for highly qualified \nindividuals with college degrees\n\n[[Page S370]]\n\nwishing to teach, including mid-career professionals and former \nmilitary personnel. The bill also authorizes funds to support State \nefforts to increase the portability of teacher's pensions, \ncertification and years of experience so that teachers have greater \nmobility and school districts can fill vacant teaching positions with \nteachers who are fully-qualified. The funds may also be used for \nprograms of support for new teachers to ensure that they are more \nlikely to remain in the nation's teaching force.\n  In order to make parents our partners in our efforts to raise \nteaching standards, this bill requires districts and schools to provide \nparents with information about the qualifications of their child's \nteacher. These provisions build on legislation I authored that became \npart of the Higher Education Act of 1998 requiring a national report \ncard on teacher training programs. The parental right to know provision \nin the Quality Teachers for All Act will empower parents by informing \nthem of the strengths and weaknesses of their children's teachers, \nhelping them to support the push for fully-qualified teachers in every \nclassroom.\n  The National Dropout Prevention Act is a bill designed to reduce the \ndropout rate in our nation's schools through the use and dissemination \nof effective dropout prevention programs. While much progress has been \nmade in encouraging all student to complete high school, the nation \nremains far from its goal of a 90 percent graduation rate for students, \na goal that was to be attained in the year 2000. In fact, none of the \nstates with large and diverse populations have yet come close to this \ngoal and dropout rates approaching 50 percent between ninth grade and \nthe senior year are commonplace in some of the most disadvantaged of \nour nation's communities. This bill is based on many of the findings of \nthe National Hispanic Dropout Project, a group of nationally recognized \nexperts assembled in 1996-97 to help find ways of reducing the high \ndropout rates among Hispanic and other at-risk students. The group \npointed out that there are widespread misconceptions about why so many \nstudent drop out of school and that there is little familiarity with \nproven drop out prevention programs. Most problematic is the fact that \nthere is currently no concerted federal effort to provide or coordinate \neffective and proven dropout prevention programs or oversee the \nmultitude of programs that include dropout prevention as a component.\n  The Act makes lowering the dropout rate a national priority. A \nnational clearinghouse on effective school drop out prevention, \nintervention and reentry programs would be created and efforts to \nprevent students from dropping out would be identified and \ndisseminated. The bill provides support and recognition for schools \nengaged in effective dropout prevention efforts. In addition, this bill \nprovides funds to pay the startup and implementation costs of \neffective, sustainable, coordinated and whole school dropout prevention \nprograms. Funds can be used to implement comprehensive school wide \nreforms, create alternative school programs or create smaller learning \ncommunities. In addition, grant recipients could contract with \ncommunity-based organizations to assist them in implementing necessary \nservices.\n  The Access to High Standards Act is intended to help foster the \ncontinued growth of advanced placement programs throughout the nation \nand to help ensure equal access to these programs for low income \nstudents. Advanced placement programs already provide rigorous \nacademics and valuable college credits at half the high schools in the \nUnited states, serving over 1.5 million students last year. Many states \nthat have advanced placement incentive programs have already had \ntremendous success in increasing participation rates, raising \nachievement and increasing the involvement of low-income and under \nserved students. Nevertheless, students, especially low-income \nstudents, continue to be denied or have limited access to this \nimportant educational resource. Over forty percent of our nation's \npublic schools still do not offer any Advanced Placement courses. As \nmany of my colleagues know, college costs have risen many times faster \nthan inflation over the last decade, making it difficult for many \nstudents to afford the high costs of obtaining a college education. \nAdvanced placement programs address this issue by giving students an \nopportunity to earn college credit in high school by preparing for and \npassing AP exams. In fact, a single AP English test score of 3 or \nbetter is worth approximately $500 in tuition at the University of New \nMexico and the credits granted to AP students nationwide are worth \nbillions of dollars in savings each year.\n  By promoting AP courses, we also address the need to raise academic \nstandards. AP courses provide schools with high academic standards and \nstandardized achievement measures. Participating in AP courses helps \nstudent prepare for college as they serve to connect curriculum between \nhigh school and post secondary institutions. And, because the vast \nmajority of AP teachers teach several non-AP courses as well, AP \nprograms have the effect of raising school wide standards and \nachievement. Of course, there is no single remedy or federal program \nthat can hope to address all of the issues that public education must \nface in order to improve the achievement of our students. However, I \nbelieve that high college costs and low academic standards deserve our \nclose attention and I am confident that expansion of advanced placement \nprograms will help states address these issues effectively.\n  In order to ensure that our children are well-prepared to meet the \nchallenges of an increasingly complex and challenging world, it is \ncritical to address improving our nation's school with a comprehensive \neffort. The bills I introduce today are designed to build on the \nprogress we have made in the past few years to raise standards and \nincrease accountability in America's schools. I ask unanimous consent \nto have the bills printed in the record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider supporting passage \nof these bills.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 101\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       ``(1) far too many students are not being provided \n     sufficient academic preparation in secondary school, which \n     results in limited employment opportunities, college dropout \n     rates of over 25 percent for the first year of college, and \n     remediation for almost one-third of incoming college \n     freshmen;\n       ``(2) there is a growing consensus that raising academic \n     standards, establishing high academic expectations, and \n     showing concrete results are at the core of improving public \n     education;\n       ``(3) modeling academic standards on the well-known program \n     of advanced placement courses is an approach that many \n     education leaders and almost half of all States have \n     endorsed;\n       ``(4) advanced placement programs already are providing 30 \n     different college-level courses, serving almost 60 percent of \n     all secondary schools, reaching over 1,000,000 students (of \n     whom 80 percent attend public schools, 55 percent are \n     females, and 30 percent are minorities), and providing test \n     scores that are accepted for college credit at over 3,000 \n     colleges and universities, every university in Germany, \n     France, and Austria, and most institutions in Canada and the \n     United Kingdom;\n       ``(5) 24 States are now funding programs to increase \n     participation in advanced placement programs, including 19 \n     States that provide funds for advanced placement teacher \n     professional development, 3 States that require that all \n     public secondary schools offer advanced placement courses, 10 \n     States that pay the fees for advanced placement tests for \n     some or all students, and 4 States that require that their \n     public universities grant uniform academic credit for scores \n     of 3 or better on advanced placement tests; and\n       ``(6) the State programs described in paragraph (5) have \n     shown the responsiveness of schools and students to such \n     programs, raised the academic standards for both students \n     participating in such programs and other children taught by \n     teachers who are involved in advanced placement courses, and \n     shown tremendous success in increasing enrollment, \n     achievement, and minority participation in advanced placement \n     programs.\n       ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this part are--\n       ``(1) to encourage more of the 600,000 students who take \n     advanced placement courses but do not take advanced placement \n     exams each year to demonstrate their achievements through \n     taking the exams;\n       ``(2) to build on the many benefits of advanced placement \n     programs for students, which benefits may include the \n     acquisition of skills that are important to many employers, \n     Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) scores that are 100 points \n     above the national averages, and the achievement of better \n     grades in secondary school and in college than the grades of \n     students who have not participated in the programs;\n       ``(3) to support State and local efforts to raise academic \n     standards through advanced placement programs, and thus \n     further increase the number of students who participate and \n     succeed in advanced placement programs;\n       ``(4) to increase the availability and broaden the range of \n     schools that have advanced placement programs, which programs \n     are still often distributed unevenly among regions, States, \n     and even secondary schools within the same school district, \n     while also increasing and diversifying student participation \n     in the programs;\n       ``(5) to build on the State programs described in \n     subsection (a)(5) and demonstrate that larger and more \n     diverse groups of students can participate and succeed in \n     advanced placement programs;\n       ``(6) to provide greater access to advanced placement \n     courses for low-income and other disadvantaged students;\n       ``(7) to provide access to advanced placement courses for \n     secondary school juniors at schools that do not offer \n     advanced placement programs, increase the rate of secondary \n     school juniors and seniors who participate in advanced \n     placement courses to 25 percent of the secondary school \n     student population, and increase the numbers of students who \n     receive advanced placement test scores for which college \n     academic credit is awarded; and\n       ``(8) to increase the participation of low-income \n     individuals in taking advanced placement tests through the \n     payment or partial payment of the costs of the advanced \n     placement test fees.\n\n     ``SEC. 10995C.

A bill to require equitable coverage of prescription \ncontraceptive drugs and devices, and contraceptive services under \nhealth plans; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                 equitable coverage under health plans\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today, with Senator \nSnowe, the Equity in Prescription and Contraception Coverage Act of \n2001 (EPICC).\n  Our legislation would require insurers, HMOs and employee health \nbenefit plans that offer prescription drug benefits to cover \ncontraceptive drugs and devices approved by the FDA. Further, it would \nrequire these insurers to cover outpatient contraceptive services if a \nplan covers other outpatient services. Lastly, it would prohibit the \nimposition of copays and deductibles for prescription contraceptives or \noutpatient services that are greater than those for other prescription \ndrugs.\n  Our bill gives Americans on both sides of the abortion debate the \nopportunity to join together in the common goal of preventing \nunintended pregnancies. I am pleased that we have support from both \npro-life and pro-choice Senators for this bill.\n  We are introducing EPICC today--the first legislative day of the \n107th Congress--because equity in prescription contraception coverage \nis long overdue. Senator Snowe and I first introduced this bill in \n1997. Since this time, the Viagra pill went on the market, and one \nmonth later was covered by most indemnity policies. Birth control \npills, which have been on the market since 1960, are covered by only \nthirty-three percent of insurance plans.\n  Most recently, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \n(EEOC) issued a decision finding that an employer's failure to include \ninsurance coverage for prescription contraceptives in an employee \nhealth benefits plan, when it covers other prescription drugs and \ndevices, constitutes unlawful sex discrimination under Title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964.\n  The EEOC ruling is an important step toward ensuring that women have \naccess to affordable contraceptives. At the same time, it highlights \nthe importance of our legislation because title VII applies only to \nemployers; it does not cover insurance providers. An estimated 16 \nmillion Americans obtain health insurance from private insurance other \nthan employer-provided plans. Only the enactment of EPICC will ensure \nthat contraceptive coverage is offered by insurance providers.\n  Our efforts have not been entirely without results. For the past \nthree consecutive years, we have passed a provision in the Treasury-\nPostal Appropriations bill that requires Federal\n\n[[Page S376]]\n\nhealth plans to cover prescription contraceptives. It is time to pass \nEPICC and extend this law to all Americans.\n  It is time to pass EPICC because EPICC is about equality for women. \nFor all the advances women have made, they still earn 74 cents for \nevery dollar a man makes and on top of that, they pay 68 percent more \nin out of pocket costs for health care than men. Reproductive health \ncare services account for much of this 68 percent difference. You can \nbe sure, if men had to pay for contraceptive drugs and devices, the \ninsurance industry would cover them.\n  It is time to pass EPICC because the health industry has done a poor \njob of responding to women's health needs. According to a study done by \nthe Alan Guttmacher Institute, 49 percent of all large-group health \ncare plans do not routinely cover any contraceptive method at all, and \nonly 15 percent cover all five of the most common contraceptive \nmethods. Women are forced to use disposable income to pay for family \nplanning services not covered by their health insurance. ``The Pill''--\none of the most common birth control methods, can cost over $300 a \nyear. Women who lack disposable income are forced to use less reliable \nmethods of contraception.\n  It is time to pass EPICC because each year approximately 3 million \npregnancies, or 50 percent of all pregnancies, in this country are \nunintended. Of these unintended pregnancies, about half end in \nabortion. Reliable family planning methods must be made available if we \nwish to reduce this disturbing number.\n  It is time to pass EPICC because insurance companies routinely cover \nmore expensive services, including abortions, sterilizations and tubal \nligations. Yet according to one study in the American Journal of Public \nHealth, health plans would accrue enough savings in pregnancy care \ncosts to cover oral contraceptives for all users under the plan by \nincreasing the number of women who use oral contraceptives by 15 \npercent. Studies indicate that for every dollar of public funds \ninvested in family planning, four to fourteen dollars of public funds \nis saved in pregnancy and health care-related costs. Not only will a \nreduction in unintended pregnancies reduce abortion rates, it will also \nlead to a reduction in low-birth weight, infant mortality and maternal \nmorbidity.\n  It is time to pass EPICC because access to contraception will bring \ndown the unintended pregnancy rate, ensure good reproductive health for \nwomen, and reduce the number of abortions. It is vitally important to \nthe health of our country that quality contraception is not beyond the \nfinancial reach of women. Regardless of where you stand on the abortion \nissue, prevention is the common ground on which we can all stand. I \nurge you to join me in supporting EPICC.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague form Nevada, \nSenator Harry Reid, to reintroduce the Equity in Prescription Insurance \nand Contraceptive Coverage Act.\n  Today is the 28th anniversary of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision--\nan anniversary which makes it especially poignant to reintroduce EPICC \ntoday. There are three million unintended pregnancies every year--half \nof all pregnancies that occur every year in this country. And \nfrighteningly, approximately half of all unintended pregnancies end in \nabortion.\n  I am firmly pro-choice and I believe in a woman's right to a safe and \nlegal abortion when she needs this procedure. But I want abortion to be \nan option that a woman rarely needs.\n  The simplest and most effective means of reducing the number of \nabortions is to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies in America. \nAnd the safest and most effective means of preventing unintended \npregnancies are with prescription contraceptives. Unfortunately, while \nthe vast majority of insurers cover prescription drugs, they treat \nprescription contraceptives very differently. In fact, half of large \ngroup plans exclude coverage of contraceptives. And only one-third \ncover oral contraceptives--the most popular form of reversible birth \ncontrol.\n  When one realizes the insurance ``carve-out'' for these prescriptions \nand related outpatient treatments, it is no longer a mystery why women \nspend 68 percent more than men in out-of-pocket health care costs. No \nwoman should have to forgo or rely on inexpensive and less effective \ncontraceptives for purely economic reasons, knowing that she risks an \nunintended pregnancy.\n  For the last three years Congress has required the health plans \nparticipating in the Federal Employees Heath Benefit Program--the \nlargest employer-sponsored health insurance plan in the country--to \nprovide prescription contraceptive coverage if they cover prescription \ndrugs as a part of their benefits package. The protections we afford to \nMembers of Congress, their staff, other federal employees and \nannuitants, and to the approximately two million women of reproductive \nage who are participating in FEHBP need and deserve to be extended to \nthe rest of the country.\n  Last December 13, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled \nthat excluding contraceptives from health insurance plans is a \nviolation of the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act, which requires \nequal treatment of women ``affected by pregnancy, childbirth or related \nmedical conditions,'' in all aspects of employment, including fringe \nbenefits.\n  The EEOC said that the Act also protects women against discrimination \nbecause they have the ability to become pregnant, not just because they \nare already pregnant. According to the EEOC's ruling, excluding \ncontraceptives also amounts to sex discrimination because these \nprescriptions are available only for women. Furthermore, excluding \ncontraceptives due to possible increased costs is not valid--under the \nPregnancy Discrimination Act Congress specifically rejected costs as a \ndefense.\n  Unfortunately, the ruling only applies to the two cases examined by \nthe EEOC and is not a general ``policy guidance'' that would apply to \nall employers. These two particular health plans must cover \ncontraceptives, the ruling said, because they already cover a wide \nrange of preventive services, including vaccinations, drugs to control \nblood pressure, weight loss medication and preventive dental care.\n  Another health plan--one that doesn't cover these services--might not \nbe in violation of the law. But most health plans cover similar \nservices, and the decision announced in December could be used by other \nwomen who seek coverage from their employers.\n  The Pregnancy Discrimination Act--and this EEOC decision--only \nreaches employers of 15 people or more. The Equity in Prescription \nInsurance Contraceptive Coverage Act reaches all insurance plans, no \nmatter the size, and includes individual insurance--not just employer-\nsponsored insurance plans.\n  The time has come for Congress to act, once and for all, to ensure \nequity in prescription insurance coverage. The EEOC's decision provides \na powerful impetus for action in Congress, and demonstrates the degree \nof concern through the nation about unfair and discriminatory \nprescription practices. The EEOC decision highlights the problem; I \nbelieve passage of our legislation in Congress is the solution.\n  Unfortunately, the lack of contraceptive coverage in health insurance \nis not news to most women. Countless American women have been shocked \nto learn that their insurance does not cover contraceptives, one of \ntheir most basic health care needs, even though other prescription \ndrugs which are equally valuable to their lives are routinely covered. \nLess than half--49 percent--of all large-group health care plans cover \nany contraceptive method at all and only 15 percent cover the five most \ncommon reversible birth control methods. HMOs are more likely to cover \ncontraceptives, but only 39 percent cover all five reversible methods. \nAnd ironically, 86 percent of large group plans, preferred provider \norganizations, and HMOs cover sterilization and between 66 and 70 \npercent of these different plans do cover abortion.\n  Thirteen states require their state-regulated health plans to \ncoverage prescription contraceptive: Maryland, Connecticut, Georgia, \nHawaii, New Hampshire, Nevada, North Carolina, Vermont, California, \nDelaware, Iowa, Rhode Island, and my home state of Maine. We need to \nensure that this protection is expanded to all states.\n  The concept underlying EPICC is simple. This legislation says that if \ninsurers cover prescription drugs and devices, they must also cover \nFDA-approved prescription contraceptives.\n\n[[Page S377]]\n\nAnd in conjunction with this, EPICC requires health plans which already \ncover basic health care services to also cover outpatient services \nrelated to prescription contraceptives.\n  The bill does not require insurance companies to cover prescription \ndrugs. What the bill does say is that if insurers cover prescription \ndrugs, they cannot carve prescription contraceptives out of their \nformularies. And it says that insurers which cover outpatient health \ncare services cannot limit or exclude coverage of the medical and \ncounseling services necessary for effective contraceptive use.\n  This bill is good health policy. By helping families to adequately \nspace their pregnancies, contraceptives contribute to healthy \npregnancies and healthy births, reduce rates of maternal complications, \nand reduces the possibility of low-birthweight births.\n  Furthermore, the Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive \nCoverage Act makes good economic sense. We know that contraceptives are \ncost-effective: in the public sector, for every dollar invested in \nfamily planning, $4 to $14 is saved in health care and related costs. \nAnd all methods of reversible contraceptives are cost-effective when \ncompared to the cost of unintended pregnancy. A sexually active women \nwho uses no contraception costs the health care provider an average of \n$3,225 in a given year. The average cost of an uncomplicated vaginal \ndelivery in 1993 was approximately $6,400. and for every 100 women who \ndo not use contraceptives in a given year, 85 percent will become \npregnant.\n  Why do insurance companies exclude prescription contraceptive \ncoverage from their list of covered benefits--especially when they \ncover other prescription drugs? The tendency of insurance plans to \ncover sterilization and abortion reflects, in part, their long-standing \ntendency to cover surgery and treatment over prevention. But insurers \ndo not feel compelled to cover prescription contraceptives because they \nknow that most women who lack contraceptive coverage will simply pay \nfor them out of pocket. And in order to prevent an unintended \npregnancy, a women needs to be on some from of birth control for almost \n30 years of her life.\n  The Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act \ntells insurance companies that we can no longer tolerate policies that \ndisadvantage women and disadvantage our nation. When our bill is \npassed, women will finally be assured of equity in prescription drug \ncoverage and health care services. And America's unacceptably high \nrates of unintended pregnancies and abortions will be reduced in the \nprocess.\n  The philosophy behind the bill is that contraceptives should be \ntreated no differently than any other prescription drug or device. It \ndoes not give contraceptives any type of special insurance coverage, \nbut instead seeks to achieve equity of treatment and parity of \ncoverage. For that reason, the bill specifies that if a plan imposes a \ndeductible or cost-sharing requirement on prescription drugs or \ndevices, it can impose the same deductible or cost-sharing requirement \non prescription contraception. But it cannot charge a higher cost-\nsharing requirement or deductible on contraceptives. Outpatient \ncontraceptive services must also be treated similarly to general \noutpatient health care services.\n  Time and time again Americans have expressed the desire for their \nleaders to come together to work on the problems that face us. This \nbill exemplifies that spirit of cooperation. It crosses some very wide \ngulfs and makes some very meaningful changes in policy that will \nbenefit countless Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 105. A bill to amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to prohibit \nthe Secretary of Agriculture from basing minimum prices for Class I \nmilk on the distance or transportation costs from any location that is \nnot within a marketing area, except under certain circumstances, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                           dairy legislation\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a measure which \nwill serve as a first step towards eliminating the inequities borne by \nthe dairy farmers of Wisconsin and the upper Midwest under the Federal \nMilk Marketing Order system.\n  The Federal Milk Marketing Order system, created nearly 60 years ago, \nestablishes minimum prices for milk paid to producers throughout \nvarious marketing areas in the U.S. For sixty years, this system has \ndiscriminated against producers in the Upper Midwest by awarding a high \nprice to dairy farmers in proportion to the distance of their farms \nfrom Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n  This legislation is very simple. It identifies the single most \nharmful and unjust feature of the current system, and corrects it.\n  Under the current archaic law, the price for fluid milk increases \ndepending on the distance from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, even though most \nmilk marketing orders do not receive any milk from Wisconsin.\n  The bill I introduce today will prohibit the Secretary of Agriculture \nfrom using distance or transportation costs from any location as the \nbasis for pricing milk, unless significant quantities of milk are \nactually transported from that location into the recipient market. The \nSecretary will have to comply with the statutory requirement that \nsupply and demand factors be considered as specified in the \nAgricultural Marketing Agreement Act when setting milk prices in \nmarketing orders. The fact remains that single-basing-point pricing \nsimply cannot be justified based on supply and demand for milk both in \nlocal and national markets.\n  This bill also requires the Secretary to report to Congress on \nspecifically which criteria are used to set milk prices. Finally, the \nSecretary will have to certify to Congress that the criteria used by \nthe Department do not in any way attempt to circumvent the prohibition \non using distance or transportation cost as basis for pricing milk.\n  This one change is so crucial to Upper Midwest producers, because the \ncurrent system has penalized them for many years. By providing \ndisparate profits for producers in other parts of the country and \ncreating artificial economic incentives for milk production, Wisconsin \nproducers have seen national surpluses rise, and milk prices fall. \nRather than providing adequate supplies of fluid milk in some parts of \nthe country, the prices have led to excess production.\n  The prices have provided production incentives beyond those needed to \nensure a local supply of fluid milk in some regions, leading to an \nincrease in manufactured products in those marketing orders. Those \nmanufactured products directly compete with Wisconsin's processed \nproducts, eroding our markets and driving national prices down.\n  The perverse nature of this system is further illustrated by the fact \nthat since 1995 some regions of the U.S., notably the Central states \nand the Southwest, are producing so much milk that they are actually \nshipping fluid milk north to the Upper Midwest. The high fluid milk \nprices have generated so much excess production, that these markets \ndistant from Eau Claire are now encroaching upon not only our \nmanufactured markets, but also our markets for fluid milk, further \neroding prices in Wisconsin.\n  The market distorting effects of the fluid price differentials in \nfederal orders are manifest in the Congressional Budget Office estimate \nthat eliminating the orders would save $669 million over five years. \nGovernment outlays would fall, CBO concludes, because production would \nfall in response to lower milk prices and there would be fewer \ngovernment purchases of surplus milk. The regions which would gain and \nlose in this scenario illustrate the discrimination inherent to the \ncurrent system. Economic analyses show that farm revenues in a market \nundisturbed by Federal Orders would actually increase in the Upper \nMidwest and fall in most other milk-producing regions.\n  While this system has been around since 1937, the practice of basing \nfluid milk price differentials on the distance from Eau Claire was \nformalized in the 1960's, when the Upper Midwest arguably was the \nprimary reserve for additional supplies of milk. The idea was to \nencourage local supplies of fluid milk in areas of the country that did \nnot traditionally produce enough fluid milk to meet their own needs.\n  Mr. President, that is no longer the case. The Upper Midwest is \nneither the\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\nlowest cost production area nor a primary source of reserve supplies of \nmilk. In many of the markets with higher fluid milk differentials, milk \nis produced efficiently, and in some cases, at lower cost than the \nupper Midwest. Unfortunately, the prices didn't adjust with changing \neconomic conditions, most notably the shift of the dairy industry away \nfrom the Upper Midwest and towards the Southwest, specifically \nCalifornia, which now leads the nation in milk production.\n  Fluid milk prices should have been lowered to reflect that trend. \nInstead, in 1985, the prices were increased for markets distant from \nEau Claire. USDA has refused to use the administrative authority \nprovided by Congress to make the appropriate adjustments to reflect \neconomic realities. They continue to stand behind single-basing-point \npricing.\n  The result has been a decline in the Upper Midwest dairy industry, \nnot because they can't produce a product that can compete in the market \nplace, but because the system discriminates against them. Today, \nWisconsin loses dairy farmers at a rate of more than 5 per day. The \nUpper Midwest, with the lowest fluid milk prices, is shrinking as a \ndairy region despite the dairy-friendly climate of the region. Other \nregions with higher fluid milk prices are growing rapidly.\n  In an unregulated market with a level playing field, these shifts in \nproduction might be fair. But in a market where the government is \nsetting the prices and providing that artificial advantage to regions \noutside the Upper Midwest, the current system is unconscionable.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and bring reform to this \nout-dated system and work to eliminate the inequities in the current \nmilk marketing order pricing system. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 105\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the provisions of titles 5 and 28, United \nStates Code, relating to equal access to justice, award of reasonable \ncosts and fees, taxpayers' recovery of costs, fees, and expenses, \nadministrative settlement offers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               equal access to justice reform legislation\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Equal \nAccess to Justice Reform Amendments of 2001. This legislation contains \nadjustments to the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) that will \nstreamline and improve the process of awarding attorney's fees to \nprivate parties who prevail in litigation against the Federal \ngovernment. This is the now the fourth Congress in which I have \nintroduced this legislation. I believe these reforms are an important \nstep in reducing the burden of defending government litigation for many \nindividuals and small businesses.\n  I am very pleased to be joined in introducing this legislation once \nagain this year by my friend from Arkansas, Sen. Tim Hutchinson. We \nhope that by working on a bipartisan basis on this important project we \ncan improve the chances that it can become law.\n  Over the years, members of Congress often speak of ``getting \ngovernment off the backs of the American people.'' Sometimes we \ndisagree about when government is a burden and when it is giving a \nhelping hand. But all of us in the Senate want to reform government in \nways that will improve the lives of people all across this nation. The \nlegislation we are proposing today deals directly with a problem that \naffects everyday Americans who face legal battles with the federal \ngovernment and prevail. Even if they win in court, they may still lose \nfinancially because of the expense of paying their attorneys.\n  At the outset, it is important to understand what the Equal Access to \nJustice Act is, and why it exists. The premise of this statute is very \nsimple. EAJA places individuals and small businesses who face the \nUnited States Government in litigation on more equal footing with the \ngovernment by establishing guidelines for the award of attorney's fees \nwhen the individual or small business prevails. Quite simply, EAJA \nacknowledges that the resources available to the federal government in \na legal dispute far outweigh those available to most Americans. This \ndisparity is lessened by requiring the government in certain instances \nto pay the attorneys' fees of successful private parties. By giving \nsuccessful parties the right to seek attorneys' fees from the United \nStates, EAJA seeks to prevent small business owners and individuals \nfrom having to risk their companies or their family savings in order to \nseek justice.\n  My interest in this issue predates my election to the Senate. It \narises from my experience both as a private attorney and a Member of \nthe state Senate in my home state of Wisconsin. While in private \npractice, I became aware of how the ability to recoup attorney's fees \nis a significant factor, and often one of the first considered, when \ndeciding whether or not to seek redress in the courts or to defend a \ncase. Upon entering the Wisconsin State Senate, I authored legislation \nmodeled on the federal law, which had been championed by one of my \npredecessors in this body from Wisconsin, Senator Gaylord Nelson. \nToday, section 814.246 of the Wisconsin statutes contains provisions \nsimilar to the federal EAJA statute.\n  It seemed to me then, as it does now, that we should do all that we \ncan to help ease the financial burdens on people who need to have their \nclaims reviewed and decided by impartial decision makers. To this end, \nI have reviewed the existing federal statutes with an eye toward \nimproving them and making them work better. The bill Sen. Hutchinson \nand I are introducing today does a number of things to make EAJA more \neffective for individuals and small business men and women all across \nthis country.\n  First and most important, this legislation eliminates the provision \nin current law that allows the government to avoid paying attorneys' \nfees when it loses a suit if it can show that its position was \nsubstantially justified. I believe that this high threshold for \nobtaining attorneys' fees is unfair. If an individual or small business \nbattles the federal government in an adversarial proceeding and \nprevails, the government should simply pay the fees incurred. Imagine \nthe scenario of a small business that spends time and money dueling \nwith the government and wins, only to find out that it must now \nundertake the additional step of litigating the justification of \ngovernment's litigation position. For the government, with its vast \nresources, this second litigation over fees poses little difficulty, \nbut for the citizen or small business it may simply not be financially \nfeasible.\n  Not only is this additional step a financial burden on the private \nlitigant, but a 1992 study also reveals that it is unnecessary and a \nwaste of government resources. University of Virginia Professor Harold \nKrent on behalf of the Administrative Conference of the\n\n[[Page S379]]\n\nUnited States found that only a small percentage of EAJA awards were \ndenied because of the substantial justification defense. While it is \nimpossible to determine the exact cost of litigating the issue of \nsubtantial justification, it is Prof. Krent's opinion, based upon \nreview of cases in 1989 and 1990, that while the substantial \njustification defense may save some money, it was not enough to justify \nthe cost of the additional litigation. In short, eliminating this often \nburdensome second step is a cost effective step which will streamline \nrecovery under EAJA and may very well save the government money in the \nlong run.\n  The second part of this legislation that will streamline and improve \nEAJA is a provision designed to encourage settlement and avoid costly \nand protracted litigation. Under the bill, the government can make an \noffer of settlement after an application for fees and other expenses \nhas been filed. If the government's offer is rejected and the \nprevailing party seeking recovery ultimately wins a smaller award, that \nparty is not entitled to the attorneys' fees and costs incurred after \nthe date of the government's offer. Again, this will encourage \nsettlement, speed the claims process, and thereby reduce the time and \nexpense of the litigation.\n  The final improvement to EAJA included in this legislation is the \nremoval of the carve out of cases where the prevailing party is \neligible to get attorneys fees under section 7430 of the Internal \nRevenue Code. Under current law, EAJA is inapplicable in cases where a \ntaxpayer prevails against the government. I was an original cosponsor \nof a bill that suggested a similar reform introduced by Senator Leahy \nof Vermont in the 105th Congress. This provision helps to level the \nplaying field between the IRS and everyday citizens. There is no reason \nthat taxpayers should be treated differently than any other party that \nprevails in a case against the government. They deserve to have their \nfees paid if they win.\n  We all know that the American small business owner has a difficult \nroad to make ends meet and that unnecessary or overly burdensome \ngovernment regulation can be a formidable obstacle to doing business. \nIt can be the difference between success or failure. The Equal Access \nto Justice Act was conceived and implemented to help balance the \nformidable power of the federal government. It has already helped many \nAmericans. The legislation we are offering today will make EAJA more \neffective for more Americans while at the same time helping to deter \nthe government from acting in an indefensible and unwarranted manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 106\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleague \nSenator Feingold, to introduce the Equal Access to Justice (EAJA) \nReform Amendments of 2001. I do so because it is my sincere hope that \nthe 107th Congress will work in a bi-partisan manner to provide small \nbusiness owners and individuals who prevail in court against the \nfederal government with automatic reimbursement for their legal \nexpenses--thereby fulfilling the true intent of EAJA when passed in \n1980.\n  EAJA's initial premise was to reduce the vast disparity in resources \nand expertise which exists between small business owners or individuals \nand federal agencies and to encourage the government to ensure that the \nclaims it pursues are worthy of its efforts. Twenty years ago, former \nSenator Gaylord Nelson, the author of the original, bipartisan EAJA \nbill, clearly explained EAJA's intent when he stated, ``All I can say \nis the taxpayer is injured, and if the taxpayer was correct, and that \nis the finding, then we ought to make the taxpayer whole.'' I commend \nformer Senator Nelson. His steadfast commitment to our nation's \nbusinesses as Chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee is worthy \nof admiration. As a result of a political compromise, however, the \nfinal version of EAJA does not provide for an automatic award of \nattorneys' fees. Rather, it provides for an award of attorneys' fees \nonly when an agency or a court determines that the government's \nposition was not ``substantially justified'' or that ``special \ncircumstances'' exist which would make an award unjust.\n  Agencies and courts have strayed far from the original intent of EAJA \nby repeatedly using these provisions to avoid awarding attorneys' fees \nto small businesses and individuals who have successfully defended \nthemselves. The bill that Senator Feingold and I are introducing today, \nthe Equal Access to Justice Reform Amendments of 2001, would amend EAJA \nto provide that a small business owner or individual prevailing against \nthe government will be automatically entitled to recover their \nattorneys' fees and expenses incurred in their defense.\n  Unfortunately, EAJA is not making the taxpayers of this nation whole \nafter they defend themselves against government action. Thus, I ask \nthat my colleagues join Senator Feingold and myself in our effort to \nmake these American taxpayers whole by cosponsoring and supporting the \nEqual Access to Justice Reform Amendments of 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 107. A bill to allow modified bloc voting by cooperative \nassociations of milk producers in connection with a referendum on \nFederal Milk Marketing Order reform; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n               democracy for dairy producers act of 2001\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a measure that will \nbegin to restore to many dairy farmers throughout the nation, part of \nthe market power they have lost in recent years.\n  Mr. President, when dairy farmers across the country voted on a \nreferendum two years ago--perhaps the most significant change in dairy \npolicy in sixty years--they didn't actually get to vote. Instead, their \ndairy marketing cooperatives will cast their votes for them.\n  This procedure is called bloc voting and it is used all the time. \nBasically, a Cooperative's Board of Directors decides that, in the \ninterest of time, bloc voting will be implemented for that particular \nvote. In the interest of time, but not always in the interest of their \nproducer owner-members.\n  Mr. President, I do think that bloc voting can be a useful tool in \nsome circumstances, but I have serious concerns about its use in every \ncircumstance. Farmers in Wisconsin and in other states tell me that \nthey do not agree with their Cooperative's view on every vote. Yet, \nthey have no way to preserve their right to make their single vote \ncount.\n  After speaking to farmers and officials at USDA, I have learned that \nif a Cooperative bloc votes, individual members simply have no \nopportunity to voice opinions separately. That seems unfair when you \nconsider what a monumental issue is at stake. Coops and their members \ndo not always have identical interests. We shouldn't ask farmers to \nignore that fact.\n  Mr. President, the Democracy for Dairy Producers Act of 2001 is \nsimple and fair. It provides that a cooperative cannot deny any of its \nmembers a ballot if one or two or ten or all of the members chose to \nvote on their own.\n  This will in no way slow down the process at USDA; implementation of \nany rule or regulation would be able to proceed on schedule. Also, I do \nnot expect that this would change the final outcome of any given vote. \nCoops could still cast votes for their members who do not exercise \ntheir right to vote individually. And to the extent that coops \nrepresent farmers interest, farmers are likely to vote along with the \ncoops, but whether they join the coops or not, farmers deserve the \nright to vote according to their own views.\n  I urge my colleagues to return just a little bit of power to \nAmerica's farmers, and a little bit of pure democracy to the vote on \nissues that have such an impact on their future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Democracy for Dairy Producers \nAct, a dairy bill without regional bias.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 107\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce the number of executive branch political \nappointees; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n    legislation to Reduce the Number of Executive Branch Political \n                              Appointments\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce legislation \nto reduce the number of presidential political appointees. \nSpecifically, the bill caps the number of political appointees at \n2,000. The most recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates of \nthis measure is that it would save $382 million over the next five \nyears, and $872 million over the next 10 years.\n  The bill is based on the recommendations of a number of distinguished \npanels, including most recently, the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force \non the Presidential Appointment Process. The task force findings are \nonly the latest in a long line of recommendations that we reduce the \nnumber of political appointees in the Executive Branch. For many years, \nthe proposal has been included in CBO's annual publication Reducing the \nDeficit: Spending and Revenue Options, and it was one of the central \nrecommendations of the National Commission on the Public Service, \nchaired by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker.\n  Between 1980 and 1992, the ranks of political appointees grew 17 \npercent, over three times as fast as the total number of Executive \nBranch employees and looking back to 1960 their growth is even more \ndramatic. In his book Thickening Government: Federal Government and the \nDiffusion of Accountability, author Paul Light reports a startling 430 \npercent increase in the\n\n[[Page S381]]\n\nnumber of political appointees and senior executives in Federal \ngovernment between 1960 and 1992.\n  Mr. President, it is essential that any Administration be able to \nimplement the policies that brought it into office in the first place. \nGovernment must be responsive to the priorities of the electorate. But \nas the Volcker Commission noted, the great increase in the number of \npolitical appointees in recent years has not made government more \neffective or more responsive to political leadership. Indeed, in their \nreport, the Volcker Commission argued that the growing number of \npresidential appointees may ``actually undermine effective presidential \ncontrol of the executive branch.'' The report went on to note that the \nlarge number of presidential appointees simply cannot be managed \neffectively by any President or White House. The Commission argued that \nthis lack of control and political focus ``may actually dilute the \nPresident's ability to develop and enforce a coherent, coordinated \nprogram and to hold cabinet secretaries accountable.''\n  Adding organizational layers of political appointees can also \nrestrict access to important resources, while doing nothing to reduce \nbureaucratic impediments.\n  In commenting on this problem, author Light noted, ``As this sediment \nhas thickened over the decades, presidents have grown increasingly \ndistant from the lines of government, and the front lines from them.'' \nLight added that ``Presidential leadership, therefore, may reside in \nstripping government of the barriers to doing its job effectively. . \n.''\n  The Volcker Commission also asserted that this thickening barrier of \ntemporary appointees between the President and career officials can \nundermine development of a proficient civil service by discouraging \ntalented individuals from remaining in government service or even \npursuing a career in government in the first place.\n  Mr. President, former Attorney General Elliot Richardson put it well \nwhen he noted:\n\n       But a White House personnel assistant sees the position of \n     deputy assistant secretary as a fourth-echelon slot. In his \n     eyes that makes it an ideal reward for a fourth-echelon \n     political type - a campaign advance man, or a regional \n     political organizer. For a senior civil servant, it's irksome \n     to see a position one has spent 20 or 30 years preparing for \n     preempted by an outsider who doesn't know the difference \n     between an audit exception and an authorizing bill.\n\n  Mr. President, the report of the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on \nthe Presidential Appointment Process identified another problem \naggravated by the excessive number of political appointees, namely the \nincreasingly lengthy process of filling these thousands of positions. \nAs the Task Force reported, both President Bush and President Clinton \nwere into their presidencies for many months before their leadership \nteams were fully in place. The Task Force noted that ``on average, \nappointees in both administrations were confirmed more than eight \nmonths after the inauguration--one-sixth of an entire presidential \nterm.'' By contrast, the report noted that in the presidential \ntransition of 1960, ``Kennedy appointees were confirmed, on average, \ntwo and a half months after the inauguration.''\n  In addition to leaving vacancies among key leadership positions in \ngovernment, the appointment process delays can have a detrimental \neffect on potential appointees. The Twentieth Century Fund Task Force \nreported that appointees can ``wait for months on end in a limbo of \nuncertainty and awkward transition from the private to the public \nsector.''\n  Mr. President, as we reduce the number of government employees, \nstreamline agencies, and make government more responsive, we should \nalso right size the number of political appointees, ensuring a \nsufficient number to implement the policies of any Administration \nwithout burdening the Federal budget with unnecessary, possibly \ncounterproductive political jobs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record immediately following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 108\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF POLITICAL APPOINTEES.\n\n       (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``political \n     appointee'' means any individual who--\n       (1) is employed in a position on the executive schedule \n     under sections 5312 through 5316 of title 5, United States \n     Code;\n       (2) is a limited term appointee, limited emergency \n     appointee, or noncareer appointee in the senior executive \n     service as defined under section 3132(a) (5), (6), and (7) of \n     title 5, United States Code, respectively; or\n       (3) is employed in a position in the executive branch of \n     the Government of a confidential or policy-determining \n     character under Schedule C of subpart C of part 213 of title \n     5 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (b) Limitation.--The President, acting through the Office \n     of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel \n     Management, shall take such actions as necessary (including \n     reduction in force actions under procedures established under \n     section 3595 of title 5, United States Code) to ensure that \n     the total number of political appointees shall not exceed \n     2,000.\n       (c) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on \n     October 1, 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 109. A bill to establish the Dairy Farmer Viability Commission, to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                       Dairy Farmer Viability Act\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Dairy \nFarmers Viability Act, legislation to establish a Commission to provide \nCongress with legislative and administrative recommendations to address \ndairy farming prices, stability, and marketplace competition and \nconcentration.\n  As Congress moves to revise the 1996 farm bill, it is of paramount \nimportance that we fashion dairy policies to meet the needs of all \ndairy farmers. I have taken the floor a number of times to talk about \nthe challenges facing Wisconsin's dairy farmers, and many of those \nchallenges are a result of inequities in the current pricing structure \nof milk. While I may disagree on many levels with my friend from \nVermont, Senator Jeffords, there are a number of issues that face all \ndairy farmers, whether they are in Vermont, Idaho or Wisconsin.\n  This commission will help Congress address many of these common \nconcerns, such as reducing the concentration in the marketplace, \nincreasing competition in rural America, and improving farm-gate \nprices. I hope my colleagues will work with us to move this commission \nforward quickly and help to address the concerns of dairy farmers \nnationwide.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 109\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Dairy Farmer Viability \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the farm-retail price spread (the difference between \n     farm and retail values) for dairy products has doubled since \n     the early 1980's;\n       (2) the price of raw milk sent to the market by dairy \n     producers has fallen to levels received in 1978; and\n       (3) the number of family-sized dairy operations has \n     decreased by almost 75 percent in the last 2 decades, with \n     some States losing nearly 10 percent of their dairy farmers \n     in recent months.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established a commission to be \n     known as the ``Dairy Farmer Viability Commission'' (referred \n     to in this Act as the ``Commission'').\n       (b) Membership.--\n       (1) Composition.--The Commission shall be composed of 15 \n     members appointed by the Secretary.\n       (2) Prohibition on federal government employment.--A member \n     of the Commission appointed under paragraph (1) shall not be \n     an employee or former employee of the Federal Government.\n       (3) Date of appointments.--The appointment of a member of \n     the Commission shall be made as soon as practicable after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Term; Vacancies.--\n       (1) Term.--A member shall be appointed for the life of the \n     Commission.\n       (2) Vacancies.--A vacancy on the Commission--\n       (A) shall not affect the powers of the Commission; and\n       (B) shall be filled in the same manner as the original \n     appointment was made.\n\n[[Page S382]]\n\n       (d) Initial Meeting.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n     on which all members of the Commission have been appointed, \n     the Commission shall hold the initial meeting of the \n     Commission.\n       (e) Meetings.--The Commission shall meet at the call of the \n     Chairperson.\n       (f) Quorum.--A majority of the members of the Commission \n     shall constitute a quorum, but a lesser number of members may \n     hold hearings.\n       (g) Chairperson and Vice Chairperson.--The Commission shall \n     select a Chairperson and Vice Chairperson from among the \n     members of the Commission.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Few people have that ability. Most of our \nconstituents do not have that power. And that this power is so unusual \nis good reason for the Congress to exercise that power openly, and to \nexercise it subject to regular procedures that include debate, \namendment, and a vote on the Record.\n  Last year, the Senate initially voted down the conference report on \nthe Legislative Branch Appropriations bill. As I noted during the \ndebate on that bill, by considering the Treasury-Postal appropriations \nbill as part of that conference report, shielded as it was from \namendment, the Senate blocked any opportunity to force an open debate \nof a $3,800 pay raise for every Member of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives. This process of pay raises without accountability must \nend.\n  The stealth pay raise technique began with a change Congress enacted \nin the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. In section 704 of that Act, Members \nof Congress voted to make themselves entitled to an annual raise equal \nto half a percentage point less than the employment cost index, one \nmeasure of inflation. Many times, Congress has voted to deny itself the \nraise, and Congress traditionally does that on the Treasury-Postal \nAppropriations bill.\n  And by bringing the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill to the Senate \nfloor for the first time last year in a conference report, without \nSenate floor consideration, the majority leadership prevented anyone \nfrom offering an amendment on that bill to block the pay raise. The \nmajority leadership tried to make it impossible even to put Senators on \nrecord in an up-or-down vote directly for or against the pay raise, \nnearly perfecting the technique of the stealth pay raise.\n  The question of how and whether Members of Congress can raise their \nown pay was one that our Founders considered from the beginning of our \nNation. In August of 1789, as part of the package of 12 amendments \nadvocated by James Madison that included what has become our Bill of \nRights, the House of Representatives passed an amendment to the \nConstitution providing that Congress could not raise its pay without an \nintervening election. Almost exactly 211 years ago, on September 9, \n1789, the Senate passed that amendment. In late September of 1789, \nCongress submitted the amendments to the states.\n  Although the amendment on pay raises languished for two centuries, in \nthe 1980s, a campaign began to ratify it. While I was a member of the \nWisconsin state Senate, I was proud to help ratify the amendment. Its \napproval by the Michigan legislature on May 7, 1992, gave it the needed \napproval by three-fourths of the states.\n  The 27th Amendment to the Constitution now states: ``No law, varying \nthe compensation for the services of the senators and representatives, \nshall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have \nintervened.''\n  I try to honor that limitation in my own practices. In my own case, \nthroughout my 6-year term, I accept only the rate of pay that Senators \nreceive on the date on which I was sworn in as a Senator. And I return \nto the Treasury any additional income Senators get, whether from a \ncost-of-living adjustment or a pay raise we vote for ourselves. I don't \ntake a raise until my bosses, the people of Wisconsin, give me one at \nthe ballot box. That is the spirit of the 27th Amendment. The stealth \npay raises like the one that Congress allowed last year, at a minimum, \ncertainly violate the spirit of that amendment.\n\n[[Page S383]]\n\n  Mr. President, this practice must end. To address it, I am re-\nintroducing this bill to end the automatic cost-of-living adjustment \nfor Congressional pay. Senators and Congressmen should have to vote up-\nor-down to raise Congressional pay. My bill would simply require us to \nvote in the open. We owe our constituents no less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record immediately following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 110\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of \n1983 to ensure that all persons who benefit from the dairy promotion \nand research program contribute to the cost of the program; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                      dairy promotion fairness act\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nKohl to introduce the ``Dairy Promotion Fairness Act.'' This \nlegislation provides equity to domestic producers who have been paying \ninto the Promotion Program while importers have gotten a free ride. \nSince the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board conducts only \ngeneric promotion and general product research, domestic farmers and \nimporters alike benefit from these actions. The Dairy Promotion \nFairness Act requires that all dairy product importers contribute to \nthe program.\n  This bill supports the dairy marketing board's efforts to educate \nconsumers on the nutritional value of dairy products. It also treats \nour farmers fairly--by asking them not to bear the entire financial \nburden for a promotional program that benefits importers and domestic \nproducers alike. We have put our own producers at a competitive \ndisadvantage for far too long. It's high time importers paid for their \nfair share of the program.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 111\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to terminate production under the D5 submarine-\nlaunched ballistic missile program and to prohibit the backfit of \ncertain Trident I ballistic missile submarines to carry D5 submarine-\nlaunched ballistic missiles; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                          DEFENSE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing two bills that I \nhope will be a first step in helping to change fundamentally the way we \nthink about our national defense.\n  As I have said time and again, I strongly support our Armed Forces \nand the excellent work they are doing to combat the new threats of the \n21st century and beyond. I am concerned, however, that we are not \ngiving our forces the tools they need to combat these emerging threats. \nInstead, a Cold War mentality continues to permeate the United States \ndefense establishment and we still cling to the strategies and weapons \nthat we used to fight--and win--the Cold War.\n  We have an historic opportunity, Mr. President. There is a new \nPresident, a new Congress, and a pending Quadrennial Defense Review--\nall at the dawn of a new millennium. We should take advantage of this \nopportunity by restructuring our national defense policy to combat the \nthreats of the new century instead of continuing to guard against the \nlong-defeated perils of the last one.\n  In the coming months, I will introduce and support a number of \ninitiatives that I hope will help to turn the focus of our national \ndefense policy away from the Cold War that has already been won and \ntoward fielding a strong, agile force that can meet the emerging \nthreats of the new century head on.\n  The two bills I am introducing today are a first step toward this \ngoal. One of these bills would terminate the operation of the Navy's \nExtremely Low Frequency communications system (Project ELF). The other \nwould end production of the Navy's Trident II submarine-launched \nballistic missile and would prohibit certain back-fits of Trident I \nsubmarines.\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\n  Both of these systems were designed to protect the United States \nagainst an attack by the Soviet Union. Trident submarines, and the \ndeadly submarine-launched ballistic missiles they carry, were designed \nspecifically to attack targets inside the Soviet Union from waters off \nthe continental United States. Project ELF was designed to send short \none-way messages to ballistic and attack submarines that are submerged \nin deep waters.\n  The first bill I am introducing today would terminate operations \nunder Project ELF, which is located in Clam Lake, Wisconsin, and \nRepublic, Michigan. I would like to thank the senior Senator from \nWisconsin [Mr. Kohl] and the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden] for \ncosponsoring this bill.\n  This bill would terminate operations at Project ELF, while \nmaintaining the infrastructure in Wisconsin and Michigan in the event \nthat a resumption in operations becomes necessary. If enacted, this \nbill would save taxpayers nearly $14 million per year.\n  Project ELF is ineffective and unnecessary in the post-Cold War era. \nSince ELF cannot transmit detailed messages, it serves as an expensive \n``beeper'' system to tell submarines to come to the surface to receive \nmessages from other sources, and the subs cannot send a return message \nto ELF in the event of an emergency. It takes ELF four minutes to send \na three-letter message to a deeply submerged submarine.\n  With the end of the Cold War, Project ELF becomes harder and harder \nto justify. Our submarines no longer need to take that extra precaution \nagainst Soviet nuclear forces. They can now surface on a regular basis \nwith less danger of detection or attack. They can also receive more \ncomplicated messages through very low frequency (VLF) radio waves or \nlengthier messages through satellite systems. It is hard to understand \nwhy the taxpayers continue to be asked to pay $14 million a year for \nwhat amounts to a beeper system that tells our submarines to come to \nthe surface to receive orders from another, more sophisticated source.\n  Further, continued operation of this facility is opposed by most \nresidents in my state. The members of the Wisconsin delegation have \nfought hard for years to close down Project ELF; I have introduced \nlegislation during each Congress since taking office in 1993 to \nterminate it; and I have even recommended it for closure to the Defense \nBase Closure and Realignment Commission.\n  Project ELF has had a turbulent history. Since the idea for ELF was \nfirst proposed in 1958, the project has been changed or canceled \nseveral times. Residents of Wisconsin have opposed ELF since its \ninception, but for years we were told that the national security \nconsiderations of the Cold War outweighed our concerns about this \ninstallation in our state. Ironically, this system became fully \noperational in 1989--the same year the tide of democracy began to sweep \nacross Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Now, twelve years later, \nthe hammer and sickle has fallen and the Russian submarine fleet is in \ndisarray. But Project ELF still remains as a constant, expensive \nreminder to the people of my state that the Department of Defense \nremains focused on the past.\n  There also continue to be a number of public health and environmental \nconcerns associated with Project ELF. For almost two decades, we have \nreceived inconclusive data on this project's effects on Wisconsin and \nMichigan residents. In 1984, a U.S. District Court ordered that ELF be \nshut down because the Navy paid inadequate attention to the system's \npossible health effects and violated the National Environmental Policy \nAct. Interestingly, that decision was overturned because U.S. national \nsecurity, at the time, prevailed over public health and environmental \nconcerns.\n  Numerous medical studies point to a possible link between exposure to \nextremely low frequency electromagnetic fields and a variety of human \nhealth effects and abnormalities in both animal and plant species.\n  In 1999, after six years of research, the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences released a report that did not prove \nconclusively a link between electromagnetic fields and cancer, but the \nreport did not disprove it, either. Serious questions remain, Mr. \nPresident, and many of my constituents are rightly concerned about this \nissue.\n  In addition, I have heard from a number of dairy farmers who are \nconvinced that the stray voltage associated with ELF transmitters has \ndemonstrably reduced milk production. As we continue our efforts to \nproduce a sustainable balanced federal budget and reduce the national \ndebt, and as the Department of Defense continues to struggle to address \nreadiness and other concerns, it is clear that outdated programs such \nas Project ELF should be closed down.\n  The second bill I am introducing today would terminate production \nunder the Navy's Trident II submarine-launched ballistic missile \nprogram. It would also prohibit the Navy from moving forward with the \nplanned back-fits of two Trident I submarines to carry Trident II \nmissiles, which are currently scheduled for 2005 and 2006.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the Senator from Iowa \n[Mr. Harkin], the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], and the \nSenator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden].\n  Let me say at the outset that my bill will in no way prevent the Navy \nfrom maintaining the current arsenal of Trident II missiles. Nor will \nit affect those Trident II missiles that are currently in production.\n  Mr. President, the Navy currently has ten Trident II submarines, each \nof which carries 24 Trident II (D5) missiles. Each of these missiles \ncontains eight independently targetable nuclear warheads, for a total \nof 192 warheads per submarine. Each warhead packs between 300 to 450 \nkilotons of explosive power.\n  By comparison, the first atomic bomb that the United States dropped \non Hiroshima generated 15 kilotons of force. Let's do the math for just \none fully-equipped Trident II submarine.\n  Each warhead can generate up to 450 kilotons of force.\n  Each missile has eight warheads, and each submarine has 24 missiles.\n  That equals 86.4 megatons of force per submarine. That means that \neach Trident II submarine carries the power to deliver devastation \nwhich is the equivalent of 5,760 Hiroshimas.\n  And that is just one fully equipped submarine. As I noted earlier, \nthe Navy currently has ten such submarines.\n  Through fiscal year 2001, the Navy will have been authorized to \npurchase 384 Trident II missiles for these submarines. Even taking into \naccount the 78 Trident II missiles that have been expended through \ntesting through calendar year 2000 and the four more that are scheduled \nto be expended this year, the Navy will still have 302 missiles in \nstock once those authorized to be purchased during FY2001 are \ncompleted.\n  The Navy needs 240 missiles to fully equip ten Trident II submarines \nwith 24 missiles each. That leaves 62 ``extra'' missiles in the Navy's \ninventory. And the Navy still plans to buy 41 more missiles over the \nnext four years, for a total purchase of 425 missiles. My bill would \nterminate production of these missiles after the currently authorized \n384.\n  In addition to the ten Trident II submarines, the Navy also has eight \nTrident I submarines. The Navy plans to remove four of these submarines \n(the Ohio, the Florida, the Michigan, and the Georgia) from strategic \nservice in 2003 and 2004 in order to comply with the provisions of the \nSTART II treaty. Current plans call for the other four Trident I \nsubmarines to be back-fitted to carry Trident II missiles. One of these \nback-fits began in May 2000 (the Alaska); another is scheduled to begin \nin February 2001 (the Nevada). The Navy wants to back-fit the last two \nTrident I submarines (the Henry M. Jackson and the Alabama) in 2005 and \n2006. My bill would prohibit those last two back-fits. It would not \naffect the back-fits of the Alaska and the Nevada.\n  Thus, once the back-fits of the Alaska and the Nevada are completed, \nthe Navy will have a fleet of twelve submarines capable of carrying \nTrident II missiles. This is more than enough firepower to be an \neffective deterrent against the moth-balled Russian submarine fleet and \nagainst the ballistic missile aspirations of rogue states including \nChina and North Korea.\n  I recognize that there is still a potential threat from rogue states \nand from independent operators who seek to acquire ballistic missiles \nand other weapons of mass destruction. I also recognize that our \nsubmarine fleet and our\n\n[[Page S385]]\n\narsenal of strategic nuclear weapons still have an important role to \nplay in warding off these threats. Their role, however, has diminished \ndramatically from what it was at the height of the Cold War. Our \nmissile procurement and equipment upgrade decisions should reflect that \nchange and should reflect the realities of the post-Cold War world.\n  Our current ballistic missile capability is far superior to that of \nany other country on the globe. And the capability of the Russian \nmilitary--the very force which these missiles were designed to \ncounter--is seriously degraded.\n  I cannot understand the need for more Trident II missiles and more \nsubmarines to carry them at a time when the Governments of the United \nStates and Russia are in negotiations to implement START II and are \nalso discussing a framework for START III. These agreements call for \nreductions in our nuclear arsenal, not increases. To spend scarce \nresources on building more missiles now and on back-fitting two more \nsubmarines to carry them in the coming years is short-sighted and could \nseriously undermine our efforts to negotiate further arms reductions \nwith Russia.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, we should reexamine our national \ndefense policy at the earliest possible date. The forthcoming \nQuadrennial Defense Review presents an excellent opportunity to do just \nthat. We should not miss this opportunity to begin to transform our \nArmed Forces from the structure and strategies that won the Cold War to \na fiscally responsible force that is adequately trained and equipped to \ncombat the new challenges of the 21st century and beyond. The \nlegislation I am introducing today is a step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both of these bills be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 112\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to terminate the Uniformed Services University of the \nHealth Sciences; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n  terminating the uniformed services university of the health sciences\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am today re-introducing legislation \nterminating the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences \n(USUHS), a medical school run by the Department of Defense. The measure \nis one I proposed when I ran for the U.S. Senate, and was part of a \nlarger, 82 point plan to reduce the Federal budget deficit. The most \nrecent estimates of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) project that \nterminating the school would save $273 million over the next five \nyears, and when completely phased-out, would generate $450 million in \nsavings over five years.\n  USUHS was created in 1972 to meet an expected shortage of military \nmedical personnel. Today, however, USUHS accounts for only a small \nfraction of the military's new physicians, less than 12 percent in 1994 \naccording to CBO. This contrasts dramatically with the military's \nscholarship program which provided over 80 percent of the military's \nnew physicians in that year.\n  Mr. President, what is even more troubling is that USUHS is also the \nsingle most costly source of new physicians for the military. CBO \nreports that based on figures from 1995, each USUHS trained physician \ncosts the military $615,000. By comparison, the scholarship program \ncost about $125,000 per doctor, with other sources providing new \nphysicians at a cost of $60,000. As CBO has noted, even adjusting for \nthe lengthier service commitment required of USUHS trained physicians, \nthe cost of training them is still higher than that of training \nphysicians from other sources, an assessment shared by the Pentagon \nitself. Indeed, CBO's estimate of the savings generated by this measure \nalso includes the cost of obtaining physicians from other sources.\n  The House of Representatives has voted to terminate this program on \nseveral occasions, and the Vice President's National Performance Review \njoined others, ranging from the Grace Commission to the CBO, in raising \nthe question of whether this medical school, which graduated its first \nclass in 1980, should be closed because it is so much more costly than \nalternative sources of physicians for the military.\n  Mr. President, the real issue we must address is whether USUHS is \nessential to the needs of today's military structure, or if we can do \nwithout this costly program. The proponents of USUHS frequently cite \nthe higher retention rates of USUHS graduates over physicians obtained \nfrom other sources as a justification for continuation of this program, \nbut while a greater percentage of USUHS trained physicians may remain \nin the military longer than those from other sources, the Pentagon \nindicates that the alternative sources already provide an appropriate \nmix of retention rates. Testimony by the Department of Defense before \nthe Subcommittee on Force Requirements and Personnel noted that the \nmilitary's scholarship program meets the retention needs of the \nservices.\n  And while USUHS only provides a small fraction of the military's new \nphysicians, it is important to note that relying primarily on these \nother sources has not compromised the ability of military physicians to \nmeet the needs of the Pentagon. According to the Office of Management \nand Budget, of the approximately 2,000 physicians serving in Desert \nStorm, only 103, about 5%, were USUHS trained.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by recognizing that USUHS has some \ndedicated supporters in the U.S. Senate, and I realize that there are \nlegitimate arguments that those supporters have made in defense of this \ninstitution. The problem, however, is that the federal government \ncannot afford to continue every program that provides some useful \nfunction.\n  This is especially true in the area of defense spending. Many in this \nbody argue that the Defense budget is too tight, that a significant \nincrease in spending is needed to address concerns about shortfalls in \nrecruitment and retention, maintenance backlogs, and other indicators \nof a lower level of readiness.\n  Mr. President, the debate over our level of readiness is certainly \nimportant, and it may well be that more Defense funding should be \nchanneled to\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\nthese specific areas of concern. But before advocates of an increased \nDefense budget ask taxpayers to foot the bill for hundreds of billions \nmore in spending, they owe it to those taxpayers to trim Defense \nprograms that are not justified.\n  In the face of our staggering national debt, we must prioritize and \neliminate programs that can no longer be sustained with limited federal \ndollars, or where a more cost-effective means of fulfilling those \nfunctions can be substituted. The future of USUHS continues to be \ndebated precisely because it does not appear to pass the higher \nthreshold tests which must be applied to all federal spending programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 114\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe percentage depletion allowance for certain hardrock mines, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  legislation to eliminate percentage depletion allowances on public \n                                 lands\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \neliminate from the federal tax code percentage depletion allowances for \nhardrock minerals mined on federal public lands. I am joined in \nintroducing this legislation by my colleagues from Vermont, the senior \nSenator (Mr. Leahy) and the junior Senator (Mr. Jeffords).\n  President Clinton proposes the elimination of the percentage \ndepletion allowance on public lands in his FY 2001 budget. The \nPresident's FY 2001 budget estimated that, under this legislation, \nincome to the federal treasury from the elimination of percentage \ndepletion allowances for hardrock mining on public lands would total \n$410 million over five years, and $823 million over ten years. These \nsavings are calculated as the excess amount of federal revenues above \nwhat would be collected if depletion allowances were limited to sunk \ncosts in capital investments. Percentage depletion allowances are \ncontained in the tax code for extracted fuel, minerals, metal and other \nmined commodities. These allowances have a combined value, according to \nestimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation, of $4.8 billion.\n  Mr. President, these percentage depletion allowances were initiated \nby the Corporation Excise Act of 1909. That's right, Mr. President, \ninitiated in 1909. Provisions for a depletion allowance based on the \nvalue of the mine were made under a 1912 Treasury Department \nregulation, but difficulty in applying this accounting principle to \nmineral production led to the initial codification of the mineral \ndepletion allowance in the Tariff Act of 1913. The Revenue Act of 1926 \nestablished percentage depletion much in its present form for oil and \ngas. The percentage depletion allowance was then extended to metal \nmines, coal, and other hardrock minerals by the Revenue Act of 1932, \nand has been adjusted several times since.\n  Percentage depletion allowances were historically placed in the tax \ncode to reduce the effective tax rates in the mineral and extraction \nindustries far below tax rates on other industries, providing \nincentives to increase investment, exploration and output. However, \npercentage depletion also makes it possible to recover many times the \namount of the original investment.\n\n  There are two methods of calculating a deduction to allow a firm to \nrecover the costs of their capital investment: cost depletion, and \npercentage depletion. Cost depletion for the recovery of the actual \ncapital investment--the costs of discovery, purchasing, and developing \na mineral reserve--over the period during which the reserve produces \nincome. Using cost depletion, a company would deduct a portion of its \noriginal capital investment minus any previous deductions, in an amount \nthat is equal to the fraction of the remaining recoverable reserves. \nUnder this method, the total deductions cannot exceed the original \ncapital investment.\n  However, under percentage depletion, the deduction for recovery of a \ncompany's investment is a fixed percentage of ``gross income''--namely, \nsales revenue--from the sale of the mineral. Under this method, total \ndeductions typically exceed, let me be clear on that point, Mr. \nPresident, exceed the capital that the company invested.\n  The rates for percentage depletion are quite significant. Section 613 \nof the U.S. Code contains depletion allowances for more than 70 metals \nand minerals, at rates ranging from 10 percent to 22 percent.\n  In addition to repealing the percentage depletion allowances for \nminerals mined on public lands, Mr. President, my bill also creates a \nnew fund, called the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. One fourth of the \nrevenue raised by the bill, or approximately $120 million dollars, will \nbe deposited into an interest bearing fund in the Treasury to be used \nto clean up abandoned hardrock mines in states that are subject to the \n1872 Mining Law. The Mineral Policy Center estimates that there are \n557,650 hardrock abandoned mine sites nationwide and the cost of \ncleaning them up will range from $32.7 billion to $71.5 billion.\n  There are currently no comprehensive federal or state programs to \naddress the need to clean up old mine sites. Reclaiming these sites \nrequires the enactment of a program with explicit authority to clean up \nabandoned mine sites and the resources to do it. My legislation is a \nfirst step toward providing the needed authority and resources.\n  Mr. President, in today's budget climate we are faced with the \nquestion of who should bear the costs of exploration, development, and \nproduction of natural resources: all taxpayers, or the users and \nproducers of the resource? For more than a century, the mining industry \nhas been paying next to nothing for the privilege of extracting \nminerals from public lands and then abandoning its mines. Now those \nmines are adding to the nation's environmental and financial burdens. \nWe face serious budget choices this fiscal year, yet these subsidies \nremain a persistent tax expenditure that raise the deficit for all \ncitizens or shift a greater tax burden to other taxpayers to compensate \nfor the special tax breaks provided to the mining industry.\n  Mr. President, the measure I am introducing is fairly \nstraightforward. It eliminates the percentage depletion allowance for \nhardrock minerals mined on public lands while continuing to allow \ncompanies to recover reasonable cost depletion.\n  Though at one time there may have been an appropriate role for a \ngovernment-driven incentive for enhanced mineral production, there is \nnow sufficient reason to adopt a more reasonable depletion allowance \nthat is consistent with those given to other businesses.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for the Federal Government to get \nout of the business of subsidizing business. We can no longer afford \nits costs in dollars or its cost to the health of our citizens.\n\n[[Page S387]]\n\nThis legislation is one step toward the goal of ending these corporate \nwelfare subsidies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 115\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 to clarify \nthe acreage limitations and incorporate a means test for certain farm \noperations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                irrigation subsidy reduction act of 2001\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a measure that \nI sponsored in the 106th Congress to reduce the amount of federal \nirrigation subsidies received by large agribusiness interests. I \nbelieve that reforming federal water pricing policy by reducing \nsubsidies is important as a means to achieve our broader objectives of \nachieving a truly balanced budget. This legislation is also needed to \ncurb fundamental abuses of reclamation law that cost the taxpayer \nmillions of dollars every year.\n  In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt proposed legislation, which \ncame to be known as the Reclamation Act of 1902, to encourage \ndevelopment of family farms throughout the western United States. The \nidea was to provide needed water for areas that were otherwise dry and \ngive small farms--those no larger than 160 acres--a chance, with a \nhelping hand from the federal government, to establish themselves. \nAccording to a 1996 General Accounting Office report, since the passage \nof the Reclamation Act, the federal government has spent $21.8 billion \nto construct 133 water projects in the west which provide water for \nirrigation. Irrigators, and other project beneficiaries, are required \nunder the law to repay to the federal government their allocated share \nof the costs of constructing these projects.\n  However, as a result of the subsidized financing provided by the \nfederal government, some of the beneficiaries of federal water projects \nrepay considerably less than their full share of these costs. According \nto the 1996 GAO report, irrigators generally receive the largest amount \nof federal financial assistance. Since the initiation of the irrigation \nprogram in 1902, construction costs associated with irrigation have \nbeen repaid without interest. The GAO further found, in reviewing the \nBureau of Reclamation's financial reports, that $16.9 billion, or 78 \npercent, of the $21.8 billion of federal investment in water projects \nis considered to be reimbursable. Of the reimbursable costs, the \nlargest share--$7.1 billion--is allocated to irrigators. As of \nSeptember 30, 1994 irrigators have repaid only $941 million of the $7.1 \nbillion they owe. GAO also found that the Bureau of Reclamation will \nlikely shift $3.4 billion of the debt owed by irrigators to other users \nof the water projects for repayment.\n  There are several reasons why irrigators continue to receive such \nsignificant subsidies. Under the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, \nCongress acted to expand the size of the farms that could receive \nsubsidized water from 160 acres to 960 acres. The RRA of 1982 expressly \nprohibits farms that exceed 960 acres in size from receiving federally-\nsubsidized water. These restrictions were added to the Reclamation law \nto close loopholes through which federal subsidies were flowing to \nlarge agribusinesses rather than the small family farmers that \nReclamation projects were designed to serve. Agribusinesses were \nexpected to pay full cost for all water received on land in excess of \ntheir 960 acre entitlement. Despite the express mandate of Congress, \nregulations promulgated under the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 have \nfailed to keep big agricultural water users from receiving federal \nsubsidies. The General Accounting Office and the Inspector General of \nthe Department of the Interior continue to find that the acreage limits \nestablished in law are circumvented through the creation of \narrangements such as farming trusts. These trusts, which in total \nacreage well exceed the 960 acre limit, are comprised of smaller units \nthat are not subject to the reclamation acreage cap. These smaller \nunits are farmed under a single management agreement often through a \ncombination of leasing and ownership.\n  In a 1989 GAO report, the activities of six agribusiness trusts were \nfully explored. According to GAO, one 12,345\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\nacre cotton farm (roughly 20 square miles), operating under a single \npartnership, was reorganized to avoid the 960 acre limitation into 15 \nseparate land holdings through 18 partnerships, 24 corporations, and 11 \ntrusts which were all operated as one large unit. A seventh very large \ntrust was the sole topic of a 1990 GAO report. The Westhaven trust is a \n23,238 acre farming operation in California's Central Valley. It was \nformed for the benefit of 326 salaried employees of the J.G. Boswell \nCompany. Boswell, GAO found, had taken advantage of section 214 of the \nRRA, which exempts from its 960 acre limit land held for beneficiaries \nby a trustee in a fiduciary capacity, as long as no single \nbeneficiary's interest exceeds the law's ownership limits. The RRA, as \nI have mentioned, does not preclude multiple land holdings from being \noperated collectively under a trust as one farm while qualifying \nindividually for federally subsidized water. Accordingly, the J.G. \nBoswell Company re-organized 23,238 acres it held as the Boston Ranch \nby selling them to the Westhaven Trust, with the land holdings \nattributed to each beneficiary being eligible to receive federally \nsubsidized water.\n  Before the land was sold to Westhaven Trust, the J.G. Boswell Company \noperated the acreage as one large farm and paid full cost for the \nfederal irrigation water delivered for the 18-month period ending in \nMay 1989. When the trust bought the land, due to the loopholes in the \nlaw, the entire acreage became eligible to receive federally subsidized \nwater because the land holding attributed to the 326 trust \nbeneficiaries range from 21 acres to 547 acres--all well under the 960 \nacre limit.\n  In the six cases the GAO reviewed in 1989, owners or lessees paid a \ntotal of about $1.3 million less in 1987 for federal water then they \nwould have paid if their collective land holdings were considered as \nlarge farms subject to the Reclamation Act acreage limits. Had \nWesthaven Trust been required to pay full cost, GAO estimated in 1990, \nit would have paid $2 million more for its water. The GAO also found, \nin all seven of these cases, that reduced revenues are likely to \ncontinue unless Congress amends the Reclamation Act to close the \nloopholes allowing benefits for trusts.\n  The Department of the Interior has acknowledged that these problems \ndo exist. Interior published a final rulemaking in 1998 to require farm \noperators who provide services to more than 960 nonexempt acres \nwestwide, held by a single trust or legal entity or any combination of \ntrusts and legal entities to submit RRA forms to the district(s) where \nsuch land is located. Water districts are now required to provide \nspecific information about farm operators to Interior annually. This \ninformation is an important step toward enforcing the legislation that \nI am reintroducing today.\n  This legislation combines various elements of proposals introduced by \nother members of Congress to close loopholes in the 1982 legislation \nand to impose a $500,000 means-test. This new approach limits the \namount of subsidized irrigation water delivered to any operation in \nexcess of the 960 acre limit which claimed $500,000 or more in gross \nincome, as reported on their most recent IRS tax form. If the $500,000 \nthreshold were exceeded, an income ratio would be used to determine how \nmuch of the water should be delivered to the user at the full-cost \nrate, and how much at the below-cost rate. For example, if a 961 acre \noperation earned $1 million, a ratio of $500,000 (the means-test value) \ndivided by their gross income would determine the full cost rate, thus \nthe water user would pay the full cost rate on half of their acreage \nand the below cost rate on the remaining half.\n  This means-testing proposal was featured, for the fifth year in a \nrow, in the 2000 Green Scissors report. This report is compiled \nannually by Friends of the Earth and Taxpayers for Common Sense and \nsupported by a number of environmental, consumer and taxpayer groups. \nThe premise of the report is that there are a number of subsidies and \nprojects that could be cut to both reduce the deficit and benefit the \nenvironment. This report underscores what I and many others in the \nSenate have long known: we must eliminate practices that can no longer \nbe justified in light of our effort to achieve a truly balanced budget \nand eliminate our national debt. The Green Scissors recommendation on \nmeans-testing water subsidies indicates that if a test is successful in \nreducing subsidy payments to the highest grossing 10% of farms, then \nthe federal government would recover between $440 million and $1.1 \nbillion per year, or at least $2.2 billion over five years.\n  When countless federal program are subjected to various types of \nmeans-test to limit benefits to those who truly need assistance, it \nmakes little sense to continue to allow large business interests to dip \ninto a program intended to help small entities struggling to survive. \nTaxpayers have legitimate concerns when they learn that their hard \nearned tax dollars are being expended to assist large corporate \ninterests in select regions of the country who benefit from these \nloopholes, particularly in tight budgetary times. Other users of \nfederal water projects, such as the power recipients, should also be \nconcerned when they learn that they will be expected to pick up the tab \nfor a portion of the funds that irrigators were supposed to pay back. \nThe federal water program was simply never intended to benefit these \nlarge interests, and I hope that legislative efforts, such as the \nmeasure I am introducing today, will prompt Congress to fully \nreevaluate our federal water pricing policy.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, it is clear that the conflicting \npolicies of the federal government in this area are in need of reform, \nand that Congress should act. Large agribusinesses should not be able \nto continue to soak the taxpayers, and should pay their fair share. We \nshould act to close these loopholes and increase the return to the \ntreasury from irrigators as soon as possible. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the measure be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 116\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Federal reclamation program has been in existence \n     for over 90 years, with an estimated taxpayer investment of \n     over $70,000,000,000;\n       (2) the program has had and continues to have an enormous \n     effect on the water resources and aquatic environments of the \n     western States;\n       (3) irrigation water made available from Federal water \n     projects in the West is a very valuable resource for which \n     there are increasing and competing demands;\n       (4) the justification for providing water at less than full \n     cost was to benefit and promote the development of small \n     family farms and exclude large corporate farms, but this \n     purpose has been frustrated over the years due to inadequate \n     implementation of subsidy and acreage limits;\n       (5) below-cost water prices tend to encourage excessive use \n     of scarce water supplies in the arid regions of the West, and \n     reasonable price increases to the wealthiest western farmers \n     would provide an economic incentive for greater water \n     conservation;\n       (6) the Federal Government has increasingly applied \n     eligibility tests based on income for Federal entitlement and \n     subsidy programs, measures that are consistent with the \n     historic approach of the reclamation program's acreage \n     limitations that seek to limit water subsidies to smaller \n     farms; and\n       (7) including a means test based on gross income in the \n     reclamation program will increase the effectiveness of \n     carrying out the family farm goals of the Federal reclamation \n     laws.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to prohibit products that contain dry ultra-filtered \nmilk products or casein from being labeled as domestic natural cheese, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                           quality cheese act\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Quality \nCheese Act of 2000. This legislation will protect the consumer, save \ntaxpayer dollars and provide support to America's dairy farmers, who \nhave taken a beating in the marketplace in recent years.\n  When Wisconsin consumers have the choice, they will choose natural \nWisconsin cheese, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) may change current law, and \nconsumers won't know whether cheese is really all natural or not.\n  If the federal government creates a loophole for imitation cheese \ningredients to be used in U.S. cheese vats, cheese bearing the labels \n``domestic'' and ``natural'' will no longer be truly accurate.\n  If USDA and FDA allow a change in federal rules, imitation milk \nproteins known as milk protein concentrate or casein, could be used to \nmake cheese in\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\nplace of the wholesome natural milk produced by cows in Wisconsin or \nother part of the U.S.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned by recent efforts to change \nAmerica's natural cheese standard. This effort to allow milk protein \nconcentrate and casein into natural cheese products flies in the face \nof logic and could create a loophole for unlimited amounts of \nsubstandard imported milk proteins to enter U.S. cheese vats.\n  My legislation will close this loophole and ensure that consumers can \nbe confident that they are buying natural cheese when they see the \nnatural label.\n  Our dairy farmers have invested heavily in processes that make the \nbest quality cheese ingredients, and I am concerned about recent \nefforts to change the law that would penalize them for those efforts by \nallowing lower quality ingredients to flood the U.S. market.\n  Over the past decade, cheese consumption has risen at a strong pace \ndue to promotional and marketing efforts and investments by dairy \nfarmers across the country. Year after year, per capita cheese \nconsumption has risen at a steady rate.\n  Back in the 1980's, when I served in the Wisconsin State Senate, \ncheese consumption topped 20 pounds per person. During the 1990s \nconsumption increased by over 25 percent, and passed 25 pounds per \nperson. Last year we saw an even more dramatic increase when per capita \ncheese consumption rose an amazing 1.5 pounds to reach 29.8 pounds.\n  This one-year increase amounts to the largest expansion since 1982! I \nam proud to say that my home state of Wisconsin, America's dairyland, \nwas one of the main engines behind this growth. After all, when \nconsumers see the label ``Wisconsin Cheese,'' they know that it is \nsynonymous with quality.\n  Over the past two decades consumers have increased their cheese \nconsumption due to their understanding, and taste for the quality \nnatural cheese produced by America's dairy industry.\n  Recent proposals to change to our natural cheese standard could \ndecrease consumption of natural cheese. These declines could result \nfrom concerns about the origin of casein and other forms of dry UF \nmilk.\n  The vast majority of dry ultra filtered milk originates from \ncountries with State Trading Enterprises. Many of these countries \nsubsidize their dairy exports through these trading mechanisms, and \nhave quality standards that are well below those of the United States.\n  While it is difficult to obtain specific numbers about the amount of \ndry UF milk produced in foreign countries, I have heard disturbing \nstories about the conditions under which the casein and milk proteins \nare sometimes produced.\n  For the most part, dry UF milk is not produced in the US. In fact, it \nis, for the most part, produced in countries where sanitary standards \nare well below those of the United States.\n  These products are sold on the international market, and under the \nproposed rule they could be labeled as natural cheese. This cheap, low \nquality dry UF milk tends to leave cheese greasy and increases \nseparation problems.\n  The addition of this kind of milk will certainly leave the wholesome \nreputation of ``natural cheese'' significantly tarnished in the eyes of \nthe consumer.\n  This change would seriously compromise decades of work by America's \ndairy farmers to build up domestic cheese consumption levels. It is \nsimply not fair to America's farmers!\n  Mr. President, consumers have a right to know if the cheese they buy \nis unnatural. And by allowing unnatural dry UF milk into cheese, we are \ndenying consumers the entire picture.\n  This legislation will paint the entire picture for the consumer, and \nallow them enough information to select cheese made from truly natural \ningredients.\n  Allowing dry Ultra-Filtered milk into cheeses will have a significant \nadverse impact on dairy producers throughout the United States. Some \nestimate that the annual effect of the change on the dairy farm sector \nof the economy could be more than $100 million.\n  The proposed change to our natural cheese standard would also harm \nthe American taxpayer.\n  If we allow dry UF milk to be used in cheese we will effectively \npermit unrestricted importation of these ingredients into the United \nStates. Because there are no tariffs and quotas on these ingredients, \nthese heavily subsidized products will displace natural domestic dairy \ningredients.\n  These unnatural domestic dairy products will enter our domestic \ncheese market and may further depress dairy prices paid to American \ndairy producers.\n  Low dairy prices result in increased costs to the dairy price support \nprogram. So, at the same time that U.S. dairy farmers are receiving \nlower prices, the U.S. taxpayer will be paying more for the dairy price \nsupport program.\n  Mr. President, this change does not benefit the dairy farmer, \nconsumer or taxpayer. Who then is it good for?\n  The obvious answer is nobody.\n  America's farmers have invested a tremendous amount of time and \neffort to create the best cheese industry in the world. They should not \nbe penalized for their efforts.\n  This legislation addresses the concerns of farmers, consumers and \ntaxpayers by prohibiting dry ultra-filtered milk from being included in \nAmerica's natural cheese standard.\n  Congress must shut the door on any backdoor efforts to stack the deck \nagainst America's dairy farmers. And we must pass my legislation that \nprevents a loophole that would allow changes that hurt the consumer, \ntaxpayer and dairy farmer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 117\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

NATURAL CHEESE STANDARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) any change in domestic natural cheese standards to \n     allow dry ultra-filtered milk products or casein to be \n     labeled as domestic natural cheese would result in increased \n     costs to the dairy price support program; and\n       (B) that change would be unfair to taxpayers, who would be \n     forced to pay more program costs;\n       (2) any change in domestic natural cheese standards to \n     allow dry ultra-filtered milk products or casein to be \n     labeled as domestic natural cheese would result in lower \n     revenues for dairy farmers;\n       (3) any change in domestic natural cheese standards to \n     allow dry ultra-filtered milk products or casein to be \n     labeled as domestic natural cheese would cause dairy products \n     containing dry ultra-filtered milk or casein to become \n     vulnerable to contamination and would compromise the \n     sanitation, hydrosanitary, and phytosanitary standards of the \n     United States dairy industry; and\n       (4) changing the labeling standard for domestic natural \n     cheese would be misleading to the consumer.\n       (b) Prohibition.--Section 401 of the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 341) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Whenever'' and inserting ``(a) \n     Whenever''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) The Commissioner may not use any Federal funds to \n     amend section 133.3 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations \n     (or any corresponding similar regulation or ruling), to \n     include dry ultra-filtered milk or casein in the definition \n     of the term `milk' or `nonfat milk', as specified in the \n     standards of identity for cheese and cheese products \n     published at part 133 of title 21, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (or any corresponding similar regulation or \n     ruling).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 118. A bill to strengthen the penalties for violations of plant \nquarantine laws; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n      fruit, vegetable, and plant smuggling prevention act of 2001\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto strengthen the penalties for organized smuggling of fruits, plants, \nand vegetables into the United States. A felony statute for agriculture \nproduct smuggling is needed to reflect the serious impact these crimes \nhave on our farmers and the entire agriculture industry.\n  Recent breaches of the agriculture safeguarding system have proven \nthe need for strong criminal penalties for organized smuggling: \nmultiple exotic fruit fly infestations have decimated California and \nFlorida; the Asian longhorn beetle has been found in New\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\nYork and Illinois; the Asian gypsy moth has been introduced in North \nCarolina and Oregon; and plum pox from Western Europe has devastated \npeach production in Pennsylvania.\n  This widespread invasion of foreign species requires a strong federal \nresponse. The consequences of failing to adequately combat agriculture \nsmuggling are clear.\n  Until recently, a 72 square mile area of San Diego was under \nquarantine due to an infestation of Mexican Fruit Flies. The quarantine \neffected 1,470 growers of at least 20 specialty crops. The Department \nof Agriculture has encouraged California producers to grow specialty \nfruits and vegetables in an effort to reduce the risk of exotic pest \nintroduction from smuggled fruit. Yet, no pre or post harvest treatment \nfor many of these crops has been provided by the USDA. As a result of 2 \nfruit flies, roughly 150 growers lost virtually their entire harvest--\nestimated more than $3 million.\n\n\n                      Problems with existing laws\n\n  The current system that charges low fines and encourages few \nprosecutions is not a meaningful deterrent for violators. The USDA can \nassess a maximum fine of $1,000 for passenger and cargo violations. For \nan illegal shipper, this is simply a minor cost of doing business and \nnot an effective deterrent.\n  In addition, the lack of serious penalties for such crimes has \nresulted in a reduced number of criminal investigations, violators \nprosecuted, and sentences given to those convicted.\n  The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the USDA, the law \nenforcement arm of the Department, has placed a low priority on \nagriculture smuggling violations because they are only misdemeanors and \nthe OIG is forced to devote the bulk of its resources to felony \nviolations. Of the 4,400 investigations completed since October 1, \n1994, fewer than 50 involved smuggling.\n  The sentences given to the relatively few convicted smugglers is also \neffected by the attitude that this is not a serious crime.\n  In the State of Washington, two people were caught smuggling \nagricultural products into the country on numerous occasions. Their \nthird arrest came after 400 pounds of illegal and infested fruit was \nfound in the walls of their station wagon. Despite their repeated \ncrimes, the smugglers received only two days of jail time and a fine of \n$1,000.\n\n\n                        penalties for violations\n\n  This legislation would make it a felony to knowingly and willfully \nsmuggle large amounts of agriculture products into the country. Persons \ncaught smuggling foreign plant pests, more than 50 pounds of plants, \nmore than 5 pounds of plant products, more than 50 pounds of noxious \nweeds, or possession with intent to distribute these products, would be \npunished with imprisonment for up to 5 years, a fine of as much as \n$25,000, or both. Repeat violators would face 10 years of jail time \nand/or a fine of $50,000.\n  The legislation would also make smuggling lesser amounts of products \na misdemeanor crime punishable by one year in jail and/or a $1,000 \nfine. Subsequent violations would result in three years of jail time \nand/or a fine of $10,000.\n  These penalties will provide law enforcement with the needed tools to \ninvestigate, arrest, and prosecute individuals and organizations \nengaged in the organized smuggling of agriculture products.\n\n\n                          property forfeitures\n\n  Another inadequacy in current law is the lack of a specific \nforfeiture provision for agriculture product smuggling. I have been \ntold of cases at the San Diego border in which a person has been caught \nsmuggling fruits or vegetables across the border. After receiving a \nslap on the wrist from the judicial system, his truck was returned to \nhim, and he was allowed to return to his criminal occupation with the \ntools of his trade intact. It is astonishing to me that, not only is \nthe government incapable of punishing illegal traffickers of \nagriculture products, but we are unable to take even modest steps to \nprevent recurrences of the same crime.\n  According to this legislation, anyone convicted of violating the law \nwould forfeit any property used to commit or facilitate the violation. \nThey would also forfeit any money acquired through a violation of the \nlaw. The proceeds of the sale of forfeited property would be used to \nreimburse the costs of the prosecution. Any additional funds would go \ntowards the USDA's interdiction efforts.\n  I believe that Congress must send a message to our farmers and \ngrowers that the federal government is committed to protecting the \nagriculture sector from invasive species. We can do this by passing \nthis legislation as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 118\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide States with funds to support State, \nregional, and local school construction; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n        building, renovating, and constructing kids' schools act\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Chafee, to introduce the Building, Renovating, Improving, and \nConstructing Kids' Schools (BRICKS) Act--legislation that would address \nour nation's burgeoning need for K-12 school construction, renovation, \nand repair.\n  The legislation--which is endorsed by the National Education \nAssociation and National PTA, and the National Association of State \nBoards of Education--would accomplish this in a fiscally-responsible \nmanner while seeking to find the middle ground between those who \nsupport a very direct, active federal role in school construction, and \nthose who are concerned about an expanded federal role in what has \nbeen--and remains--a state and local responsibility.\n  Mr. President, the condition of many of our nation's existing public \nschools is abysmal even as the need for additional schools and \nclassroom space grows. Specifically according to reports issued by the \nGeneral Accounting Office in 1995 and 1996, fully one-third of all \npublic schools need extensive repair or replacement.\n  As further evidence of this problem, an issue brief prepared by the \nNational Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in 1999 stated that the \naverage public school in America is 42 years old, with school buildings \nbeginning rapid deterioration after 40 years. In addition, the NCES \nbrief found that 29 percent of all public schools are in the ``oldest \ncondition,'' which means that they were build prior to 1970 and have \neither never been renovated or were renovated prior to 1980.\n  Not only are our nation's schools in need of repair and renovation, \nbut there is a growing demand for additional schools and classrooms due \nto an ongoing surge in student enrollment. Specifically, according to \nthe NCES, at least 2,400 new public schools will need to be built by \nthe year 2003 to accommodate our nation's burgeoning school rolls, \nwhich will grow from a record 52.7 million children today to 54.3 \nmillion by 2008.\n  Needless to say, the cost of addressing our nation's need for school \nrenovations and construction is enormous. In fact, according to the \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO), it will cost $112 billion just to \nbring our nation's schools into good overall condition, and a recent \nreport by the NEA identified $322 billion in unmet school modernization \nneeds. Nowhere is this cost better understood than in my home state of \nMaine, where a 1996 study by the Maine Department of Education and the \nState Board of Education determined that the cost of addressing the \nstate's school building and construction needs stood at $637 million.\n  Mr. President, we simply cannot allow our nation's schools to fall \ninto utter disrepair and obsolescence with children sitting in \nclassrooms that have leaky ceilings or rotting walls. We cannot ignore \nthe need for new schools as the record number of children enrolled in \nK-12 schools continues to grow.\n  Accordingly, because the cost of repairing and building these \nfacilities may prove to be more than many state and local governments \ncan bear in a short period of time, I believe the federal government \ncan and should assist Maine and other state and local governments in \naddressing this growing national crisis.\n  Admittedly, not all members support strong federal intervention in \nwhat has been historically a state and local responsibility. In fact, \nmany argue with merit that the best form of federal assistance for \nschool construction or other local educational needs would be for the \nfederal government to fulfill its commitment to fund 40 percent of the \ncost of special education. This long-standing commitment was made when \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education (IDEA) Act was signed into \nlaw\n\n[[Page S393]]\n\nmore than 20 years ago, but the federal government has fallen woefully \nshort in upholding its end of the bargain, only recently increasing its \nshare above 10 percent.\n  Needless to say, I strongly agree with those who argue that the \nfederal government's failure to fulfill this mandate represents nothing \nless than a raid on the pocketbook of every state and local government. \nAccordingly, I am pleased that recent efforts in the Congress have \nincreased federal funding for IDEA by approximately $3.8 billion over \nthe past five years, and I support ongoing efforts to achieve the 40 \npercent federal commitment in the near future.\n  Yet, even as we work to fulfill this long-standing commitment and \nthereby free-up local resources to address local needs, I believe the \nfederal government can do more to assist state and local governments in \naddressing their school construction needs without infringing on local \ncontrol.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we are offering today--the ``BRICKS \nAct''--will do just that. Specifically, it addresses our nation's \nschool construction needs in a responsible fiscal manner while bridging \nthe gap between those who advocate a more activist federal role in \nschool construction and those who do not.\n  First, our legislation will provide $20 billion in federal loans to \nsupport school construction, renovation, and repair at the local level. \nBy designating that at least one-half of these loan monies must be used \nto pay the interest owed to bondholders on new school construction \nbonds that are issued through the year 2003, the federal government \nwill leverage the issuing of new bonds by states and localities that \nwould not otherwise be made. In addition, by providing that up to one-\nhalf of the monies may be used for state-wide school construction \ninitiatives, the bill provides needed flexibility to ensure that unique \nstate and local approaches to school construction will also be \nsupported, such as revolving loan funds.\n\n  Of importance, these loan monies--which will be distributed on an \nannual basis using the Title I distribution formula--will become \navailable to each state at the request of a Governor. While the federal \nloans can only be used to support bond issues that will supplement, and \nnot supplant, the amount of school construction that would have \noccurred in the absence of the loans, there will be no requirement that \nstates engage in a lengthy application process that does not even \nassure them of their rightful share of the $20 billion pot.\n  Second, our bill ensures that these loans are made by the federal \ngovernment in a fiscally responsible manner that does not cut into the \nSocial Security surplus or claim a portion of non-Social Security \nsurpluses that may prove ephemeral in the future.\n  Specifically, our bill would make these loans to states from the \nExchange Stabilization Fund (ESF)--a fund that was created through the \nGold Reserve Act of 1934 and has grown to hold more than $40 billion in \nassets. The principal activity of the fund--which is controlled solely \nby the Secretary of the Treasury--is foreign exchange intervention that \nis intended to limit fluctuations in exchange rates. However, the fund \nhas also been used to provide stabilization loans to foreign countries, \nincluding a $20 billion line of credit to Mexico in 1995 to support the \npeso.\n  In light of the controversial manner in which the ESF has been used, \nsome have argued that additional constraints should be placed on the \nfund. Still others--including former Federal Reserve Board Governor \nLawrence B. Lindsey--have stated that, for various reasons, the fund \nshould be liquidated.\n  Regardless of how one feels about exercising greater constraint over \nthe ESF or liquidating it, I believe that if this $40 billion fund can \nbe used to bailout foreign currencies, it certainly can be used to help \nAmerica's schools.\n  Accordingly, I believe it is appropriate that the $20 billion in \nloans provided by my legislation will be made from the ESF--an amount \nidentical to the line of credit that was extended to Mexico by the \nSecretary of the Treasury in 1995. Of importance, these loans will be \nmade from the ESF on a progressive, annual basis--not in a sudden or \nimmediate manner. Furthermore, these monies will be repaid to the fund \nto ensure that the ESF is compensated for the loans it makes.\n  Although the ESF will recoup all of the monies it lends, it should \nalso be noted that my proposal ensures that states and local \ngovernments will not be forced to pay excessive interest, or that they \nwill be forced to repay over an unreasonable period of time. In fact, \nif the federal government fails to substantially increase its share of \nIDEA funding, states will incur no interest at all!\n  Specifically, to encourage the federal government to meet its funding \ncommitment for IDEA--and to compensate states for the fact that every \ndollar in forgone IDEA funding is a dollar less that they have for \nschool construction or other local needs--our bill would impose no \ninterest on BRICKS loans during the first five years provided the 40 \npercent funding commitment is not met.\n  Thereafter, the interest rate is pegged to the federal share of IDEA: \nzero in any year that the federal government fails to fund at least 20 \npercent of the cost of IDEA; 2.5 percent--the long-term projected \ninflation rate--in years that the federal share falls between 20 and 30 \npercent; 3.5 percent in years the federal share is 30 to 40 percent; \nand 4.5 percent in years the full 40 percent share is achieved.\n  Combined, these provisions will minimize the cost of these loans to \nthe states, and maximize the utilization of these loans for school \nconstruction, renovation, and repair.\n  Mr. President, by providing low-interest loans to states and local \ngovernments to support school construction, I believe that our bill \nrepresents a fiscally-responsible, centrist solution to a national \nproblem.\n  For those who support a direct, active federal role in school \nconstruction, our bill provides substantial federal assistance by \ndedicating $20 billion to leverage a significant amount of new school \nconstruction bonds. For those who are concerned about the federal \ngovernment becoming overly-engaged in an historically state and local \nresponsibility--and thereby stepping on local control--my bill directs \nthat the monies provided to states will be repaid, and that no onerous \napplications or demands are placed on states to receive their share of \nthese monies.\n  Mr. President, I urge that my colleagues support the ``BRICKS Act''--\nlegislation that is intended to bridge the gap between competing \nphilosophies on the federal role in school construction. Ultimately, if \nwe work together, we can make a tangible difference in the condition of \nAmerica's schools without turning it into a partisan or ideological \nbattle that is better suited to sound bites than actual solutions.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the letters of \nsupport from the NEA, PTA, NASBE, and Jim Rier, the Chairman of the \nMaine State Board of Education, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Education Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2000.\n     Sen. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the National Education \n     Association's (NEA) 2.5 million members, we would like to \n     thank you for your leadership in introducing a revised \n     version of the Building, Renovating, Improving, and \n     Constructing Kids' Schools (BRICKS) Act.\n       As you known, our nation's schools are in desperate need of \n     repair and renovation. Too many students attend classes in \n     overcrowded buildings with leaky roofs, faulty wiring, and \n     outdated plumbing. A recently-released NEA study documents \n     more than $300 billion in unmet infrastructure and technology \n     needs, nearly three times the level estimated in previous \n     research by the General Accounting Office.\n       NEA believes the revised BRICKS Act offers a meaningful \n     avenue for assisting schools. The bill would make available \n     $20 billion in guaranteed funding over 15 years to provide \n     low-interest--and in many cases zero interest--school \n     modernization loans to states and schools. According to a \n     preliminary Department of Education analysis, the BRICKS Act \n     would provide schools with a benefit of $465 for each $1,000 \n     in bonds.\n       We are pleased that the BRICKS Act would allow up to 50 \n     percent of federal funds to be used for payment of actual \n     construction costs or the principal portion of loans, as well \n     as the interest costs. We also appreciate the provision \n     allowing those states with laws that prohibit borrowing to \n     pay the interest costs on school bonds to use 100 percent of \n     their BRICKS loans for state revolving loan\n\n[[Page S394]]\n\n     funds or other state administered school modernization \n     programs.\n       NEA believes it is essential to enact meaningful school \n     modernization assistance this year. We thank you for your \n     leadership in this area and look forward to continuing to \n     work with you toward passage of bipartisan school \n     modernization legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Mary Elizabeth Teasley,\n     Director of Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       National PTA,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, July 7, 2000.\n     Hon. Lincoln D. Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Chafee and Snowe: On behalf of the 6.5 \n     million parents, teachers, students, and other child \n     advocates who are members of the National PTA, I am writing \n     to support the Building, Renovating, Improving, and \n     Constructing Kids' Schools (BRICKS) Act, which you plan to \n     introduce next week.\n       We thank you for your leadership in proposing this \n     initiative, which acknowledges the federal government's \n     responsibility to help schools repair and renovate their \n     facilities. As you are aware, the U.S. General Accounting \n     Office has estimated that the cost of fixing the structural \n     problems in schools across the nation will cost more than \n     $112 billion. If new schools are built to accommodate \n     overcrowding, and if schools's technology, wiring, and \n     infrastructure needs are added in, this estimate would exceed \n     $200 billion dollars.\n       This is a problem schools cannot address without a \n     partnership with the federal government, and National PTA \n     supports a variety of approaches to address this growing \n     crisis. In addition to endorsing the BRICKS bill, National \n     PTA is supporting the Public School Repair and Renovation \n     Act, which would provide tax credits to pay the interest on \n     school modernization bonds and create a grant and loan \n     program for emergency repairs in high-need districts; and \n     also the America's Better Classrooms Act, which would provide \n     $22 billion over two years in zero interest school \n     construction and modernization bonds.\n       Under BRICKS, nearly $20 billion would be available over 15 \n     years to provide low interest, and in many cases zero \n     interest, loans to States for interest payments on their \n     school modernization bonds. We are pleased that the proposal \n     will allow increased flexibility in using the federal funds \n     for interest payments, as well as for other state-\n     administered programs that assist state entities or local \n     governments pay for the construction or repair of schools.\n       National PTA is committed to helping enact a federal school \n     modernization proposal this Congress. We believe the BRICKS \n     Act should be promoted as one of the ways the federal \n     government can assist schools, and we thank you for your \n     leadership in this area. We look forward to continuing to \n     work with you toward formulation and passage of bipartisan \n     school modernization legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Vicki Rafel,\n     Vice President for Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Association of State Boards of Education,\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 18, 2000.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: The National Association of State \n     Boards of Education (NASBE) is a private nonprofit \n     association representing state and territorial boards of \n     education. Our principal objectives are to strengthen state \n     leadership in education policy-making, promote excellence in \n     the education of all students, advocate equality of access to \n     educational opportunity, and assure responsible governance of \n     public education.\n       We are writing to applaud your efforts to provide federal \n     assistance to states for school construction. The \n     deterioration of America's school infrastructure has reached \n     crisis proportions. At least one-third of all U.S. schools \n     are in need of extensive repairs or replacement and 60% have \n     at least one major building deficiency such as cracked \n     foundations, leaky roofs, or crumbling walls. We cannot \n     expect our children to learn much less excel in such decrepit \n     and unsafe environments.\n       The more than $112 billion needed to renovate and/or repair \n     existing school facilities has simply overwhelmed state and \n     local resources. This national problem demands federal \n     attention and we are encouraged that your office is \n     attempting to address this need by proposing a $20 billion \n     federal loan program.\n       Your legislation, the Building, Renovating, Improving, and \n     Constructing Kids' Schools Act (BRICKS), will leverage new \n     school construction expenditures at the state and local \n     levels and provides flexibility to integrate this assistance \n     with the variety of solutions states have already undertaken, \n     such as revolving funds, to enhance the financing of school \n     construction.\n       We appreciate your efforts and attention to address this \n     critical situation. NASBE is encouraged by your actions and \n     we look forward to working with your office to foster a \n     partnership between federal, state and local entities to \n     improve the learning conditions of American children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Brenda Lilienthal Welburn,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     State Board of Education,\n\n                                      Augusta, ME, April 29, 2000.\n     Sen. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: The age and condition of our nation's \n     public schools are an expanding crisis and should be of great \n     concern to all. Decades of neglect, unfunded maintenance \n     programs, constrained state and municipal budgets, shifting \n     populations, technology requirements, and programmatic \n     changes have combined to weaken the infrastructure of public \n     education. As you are well aware, a 1995 GAO report estimated \n     that just repairing existing school facilities would cost \n     $112 billion. In addition, building new facilities to meet \n     the demands of program and increased enrollments could cost \n     another $73 billion. We have allowed the condition of our \n     schools to deteriorate to a point that there are now critical \n     implications for the health and safety of our students and \n     staff who occupy those buildings. A number of states have \n     launched major efforts to address their school facilities \n     needs. The task is huge and beyond the ability of most local \n     and even state resources.\n       Unfortunately, Maine mirrors the nation. A Facilities \n     Inventory Study, conducted in 1996 by the Department of \n     Education and the University of Maine's Center for Research \n     and Evaluation, identified approximately $650 million in \n     needed facility improvements. Of particular concern was the \n     need for over $60 million in serious health and safety \n     related improvements as well as an additional $150 million in \n     other renovation and upgrades required.\n       In response to Maine's survey of over 700 buildings, \n     Governor King appointed a Commission to develop a plan to \n     address the needs identified. Their report was delivered to \n     the Maine Legislature in February 1998, and the \n     recommendations were enacted in April 1998. Maine has \n     responded to address the identified needs with significant \n     state and local resources. However, even as we develop policy \n     and resources to aggressively address those needs, our \n     concern grows.\n       Progressing from the condition survey to a detailed \n     engineering and environmental analysis of the conditions \n     causes even greater alarm. Roofs that were reported as \n     leaking in the survey are found to have serious structural \n     integrity problems with greater safety risks for occupants as \n     well as more complex and costly solutions. indoor air quality \n     problems in the survey grow from increased air exchange \n     solutions to more complex ones due to mold and microbial \n     growth in the interior walls. Again, this poses increased \n     health risk for students and staff. As we learn more about \n     the problems, our concerns grow and the necessary resources \n     increase. The critical health and safety needs from the 1996 \n     survey ($60 million) have grown to over $86 million in our \n     latest project estimates. Many more projects are yet to be \n     identified.\n       Applications for Major Capital Construction projects were \n     received in August of 1999 from over 100 buildings throughout \n     Maine. Even with a major new commitment of over $200 million \n     from this Session of the Maine Legislature we will only be \n     able to address approximately 20 of those projects over the \n     next two years. More will be applying in the next two-year \n     cycle that begins in July 2001.\n       Although school construction and modernization is and \n     should remain primarily a state and local responsibility, \n     states and school districts cannot meet the current urgent \n     needs alone. Federal assistance in the form of reduced or low \n     interest loans as you have included in S1992, the BRICKS ACT, \n     responds to the urgent need and could provide a critical \n     component to a comprehensive but flexible approach to address \n     Maine's, as well as the nation's, school facilities needs. As \n     currently proposed, your legislation would allow the \n     flexibility to address the renovation and upgrade of existing \n     facilities as well as provide relief for overcrowding and \n     insufficient program space where major capital construction \n     is required. It creates an effective local/state/federal \n     partnership, while leaving decisions about which schools to \n     build or repair up to states and local school units. In \n     Maine, that would allow us to strengthen our Revolving \n     Renovation Fund (created to aid local units in the upgrade \n     and renovation of existing buildings), and it would enhance \n     our bonding capacity for long term debt commitment to major \n     capital construction projects.\n       Structurally unfit, environmentally deficient, or \n     overcrowded classrooms impair student achievement, diminish \n     student discipline, and compromise student safety. Although \n     not cited often, the learning environment does affect the \n     quality of education and our ability to help students achieve \n     high standards.\n       The National Association of State Boards of Education has \n     identified school construction as one of its priority issues. \n     I serve as Vice-Chair of their Governmental Affairs Committee \n     and would be happy to enlist their help in focusing the \n     nation's attention on the poor condition of our schools and \n     the need for comprehensive federal assistance. If you have \n     questions or need information from NASBE please contact David \n     Griffith, Director of Governmental Affairs at 703-684-4000. \n     As Chairman of the Maine State Board of Education and the \n     Governor's School Facilities Commission I am available and \n     would be pleased to participate in any way you think \n     appropriate to outline Maine's innovative and comprehensive \n     school facilities program,\n\n[[Page S395]]\n\n     and to elaborate on how federal assistance could best \n     complement state and local efforts to address our school \n     construction needs.\n       It was an honor to meet you in March during NASBE's \n     Legislative Conference. I look forward to working with you in \n     support of a federal partnership with state and local school \n     units to provide a safe, healthy, and effective learning \n     environment for all.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        James E. Rier, Jr., Chair,\n                                   Maine State Board of Education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 120. A bill to establish a demonstration project to increase \nteacher salaries and employee benefits for teachers who enter into \ncontracts with local educational agencies to serve as master teachers; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                          master teacher bill\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \ncreate a demonstration grant program to help school districts create \nmaster teacher positions.\n  The bill authorizes $100 million for a five-year demonstration \nprogram under which the Secretary of Education would award competitive \ngrants to school districts to create master teacher positions. Federal \nfunds would be equally matched by states and local governments so that \n$200 million total would be available. Under the bill, 6,600 master \nteacher positions could be created if each master teacher were paid \n$30,000 on top of the current average teacher's salary.\n  As defined in this bill, a master teacher is one who is credentialed; \nhas at least five years of teaching experience; is judged to be an \nexcellent teacher by administrators and teachers who are knowledgeable \nabout the individual's performance; is currently teaching; and enters \ninto a contract and agrees to serve at least five more years.\n  The master teacher would help other teachers to improve instruction, \nstrengthen other teachers' skills, mentor less experienced teachers, \ndevelop curriculum, and provide other professional development.\n  The goal of this bill is for districts to pay each master teacher up \nto $30,000 on top of his or her regular salary. Nationally, the average \nteacher salary is $40,574. In California, it is $45,317. School \nprincipals receive $76,768 on average nationally and $72,805 in \nCalifornia. School superintendents nationally earn $106,122 and in \nCalifornia, $102,054. The purpose of the master teacher concept in this \nbill is to pay teachers a salary closer to that of an administrator to \nkeep good teachers in teaching.\n  The bill requires State and/or local districts to match federal funds \ndollar for dollar. It requires the U.S. Department of Education to give \npriority to school districts with a high proportion of economically \ndisadvantaged students and to ensure that grants are awarded to a wide \nrange of districts in terms of the size and location of the school \ndistrict, the ethnic and economic composition of students, and the \nexperience of the districts' teachers.\n  There are several reasons we need this bill.\n  Beginning teachers face overwhelming challenges in their first year, \nbut in the real world, they get little guidance or support, in a year \nthat will have a profound impact on the rest of their professional \ncareer. They often feel ``out there'' and ``alone,'' thrown into an \nunfamiliar school and classroom with a room full of new faces. By the \ncurrent sink-or-swim method, new teachers often find themselves ill \nequipped to deal with the educational and disciplinary tasks of their \nfirst year.\n  A new teacher can get experienced guidance from a master teacher who \nis paired with the new teacher. The master teacher can help plan \nlessons, improve instructional methods, and deal with discipline \nproblems. Having this kind of professional support can give these new \nteachers the skills and confidence to stay in teaching.\n  Second, master teacher programs can bring more prestige to teaching \nas a profession, by increasing the teacher's salary, by rewarding \nexperience, and by giving teachers opportunities to supervise others. A \nmaster teacher designation is a way to recognize outstanding ability \nand performance, and to reward the good teachers. A master teacher \nposition can give teachers a professional goal, a higher level to \npursue. A 1996 report by the National Commission for Teaching and \nAmerican's Future said that creating new career paths for teachers is \none of the best ways to give educators the respect they deserve and to \nensure that proven teaching methods spread quickly and broadly.\n\n  In one survey of teachers which asked which factors make teachers \nstay in teaching, 79 percent of teachers said that respect for the \nteaching profession is needed in order to retain qualified teachers. \nEighty percent said that formal mentoring programs for beginning \nteachers is key (Scholastic/Chief State School Officers' Teacher Voices \nSurvey, 2000). Over 70 percent of teachers said that more planning time \nwith peers is needed to keep teachers in the classroom. This amendment \nshould help.\n  Because of the higher pay and enhanced prestige, a master teacher \nprogram can help to recruit and retain teachers. Mentor systems provide \nnew teachers with a support network, someone to turn to. Studies \nindicate higher retention rates among new teachers who participate in \nmentoring programs. According to Yvonne Gold of California State \nUniversity-Long Beach, 25 percent of beginning teachers do not teach \nmore than two years and nearly 40 percent leave in the first five \nyears. In the Rochester, New York, system, the teacher retention rate \nwas nearly double the national average five years after establishing a \nmentoring program.\n  As Jay Matthews wrote in the May 16, 2000, Washington Post, programs \nlike this ``can provide a large boost to the profession's image for a \nrelatively small amount of money.'' These programs can keep good \nteachers in the classroom, instead of losing them to school \nadministration or industry.\n  Higher salaries and prestige for master teachers could deter the \ndrain from the classrooms.\n  Another reason for this bill is that teacher mentoring programs can \nmake teacher performance more accountable. A master teacher can help \nnovice teachers improve their teaching and get better student \nachievement. ``Teachers cannot be held accountable for knowledge based, \nclient-oriented decisions if they do not have access to knowledge, as \nwell as opportunities for consultation and evaluation of their work,'' \nsaid Adam Urbanski, President of the Rochester, New York, Teachers \nAssociation. He went on: ``Unsatisfactory teacher performance often \nstems from inadequate and incompetent supervision. Administrators often \nlack the training and the resources to supervise teachers and improve \nthe performance of those who are in serious trouble.''\n  Good teachers are key to learning. Lower math test scores have been \ncorrelated with the percentage of math teachers on emergency permits \nand higher math test scores were linked both to the teachers' \nqualifications and to their years of teaching experience, according to \n``Professional Development for Teachers, 2000.''\n  This bill could be very helpful in California where one-fifth of our \nteachers will leave the profession in three years, according to an \narticle in the February 9, 2000, Los Angeles Times. One-half of our \nteachers are over age 44.\n  California will need 300,000 new teachers by 2010. ``More students to \nteach, smaller classes, and teachers leaving or retiring means that \nCalifornia school districts are now having to hire a record 26,000 new \nteachers each year,'' says the report, ``Teaching and California's \nFuture, 2000.'' California's enrollment is growing at three times the \nnational rate. With these kinds of demands, understaffing often leads \nto under qualified and new teachers entering the classroom. We have to \ndo all we can to attract and retain good teachers.\n  The true beneficiaries of master teacher programs are the students \nand that is, of course, my fundamental goal. As stated in Rochester's \nteaching manual, the goal is ``to improve student outcomes by \ndeveloping and maintaining the highest quality of teaching, providing \nteachers with career options that do not require them to leave teaching \nto assume additional responsibilities and leadership roles.''\n\n[[Page S396]]\n\n  I believe this bill can begin to provide teachers the real \nprofessional support they need, can attract and retain teachers and can \nbring to the teaching profession the prestige it deserves.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 120\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish an Office of Children's Services within \nthe Department of Justice to coordinate and implement Government \nactions involving unaccompanied alien children, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation \nto change the way unaccompanied immigrant children are treated while in \nthe custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). If \nenacted, the Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2001 would \nensure that the federal government addresses the special needs of \nthousands of unaccompanied alien children who enter the U.S. It will \nensure that these children have a fair opportunity to obtain \nhumanitarian relief.\n  Central throughout this legislation are two concepts: The United \nStates government has a fundamental responsibility to protect \nunaccompanied children in its custody; and in all proceedings and \nactions, the government's ultimate priority should be to protect the \nbest interests of children.\n  The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2001 would ensure \nthat children who are apprehended by the INS are treated humanely and \nappropriately by transferring jurisdiction over their welfare from the \nINS Detention and Deportation division to a newly created Office of \nChildren's Services within the Department of Justice.\n  This legislation would also centralize responsibility for the care \nand custody of unaccompanied children in this new Office of Children's \nServices. By doing so, it would resolve the conflict of interest \ninherent in the current system--that is, the INS retains custody of \nchildren and is charged with their care while, at the same time, it \nseeks their deportation.\n  Under this bill, the Office of Children's Services would be required \nto establish standards for the custody, release, and detention of \nchildren, ensuring that children are housed in appropriate shelters or \nfoster care rather than juvenile jails. In 1999, the INS held some \n2,000 children in juvenile jails even though they had never committed a \ncrime. Equally as important, the bill would require the Office to \nestablish clear guidelines and uniformity for detention alternatives \nsuch as shelter care, foster care, and other child custody \narrangements.\n  The bill would improve unaccompanied aliens' access to existing \noptions for permanent protection when U.S. immigration and child \nwelfare authorities believe such protection is warranted.\n  Finally, the Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act would provide \nunaccompanied minors with access to legal counsel, who would ensure \nthat the children appear at all immigration proceedings and assist them \nas the INS and immigration court consider their cases. The bill would \nalso provide the children with access to a guardian ad litem to ensure \nthat they are properly placed in a safe and caring environment. The \nguardian ad litem would also work to ensure that each child's best \ninterests are protected throughout the process.\n  Let me turn for a moment to the issue of access to counsel. Children, \neven more than adults, have incredible difficulty understanding the \ncomplexities of the asylum system without the assistance of counsel. \nDespite this reality, most children in INS detention are overlooked and \nunrepresented. Without legal representation, children are at risk of \nbeing returned to their home countries where they may face further \nhuman rights abuses.\n  I am aware of two cases that demonstrate the compelling need for \ncounsel on behalf of these children. The first case involves two 17-\nyear old boys from China. Li and Wang, who were apprehended on an \nisland near Guam and had been in INS custody for almost two years. \nDuring their detention in Guam, the two boys testified in federal court \nagainst the smugglers who brought them to Guam. In their testimony, \nthey described being beaten by the smugglers even before leaving China, \nand stated that others were beaten during the trip to Guam. In the \nspring of 2000, the two boys were brought to a corrections facility in \nLos Angeles and\n\n[[Page S397]]\n\ndetained in the INS section of that facility. This is where the \nsimilarity in their cases end.\n  Mr. President, while both of the boys would face danger from the \nsmugglers if they returned to China because of their testimony, only \none was granted asylum. Li applied for asylum and was denied. He was \nnot represented by counsel at his hearing. Despite the fact that the \nINS trial attorney mentioned that Li had testified in federal court \nagainst the smugglers, the judge did not include this information in \nher decision on the claim. Luckily for Li, an attorney overheard the \nhearing, and after speaking with Li, agreed to appeal his asylum claim. \nLi is still being held in a Los Angeles corrections facility. The story \nis different for Wang. Wang had an attorney and won his asylum hearing. \nBut INS is appealing the decision so Wang remains in a Los Angeles \ncorrections facility, as well.\n  Mr. President, these cases demonstrate the pressing need for legal \nrepresentation of children. Had he been represented by counsel and if \nhis testimony would have been incorporated into his case, Li may have \nwon his asylum claim. Instead, a 17-year-old boy unfamiliar with our \nimmigration system and our language was forced to navigate the complex \ncourt system alone.\n  According to Human Rights Watch, children detained by the INS, \nwhether in secure detention or less restrictive settings, often have \ngreat difficulty obtaining information about their legal rights. On a \n1998 visit to the Berks County Juvenile Detention Center in Reading, \nPennsylvania, Human Rights Watch staff found that none of the children \nthey interviewed had received information from the INS or the \nfacility's staff about their rights or the legal services available to \nthem.\n  Unaccompanied alien children are among the most vulnerable of the \nimmigrant population; many have often entered the country under \ntraumatic circumstances. They are young and alone, subject to abuse and \nexploitation. These unaccompanied children are unable to articulate \ntheir fears, their views, or testify to their needs as accurately as \nadults can.\n  Despite these facts, U.S. immigration laws and policies have been \ndeveloped and implemented without caring about their effect on \nchildren, particularly on unaccompanied alien children.\n  Sadly, the INS detains more than 5,000 children nationwide each year. \nThey are apprehended for not having proper documentation at ports-of-\nentry into the United States. Their detention may last for months--or \nsometimes for years--as they undergo complex and arduous immigration \nproceedings.\n  Under current immigration law, these children are forced to struggle \nthrough a system designed primarily for adults, even though they lack \nthe capacity to understand nuanced legal principles and procedures. \nChildren who may very well be eligible for relief are often vulnerable \nto being deported back to the very abusive situations from which they \nfled before they are able to make their case before the INS or an \nimmigration judge.\n  Under current law, the INS is responsible for the apprehension, \ndetention, care, placement, legal protection, and deportation of \nunaccompanied children. I believe that these are conflicting \nresponsibilities that undercut the best interests of the child. Too \noften, the INS has fallen short in fulfilling the protection side of \nthese responsibilities.\n  The INS uses a variety of facilities to house children. Some are held \nin children's shelters in which children are offered some of the \nservices they need but still may experience prolonged detention, lack \nof access to counsel, and other troubling conditions.\n  The INS relies on juvenile correctional facilities to house many \nchildren, even in the absence of any criminal wrongdoing. Today, one \nout of every three children in INS custody is detained in secure, jail-\nlike facilities. These facilities are highly inappropriate, \nparticularly for children who have already experienced painful trauma \nin their homelands.\n  There is currently no provision of federal law providing guidance for \nthe placement of unaccompanied alien children. In 1987, the Flores v. \nReno settlement agreement on behalf of minors in INS detention \nestablished the nationwide policy for the detention, release, and \ntreatment of children in the custody of INS. The Flores agreement \nrequires that the INS treat minors with dignity, respect, and special \nconcern for their particular vulnerability. It also requires the INS to \nplace each detained minor in the least restrictive setting appropriate \nto the child's age and special needs.\n\n  In response to Flores, the INS issued regulations that permitted its \nofficers to detain children in secure facilities only in limited \ncircumstances. The INS officers were required to provide written notice \nto the child of the reasons for such placement. More importantly, the \nregulations required the INS to segregate immigration detainees from \njuvenile criminal offenders.\n  Although INS officials have contended that these children are placed \nin these facilities largely because they are charged with other \noffenses, the INS statistics do not bear out this claim. In fiscal year \n1999, only 19 percent of the children placed in secure detention were \nchargeable or adjudicated as delinquents.\n  According to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as Human \nRights Watch and the Women's Commission on Refugee Women and Children, \nthe INS regularly violates these regulations. The NGOs contend that all \ntoo often children are placed in jail-like facilities for seemingly \narbitrary reasons, seldom notified of the reasons why, and forced to \nshare rooms and have extensive contact with convicted juvenile \noffenders.\n  I was also astonished to learn that many of these children, some as \nyoung as four and five years old, are placed behind multiple layers of \nlocked doors, surrounded by walls and barbed wire. They are strip \nsearched, patted down, placed in solitary confinement for punishment, \nforced to wear prison uniforms and shackles, and are forbidden to keep \npersonal objects. Often they have no one to speak with because of the \nlanguage barrier.\n  The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act of 2001 would ensure \nthat the particular needs of the thousands of unaccompanied alien \nchildren who enter INS custody each year are met and that these \nchildren have a fair opportunity to obtain immigration relief when \neligible.\n  In 1999, the INS held approximately 4,600 children under the age of \n18 in its custody. Some of these children fled human rights abuses or \narmed conflict in their home countries, some were victims of child \nabuse or had otherwise lost the support and protection of their \nfamilies, some came to the United States to join family members, and \nsome came to escape economic deprivation.\n  Many of these children came from troubled and war-torn countries \naround the world, including the Peoples Republic of China, Honduras, \nAfghanistan, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Colombia, Guatemala, Cuba, former \nYugoslavia, and others. They range in age from toddlers to teenagers. \nSome traveled to the United States alone, while others were accompanied \nby unrelated adults.\n  Sadly, a significant number are victims of smuggling or trafficking \nrings. In one recent instance, Phanupong Khaisri, a two-year old Thai \nchild, was brought to the U.S. by two individuals falsely claiming to \nbe his parents, but who were actually part of a major alien trafficking \nring. The INS was prepared to deport the child back to Thailand. It was \nnot until Members of Congress and the local Thai community had \nintervened, however, that the INS decided to allow the child to remain \nin the U.S. until the agency could provide proper medical attention and \ndetermine what course of action would be in his best interest. Now his \ncase is before a federal district court judge who will determine \nwhether he should be eligible to apply for asylum.\n  The Unaccompanied Alien Child Protection Act aims to prevent \nsituations like this from recurring by centralizing the care and \ncustody of unaccompanied children into a new Office of Children's \nServices within the INS, but outside the jurisdiction of the District \nDirectors. By doing so, the Act resolves the conflict of interest \ninherent in the current system--that is, the INS retains custody of \nchildren and is charged with their care while, at the same time, it \nseeks their deportation.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to share with you a few \nother examples of how the federal government has fallen short in the \nmanner in\n\n[[Page S398]]\n\nwhich we handle vulnerable unaccompanied minors. One would think that \nour country would treat unaccompanied minors with the sensitivity and \ncare their situations demand. Unfortunately, in too many instances, \nthat has not been the case. Too often, these children are often treated \nlike adults and, under the worst circumstances, like criminals.\n\n  Xaio Ling, a young girl from China who spoke no English, was detained \nby the INS at the Berks County Juvenile Detention Center. The INS \nplaced her among children guilty of violent crimes, including rape and \nmurder. Xaio was never guilty of any crime, and yet she slept in a \nsmall concrete cell, was subjected to humiliating strip searches, and \nforced to wear handcuffs. She was forbidden to keep any of her clothes \nor possessions and, under the policies of the Berks Center, Xaio was \nnot allowed to laugh--not that she had anything to laugh about.\n  Imagine the fear this child had to endure: thrust into a system she \ndid not understand, given no legal aid, placed in jail that housed \njuveniles with serious criminal convictions, including murder, car \njacking, rape, and drug trafficking. She did not speak English and was \nunable to speak to any staff who knew her language, and she had to \nsubmit to strip searches. It is hard to believe that our country would \nhave allowed this innocent child to be treated in such a horrible \nmanner.\n  Situations like that of this young Chinese girl make a compelling \ncase for changes in the way our nation treats unaccompanied alien \nchildren. Under the legislation I have introduced today, this youngster \nnever would have been placed in a detention center with criminal \noffenders. Rather, she would have immediately been placed in shelter \ncare, foster care, or a home more appropriate for her situation. She \nwould have been provided an attorney for her immigration proceedings \nand a social worker would have been appointed as guardian ad litem to \nensure that her needs were being met. Sadly, this young girl was given \nnone of these options.\n  Neither was a 16 year-old boy from Colombia, who fled Colombia to \nescape a life of violence on the streets of Bogota, where FARC \nguerillas attempted to recruit him and the F-2 branch of the Colombian \ngovernment harassed him in its attempt to get rid of street children. \nFearing for his life, he fled Colombia for Venezuela where he lived \nwithout shelter or sufficient food. In search of a safer life, he \nsneaked into the machine room of a cargo ship bound for the United \nStates. He was lucky to survive; many other stowaways were thrown \noverboard when discovered by the ship's crew.\n  The boy remained on the ship from November 1998 until March 1999, \nwhen he arrived in Philadelphia. He was soon turned over to the INS and \nplaced into the same detention center in which the young Chinese girl \nwas held. He, too, was kept with criminal offenders. He did not \nunderstand English, which created a myriad of problems because he was \nunable to understand what was expected of him in the detention center. \nHe was held in an inappropriately punitive environment for six months.\n  I have one last story to share with you today. Placed on a boat bound \nfor the United States by her very own parents, a 15-year-old girl fled \nChina's rigid family planning laws. Under these laws she was denied \ncitizenship, education, and medical care. She came to this country \nalone and desperate. And what did our immigration authorities do when \nthey found her? They held her in a juvenile jail in Portland, Oregon. \nShe was held for eight months and was detained for an additional four \nmonths after being granted political asylum. At her asylum hearing, the \nyoung girl could not wipe away the tears from her face because her \nhands were chained to her waist. According to her lawyer, ``her only \ncrime was that her parents had put her on a boat so she could get a \nbetter life over here.''\n  Mr. President, for years children's rights and human rights activists \nhave implored Congress to improve the way our immigration system \nhandles unaccompanied minors--just like the ones whose stories I have \njust told. I believe my bill would do just that.\n  We cannot continue to allow children, who come to our country, often \ntraumatized and guilty of no crime, to be held in jails and treated \nlike criminals. We cannot continue to allow children, scared and \nhelpless, to be thrown into a system they do not understand without \nsufficient legal aid and a guardian to look after their best interests. \nWe must adhere to the principles of our justice system. What kind of \nmessage do we send when we deprive children who come to our country \nseeking refuge of their basic rights and protections?\n  As a nation that holds our democratic ideals and constitutional \nrights paramount, how then can we continue to avert our attention from \nrepeated violations of some of the most basic human rights against \nchildren who have no voice in the immigration system? We should be \noutraged that children who come to the U.S. alone, many against their \nwill, are subjected to such inhumane, excessive conditions.\n  I am proud to have the support of the United States Catholic \nConference and the Women's Commission on Refugee Women and Children, \nwith whom I have worked closely to develop this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me by cosponsoring this important \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 122. A bill to prohibit a State from determining that a ballot \nsubmitted by an absent uniformed services voter was improperly or \nfraudulently cast unless that State finds clear and convincing evidence \nof fraud, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n              Armed Services Voting Rights Protection Act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Armed Services \nVoting Rights Protection Act of 2001.''\n  This important legislation takes a two pronged approach to help \naddress the technical problems that resulted in far too many of the \nballots cast by those serving in our nation's Armed Services being \nthrown out in the last election.\n  The first part of the bill would amend the Uniformed and Overseas \nCitizens Absentee Voting Act of 1986 to help protect the voting rights \nof our armed services members. This first part is companion language to \na bill, H.R. 159, that has been introduced in the 107th Congress by \nRepresentative Bob Riley of Alabama.\n  Specifically, this part of the bill would prohibit a state from \ndetermining that an absentee ballot submitted by a uniformed services \nvoter has been improperly cast unless the state finds clear and \nconvincing evidence of fraud. It states that the lack of a witness \nsignature, address, postmark, or other identifying information cannot \nnot be considered clear and convincing evidence of fraud unless there \nis other evidence or information. Further, it is designed to have no \neffect on filing deadlines as determined by the states.\n  The second part of the Armed Services Voting Rights Protection Act \ndirects the United States Postal Service to conduct joint studies with \neach of the branches of our Armed Services to examine what went wrong \nduring the last election that caused so many of the ballots cast by our \nnation's Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines to be thrown out, often \nfor minor technical reasons. It directs the U.S. Postal Service and the \nArmed Services to report back to congress within 120 days of the \nenactment of this Act with recommendations about how to improve the \nU.S. Post Office's interface with the Armed Services and help prevent a \nrepeat performance where so many overseas military ballots were thrown \nout. It also directs them to implement the changes that can be done \nwithout changing current law and recommend further changes in law that \nCongress may want to consider. These efforts should also help improve \nthe overall day-to-day relationship between the Armed Services and \nPostal Service.\n\n  The need for this bill is clear. While ballots were being counted \nduring the most recent presidential election, an army of trial lawyers \nwas sent out in a coordinated effort to systematically eliminate many \nof the votes cast by Americans serving in our nation's Armed Services \noverseas. These efforts to throw out ballots, usually for minor \ntechnical reasons, were all too successful. We need to do what we can \nto make sure it does not happen again.\n  As a veteran and a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I\n\n[[Page S399]]\n\nbelieve throwing out votes cast by those serving in the Armed Services \nover technicalities is simply wrong on the most fundamental level. Our \nnation's Marines, Sailors, Airmen and Soldiers serve on the front lines \nin the defense of our great nation and constitutional democracy. To \ntoss out so many of their ballots, and especially those cast by those \nserving at the forefront of our defense by being underway at sea or \nserving in remote hardship posts, is no way to show appreciation for \ntheir service.\n  Many Americans, myself included, are deeply concerned that the last \nelection sent a clear signal to those serving in the Armed Forces that \neven though they may be putting their very lives on the line in the \ndefense of our nation, and are duty bound to obey orders issued by \ntheir Commander in Chief, the President of the United States, there is \na good chance that their right to have a voice, through a vote, in the \nselection of that President may be eliminated by the most minor of \ntechnicalities. This situation is made even worse by the fact that the \nvery technical problems that may disqualify their ballots, like lack of \naccess to postal marks, are often well beyond the control of individual \nSailors, Soldiers, Marines and Airmen.\n  In order to vote, most of our fellow Americans serving in the Armed \nServices already have to jump through more hoops that the average \ncitizen. We must do what we can to make it easier for them to jump \nthrough those hoops, rather that using these hoops as a way to trip up \ntheir right to vote.\n  Late last year, our nation witnessed an unprecedented assault on \nvotes cast by our nation's Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines, and \nespecially those serving overseas. The Armed Services Voting Rights \nProtection Act would be an important step in making sure that it does \nnot happen again. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 122\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to extend \nloan forgiveness for certain loans to Head Start teachers; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                    head start teachers act of 2001\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President: I rise today with my colleague from \nOhio, Senator Voinovich, to introduce legislation to expand the federal \nloan forgiveness program to include Head Start teachers.\n  Head Start is one of the most important federal programs because it \nhas the potential to reach children early in their formative years when \ntheir cognitive skills are just developing. We know that poor children \ndisproportionately start school behind their peers--they are less \nlikely to count to 10 or to recite the alphabet.\n  Providing low-income children with access to programs that encourage \ncognitive learning and prepare them to enter school ready to learn is \nimportant. Head Start is one example of a Federal program that has the \npotential to reach every low-income child; to help every eligible child \nlearn to count to ten and begin to recite the alphabet.\n  Many of our Nation's youngsters, however, enter elementary school \nwithout the basic skills necessary to succeed. Often these children lag \nbehind their peers throughout their academic career.\n  As taxpayers, we will spend millions on efforts to help these \nchildren catch up. Many of these children will never catch up.\n  Several studies confirm the importance of providing low-income \nchildren with the opportunity early on to gain basic cognitive skills:\n\n  A study conducted on a preschool program in Chicago showed that for \nevery dollar invested, $8 was saved by society in projected costs. \nAdditionally, 26 percent more children were likely to finish high \nschool and 40 percent were less likely to repeat a grade.\n  The National Head Start Association found that for every dollar \ninvested in Head Start, at least $2.50 is saved because these children \nneed less remedial education and are less likely to be on welfare \nprograms or involved with the juvenile justice system than non-Head \nStart peers.\n  The Rand Corporation found that for every dollar invested in early \nchildhood learning programs, taxpayers save between $4 and $7 later by \nreducing the need for alcohol and drug treatment programs, special \neducation programs, mental health services, and the likelihood of \nincarceration.\n\n  We can save millions by providing low-income children with access to \nquality preschool where they will gain the necessary cognitive skills \nto succeed in school and life.\n  In order to give every child a head start in life, we must continue \nto recruit qualified teachers to the Head Start field who have \ndemonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, early \nchildhood development, and other areas of the preschool curriculum with \na particular focus on cognitive learning. Obtaining and maintaining \nteachers with such qualifications is the only way to jump-start \ncognitive learning and to ensure that our youngsters start elementary \nschool ready to learn.\n  Several recent studies confirm the importance of investing in the \neducation and training of those who work with preschoolers.\n\n[[Page S400]]\n\n  A study conducted by the National Research Council at the request of \nthe U.S. Department of Education recommends that:\n\n       Each group of children in an early childhood education and \n     care program should be assigned a teacher who has a \n     bachelor's degree with specialized education related to \n     early childhood. . . . Progress toward a high-quality \n     teaching force will require substantial public and private \n     support and incentive programs, including innovative \n     education programs, scholarship and loan programs, and \n     compensation commensurate with the expectations of college \n     graduates.\n\n  The Head Start 2010 National Advisory Panel presided over fifteen \nnational hearings and open forums. The panel found:\n\n       There was a tremendous amount of testimony about the fact \n     that, despite increases resulting from Federal quality set-\n     aside funding, relatively low salaries and poor or non-\n     existent benefits make it difficult to attract and retain \n     qualified staff over the long term. Witnesses stated that \n     many staff positions remain vacant and turnover is likely to \n     worsen if compensation does not improve significantly . . . \n     comments included passionate exhortations for greater \n     investment in staff, observing that, in Head Start . . . the \n     quality of the program is tied directly to the quality of the \n     staff.\n\n  Many Head Start programs are losing qualified teachers to local \nschool districts because the pay is better, and working in an \nelementary or secondary school assists these teachers in qualifying to \nreceive up to $5,000 of their federal loans forgiven. Every teacher \nHead Start loses impacts access to services for our nation's most \nvulnerable youngsters.\n  I believe that leveling the playing field by offering Head Start \nteachers the same loan forgiveness benefit currently afforded to \nelementary and secondary school teachers could encourage more college \ngraduates to enter the field.\n  Following the recommendations of the Head Start 2010 National \nAdvisory Panel and the National Research Council, I believe we must \ncreate programs to encourage highly educated and trained individuals to \ncommit to long-term careers in the Head Start arena.\n  To encourage recent graduates, current Head Start teachers without a \ndegree, and college students to enter and remain in the Head Start \nfield, I am introducing legislation that will expand the federal loan \nforgiveness program to include Head Start teachers. In exchange for 5 \nyears of service, a Head Start teacher could receive up to $5,000 of \ntheir federal Stafford loan forgiven.\n  I believe we must continue to improve the Head Start program such \nthat children leave the program able to count to ten, to recognize \nsizes and colors, and can begin to recite the alphabet, to name a few \nindicators of cognitive learning. To ensure cognitive learning, we must \nalso continue to raise the standards for Head Start teachers.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein, in introducing legislation which will \nencourage young teachers to go into early childhood education, \nencourage further learning and credentialing of early learning \neducators, and lead to better education for our nation's youngest \nchildren.\n  There is no more important time in a child's life than their earliest \nyears. Scientific research tells us that babies are born with 100 \nbillion neurons, or brain cells, that are waiting to make connections, \nor synapses, with one another. These synapses empower the brain and \ndictate healthy development and future learning. By the time a baby is \nthree, 1,000 trillion connections have been made--twice as many \nsynapses as most adults have.\n  However, at age 11, children start eliminating those brain \nconnections that have not been used, thus decreasing their potential \nfor learning and development.\n  To maximize their learning potential, we must begin to teach our \nchildren the necessary skills before they reach kindergarten. \nResearchers have found that focusing on these earliest years can make \nthe greatest difference in a child's development and learning, and I \nknow of few other programs that provide the same focus as Head Start.\n  Our bill, the Loan Forgiveness for Head Start Teachers Act of 2001, \nis designed to encourage currently enrolled and incoming college \nstudents working on a Bachelor's or a Master's degree to pursue a \ncareer as a Head Start teacher. In exchange for a 5-year teaching \ncommitment in a qualified Head Start program, a college graduate with a \nminimum of a bachelor's degree could receive up to $5,000 in \nforgiveness for their federal Stafford student loan.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, we invested heavily in Head Start so \nthat there was room for every eligible child in Ohio. Because of our \nefforts, Ohio is 4th in the nation in terms of children served by Head \nStart with nearly 38,000 students served in the year 2000.\n  I have carried my passion for early childhood education with me to \nthe U.S. Senate. I continue to believe that it is absolutely critical \nthat we do more to help our young people prepare to begin school and it \nis why I was pleased to work with Senators Jeffords and Stevens to help \npass the Early Learning Opportunities Act of 2000. Still, we must now \ndo more to help those teachers who educate our youngest children.\n  The results of a survey undertaken by the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services over the past two years has shown a significant \ncorrelation between the quality of education a child receives and the \namount of education that child's teacher possesses. That is, the more \neducation a teacher has, the more effectively they teach their students \ncognitive skills, and the more likely that students are to act upon \nthose skills.\n  Current federal law requires that 50 percent of all Head Start \nteachers must\n\n[[Page S401]]\n\nhave an associate, bachelor's, or advanced degree in early childhood \neducation or a related field with teaching experience by 2003. Under \nOhio law, by 2007, all Head Start teachers must have at least an \nassociates degree. The more education our teachers have, the better off \nour children will be. Unfortunately, as we all know, education is \nexpensive.\n  In Ohio today, only 11.3 percent (242) of the 2,126 Head Start \nteachers employed in the state have a bachelor's degree. Additionally, \nless than one percent (20) of Ohio's Head Start teachers have a \ngraduate degree. We must do more to help our teachers afford the \neducation that will be used to help educate our children.\n  Recruiting and retaining Head Start and early childhood teachers \ncontinues to be a challenge for Ohio and other states. The Loan \nForgiveness for Head Start Teachers Act of 2001 will help communities, \nschools and other funded Head Start providers to meet the challenge of \nrecruiting and retaining high quality teachers. It is one of the best \nways that I know of where we can make a real difference in the lives of \nour most precious resource--our children.\n  I am pleased to have been able to work with the National Head Start \nAssociation and Ohio Head Start Association, and my colleague Senator \nFeinstein, on this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join as co-\nsponsors of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kerry, and \n        Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 125. A bill to provide substantial reductions in the price of \nprescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \n``Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 2001'', legislation \nthat addresses the critical issue facing our older Americans--the cost \nof their prescription drugs. Studies have shown that older Americans \nspend almost three times as much of their income on health care than \nthose under the age of 65, and more than three-quarters of Americans \naged 65 and over are taking prescription drugs. Even more alarming is \nthe fact that seniors and others who buy their own prescription drugs, \nare forced to pay over twice as much for their drugs as are the drug \nmanufactures' most favored customers, such as the federal government \nand large HMOs.\n  The ``Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act'' will protect \nsenior citizens and disabled individuals from drug price discrimination \nand make prescription drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries at \nsubstantially reduced prices. The legislation achieves these goals by \nallowing pharmacies that serve Medicare beneficiaries to purchase \nprescription drugs at prices equal to those of the pharmaceutical \ncompanies' most favored customers. Estimated to reduce prescription \ndrug prices for seniors by over 40%, this bill will help those seniors \nwho often times have to make devastating choices between buying food or \nmedications. Choices that no human being should have to make.\n  Research and development of new drug therapies is an important and \nnecessary tool towards improving a person's quality of life. But due to \nthe high price tag that often accompanies the latest drug therapies, \nseniors are often left without access to these new therapies, and \nultimately, in far too many instances, without access to medication at \nall. This legislation is an important step towards restoring the access \nto affordable medications for our Medicare beneficiaries.\n  While this may not be the magic bullet that meets all of the long \nterm needs of providing Medicare prescription drug coverage, it does \nprovide a mechanism for immediate relief from rising drug costs. \nWorking together, reaching across the aisle, we can use this time of \nunparalleled prosperity to do the right thing by our seniors. We should \ndo it this year for their sake, and for the sake of the future of \nMedicare.\n  I look forward to working on this important issue in the months to \ncome and hope that Congress will work swiftly in a bipartisan manner to \nenact legislation that will benefit millions of senior citizens and \ndisabled individuals across our nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND (for himself, Mr. Miller, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 126. A bill to authorize the President to present a gold medal on \nbehalf of Congress to former President Jimmy Carter and his wife \nRosalynn Carter in recognition of their service to the Nation; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n   Authorizing the President to present the Gold Medal on behalf of \n    Congress to Former President Jimmy Carter and Former First Lady \n                            Rosalynn Carter\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould authorize the President to present a Gold Medal on behalf of \nCongress to former President Jimmy Carter and former First Lady \nRosalynn Carter in recognition of their service to the Nation. I would \nlike to thank Senators Miller, Inouye, Torricelli, Bingaman and Harkin \nfor co-sponsoring this bill and extend an invitation to all our other \ncolleagues to join us in supporting this legislation to award these two \ngreat Americans with Congress' highest honor.\n  It is widely agreed that President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn \nCarter have distinguished records of public service to the American \npeople and the international community. Internationally, the Carters \nhave been involved in a number of public service initiatives ranging \nfrom combating famine in Sub-Sahara Africa and encouraging better \nhealth care in Third World nations to serving as mediators in an effort \nto end civil wars in half a dozen countries. President Carter has \nmonitored numerous foreign elections in an effort to spread democracy \nthroughout the world.\n  A Congressional Gold Medal awarded by Congress will show the \nappreciation of the American public for the many contributions that \nPresident and Mrs. Carter have made, including service in public office \nfrom the state legislature to the White House. Jimmy and Rosalynn \ncontinue to promote human rights worldwide due to their active \ninvolvement in the nonprofit Carter Center in Atlanta that has \ninitiated projects in more than 65 countries to resolve conflicts, \npromote human rights, build democracy, improve health care worldwide, \nand revitalize urban areas. In addition, the Carters serve as \nvolunteers for Habitat for Humanity, which helps low income families \nbuild their own homes.\n  I hope that other members of Congress will join me and Senators \nMiller, Inouye, Torricelli, Bingaman, and Harkin in recognizing \nPresident and Mrs. Carter for their distinguished records of public \nservice by awarding them the Congressional Gold Medal.

A bill to give American companies, American workers, and \nAmerican ports the opportunity to compete in the United States cruise \nmarket; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                the united states ship cruise vessel act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today Senators Hutchison, Cleland, \nMurkowski, and I are introducing the United States Cruise Vessel Act. \nThe purpose of this bill is to provide increased domestic cruise \nopportunities for the American cruising public by temporarily reducing \nbarriers to operation in the domestic cruise market. I want to start by \nthanking Senators Hutchison, Cleland, and Murkowski for once again \njoining me in an effort to rebuild our nation's cruise ship industry.\n  While we made great progress in advancing our goals during the last \nCongress, our efforts were blocked by the special interests of a small \ngroup of shipbuilders who prefer the status quo that allows them to \ndominate the small market for large U.S.-built cruise ships without the \nfear of competition. The bill that we are introducing today was passed \nout of the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously during the last \nCongress. It represents months, if not years, of work by a large cross \nsection of our nation's maritime industry to reach agreement on how \nbest to jump-start our nation's fleet of U.S. flagged cruise vessels \nand provide them the tools they need to compete in the world market.\n  The measure we are introducing today would allow for the immediate \nexpansion of the domestic fleet by allowing operators to bring existing \ncruise ships under the U.S. flag as long as they agree to build \nadditional vessels in the United States. The measure would also provide \nincreased opportunities for U.S. mariners to serve at sea. This becomes \nmore critical annually, as we face greater difficulties in meeting our \nnational defense sealift need for qualified merchant mariners. We need \nto provide more opportunities for U.S. merchant mariners to serve at \nsea and this measure can lead to those opportunities. Finally, the \nmeasure would lead to increased work for our nation's shipyards and \nbuild on the limited construction plans for large cruise ships \ncurrently underway.\n  I want to highlight some of the major provisions of the bill in order \nto ensure that the legislation we are introducing today is not confused \nwith previous measures that allowed for the operation of foreign \nflagged vessels in the U.S. domestic market. The bill we are \nintroducing today provides a two-year window of opportunity to \nencourage the immediate reflagging of large cruise vessels under the \nUnited States flag for operation in the domestic cruise trades. The \nbill would allow the Secretary of Transportation to issue permits for \nthe limited operation of foreign-built cruise vessels in the domestic \ntrades if applications are received within two years of the date of \nenactment of this legislation.\n  To be eligible for reflagging and operation in the U.S. domestic \ncruise trades, a cruise vessel must have been delivered after January \n1, 1980, and be at least 20,000 gross registered tons, have no fewer \nthan 800 passenger berths, provide a full range of \novernight accommodations, dining, and entertainment services, comply \nwith the Safety of Life at Sea requirements for a fixed smoke detection \nand sprinkler system in the accommodation areas, and be constructed \naccording to internationally accepted construction standards. This will \nhelp ensure that any foreign flag vessels reflagged to take advantage \nof the bill are modern and safe.\n\n  To be eligible to enter the domestic market, the vessel must be owned \nby a citizen of the United States as defined in section 2 of the \nShipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. 802) or section 12106(e) of title 46 \nUnited States Code.\n  The bill would assist the U.S. ship repair industry and would require \nforeign built cruise vessels entering the domestic market to have all \nrepair, maintenance, alteration and other work required for operation \nunder the U.S. flag, as well as regular repair and maintenance work, \nperformed in a U.S. shipyard.\n  Prior to allowing a foreign built vessel to be reflagged and utilized \nin the domestic market, the bill would require the operator of a \nreflagged vessel to enter into a binding contract with U.S. shipyards \nfor the construction of at least one more vessel than the total number \nof vessels they will operate in the domestic cruise market. The \ncontract must provide for a total number of passenger berths equal to \nor greater than the number operated in the domestic market by that \noperator. Additionally, the replacement vessels must be at least 20,000 \ngross registered tons and have no fewer than 800 passenger berths.\n  The bill would require the first replacement vessel to be delivered \nwithin five years of the date the foreign-built vessel commences \noperation in the domestic trade and that each additional vessel be \ndelivered within two years of the preceding vessel. Foreign built \nvessels are required to leave the domestic market two years after the \nreplacement vessel or vessels are delivered.\n  The bill would require the Secretary to Transportation to insure that \nthe coastwise business of a U.S. built vessel operator is not harmed by \nthe operation of a foreign-built vessel in the domestic market. The \nSecretary, after reviewing the proposed itineraries of foreign-built \nvessels in the domestic market, as well as taking into consideration \npublic comments, is required to determine if there will be an adverse \nimpact on the operation of a U.S.-built vessel. The Secretary is \nrequired to consider the scope of the vessel's itineraries, the \nduration of the cruise, the size of the vessel and the retail per diem \nof the vessel. If there is a conflict, the operator of a foreign-built \nvessel must change the vessel's itinerary in order to remove the \nconflict to the satisfaction of the Secretary.\n  The slow and limited growth of the U.S. domestic cruise market \ndemands that we put aside special interests and pass this measure at \nthe first available opportunity. I can assure my colleagues that as \nChairman, the Senate Committee will continue to work with all members \ninterested in the future of a U.S. flagged cruise fleet to further \naddress any concerns with the bill. But I would also ask all members to \ncompare the limited growth of our domestic fleet to the dynamic growth \nin the international cruise market in hopes that they will realize that \nwithout actions soon, the U.S. fleet will be left behind.\n  The bill we are introducing today will stimulate growth and \nopportunity within the domestic cruise ship trade with the \nbeneficiaries being U.S. port cities and business, and as I have often \nsaid, the millions of American citizens who want to be able to enjoy \ncruising between U.S. ports.\n  I hope my colleagues will join Senators Hutchison, Cleland, \nMurkowski,\n\n[[Page S403]]\n\nand me to help advance this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 127\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

REPAIRS REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary may not issue a certificate \n     of documentation under section 101(a) for an eligible cruise \n     vessel unless the operator establishes to the satisfaction of \n     the Secretary that--\n       (1) any repair, maintenance, alteration, or other \n     preparation of the vessel for operation under a certificate \n     of documentation issued under section 101(a) have been, or \n     will be, performed in a United States shipyard; and\n       (2) any repair, maintenance, or alteration of the vessel \n     after a certificate of documentation is issued under that \n     section will be performed in a United States shipyard.\n       (b) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive the requirements of \n     subsection (a) if the Secretary finds that the repair, \n     maintenance, alterations, or other preparation services are \n     not available in the United States or if an emergency \n     dictates that the vessel proceed to a foreign port.\n\n     SEC. 103. CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) Construction Contract Required.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), a \n     vessel for which a certificate of documentation has been \n     issued under section 101(a) may not commence operations in \n     the coastwise trade until the operator of that vessel \n     executes a contract with one or more United States shipyards \n     for the construction of a total of 2 or more cruise vessels \n     with a total combined berth or stateroom capacity equal to at \n     least the total combined berth or stateroom capacity of that \n     vessel. If certificates of documentation are issued under \n     section 101(a) for more than 1 vessel for an operator, the \n     construction contract required by the preceding sentence \n     shall provide for the construction of 1 more vessel than the \n     number of vessels for which certificates of documentation are \n     issued with a total combined berth or stateroom capacity \n     equal to at least the total combined berth or stateroom \n     capacity of the vessels for which the certificates of \n     documentation are issued.\n       (2) Demonstration of Capability Required.--For purposes of \n     this subsection, a construction contract for which financing \n     is not provided under title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, \n     1936 (46 U.S.C. App. 1101 et seq.) shall not be recognized as \n     meeting the requirements of paragraph (1) unless both the \n     operator and the shipyard are capable of completing the \n     contract. For purposes of this paragraph--\n       (A) an operator shall be considered to be capable of \n     completing such a contract if the operator meets the \n     standards set forth in sections 298.12, 298.13, and 298.14 of \n     title 46, Code of Federal Regulations; and\n       (B) a shipyard shall be considered to be capable of \n     completing such a contract if the shipyard meets the \n     standards set forth in section 298.32(a) of that title.\n       (b) Minimum Size Requirement.--For purposes of this \n     section, a contract for the construction of a vessel shall be \n     disregarded if that vessel--\n       (1) will be less than 20,000 gross registered tons; or\n       (2) will have fewer than 800 passenger berths.\n       (c) Contract Terms.--\n       (1) In general.--The contract required by subsection (a) \n     shall provide for delivery of the first such vessel not later \n     than 60 months after the date on which operations of the \n     vessel for which the certificate of documentation was issued \n     commence, and shall contain any other provisions required by \n     the Secretary for purposes of this subsection. If the \n     contract provides for the construction of more than 1 vessel, \n     it shall provide for delivery of each vessel subsequent to \n     the first not later than 24 months after delivery of the \n     immediately preceding vessel.\n       (2) Extension of time periods for impossibility of \n     performance.--If the commencement of construction or the \n     completion of construction is prevented or delayed by \n     circumstances that would be recognized as providing a defense \n     of impossibility-of-performance by the shipyard under \n     applicable contract law, each time period in this Act related \n     to delivery of a vessel by that shipyard shall be extended \n     for whatever period of time the circumstance on which the \n     defense is predicated continues to exist.\n       (d) Expiration of Coastwise Endorsement.--The coastwise \n     endorsement for an eligible cruise vessel under section \n     101(a) shall expire 24 months after the delivery date for the \n     replacement vessel or vessels for that eligible cruise \n     vessel. For purposes of this subsection, the term \n     ``replacement vessel or vessels'' means 1 or more vessels the \n     operator of the eligible cruise vessel is obligated to \n     construct in the United States under the contract described \n     in subsection (a) with respect to the eligible cruise vessel \n     that have at least the same number of passenger berths as the \n     eligible cruise vessel, or they, replace.\n       (e) Reflagging Under Foreign Registry.--Notwithstanding \n     section 9(c) of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 U.S.C. App. 808), \n     the operator of an eligible cruise vessel issued a \n     certificate of documentation with a temporary coastwise \n     endorsement under section 101(a), or a cruise vessel \n     constructed under a contract described in subsection (a) of \n     this section, may place that vessel under foreign registry.\n\n     SEC. 104. CERTAIN OPERATIONS PROHIBITED.\n\n       Neither an eligible cruise vessel operating in domestic \n     itineraries under a certificate of\n\n[[Page S404]]\n\n     documentation issued under section 101(a) nor a vessel \n     constructed under a contract described in section 103(a) \n     may--\n       (1) operate as a ferry;\n       (2) regularly carry for hire both passengers and vehicles \n     or other cargo; or\n       (3) operate between or among the islands of Hawaii.\n\n     SEC. 105. PRIORITIES WITHIN DOMESTIC MARKETS.\n\n       (a) Notification of Secretary.--\n       (1) New vessels.--Any person eligible under section 12102 \n     of title 46, United States Code, to document a vessel under \n     chapter 121 of that title that enters into a contract with a \n     United States shipyard for the construction of a cruise \n     vessel that--\n       (A) will be at least 20,000 gross registered tons,\n       (B) will have no fewer than 800 passenger berths, and\n       (C) is otherwise eligible for a certificate of \n     documentation and a coastwise trade endorsement,\n     shall notify the Secretary, at such time and in such manner \n     and form as the Secretary may require, of the construction of \n     that vessel not less than 2 full calendar years before the \n     earliest date on which the vessel is intended to commence \n     operations.\n       (2) Reconstruction.--The notification requirement of \n     paragraph (1) also applies to any such person that enters \n     into a contract with a United States shipyard for the \n     reconstruction of any vessel, including a vessel that has a \n     certificate of documentation under chapter 121 of title 46, \n     United States Code, will, after reconstruction, will be that \n     size and capacity and be eligible for such an endorsement.\n       (b) Priority to U.S.-Built Vessels.--The Secretary shall \n     give priority to any cruise vessel described in subsection \n     (a) over any other cruise vessel of comparable operations in \n     a comparable market under a certificate of documentation \n     issued under section 101(a) if the Secretary, after notice \n     and an opportunity for public comment, determines that the \n     employment in the coastwise trade of the vessel issued a \n     certificate of documentation under section 101(a) will \n     adversely affect the coastwise trade business of any person \n     operating a vessel not documented under section 101(a) in the \n     coastwise trade.\n       (c) Factors Considered.--In determining and assigning \n     priorities, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors \n     determined by the Secretary to be appropriate--\n       (A) the scope of a vessel's itinerary, including--\n       (i) the ports between which it operates;

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nthe payment of a monthly stipend to the surviving parents (known as \n``Gold Star Parents'') of members of the Armed Forces who die during a \nperiod of war; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                     gold star parents annuity act\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Gold Star \nParents Annuity Act. The use of the Gold Star to denote the death of a \nservice member or members in a family was started during World War I by \nPresident Woodrow Wilson. The idea behind the Gold Star was that it \ncould symbolize the family's devotion and pride in the ultimate \nsacrifice for their country made by their family member instead of the \nsense of personal loss that is represented by the traditional mourning \nsymbols.\n  The Gold Star Parents Annuity Act provides for an annuity of $125 a \nmonth payable to each individual who has received a Gold Star Lapel \npin, which is awarded to parents who have had a child die honorably in \nservice to our country. Payments are to be divided equally among \nparents when there is more than one surviving parent. The receipt of \nthis pension will not deprive anyone of the right to any other \npensions, benefit, right or privilege that\n\n[[Page S405]]\n\nthey are entitled to under any existing or future law. Furthermore, \nthese special pension payments will not be subject to any attachment, \nexecution, levy, tax lien or detention under any process. I believe \nthis measure would provide a needed increase in income for many parents \nwho have lost children in service to our country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 129\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Gold Star Parents Annuity \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SPECIAL PENSION FOR GOLD STAR PARENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) Chapter 15 of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subchapter:\n\n         ``SUBCHAPTER V--SPECIAL PENSION FOR GOLD STAR PARENTS\n\n     ``Sec. 1571.

In any case in which there is more than one parent \n     eligible for special pension under this section with respect \n     to the death of a person, the Secretary shall divide the \n     payment equally among those eligible parents.\n       ``(c) The receipt of special pension under this section \n     shall not deprive any person of any other pension or other \n     benefit, right, or privilege to which such person is or may \n     hereafter be entitled under any existing or subsequent law. \n     Special pension under this section shall be paid in addition \n     to all other payments under laws of the United States.\n       ``(d) Special pension under this section shall not be \n     subject to any attachment, execution, levy, tax lien, or \n     detention under any process whatever.\n       ``(e) For purposes of this section, the term `parent' has \n     the meaning provided in section 1126(d)(2) of title 10.''.\n       (2) The table of sections at the beginning of such chapter \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n         ``subchapter v--special pension for gold star parents\n\n``1571.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to modify the \nannual determination of the rate of the basic benefit of active duty \neducational assistance under the Montgomery GI Bill, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n              VETERANS' HIGHER EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator Susan \nCollins (R-ME) in introducing the Veterans' Higher Education \nOpportunities Act. Last year, Senator Collins and I introduced similar \nlegislation, S. 2419, that received broad, bipartisan support in \nCongress and among the veterans and higher education communities. Our \ngoal with this year's legislation remains the same: to modernize the \nMontgomery GI Bill and help veterans achieve their goals of higher \neducation.\n  The 1944 GI Bill of Rights is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation ever passed by Congress. No program has been more \nsuccessful in increasing educational opportunities for our country's \nveterans while also providing a valuable incentive for the best and \nbrightest to make a career out of military service. This bill has \nallowed eight million veterans to finish high school and 2.3 million \nservice members to attend college.\n  Unfortunately, the current GI Bill can no longer deliver these \nresults and fails in its promise to veterans, new recruits and the men \nand women of the armed services. The Veterans' Higher Education \nOpportunities Act will modernize the GI Bill and ensure its viability \nas education costs continue to increase.\n  Over 96 percent of recruits currently sign up for the Montgomery GI \nBill and pay $1,200 out of their first year's pay to guarantee \neligibility. But only one-half of these military personnel use any of \nthe current Montgomery GI Bill benefits. This is evidence that the \ncurrent GI Bill simply does not meet their needs. The main reason why \nmilitary personnel no longer use the GI Bill is because GI Bill \nbenefits have not kept pace with increased costs of education.\n  There is consensus among national higher education and veterans \nassociations that at a minimum, the GI Bill should pay the costs of \nattending the average four-year public institution as a commuter \nstudent. The current Montgomery GI Bill benefit pays a little more than \nhalf of that cost.\n  The Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act creates that \nbenchmark by indexing the GI Bill to the costs of attending the average \nfour-year public institution as a commuter student. This benchmark cost \nwill be updated annually by the College Board in order for the GI Bill \nto keep pace with increasing costs of education.\n  The Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act is truly a \nbipartisan effort to address recruitment and retention in the armed \nforces. In addition, the Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act \nhas the overwhelming support of the Partnership for Veterans' \nEducation--a coalition of the nation's leading veterans groups and \nhigher education organizations including the VFW, the American Council \non Education, the Non Commissioned Officers Association, the National \nAssociation of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges, and The \nRetired Officers Association.\n  As the parent of a son who serves in the Army, these military \n``quality of life'' issues are of particular concern to me. Making the \nGI Bill pay for viable educational opportunity makes as much sense \ntoday as it did following World War II. In fact, a study conducted on \nbeneficiaries of the original GI Bill shows that the cost to benefit \nratio of the GI Bill was an astounding 12.5 to 1. That means that our \nnation gained more than $12.50 in benefits for every dollar invested in \ncollege or graduate education for veterans.\n  Congress and the President took an important step last year toward \nimproving the Montgomery GI Bill by passing into law the Veterans \nBenefits and Health Care Improvement Act of 2000. This law increases \nthe monthly education benefit to $650 and increases educational \nbenefits of veterans survivors and dependents. These changes are long \noverdue, and the next step in restoring the effectiveness of the \nMontgomery GI Bill is through the Veterans' Higher Education \nOpportunities Act and the creation of a true benchmark for veterans \neducational benefits.\n  The very modest cost of improving the GI Bill will help our military \nand our society.

Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Johnson, in introducing the Veterans' Higher \nEducation Opportunities Act of 2001. This legislation, which is an \nupdated version of the measure we introduced in the 106th Congress, \nwill provide our veterans with expanded educational opportunities at a \nreasonable cost. Endorsed by the Partnership for Veterans Education, a \nbroad coalition including over 40 veterans service organizations and \neducation associations, our legislation provides a new model for \ntoday's G.I. Bill that is logical, fair, and worthy of a nation that \nvalues both higher education and our veterans.\n  The original G.I. Bill was enacted in 1944. As a result of this \ninitiative, 7.8 million World War II veterans were able to take \nadvantage of post-service education and training opportunities, \nincluding more than 2 million veterans who went on to college. My own \nfather was among those veterans who served bravely in World War II and \nthen came back home to resume his education with assistance from the \nG.I. Bill.\n  Since that time, the G.I. Bill has seen a number of changes but has \ncontinued to assist millions of veterans in taking advantage of the \neducational opportunities they put on hold in order to serve their \ncountry. New laws were enacted to provide educational assistance to \nthose who served in Korea and Vietnam, as well as to those who served \nduring the period in between. Since the change to an all-volunteer \nservice, additional adjustments to these programs were made, leading up \nto the enactment of the Montgomery G.I. Bill in 1985.\n  The Montgomery G.I. Bill has served our country well over the past 15 \nyears. However, the value of the educational benefit assistance it \nprovides has greatly eroded over time due to inflation and the \nescalating cost of higher education. Military recruiters indicate that \nthe program's benefits no longer serve as a strong incentive to join \nthe military; nor do they serve as a retention tool valuable enough to \npersuade men and women to stay in the military and defer the full or \npart-time pursuit of their higher education until a later date. Perhaps \nmost important, the program is losing its value as a means to help our \nmen and women in uniform readjust to civilian life after military \nservice.\n  This point really hit home for me when I met last year with \nrepresentatives of the Maine State Approving Agency (SAA) for Veterans \nEducation Programs. They told me of the ever-increasing difficulties \nthat service members are facing in using the G.I. Bill's benefits for \neducation and training.\n  For example, the Maine representatives told me that the majority of \ntoday's veterans are married and have children. Yet, the Montgomery \nG.I. Bill often does not cover the cost of tuition to attend a public \ninstitution, let alone the other costs associated with the pursuit of \nhigher education and those required to help support a family.\n  The basic benefit program of the Vietnam era G.I. Bill provided $493 \nper month in 1981 to a veteran with a spouse and two children. Before \nthe reforms of last year, a veteran in identical circumstances received \nonly $43 more, a mere 8% increase over a time period when inflation has \nnearly doubled, and a dollar buys only half of what it once purchased. \nIn constant dollars, the amount was the second-lowest level of \nassistance ever extended under the G.I. Bill to those who served in the \ndefense of our country.\n  While we made progress last year in increasing stipend levels under \nthe G.I. Bill, the reforms fell drastically short of allocating \nsufficient funds to cover the current cost of higher education. \nMoreover, the increase failed to address the structural reforms needed \nto ensure that the G.I. Bill provides sufficient funds for the \neducation of our nation's veterans long into the 21st Century.\n  To address these problems, we are offering a modern version of the \nMontgomery G.I. Bill. Our new model establishes a sensible, easily \nunderstood benchmark for G.I. Bill benefits. The benchmark sets G.I. \nBill benefits at ``the average monthly costs of tuition and expenses \nfor commuter students at public institutions of higher education that \naward baccalaureate degrees.'' This common sense provision would serve \nas the foundation upon which future education stipends for all veterans \nwould be based and would set benefits at a level sufficient to provide \nveterans the education promised to them at recruitment.\n  The current G.I. Bill now provides nine monthly $650 stipends per \nyear for four years. The total benefit is $23,400. Under the new \nbenchmark established by this legislation, the monthly stipend for this \nacademic year would be $1025, producing a new total benefit of $36,900 \nfor the four academic years. By using our benchmark, which is updated \nannually by the College Board, the G.I. Bill benefits will truly \nreflect the current cost of higher education.\n  Mr. President, today's G.I. Bill is woefully under-funded and does \nnot provide the financial support necessary for our veterans to meet \ntheir educational goals. The legislation that we are proposing would \nfulfill the promise made to our nation's veterans, help with recruiting \nand retention of men and women in our military, and reflect current \ncosts of higher education. Now is the time to enact these modest \nimprovements to the basic benefit program of the Montgomery G.I. Bill. \nI urge all members of the Senate to join Senator Johnson and myself in \nsupport of the Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Reid, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Daschle, Ms. Snowe and Mr. Conrad)\n  S. 132. A bill to amend the International Revenue Code of 1986 to \nprovide that housing assistance provided under the Native American \nHousing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 be treated for \npurposes of the low-income housing credit in the same manner as \ncomparable assistance; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     low income housing tax credits\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will correct an unintended oversight in the federal \nadministration of Native American housing programs, allowing Indian \ntribes to once again access Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs) for \nhousing development in some of this nation's most under-served \ncommunities.\n  In the 104th Congress, the Native American Housing Assistance and \nSelf-Determination Act (NAHASDA) was signed into law, separating Indian \nhousing from public housing and providing block grants to tribes and \ntheir tribally designated housing authorities. Prior to passage of \nNAHASDA, Indian tribes receiving HOME block grant funds were able to \nuse those funds to leverage the Low Income Housing Tax Credits \ndistributed by states on a competitive basis. Unfortunately, unlike \nHOME funds, block\n\n[[Page S407]]\n\ngrants to tribes under the new NAHASDA are defined as federal funds and \ncannot be used for accessing LIHTCs.\n  The fact that tribes cannot use their new block grant funds to access \na program (LIHTC) which they formerly could access is an unintended \nconsequence of taking Indian Housing out of Public Housing at HUD and \nsetting up the otherwise productive and much needed NAHASDA system. The \nlegislation I am introducing today is limited in scope and redefines \nNAHASDA funds, restoring tribal eligibility for the LIHTC by putting \nNAHASDA funds on the same footing as HOME funds. With this technical \ncorrection, there would be no change to the LIHTC programs--tribes \nwould compete for LIHTCs with all other entities at the state level, \njust as they did prior to NAHASDA.\n  This technical corrections legislation is a minor but much needed fix \nto a valuable program that will restore equity to housing development \nacross the country. The South Dakota Housing Development Authority has \nenthusiastically endorsed this legislation out of concern for equitable \ntreatment of every resident of our state and to reinforce the proven \nsuccess of the LIHTC program for housing development in rural and lower \nincome communities.\n  I have joined many of my colleagues in past efforts to preserve and \nincrease the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program which benefits every \nstate, and I ask my colleagues to recognize the importance of \nmaintaining fairness in access to this program emphasized through this \nlegislation and encourage my colleagues to support passage of this \nvital legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Low Income Housing Tax \n     Credit for Native Americans Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CERTAIN NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE \n                   DISREGARDED IN DETERMINING WHETHER BUILDING IS \n                   FEDERALLY SUBSIDIZED FOR PURPOSES OF THE LOW-\n                   INCOME HOUSING CREDIT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (E) of section 42(i)(2) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to determination \n     of whether building is federally subsidized) is amended--\n       (1) in clause (i), by inserting ``or the Native American \n     Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 \n     U.S.C. 4101 et seq.)

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue code of 1986 to make \npermanent the exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  Employee educational assistance act\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nmake permanent a temporary tax code provision that permits employers to \npay for their employees' college tuition costs without the employee \nhaving to pay tax on the amount of the assistance. Senator Grassley \njoins me as an original co-sponsor of the legislation.\n  Since its inception in 1979, section 127 of the tax code has enabled \nthousands of employers to promote continuing education among their \nemployees and enabled millions of workers to advance their job skills \nwithout incurring additional taxes.\n  Under current law, an employer may provide up to $5,250 per year in \ntuition assistance to its employees without any reduction in the \nemployee's take-home pay. This simple rule applies regardless of \nwhether the classes undertaken are necessary to maintain an employee's \njob or to qualify for a new job. Without section 127, only those \ncourses that directly relate to the employee's current job can be \nsubsidized without additional taxes.\n  Section 127 has increased upward mobility for workers in an efficient \nmanner that is supported by workers, educators and business. Workers \ncan improve their job skills and prepare themselves for increased \nresponsibility. Businesses can maintain qualified employees and help \nthem advance within the organization. Educators and other students \nbenefit from having students with real world experience participating \nin the classroom.\n  Congress has recognized the strength of section 127. In 1997 the \nSenate voted to make the provision permanent. In the 106th Congress, \nall 20 members of the Finance Committee sponsored legislation to make \nsection 127 permanent. So why hasn't the legislation been enacted? \nWhile it is difficult to be sure, bills including permanent extension \nalways come back from a conference with the House of Representatives as \na short extension with no coverage for graduate courses. Our hope is \nthat this year will be different.\n  There are two principal flaws in section 127. First, the benefit is \nscheduled to expire on December 31, 2001. The provision has been \nextended ten times since it original enactment. During 1995, the \nprovision was expired and, even though reenacted in 1996, employers \nwere not sure at the end of 1995 whether or not to report as income \ntheir employee-assistance program. We have had this provision in the \nCode long enough to know that it works and we should make it permanent. \nThe bill Senator Grassley and I introduce today would do just that.\n  The second flaw is that the program is limited to employer assistance \nfor undergraduate courses. If an employer wants to provide funds for \nits employees to attend graduate school, then the employee has to \nincrease his or her wages income and tax liability. For example, \nsuppose a bank has an employee who wants to pursue an MBA. The employee \nearns $30,000 per year and pays $3,000 in federal income taxes. If the \ntuition costs $4,000, all of which is paid by the employer, then the \nworker has to pay 15 percent of the value of the assistance, or $600 in \nincome taxes. This can be a strong disincentive for low and moderate \nincome workers to accept an employer-sponsored tuition assistance \noffer.\n  The importance of graduate education has increased dramatically in \nthe past two decades. For an increasing number of positions, graduate \ncoursework is essential. For an increasing number of employers, \nproviding graduate education is necessary to retain employees who are \ncapable of doing work at higher levels, for more compensation. The bill \nwould permit exclusion of employer-provided tuition benefits for \nundergraduate and graduate education.\n  Section 127 is one of the most successful education programs the \nfederal government has ever undertaken. The legislation I am \nintroducing today expands the program to graduate education and makes \nthe provision permanent. I urge my colleagues to work with Senator \nGrassley and me as we seek to enact this legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY: Mr. President, today I am joining with Senator Max \nBaucus in introducing a bill that would make permanent the exclusion \nfor employer-provided educational assistance under Sec. 127 of the \nInternal Revenue Code. Section 127 allows public or private employers \nto provide up to $5,250 per year to each of their employees in tax-free \nreimbursement for tuition, books and fees for job or non-job related \neducation. Section 127 is a purely private-sector initiative and the \none vehicle that encourages employer investment and assistance in \nproviding educational assistance to its workers. There is no \nbureaucracy administering this program--it is run through the \ngenerosity of private sector employers who provide educational \nopportunities to their employees in the interest of raising workforce \nproductivity and making their businesses more competitive. Like other \ntypes of benefits, Sec. 127 employer-provided educational assistance \nmust be provided on a nondiscriminatory basis and may not favor highly-\ncompensated employees.\n  The Revenue Act of 1978 created Sec. 127 and established employer-\nprovided educational assistance as excludable for any type of course, \nother than a hobby or a sport. Prior to 1978, only specific ``job-\nrelated'' education was excludable from taxable income. The provision \nhas\n\n[[Page S408]]\n\nbeen extended numerous times since its inception. It is time for the \nexclusion to become permanent.\n  I commend the leadership of Senator Max Baucus for bringing this bill \nbefore the Senate and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill. I hope \nthe rest of our colleagues in the Senate will join in supporting the \nenactment of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 134. A bill to ban the importation of large capacity ammunition \nfeeding devices; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n       large capacity ammunition magazine import ban act of 2001\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to re-introduce the same ban on \nimporting large capacity ammunition magazines that passed both Houses \nof Congress in 1999 during the Juvenile Justice debate.\n  That amendment passed the Senate by voice vote after a Motion to \nTable failed 59-39.\n  The same provision, offered by then-Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde on \nthe House floor, passed by voice vote as an amendment to the House \nJuvenile Justice Gun Bill.\n  Nevertheless, these clips continue to flood into the country, because \nthe Juvenile Justice bill became stalled in Conference, and never got \nto the President's desk.\n  It is time to take care of this once and for all--outside of \npolitics, and outside of partisan bickering over other provisions. We \nsimply cannot stand by and watch millions of these killer clips flood \nour shores.\n  Large-capacity ammunition clips are ammunition feeding devices, such \nas clips, magazines, drums and belts, which hold more than ten rounds \nof ammunition.\n  The 1994 assault weapons ban prohibited the domestic manufacture of \nthese devices, but foreign companies are still sending them to our \nshores by the hundreds of thousands.\n  As the author of the 1994 provision, I can assure you that this was \nnot our intent. We intended to ban the future manufacture of all high \ncapacity clips, leaving only a narrow clause allowing for the \nimportation of clips already on their way to this country.\n  Instead, due to the grandfather clause inserted into the 1994 \nlegislation, BATF has allowed millions of foreign clips into this \ncountry, with no true method of determining date of manufacture. \nBetween March 1998 and March 1999, BATF approved more than 11.4 million \nlarge-capacity clips for importation into America.\n  By voting for the amendment to the Juvenile Justice bill in 1999, a \nsignificant majority of this body has already agreed that it is both \nillogical and irresponsible to permit foreign companies to sell items \nto the American public--particularly items that are so often used for \ndeadly purposes--that U.S. companies are prohibited from selling.\n  Supporting this legislation once again will simply finish what we \nalready started during the juvenile justice debate, and bring foreign \ncompanies into greater compliance with the original intent of the 1994 \nlaw.\n  Opposing this bill would effectively allow foreign companies to \ncontinue to flout our laws, while domestic companies remain in \ncompliance.\n  Let me just outline a bit of the history behind this issue.\n  Because of strong NRA opposition to the 1994 assault weapons ban and \nfears that businesses with inventories of the newly illegal products \nwould be adversely impacted, we carved out a clause during negotiations \nto allow pre-existing guns and clips to remain on the shelves of stores \nacross this country.\n  This so-called ``grandfather clause'' was also meant to allow guns \nand clips already on their way to this country to get here. Some \nSenators did not want to penalize companies that already had shipments \nin transit.\n  But it has now been more than six years, and these companies have had \nmore than enough time to ship their pre-existing supplies of clips to \nthe United States. Without question, many of these clips now flooding \nthis country were made after the 1994 ban took effect. But because the \nATF cannot tell when the clips were made, they must allow their import.\n  In 1998, President Clinton stopped the importation of most copycat \nassault weapons to this country with an Executive Order. However, the \nJustice Department advised us that the President does not have the \nauthority to ban importation of big clips. As a result, millions of \nhigh capacity ammunition magazines continue to flow onto our shores and \ninto the hands of criminals and, indeed, our children.\n  These clips come from at least 17 different countries, from Austria \nto Zimbabwe.\n  They come in sizes ranging from 15 rounds per clip to 30, 75, 90, or \neven 250 rounds per clip. In one recent one-year period:\n\n       20,000 clips of 250-rounds came from England;\n       Two million 15-round magazines came from Italy;\n       5,000 clips of 70-rounds came from the Czech Republic.\n\n  And the list goes on, and on, and on.\n  Mr. President, 75, 90 and even 250-round clips have no sporting \npurpose. They are not used for self defense. They have only one use--\nthe purposeful killing of other men, women and children.\n  The legislation I re-introduce today will stop the flow of these \nclips into this country. I know that we cannot eliminate these clips \nfrom existence. But we can make them harder to obtain and, over time, \ndry up their supply.\n  These big clips allow disgruntled workers, angry children and \npsychopathic killers to exponentially increase the damage of their \ncrimes. Let me give you just two examples.\n  In the now famous Springfield, Oregon shooting, a 15 year-old gunman \nwith a 30-round clip killed two people and injured 22 more. Two dead, \n22 wounded, all from one ammunition clip. It was only when his clip was \nfinally empty and he had to pause to change clips that a fellow student \nwas able to tackle and subdue him. Just imagine if the clip had held 75 \nrounds. Or 90. Or 250.\n  In the Jonesboro, Arkansas shooting, the two boys were armed with ten \nguns, one of which was a Universal carbine equipped with a 15-round \nkiller clip. All 15 of the bullets in the killer clip were fired--more \nrounds than in all of the other nine guns combined. Five people were \nkilled, ten other wounded.\n  Mr. President, in passing this legislation, we will not put an end to \nall incidents of gun violence now or in the near future. But we will \nbegin to limit the destructive power of that violence. It will not stop \nevery troubled child or adult who decides to commit an act of violence \nfrom doing so, but we can limit the tools used to carry out that act.\n  Passing this bill will not infringe on the legitimate rights of any \nadult gun owner or prevent a son or daughter from protecting the family \nfrom harm. It will not create a new category of banned guns.\n  But it will save some lives. It is just that simple. So let us do our \nbest to ensure that the next time a troubled or vengeful child decides \nto strike out at his classmates, he cannot so easily find a gun that \nfires a hundred rounds a minute, or holds dozens of armor-piercing \nbullets.\n  Mr. President, I urge any of my colleagues who remain skeptical to \nlook beyond the opposition rhetoric and into the heart of this \nlegislation. And I urge them to look into their own hearts, and to \nrealize that there are some things we can do to keep future Littletons \nfrom happening. This legislation is one of them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record following the statement.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove payments for direct graduate, medical education under the \nmedicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        correcting the direct graduate medical education formula\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto reform the longstanding inequity in the Medicare Direct Graduate \nMedical Education (DGME) formula that has unfairly compensated many \nteaching hospitals across the country in the past 15 years.\n  The Medicare DGME payment compensates teaching hospitals for many of \nthe costs related to the graduate training of physicians.\n  This legislation is timely as many of our nation's 400 teaching \nhospitals are in the midst of a serious financial crisis.\n  Over 72 percent of all teaching hospitals are currently operating \nwith negative margins, according to the Association of American Medical \nColleges. Approximately 42 percent of the 100 major teaching hospitals \ncould be operating at a loss by 2002.\n  Teaching hospitals are losing millions of dollars annually.\n  The University of Pennsylvania reported a $200 million deficit in \n1999.\n  In Massachusetts, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham and \nWomen's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the New England \nMedical Center posted operating losses for the six month period of \nOctober 1998 to March 1999 totaling more than $63 million.\n  The University of Minnesota sold its hospital to a private company in \n1997 because ``it was bleeding red ink,'' according to the university's \nsenior Vice-President for health sciences.\n  Wayne State University in Michigan lost nearly $200 million in 1998 \nand 1999.\n  Georgetown University lost $83 million in 1999, $62 million in 1998, \nand $57 million in 1997.\n  In my State, the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) has seen \nits net income plunge $50 million and bottom out close to zero.\n  The University of California San Francisco faces a $25 million loss \nover the next year.\n  Excluding the University of California San Francisco, all University \nof California teaching hospitals collectively lost $90 million in net \nincome since 1997.\n  Many factors are to blame for the financial crisis of our nation's \nteaching hospitals.\n  Balanced Budget Act of 1997:\n  The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 took a major blow at teaching \nhospitals, significantly cutting federal Medicare payments.\n  The cuts included in BBA 1997, for example, has meant a loss of $25 \nmillion over three years to UCLA.\n  Penetration of Managed Care:\n  Managed care payments to many teaching hospitals barely cover costs. \nTwenty-eight percent of all privately insured Americans are enrolled in \nan HMO. In California, this number is 88 percent.\n  For example, California's capitation rate is one of the lowest in the \nnation. The average capitation rate in the State reached its peak in \n1993 at $45 per month. Last year, the rate sunk to $29, while the cost \nof living jumped 25.2 percent.\n  Increasing Number of Uninsured:\n  The number of uninsured has exploded. Today, 44 million Americans are \nwithout health insurance, California alone has 7 million uninsured \nresidents.\n  The high rate of uninsured impacts teaching hospitals because they \nare a major safety net provider--teaching hospitals provide \napproximately 44 percent of all care to the indigent. This means that \nwhen our nation's uninsured require medical care for complicated and \ncomplex pathologies, they find their way to teaching hospitals.\n  Academic medical centers affiliated with the University of \nCalifornia, for example, are the second largest safety net for a State \nthat has the fourth highest uninsured rate in the country.\n  These are three examples of the forces behind the financial crisis of \nour nation's teaching hospitals. Low DGME payments further erode and \ndestabilize the health care system.\n  Academic medical centers have three major responsibilities and \nmissions--teaching, research, and patient care--which cause them to \nincur costs unique to such facilities. ``If just one leg of that three-\nlegged stool is weak, it [academic medical centers] becomes \ndestabilized,'' said Dr. Gerald Levey, UCLA's provost for health \nsciences. Low DGME payments are weakening teaching hospitals' ability \nto train future physicians.\n  Teaching hospitals account for only 6 percent of the nation's 5,000 \nhospitals. Despite the small number of teaching hospitals, they are a \nmajor provider of care. Teaching hospitals house: Forty percent of all \nneonatal intensive care units; fifty-three percent of pediatric \nintensive care units; and seventy percent of all burn units.\n\n  Teaching hospitals also handle: Twenty percent of all inpatient \nadmissions; twenty-two percent of outpatient visits; nineteen percent \nof surgical operations, including 82 percent of all open heart \nsurgeries; sixteen percent of emergency visits; and nineteen percent of \nall births.\n  The bottom line is that the financial crisis faced by teaching \nhospitals is impacting patient access to and quality of care.\n  California has been particularly impacted by this financial crisis.\n  Let me tell you how an outpatient eye clinic at the University of \nCalifornia, San Francisco has been impacted by the financial crisis \nfacing teaching hospitals.\n  The clinic has a patient mix that is approximately 70 percent \nMedicare and 30 percent Medi-Cal. Due in part to historically low DGME \npayments, the clinic has had to decrease the number of staff, increase \npatient load, and cut faculty salaries by 15 percent. The number of \npatients seen on an average day, for example, has increased from 12 per \nhalf day to 18. Less time with each patient compromises quality of \ncare.\n  According to a 1965 Medicare rule, Medicare paid for its share of \nDGME costs based on each hospital's ``Medicare allowable costs.'' This \nallowed for open-ended reimbursement.\n  Congress changed the methodology used to determine payments in 1986, \nand retroactively established Fiscal Year 1985 as the base year for all \nfuture calculations for DGME payments. The problem, which created this \ndisparity in payments, is that some teaching hospitals narrowly \ninterpreted the law and did not claim such expenses as faculty costs \nand benefits in 1985.\n  Submitted claims for 1985 were then used to determine a ``base \nformula'' for each teaching hospital. The base formula determined for \neach teaching hospital in 1985 has been used to determine all DGME \npayments since 1985 and disadvantages many teaching hospitals.\n  To give you an idea of the large variation in payments, 10 percent of \nteaching hospitals had per-resident payments of more than $98,800 in \n1995, whereas the average payment for another 10 percent was below \n$37,400. The national mean in 1995 was $62,700.\n  A study conducted last year based on data from the Health Care \nFinancing Administration (HCFA) further highlights the variations among \nteaching hospitals. The study shows that: Beth Israel Medical Center in \nManhattan received an average Medicare payment of $57,010 a year for \neach resident it trains. In comparison, Columbia-Presbyterian Medical \nCenter in Manhattan received an average of $24,444 per resident.\n  Even when cost-of-living and training expenses are presumably similar \n(both hospitals are in Manhattan), there is great variation in the \npayment received by hospitals for training residents.\n  Additional examples of variations in payments include: Montefiore \nMedicare\n\n[[Page S410]]\n\nCenter in the Bronx received an average of $55,073 per resident; \nMassachusetts General Hospital in Boston received an average of $29,843 \nper resident; Cleveland Clinic Hospital received an average of $16,118 \nper resident, and the University of California, Los Angeles Medical \nCenter received an average of $11,908 per resident.\n  In an attempt to level the playing field, the Balanced Budget \nRefinement Act of 1999 (BRA) contained provision that created a 70 \npercent floor and a 140 percentage ceiling for Medicare DGME payments. \nThe Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Improvement Act of 2000 also \ncontained provision to increase the floor to 85 percent in 2002.\n  While Congress has begun to address the tissue of variations in DGME \npayments by implementing a floor and a ceiling for payments in 1999 and \n2000, more must be done.\n  I believe all teaching hospitals should receive reimbursement from \nMedicare that equal the national average. Bringing all teaching \nhospitals up to the national average, without undermining the financial \nstability of those teaching hospitals currently receiving payments \nabove the national average, could help stabilize our nation's health \ncare system.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today takes good steps to \nreduce variations in DGME and restore stability to the system.\n  As established in current law, the floor for Medicare reimbursements \nfor teaching hospitals would equal 85 percent by Fiscal Year 2002. Over \na period of four years (from FY 2003-2006), this legislation would \nbring teaching hospitals that are currently reimbursed by Medicare \nbelow the national average up to the national average.\n  The phase in is as follows:\n  Beginning in Fiscal Year 2003 and 2004, the floor would be increased \nto 90 percent.\n  In Fiscal Year 2005 the floor would be increased to 95 percent.\n  By Fiscal Year 2006, all teaching hospitals would be receiving per \nresident payments that equal at least 100 percent of the national \naverage. Those teaching hospitals receiving payments above the national \naverage would be held harmless.\n  Approximately thirty-eight States benefit under the proposed \nlegislation. Teaching hospitals in several states will benefit over the \nnext several years due in combination to the proposed legislation and \nthe changes made in both 1999 and 2000 to increase the floor for DGME \npayments.\n  California to Benefit:\n  California will gain approximately $61.5 million over the next 6 \nyears as a result of this legislation and the changes made to the DGME \nfloor in 1999 and 2000.\n  For example, the University of California Medical Centers will gain \n$16.3 million over six years. The medical center at the University of \nDavis will gain $3.2 million; the medical center at the University of \nIrvine will gain $1.6 million; UCLA's medical center will gain $5.8 \nmillion; the medical center at the University of San Diego will gain \n$1.8 million; and the medical center at the University of San Francisco \nwill gain approximately $3.9 million.\n  This is merely an example of State impact under the proposed \nlegislation. These numbers are significant. Many of our nation's \nteaching hospitals would greatly benefit under the proposed \nlegislation.\n  The proposed legislation would use new money to move teaching \nhospitals below the national average up to the average. Less than $500 \nmillion over 4 years would be borrowed from the Medicare Part A Trust \nfund to pay for the increase in Medicare payments to direct graduate \nmedical education. So as to keep the Medicare Part A Trust Fund solvent \nbeyond 2025, this legislation authorizes the Senate to appropriate to \nthe Trust Fund annually an amount equal to what is taken out to \nreimburse teaching hospitals at this higher rate.\n  Teaching hospitals rely heavily on DGME payments to train and support \ntheir medical students and faculty.\n  For example, medical education funding in California helps support \n108 hospitals that train more than 6,700 residents over three-to-five \nyear periods. California received $75.1 million in DGME payments in \n1997.\n  Many of the nation's teaching hospitals will be forced to close down \nbeds and lower the quality of care they provide. UCLA has had to lay \noff 300 employees in the past few years due to budget constraints.\n  In a statement issued April 2000 by the Association of American \nMedical Colleges (AMC), the association said that:\n\n       To enhance the credibility of the payment system and to \n     eliminate inequities in payment levels, the AMC believes that \n     payments to any hospital whose per resident DGME amount is \n     below the national average per resident DGME payment levels \n     (adjusted for local variability in cost of living wages) \n     should be raised closer to the national average; additional \n     funding resources should be used to accomplish this \n     adjustment.\n\n  This legislation does just that--over a period of four years, \nteaching hospitals receiving payments below the national average will \nbe brought up to the national average using new money. It is that \nsimple.\n  ``Teaching hospitals are a national resource,'' says Albert \nCarnesale, Chancellor of UCLA. I agree with Chancellor Carnesale. I \nbelieve that the vitality of our nation's teaching hospitals should be \nof highest concern to Congress.\n  As our nation's uninsured rate continues to grow and the population \ncontinues to explode, we must work to ensure that we have an adequate \nsupply of physicians to provide medical care. Training physicians and \nproviding teaching hospitals with the funds necessary to offer this \ntraining should be of highest priority.\n  I believe that a teaching hospital's ability to serve their \ncommunities and train physicians will be further compromised if we do \nnot enact this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 135\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, trade has been very good for America and \nher people. Trade is our game, and we excel at it. In 1999, Americans \nexported a record $956 billion in goods and services. No other country \neven came close.\n  Trade has brought untold benefits to our people not the least of \nwhich are high-paying jobs, increased consumer choice, increased \neconomic competitiveness. When Pericles spoke of Athens in his Funeral \nOration, he might well have been speaking of us: ``The magnitude of our \ncity draws the produce of the world into our harbor, so that to the \nAthenian the fruits of other countries are as familiar a luxury as \nthose of his own.'' Those who peddle defeatism as they clamor for \nprotectionist measures are subverting our best means of growth. As \nPresident Reagan warmed in 1988, ``protectionism is destructionism.''\n  Let me point out to my colleagues that it is not just the United \nStates that profits. The whole world has benefitted from the expansion \nof trade among nations. Trade has been a wealth-generating machine the \nlikes of which the world has never seen. By committing ourselves to an \nopen world trade system, the US and its partners unleashed increasing \neconomic growth and prosperity and brought hope and freedom to more \npeople than any victory in any war in history. It is no wonder that the \nworld trading system we know of as the WTO--formerly the GATT--has gone \nfrom a handful of nations in 1948 to some 140 nations today.\n  My fervent goal has been to keep world trade expanding so that more \npeople in more nations can enjoy what Pericles aptly called the \n``fruits'' of trade. We in America have been at the vanguard of trade \nliberalization efforts, both globally and regionally. We must continue \nthat trend. Unfortunately, over recent years this nation has slid into \nan unwise hiatus in moving new global or regional trade liberalization \ninitiatives. But this year, with a new President, committed to trade, \nwe have a new opportunity before us. Now is the time for us to reassert \nour leadership, to set the pace for trade expansion throughout our \nhemisphere and throughout the world.\n  Today I am introducing four pieces of legislation intended to get us \nstarted. The first bill, the Fast-Track Trade Negotiating Authority \nAct, would provide the President with much-needed fast track authority, \nso that he may expand trade by entering into trade agreements with our \npartners around the world. Fast track is key to unleashing the wealth-\ngenerating machine of trade still further, to all corners of the world. \nIt is long past time to reauthorize this critical provision.\n  The second measure, the Americas Free Trade Act, would lead to the \nextension of free trade from Alaska to Cape Horn in our own hemisphere. \nIt would provide the President with fast track authority for \nimplementation of free trade agreements with any or all of the 33 other \nnations of the Western Hemisphere, for the benefit of its more than 800 \nmillion residents. According to the 1994 agreement among the leaders of \nthe Western Hemisphere, the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas should \nbe concluded by 2005. Having fast track authority in hand will give our \nPresident the ability to move the FTAA talks forward dramatically and \nsuccessfully.\n  Both the third bill, the Chile NAFTA Accession Act, and the fourth \nbill, the United Kingdom NAFTA Accession Act, seek to build bridges \nwith key trading partners in order to spur larger trade liberalization \nefforts. Chile is a critical trading partner in South America who has \nbeen knocking at the NAFTA door for some time. The United Kingdom is a \nkey partner in Western Europe who by joining NAFTA can help keep Europe \nfrom erecting protectionist walls against the rest of the world. \nAgreements with these two important nations can keep trade \nliberalization moving forward.\n\n  Mr. President, my commitment to this cause is longstanding. In 1986 I \nintroduced legislation to begin negotiations for a free trade agreement \nwith Mexico. In 1987, I introduced a bill that laid out a framework for \nnegotiating a North American free trade area--a bill which later served \nas the basis for an amendment I offered to the 1988 trade bill and \nadopted by the Senate that authorized the negotiation of the NAFTA. In \n1989, I once again introduced trade legislation and called for a free \nagreement encompassing the entire Western Hemisphere. I have introduced \nsimilar legislation in each Congress since then. It is my hope that the \nbills I am introducing today will serve as the basis for successful \ntrade legislation in the 107th Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Fast Track Trade \nNegotiating Authority Act, the Americas Free Trade Act, the Chile NAFTA \nAccession Act, and the United Kingdom NAFTA Accession Act, together \nwith a summary of these bills, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The countries of the Western Hemisphere have enjoyed \n     more success in the twentieth century in the peaceful conduct \n     of their relations among themselves than have the countries \n     in the rest of the world.\n       (2) The economic prosperity of the United States and its \n     trading partners in the Western Hemisphere is increased by \n     the reduction of trade barriers.\n       (3) Trade protection endangers economic prosperity in the \n     United States and throughout the Western Hemisphere and \n     undermines civil liberty and constitutionally limited \n     government.\n       (4) The successful establishment of a North American Free \n     Trade Area sets the pattern for the reduction of trade \n     barriers throughout the Western Hemisphere, enhancing \n     prosperity in place of the cycle of increasing trade barriers \n     and deepening poverty that results from a resort to \n     protectionism and trade retaliation.\n       (5) The reduction of government interference in the foreign \n     and domestic sectors of a nation's economy and the \n     concomitant promotion of economic opportunity and freedoms \n     promote civil liberty and constitutionally limited \n     government.\n       (6) Countries that observe a consistent policy of free \n     trade, the promotion of free enterprise and other economic \n     freedoms (including effective protection of private property \n     rights), and the removal of barriers to foreign direct \n     investment, in the context of constitutionally limited \n     government and minimal interference in the economy, will \n     follow the surest and most effective prescription to \n     alleviate poverty and provide for economic, social, and \n     political development.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce my first bill \nof the 107th Congress, the ``Utah Public Lands Artifact Preservation \nAct of 2001.''\n  Utah's public lands are a treasure trove of the natural and cultural \nhistory of the west. Over a century of scientific exploration and \nresearch of these public lands have unearthed Native American \nartifacts, fossilized remains of prehistoric life-forms, and other \nobjects of botanical and geological significance. Fortunately, these \nunique and remarkable finds now comprise a substantial portion of the \ncollection of the University of Utah Museum of Natural History.\n  The University of Utah Museum of Natural History collection contains \nmore than one million objects and artifacts from the field of \narchaeology, botany, geology, paleontology, and zoology. It is one of \nthe largest and most comprehensive collections in the region and is \ninternationally significant. Over 75 percent of the collection was \nrecovered from lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau \nof Reclamation, National Park Service, United States Fish and Wildlife \nService, and United States Forest Service.\n  Currently the home of the Museum of Natural History is the library \nwhere I studied while I was a student at the University of Utah. \nAlthough I have fond memories of the time I spent in the library, it is \nan unfit home for the museum. As we all know, the needs of a library \nand the needs of a museum are very different. The current facility is \nnot large enough to accommodate the museum's annual level of \nvisitation. Additionally, space to display the collection is severely \nlimited and the facilities to store the collection are unsuitable for a \nmuseum, Clearly, the Museum of Natural History needs an appropriate \nstructure to exhibit, research, and house its collection.\n  This legislation will result in an enhanced museum experience that \nwill be more meaningful, educational, and accessible to the public and \nscientific researchers. Furthermore, the collection will no longer be \njeopardized by inadequate facilities. The new museum will contain \nproper facilities for storage and research.\n  I believe the strength of this project lies in the fact that its \nsuccess will rely upon a public-private partnership among the state of \nUtah, the federal government, and hundreds of private individuals and \nfoundations. Already, unprecedented support has been given by the Emma \nEccles Jones Foundation for this project. I expect there will be many \ngenerous offers of support in the near future to make this project a \nsuccess.\n  I believe that this legislation is an exciting opportunity to \nshowcase the many treasures that Utah's public lands contain. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and the new \nadministration to pass this legislation this session.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 141. A bill to provide for enhanced safety, public awareness, and \nenvironmental protection in pipeline transportation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    pipeline safety improvement act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pipeline Safety \nImprovement Act of 2001. I am very pleased to be joined in sponsoring \nthis important transportation safety legislation by Senators Murray, \nHollings, Hutchison, Bingaman, Domenici, and Breaux. This bill, which \nis identical to the measure approved unanimously by the Senate last \nyear but which failed to be sent to the President, is being introduced \ntoday to demonstrate our strong, continued commitment to improving \npipeline transportation safety. We urge our colleagues to join us in \nour efforts to help remedy identified safety problems and improve \npipeline safety for all Americans.\n  As most of my colleagues well know, the Senate worked long and hard \nduring the last Congress to produce comprehensive pipeline safety \nlegislation. As a result of our bipartisan efforts, we unanimously \napproved pipeline safety improvement legislation last September. \nUnfortunately, the House failed to approve a pipeline safety measure \nand the Congress thus failed in its efforts to improve pipeline safety. \nAs a result, the unacceptable status quo under which at least 16 \nfatalities have occurred remains the law of the land. I am hopeful that \nthis new Congress will act quickly to take the overdue action necessary \nto improve pipeline safety before any more lives are lost.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear from the outset that I continue to \nsupport passage of the strongest pipeline safety bill possible. As \nsuch, I will be very eager to receive safety improvement \nrecommendations from the new Administration. Indeed, I look forward to \nworking with the Administration, the House of Representatives, safety \nadvocates, industry and other concerned citizens to advance a sound \nlegislative proposal that can be signed into law.\n  Although pipeline safety legislation was not enacted last year as we \nhad hoped, the President did issue an executive order requiring a \nnumber of safety actions by pipeline operators. Further, the Department \nof Transportation (DOT) also issued a number of regulations during the \npast few months. The Administration's actions will be carefully \nconsidered by the Commerce Committee and we will work to ensure our \nlegislation reflects the Administration's actions, as appropriate, as \nwe advance the legislation to the full Senate.\n  The following highlights some of the major provisions of the \nlegislation we are reintroducing today:\n  The bill would require the implementation of pipeline safety \nrecommendations issued last March by the Department of Transportation \nInspector General to the Research and Special Programs Administration \n(RSPA). The legislation would statutorily require the Secretary of \nTransportation, the RSPA Administrator and the Director of the Office \nof Pipeline Safety to respond to NTSB pipeline safety recommendations \nwithin 90 days of receipt. The bill would require pipeline operators to \nsubmit to the Secretary of Transportation a plan designed to improve \nthe qualifications for pipeline personnel. At a minimum, the \nqualification plan would have to demonstrate that pipeline employees \nhave the necessary knowledge to safely and properly perform their \nassigned duties and would require testing and periodic reexamination of \nthe employees' qualifications.\n\n  The legislation would require DOT to issue regulations mandating \npipeline operators to periodically determine the adequacy of their \npipelines to safely operate and to implement integrity management \nprograms to reduce those identified risks. The regulations would, at a \nminimum, require operators to: base their integrity management plans on \nrisk assessments that they conduct; periodically assess the integrity \nof their pipelines; and, take steps to prevent and mitigate unintended \nreleases, such as improving leak detection capabilities or installing \nrestrictive flow devices.\n\n[[Page S415]]\n\n  The bill also would require pipeline operators to carry out a \ncontinuing public education program that would include activities to \nadvise municipalities, school districts, businesses, and residents of \npipeline facility locations on a variety of pipeline safety-related \nmatters. It would also direct pipeline operators to initiate and \nmaintain communication with State emergency response commissions and \nlocal emergency planning committees and to share with these entities \ninformation critical to addressing pipeline safety issues, including \ninformation on the types of product transported and efforts by the \noperator to mitigate safety risks.\n  The legislation directs the Secretary to develop and implement a \ncomprehensive plan for the collection and use of pipeline data in a \nmanner that would enable incident trend analysis and evaluations of \noperator performance. Operators would be required to report incident \nreleases greater than five gallons, compared to the current reporting \nrequirement of 42 gallons. In addition, the Secretary would be directed \nto establish a national depository of data to be administered by the \nBureau of Transportation Statistics in cooperation with RSPA.\n  Given the critical importance of technology applications in promoting \ntransportation safety across all modes of transportation, the \nlegislation directs the Secretary to include as part of the \nDepartment's research and development (R) efforts a focus on \ntechnologies to improve pipelines safety, such as through internal \ninspection devices and leak detection. Further, the legislation \nincludes provisions advanced last year by Senator Bingaman, myself, and \nothers, to provide for a collaborative R effort directed by the \nDepartment of Transportation with the assistance of the Department of \nEnergy and the National Academy of Sciences.\n  The bill provides for a three year authorization in funding for \nfederal pipeline safety activities and the pipeline state grant \nprogram. The authorization levels in particular will be carefully \nreviewed as the bill proceeds through the legislation process. We must \nensure sufficient funding is authorized to carry out critical pipeline \nsafety activities and to advance research and development efforts.\n  The legislation requires operators, in the event of an accident, to \nmake available to the DOT or NTSB all records and information \npertaining to the accident and to assist in the investigation to the \nextent reasonable. It also includes provisions to ensure that if an \naccident occurs, a review is carried out to ensure the operator's \nemployees can safely perform their duties.\n  Finally, to ensure pipeline employees are afforded the same whistle-\nblower protections as are provided to employees in other modes of \ntransportation, the legislation includes protections for pipeline \npersonnel, similar to those protections provided to aviation-related \nemployees last year in the Wendell H. Ford Aviation and Investment \nReform Act for the 21st Century, P.L. 106-181.\n  Again Mr. President, I will be interested in receiving additional \nrecommendations to further strengthen federal pipeline safety policy. I \nhope this Congress can act expeditiously to approve comprehensive \npipeline safety legislation. We simply cannot afford another missed \nopportunity to address identified pipeline safety shortcomings.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 141\n\n  (Data not available at time of printing, the bill will print in a \nsubsequent issue of the Record.)\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. \n        Daschle)\n  S. 142.

A bill to amend the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities \nExchange Act of 1934, to reduce securities fees in excess of those \nrequires to fund the operations of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, to adjust compensation provisions for employees of the \nCommission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n               competitive market supervision act of 2001\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Schumer, \ntogether with Senators Hagel, Enzi, Bennett, Bunning, Bond, Torricelli, \nAllard, and Crapo in introducing the Competitive Market Supervision Act \nof 2001. This important legislation will reduce the excess fees \ncollected by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At the same \ntime, the legislation will guarantee that the SEC is fully funded by \nfee collections, allowing fee adjustments to meet appropriated amounts. \nThis legislation, moreover, will level unaffected the funds available \nfor appropriations purposes by walling off the offsetting fee \ncollections that are expected under current law.\n  Under current budget estimates, this legislation will result in a \nreduction of fee collections by more than $1 billion in the first year \nand by about $8 billion over the next 5 years.\n  A second key element of the bill is that it will extend to the SEC \nthe same salary authority for its employees as is exercised by the \nFederal banking agencies.\n  A similar bill, S. 2107, which included the identical provisions of \nthe bill I am introducing today, was approved by the Senate Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs Committee last year.\n\n\n                   reduction of securities user fees\n\n  The original objective of the user fees collected by the Commission \nwas to provide a funding source for the agency's operations. However, \nincreases in stock market volume and valuation have spawned revenues \nthat far surpass what is needed to operate the agency. In fiscal year \n2000, to fund a budget of $375 million, the SEC collected $2.27 \nbillion. According to the most recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \nprojections, the savings to\n\n[[Page S416]]\n\ninvestors and issuers from this legislation will be approximately $8 \nbillion over 5 years, and nearly $14 billion over ten years, without \nreducing funds available for the SEC or for necessary appropriations.\n  Rather than user fees, these revenues have become taxes on savings \nand investment, taxes that lower the returns of every investor who buys \nstock, owns a mutual fund, or plans to use Individual Retirement \nAccounts, 401(k) plans, or pensions to fund retirement. Furthermore, \nexcess Section 6(b) fees are particularly harmful since these taxes are \nimposed at the beginning of the investment cycle, subtracting from the \neconomy monies that could be leveraged into several times their value \nto finance efforts to create jobs, develop new products, and build \nAmerica.\n  Section 2 of the bill amends Section 6(b) of the Securities Act of \n1933 to lower registration fee rates. In addition, this section \neliminates the general revenue portion of the registration fee. The \noffsetting collection rate is set at $67 per $1 million of securities \nregistered for FY 2002-06, and at $33 per $1 million for FY 2007 and \nthereafter. Section 3 reduces merger and tender fee rates in Section \n13(e)(3) and Section 14(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 from \none fiftieth percent under current law to $67 per $1 million of \nsecurities involved for the period FY 2002-06, and reduces rates \nfurther to $33 per $1 million for FY 2007 and thereafter, and all fees \nare also reclassified from general revenues to offsetting collections. \nIt is important to harmonize the fee registration, and merger and \ntender fee rates so as to provide no distortions or inject any \nunintended incentives into the managerial decision as to when a merger \nshould occur.\n\n  Under Section 4, all transactions included in Section 31 of the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 are consolidated, with the same fee \nrate applied to each as an offsetting collection. Transaction fees in \nany particular fiscal year will be set in appropriations acts at a rate \nestimated to collect the target dollar amount set in Section 4 for that \nyear. The target dollar amount is calculated to approximate the amount \nof transaction fees required so that, when combined with anticipated \nregistration and merger/tender fees, total offsetting collections will \napproximately equal the offsetting collections anticipated under \ncurrent law. If the most recent projections prove accurate, this will \nreduce transaction fee rates by as much as two-thirds.\n  I would note that the fee targets established under Section 4 are \nbased upon the most recent budget estimates available. It is my \nintention to adjust those targets prior to Committee action on the bill \nas new budget estimates become available in the next few weeks.\n\n\n                authority of sec to adjust to fee rates\n\n  Given the difficulty in predicting fee revenues, it is also important \nto provide a framework that ensures full funding for the SEC. \nTherefore, Section 5 of this legislation provides the Commission with \nthe authority to adjust fee rates to ensure that the agency is fully \nfunded in the event that reductions in market valuations or volume \nproduce revenues below the legislated targets. In addition, Section 5 \nrequires the agency to lower fee rates when fees are projected to bring \nin revenues that are in excess of the cap on fee collections laid out \nin the bill. To provide a safeguard against misuse of the authority \ngranted in Section 5, the legislation requires the agency to report to \nCongress before it exercises any authority to adjust fees.\n\n\n                         sec pay comparability\n\n  Section 6 of the bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to \nextend to the SEC the same authority provided to the federal bank \nregulators to adjust base rates of compensation for all of its \nemployees. Under existing law, the Commission may do this only for its \neconomists. The provisions allow parity among the Commission and \nFederal banking agency compensation programs. This change is \nparticularly timely since under the terms of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley \nAct, in many institutions, examiners from the SEC will be working along \nside examiners from the federal banking regulators. Without this pay \ncomparability, we could witness a drain of talent from the SEC toward \nthe other examiners. An amendment also is made to the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Act to bring the SEC within the consultation and information-\nsharing requirements of other agencies mentioned at 12 U.S.C. 1833b \nwith respect to rates of employee compensation. A further technical \namendment to section 1833b deletes references to entities that have \nbeen abolished.\n  The legislation assures that reductions, if any, in the base pay of a \nCommission employee represented by a labor organization with exclusive \nrecognition in accordance with Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the United \nStates Code, result from negotiations between such organization and \nCommission management, rather than by reason of the enactment of this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to early and favorable consideration of \nthe Competitive Market Supervision Act of 2001. I ask that a summary of \nthe provisions of the bill and bill text be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 143\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The general \n     revenue portion of the registration fee is eliminated. The \n     offsetting collection rate is set at $67 per $1 million of \n     securities registered for FY 2002-2006, and at $33 per $1 \n     million for FY 2007 and thereafter.\n     Section 3. Reduction in merger and tender fees; \n         reclassification as offsetting collections\n       Section 3 reduces merger and tender fee rates in Section \n     13(e)(3) and Section 14(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of \n     1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(e)(3) and 78n(g), respectively) from one \n     fiftieth percent under current law, to $67 per $1 million of \n     securities involved for the period FY 2002-2006, and reduces \n     rates further to $33 per $1 million for FY 2007 and \n     thereafter. All fees are reclassified from general revenues \n     to offsetting collections.\n     Section 4. Reduction in transaction fees; elimination of \n         general revenue component\n       Under this section, all transactions included in Section 31 \n     of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are consolidated, with \n     the same fee rate applied to each as an offsetting \n     collection. Transaction fees in any particular fiscal year \n     will be set in appropriations acts at a rate estimated to \n     collect the target dollar amount set for that year. The \n     target dollar amount is calculated to appropriate the amount, \n     when combined with anticipated registration and merger/tender \n     fees, that will approximately equal the offsetting \n     collections anticipated to be produced under current law.\n     Section 5. Adjustment to fee rates\n       The Commission is given authority to increase or decrease \n     transaction fee rates after the first half of the fiscal year \n     if projections show that either the cap or floor for total \n     fee collections will be breached. To provide a safeguard \n     against misuse of the authority granted in Section 5, the \n     legislation requires the agency to report to Congress before \n     it exercises any authority to adjust fees.\n     Section 6. Comparability provisions\n       Section 6(a) amends Section 4(b) of the Securities Exchange \n     Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78d(b)) to authorize, but not require, \n     the SEC to compensate its employees according to a scale \n     outside the Federal Government's General Schedule (GS) rates. \n     Pursuant to this authority, the SEC may provide additional \n     compensation and benefits to its employees on the same \n     comparable basis as do the agencies referred to under Section \n     1206(a) of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and \n     Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 1833b). Such agencies \n     include the Federal banking agencies, the National Credit \n     Union Administration, the Federal Housing Finance Board, and \n     the Farm Credit Administration.\n\n[[Page S419]]\n\n     The amendment ensures that reductions, if any, in base pay \n     for an employee of the SEC represented by a labor \n     organization with exclusive recognition in accordance with \n     Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the United States Code, result from \n     negotiations between such organizations and SEC management, \n     as opposed to by reason of the enactment of this amendment.\n       In establishing and adjusting schedules of compensation and \n     benefits for its employees, Section 6(b) requires the SEC to \n     inform the heads of the agencies mentioned above and must \n     seek to maintain comparability with such agencies regarding \n     compensation and benefits. A technical change is made to \n     strike from Section 1206(a) the reference to the Thrift \n     Depositor Protection Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust \n     Corporation, which was abolished on December 31, 1995. \n     Section 6(c) provides certain conforming amendments to Title \n     5 of the United States Code to reflect changes made under \n     subsection (a).\n     Section 7. Effective date\n       In general, the effective date is October 1, 2001. However, \n     certain fee reductions will not become effective until \n     October 1, 2002.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S.J. Res. 1. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States relating to voluntary school prayer; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the voluntary \nschool prayer constitutional amendment. This bill is identical to S.J. \nRes. 73, which I introduced in the 98th Congress at the request of \nthen-President Reagan and have reintroduced every Congress since.\n  This proposal has received strong support from both sides of the \naisle and is of vital importance to our Nation. It would restore the \nright to pray voluntarily in public schools--a right which was freely \nexercised under our Constitution until the 1960's, when the Supreme \nCourt ruled to the contrary.\n  Also, in 1985, the Supreme Court ruled an Alabama statute \nunconstitutional which authorized teachers in public schools to provide \n``a period of silence . . . for meditation or voluntary prayer'' at the \nbeginning of each day. As I stated when that opinion was issued and \nrepeat again: the Supreme Court has too broadly interpreted the \nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment and, in doing so, has \nincorrectly infringed on the rights of those children--and their \nparents--who wish to observe a moment of silence for religious or other \npurposes.\n  Until the Supreme Court ruled in the Engel and Abington School \nDistrict decisions, the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment was \ngenerally understood to prohibit the Federal Government from officially \napproving, or holding in special favor, any particular religious faith \nor denomination. In crafting that clause, our Founding Fathers sought \nto prevent what had originally caused many colonial Americans to \nemigrate to this country--an official, State religion. At the same \ntime, they sought, through the Free Exercise Clause, to guarantee to \nall Americans the freedom to worship God without government \ninterference or restraint. In their wisdom, they recognized that true \nreligious liberty precludes the government from both forcing and \npreventing worship.\n  As Supreme Court Justice William Douglas once stated: ``We are a \nreligious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.'' \nNearly every President since George Washington has proclaimed a day of \npublic prayer. Moreover, we, as a Nation, continue to recognize the \nDeity in our Pledge of Allegiance by affirming that we are a Nation \n``under God.'' Our currency is inscribed with the motto, ``In God We \nTrust''. In this Body, we open the Senate and begin our workday with \nthe comfort and stimulus of voluntary group prayers. I would note that \nthis practice has been upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court.\n  It is unreasonable that the opportunity for the same beneficial \nexperience is denied to the boys and girls who attend public schools. \nThis situation simply does not comport with the intentions of the \nframers of the Constitution and is, in fact, antithetical to the rights \nof our youngest citizens to freely exercise their respective religions. \nIt should be changed, without further delay.\n  The Congress should swiftly pass this resolution and send it to the \nStates for ratification. This amendment to the Constitution would \nclarify that it does not prohibit vocal, voluntary prayer in the public \nschool and other public institutions. It emphatically states that no \nperson may be required to participate in any prayer. The government \nwould be precluded from drafting school prayers. This well-crafted \namendment enjoys the support of an overwhelming number of Americans.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support prompt consideration and \napproval of this legislation during this Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 1\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of \n     each House concurring therein), That the following article is \n     proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as \n     part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of \n     three-fourths of the several States within seven years after \n     the date of its submission by the Congress:\n\n                              ``Article --\n\n       ``Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to \n     prohibit individual or group prayer in public schools or \n     other public institutions.

Res. 11\n\n       Whereas the maritime policy of the United States expressly \n     provides that the United States shall have a merchant marine \n     sufficient to carry a substantial portion of the \n     international waterborne commerce of the United States;\n       Whereas the maritime policy of the United States expressly \n     provides that the United States shall have a merchant marine \n     sufficient to serve as a fourth arm of defense in time of war \n     and national emergency;\n       Whereas the Federal Government has expressly recognized the \n     vital role of the United States merchant marine during \n     Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm;\n       Whereas cargo reservation programs of Federal agencies are \n     intended to support the privately owned and operated United \n     States-flag merchant marine by requiring a certain percentage \n     of government-impelled cargo to be carried on United States-\n     flag vessels;\n       Whereas when Congress enacted the cargo reservation laws, \n     Congress contemplated that Federal agencies would incur \n     higher program costs to use the United States-flag vessels \n     required under those laws;\n       Whereas section 2631 of title 10, United States Code, \n     requires that all United States military cargo be carried on \n     United States-flag vessels;\n       Whereas Federal law requires that cargo purchased with loan \n     funds and guarantees from the Export-Import Bank of the \n     United States established under section 2 of the Export-\n     Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635), be carried on United \n     States-flag vessels;\n       Whereas section 901(b) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (46 \n     U.S.C. App. 1241(b)), requires that at least 50 percent of \n     the gross tonnage of ocean-borne cargo generated directly or \n     indirectly by the Federal Government be carried on United \n     States-flag vessels, and section 901b of that Act (46 U.S.C. \n     App. 1241f) requires that, in the case of such cargoes of \n     certain agricultural commodities that are the subject of an \n     export activity of the Commodity Credit Corporation or the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, an additional 25 percent of the \n     gross tonnage be carried on United States-flag vessels;\n       Whereas cargo reservation programs are very important for \n     the shipowners of the United States, which require \n     compensation for maintaining a United States-flag fleet;\n       Whereas the United States-flag vessels that carry reserved \n     cargo provide high-quality jobs for seafarers of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, according to the most recent statistics from the \n     Maritime Administration, in 1997, cargo reservation programs \n     generated $900,000,000 in revenue to the United States-flag \n     fleet and accounted for one-third of all revenue from United \n     States-flag foreign trade cargo;\n       Whereas the Maritime Administration has indicated that the \n     total volume of cargoes moving under the programs subject to \n     the cargo reservation laws is declining and will continue to \n     decline;\n       Whereas, in 1970, Congress found that the degree of \n     compliance by Federal agencies with the requirements of the \n     cargo reservation laws was chaotic and uneven, and that it \n     varied from agency to agency;\n\n[[Page S420]]\n\n       Whereas, to ensure maximum compliance by all agencies with \n     Federal cargo reservation laws, Congress enacted the Merchant \n     Marine Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1018), amending the Merchant \n     Marine Act, 1936, to centralize monitoring and compliance \n     authority for all cargo reservation programs in the Maritime \n     Administration;\n       Whereas, notwithstanding section 901(b) of the Merchant \n     Marine Act, 1936 (46 U.S.C.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nshare with the Senate my thoughts on the life of a friend and former \nmember of this body, Senator Alan Cranston.\n  Alan passed away on December 31, 2000 at 86 at home in California. It \nwas a quiet end for a man who throughout his career raised his voice \nfor so many. Alan enjoyed a long life and was blessed with a keen mind, \na strong spirit and simple common sense. In return for these gifts he \nworked to his last days to make this world a more peaceful and humane \nplace. I will miss him and his example very much.\n  Alan was first elected to the Senate in 1968. He served the people of \nCalifornia in this Chamber for four terms, eventually retiring in 1993. \nIt was my honor to have been elected to the seat he vacated.\n  Prior to his Senate service he was Controller for the State of \nCalifornia. He served his country in World War II, first in the Office \nof War Information and then in the U.S. Army. After graduating from \nStanford University and before the onset of the war, Alan was an \noverseas correspondent for the International News Service covering such \nplaces as England, Germany, Italy and Ethiopia.\n  While a correspondent he saw an English language version of Mein \nKampf, sanitized to hide the truth from Americans. He published his own \nversion highlighting the ``worst of Hitler'' and was sued by Hitler's \npublisher. While he lost the suit, a half a million copies had already \nbeen distributed helping to educate many about the true nature of \nNazism and Hitler.\n  As United States Senator he stood out as a tireless and effective \nadvocate for his constituents. No matter how he grew in stature and \ninfluence within this institution, he never forgot those who sent him \nto Washington and why. Alan cared deeply for people. He pursued \npolicies that reflected his unwavering belief in the fundamental \ndignity and worth of others.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Alan played an \ninvaluable role in America's efforts to assist our service men and \nwomen and their families. In addition, he was a national leader on the \nenvironment, civil rights, workers' rights, education and so much more. \nA consensus builder, he achieved success through a firm understanding \nof the issues and a finely developed sense of not only what was needed, \nbut what was possible.\n  Alan left his mark on many issues, but his true passion was world \npeace. As a witness to the horror and devastation of World War II, he \ncommitted himself to creating a world where conflicts between nations \ncould be resolved without bloodshed. He was an outspoken opponent of \nthe war in Vietnam and made the abolition of nuclear weapons a central \npart of his agenda in the Senate. Upon his retirement, he devoted \nhimself to the latter cause almost exclusively.\n  Encouraged by the end of the Cold War, after leaving the Senate he \nbecame chairman of the Gorbachev Foundation, which later changed its \nname to the State of the World Forum. Based in San Francisco, the Forum \nhas developed into a widely respected organization for the discussion \nof global issues. In recent years, the Forum has hosted multi-day \ngatherings attended by world leaders. This year's gathering occurred in \nNew York and coincided with the U.N.'s Millennial Summit. As an \nauthority on nonproliferation, Alan Cranston prepared the program on \nthe subject for participants who included former heads of state, and \nsome of the most influential minds in foreign affairs, business, the \narts and the media.\n\n  Alan also formed the Global Security Institute. There he and others \nconceived of Project Abolition, the Responsible Security Appeal. The \npurpose of this coalition is to rally people, politicians and \ngovernments to support policies that lead to a world safe from the \nnuclear threat. I am sure Alan would be pleased that this effort will \ncontinue even without him.\n  Recently, CNN founded Ted Turner and former Senator Sam Nunn \nannounced that they were forming a foundation with an annual budget of \n$50 million dedicated to the elimination of weapons of mass \ndestruction. This is great news, and further evidence that Alan's \nmessage of peace continues to resonate. In many ways, this foundation \nis a tribute to him and his legacy.\n  Senator Alan Cranston was a leader and citizen that California, the \nUnited States and the world could be proud of. Although we are all a \nlittle poorer today at his passing, in the final tally we are all much \nricher for having known him and benefited from this time among us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/22/senate-section/article/S420-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S420-S421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 13--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n NEED FOR CONGRESS TO ENACT A NEW FARM BILL DURING THE 1ST SESSION OF \n                           THE 107TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nBaucus, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \nDorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Conrad, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Kennedy, \nand Ms. Stabenow submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry:\n\n[[Page S421]]\n\n                               S. Res. 13\n\n       Whereas in contrast to the economic prosperity enjoyed by \n     Americans over the past several years, many agriculture-\n     dependent rural economies have continued to experience \n     serious economic hardship;\n       Whereas independently owned and operated farms and ranches \n     that are integral to the economic and social stability of \n     rural America, but that are relatively less able to withstand \n     economic shock, have suffered disproportionately during this \n     period of ongoing economic distress;\n       Whereas the contract payments authorized by the \n     Agricultural Market Transition Act (7 U.S.C. 7201 et seq.) \n     increasingly are considered by producers to be inequitable \n     because--\n       (1) the contract payments are not based on current \n     production, but are instead based on 85 percent of program \n     yields established in 1986 and frozen in 1990;\n       (2) the contract payments are provided to owners and \n     producers that may no longer be producing the crop on which \n     the contract payments are calculated;\n       (3) the contract payments are not available to producers of \n     nonprogram crops, including soybeans and other oilseeds, \n     resulting in further inequities and arbitrariness in making \n     emergency farm payments;\n       (4) the contract payments are not available to owners and \n     producers that did not enter into production flexibility \n     contracts under the Agricultural Market Transition Act; and\n       (5) the contract payments are made for crops regardless of \n     whether the crops are experiencing low prices;\n       Whereas despite being promoted as a means of limiting farm \n     program spending, current farm policy necessitated record \n     levels of program spending and emergency assistance packages;\n       Whereas the previous record of $26,000,000,000 in direct \n     payments through the Commodity Credit Corporation for fiscal \n     year 1986 during the heart of the farm crisis in the 1980's \n     was eclipsed by direct payments made for fiscal year 2000 by \n     nearly $6,300,000,000;\n       Whereas even at these high levels of farm program and \n     emergency spending, the farm economy and the financial \n     condition of farm and ranch families and rural communities \n     continues to decline;\n       Whereas agricultural producers are extremely frustrated and \n     dissatisfied with the inconsistent criteria for receipt of \n     disaster payments, the unpredictability of the payments, and \n     the inequity of the payments across producers, regions, and \n     agricultural commodities; and\n       Whereas over the past 3 years, Congress has waited until \n     well into the legislative year before considering and \n     responding to the need for disaster payments and then has \n     justified the use of unnecessarily simplistic and fiscally \n     wasteful payment formulas by claiming that there was \n     inadequate time to devise superior alternatives: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That Congress should--\n       (1) enact a new farm bill during the 1st session of the \n     107th Congress;\n       (2) include in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2002 \n     sufficient funds to provide an adequate farm income safety \n     net and eliminate the need for off-budget, emergency \n     spending;\n       (3) ensure that all farm-related payments are allocated \n     fairly and reasonably and in relation to need; and\n       (4) provide such additional sums as are necessary to fund \n     other farm bill priorities, such as priorities involving \n     rural development and telecommunication, conservation, \n     research, nutrition, and food safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/22/senate-section/article/S421-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

In becoming the \n     43rd President of the United States, George W. Bush will \n     assume the sacred trust as guardian of our Constitution. Dick \n     Cheney will be sworn in as our new Vice President. Witnessed \n     by the Congress, Supreme Court, Governors, and Presidents \n     past, the current President will stand by as the new \n     President peacefully takes office. This is a triumph of our \n     democratic Republic, a ceremony befitting a great nation.\n       In his father's stead, the Rev. Franklin Graham is with us \n     today to lead the Nation in prayer. Please stand for the \n     invocation.\n       Reverend Graham.\n       Reverend GRAHAM. Let us pray:\n       Blessed are You, O Lord our God. Yours, O God, is the \n     greatness and the power and the glory and the majesty and the \n     splendor, for everything in heaven and Earth is Yours. Yours, \n     O Lord, is the kingdom. You are exalted as head over all. \n     Wealth and honor come from You. You are the ruler of all \n     things. In Your hands are strength and power to exalt and to \n     give strength to all.\n       As President Lincoln once said, we have been the recipients \n     of the choicest bounties of heaven. We have been preserved \n     these many years in peace and prosperity. We have grown in \n     numbers, wealth, and power, as no other nation has ever \n     grown, but we have forgotten God. It behooves us then to \n     humble ourselves before the offended powers, to confess our \n     national sins, and to pray for clemency and forgiveness.\n       O Lord, as we come together on this historic and solemn \n     occasion to inaugurate once again a President and Vice \n     President, teach us afresh that power, wisdom, and salvation \n     come only from Your hand.\n       We pray, O Lord, for President-elect George W. Bush and \n     Vice President-elect Richard B. Cheney to whom You have \n     entrusted leadership of this Nation at this moment in \n     history. We pray that You will help them bring our country \n     together so that we\n\n[[Page S422]]\n\n     may rise above partisan politics and seek the larger vision \n     of Your will for our Nation. Use them to bring reconciliation \n     between the races, healing to political wounds, that we may \n     truly become one nation under God.\n       Give our new President, and all who advise him, calmness in \n     the face of storms, encouragement in the face of frustration, \n     and humility in the face of success. Give them the wisdom to \n     know and to do what is right and the courage to say no to all \n     that is contrary to Your statutes and holy law.\n       Lord, we pray for their families, and especially their \n     wives, Laura Bush and Lynne Cheney, that they may sense Your \n     presence and know Your love.\n       Today we entrust to You President and Senator Clinton and \n     Vice President and Mrs. Gore. Lead them as they \n     journey through new doors of opportunity to serve others.\n       Now, O Lord, we dedicate this Presidential inaugural \n     ceremony to You. May this be the beginning of a new dawn for \n     America as we humble ourselves before You and acknowledge You \n     alone as our Lord, our Saviour, and our Redeemer.\n       We pray this in the name of the Father and of the Son, the \n     Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n       Mr. McCONNELL. Thank you, Reverend Graham.\n       It is my distinct pleasure to introduce the Dupont Manual \n     Choir of Louisville, KY.\n       (Performance by the Dupont Manual Choir of Louisville, KY.)\n       Mr. McCONNELL. I now call on Senator Christopher J. Dodd of \n     Connecticut to introduce the Chief Justice of the United \n     States.\n       Mr. DODD. Thank you, Senator McConnell.\n       President and Senator Clinton, Vice President and Mrs. \n     Gore, President-elect and Mrs. Bush, and fellow citizens, the \n     Vice President-elect will now take the oath of office. His \n     wife, Lynne, and their daughters, Elizabeth Cheney Perry and \n     Mary Cheney, will hold the family Bible. I have the honor and \n     privilege to now present the Chief Justice of the United \n     States Supreme Court, the Hon. William Hobbs Rehnquist, to \n     administer the oath of office to the Vice President-elect, \n     Richard Bruce Cheney.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mr. Chief Justice REHNQUIST. Mr. Cheney, are you ready to \n     take the oath? -\n       Vice President-elect CHENEY. I am.\n       Mr. Chief Justice REHNQUIST. Please raise your right hand \n     and repeat after me.\n       The Chief Justice of the United States, William Hobbs \n     Rehnquist, administered to the Vice President-elect the oath \n     of office prescribed by the Constitution, which he repeated, \n     as follows:\n       ``I, Richard Bruce Cheney, do solemnly swear that I will \n     support and defend the Constitution of the United States \n     against all enemies foreign and domestic; that I will bear \n     true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this \n     obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose \n     of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the \n     duties of the office of which I am about to enter. So help me \n     God.''\n       Mr. Chief Justice REHNQUIST. Congratulations.\n       (The Marine Band performed ``Hail Columbia.'')\n       (Applause.)\n       Mr. McCONNELL. Ladies and gentlemen, Staff Sergeant Alec T. \n     Maly of the United States Army Band will now perform an \n     American medley.\n       (Staff Sergeant Alec T. Maly sang a medley of American \n     music.)\n       Mr. McCONNELL. It is now my high honor to again present the \n     Chief Justice of the United States who will administer the \n     Presidential oath of office. Everyone, please stand.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mr. Chief Justice REHNQUIST. Governor Bush, are you ready \n     to take the oath?\n       President-elect BUSH. Yes, sir.\n       Mr. Chief Justice REHNQUIST. Please raise your right hand \n     and repeat after me.\n       The Chief Justice of the United States, William Hobbs \n     Rehnquist, administered to the President-elect the oath of \n     office prescribed by the Constitution, which he repeated, as \n     follows:\n       ``I, George Walker Bush, do solemnly swear that I will \n     faithfully execute the office of President of the United \n     States and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, \n     protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. So \n     help me God.''\n       Mr. Chief Justice REHNQUIST. Congratulations.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mr. McCONNELL. Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the \n     United States, George W. Bush.\n       (Applause.)\n       (Herald Trumpets play ``Ruffles and Flourishes'' and ``Hail \n     to the Chief,'' and 21-gun salute.)\n       President BUSH. Thank you all.\n       Chief Justice Rehnquist, President Carter, President Bush--\n     --\n       (Laughter, applause.)\n       President Clinton, distinguished guests, and my fellow \n     citizens:\n       This peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet \n     common in our country. With a simple oath, we affirm old \n     traditions and make new beginnings.\n       As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to \n     our Nation. -\n       (Applause.)\n       And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted \n     with spirit and ended with grace.\n       (Applause.)\n       I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of \n     America's leaders have come before me and so many will \n     follow.\n       We have a place, all of us, in a long story; a story we \n     continue, but whose end we will not see. It is the story of a \n     new world that became a friend and liberator of the old, \n     the story of a slave-holding society that became a servant \n     of freedom, the story of a power that went into the world \n     to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer. \n     It is the American story; a story of flawed and fallible \n     people, united across the generations by grand and \n     enduring ideals.\n       The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American \n     promise: that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a \n     chance, that no insignificant person was ever born.\n       Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and \n     in our laws. And though our Nation has sometimes halted, and \n     sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.\n       Through much of the last century, America's faith in \n     freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea. Now it is a \n     seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations.\n       Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country, \n     it is the inborn hope of our humanity; an ideal we carry but \n     do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. And even after \n     nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel.\n       While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the \n     promise--even the justice--of our own country. The ambitions \n     of some Americans are limited by failing schools, and hidden \n     prejudice, and the circumstances of their birth. And \n     sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a \n     continent, but not a country.\n       We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our unity, \n     our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in \n     every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work \n     to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.\n       (Applause.)\n       I know this is within our reach, because we are guided by a \n     power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in His \n     image.\n       And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us \n     onward.\n       America has never been united by blood or birth or soil. We \n     are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift \n     us above our interests, and teach us what it means to be \n     citizens. Every child must be taught these principles. Every \n     citizen must uphold them. And every immigrant, by embracing \n     these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.\n       (Applause.)\n       Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our Nation's \n     promise through civility, courage, compassion, and character.\n       America, at its best, matches a commitment to principle \n     with a concern for civility.\n       A civil society demands from each of us good will and \n     respect, fair dealing and forgiveness.\n       Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be \n     petty because, in a time of peace, the stakes of our debates \n     appear small. But the stakes, for America, are never small. \n     If our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will \n     not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of children toward \n     knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and \n     undermine their idealism. If we permit our economy to drift \n     and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.\n       We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a \n     tactic or a sentiment. It is the determined choice of trust \n     over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, \n     if we keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.\n       America, at its best, is also courageous.\n       Our national courage has been clear in times of depression \n     and war, when defeating common dangers defined our common \n     good. Now we must choose if the example of our fathers and \n     mothers will inspire us or condemn us. We must show courage \n     in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of \n     passing them onto future generations.\n       (Applause.)\n       Together we will reclaim America's schools, before \n     ignorance and apathy claim more young lives. We will reform \n     Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from \n     struggles we have the power to prevent. And we will reduce \n     taxes, to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the \n     efforts and enterprise of working Americans.\n       (Applause.)\n       We will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness \n     invite challenge.\n       (Applause.)\n       We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new \n     century is spared new horrors.\n       The enemies of liberty and our country should make no \n     mistake, America remains engaged in the world, by history and \n     by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom. We \n     will defend our allies and our interests. We will show \n     purpose without arrogance. We will meet aggression and bad \n     faith with resolve and strength. And to all nations, we will \n     speak for the values that gave our Nation birth.\n       (Applause.)\n       America, at its best, is compassionate.\n       In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, \n     persistent poverty is unworthy of our Nation's promise. And \n     whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children \n     at risk are not at fault. Abandonment and abuse are not acts \n     of God; they are failures of love.\n       (Applause.)\n\n[[Page S423]]\n\n       And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no \n     substitute for hope and order in our souls.\n       Where there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in need \n     are not strangers, they are citizens; not problems, but \n     priorities. And all of us are diminished when any are \n     hopeless.\n       (Applause.)\n       Government has great responsibilities, for public safety \n     and public health, for civil rights and common schools. Yet \n     compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government. \n     And some needs and hurts are so deep, they will only respond \n     to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer. Church and charity, \n     synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity, and \n     they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws.\n       (Applause.)\n       Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty. But we \n     can listen to those who do. And I can pledge our Nation to a \n     goal. When we see that wounded traveler on the road to \n     Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.\n       (Applause.)\n       America, at its best, is a place where personal \n     responsibility is valued and expected.\n       Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats; \n     it is a call to conscience. And though it requires sacrifice, \n     it brings a deeper fulfillment. We find the fullness of life, \n     not only in options, but in commitments. And we find that \n     children and community are the commitments that set us free.\n       Our public interest depends on private character; on civic \n     duty and family bonds and basic fairness; on uncounted, \n     unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our \n     freedom. Sometimes in life we are called to do great things. \n     But as a saint of our times has said, every day we are called \n     to do small things with great love. The most important tasks \n     of a democracy are done by everyone.\n       I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my \n     convictions with civility; to pursue the public interest with \n     courage; to speak for greater justice and compassion; to call \n     for responsibility, and try to live it as well. In all these \n     ways, I will bring the values of our history to the care of \n     our times.\n       What you do is as important as anything government does. I \n     ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort; to defend \n     needed reforms against easy attacks; to serve your Nation, \n     beginning with your neighbor. I ask you to be citizens--\n     citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects; responsible \n     citizens building communities of service and a nation of \n     character.\n       (Applause.)\n       Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because \n     we believe in ourselves, but because we hold beliefs beyond \n     ourselves. When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no \n     government program can replace it. When this spirit is \n     present, no wrong can stand against it.\n       (Applause.)\n       After the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia \n     statesman John Page wrote to Thomas Jefferson:\n       We know the race is not to the swift nor the Battle to the \n     Strong. Do you not think an Angel rides in the Whirlwind and \n     directs this Storm?\n       Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his \n     inauguration. The years and changes accumulate, but the \n     themes of this day he would know: our Nation's grand story of \n     courage and its simple dream of dignity. We are not the \n     story's author, who fills time and eternity with His purpose. \n     Yet His purpose is achieved in our duty; and our duty is \n     fulfilled in service to one another.\n       Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew \n     that purpose today: to make our country more just and \n     generous; to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life.\n       This work continues. This story goes on. And an angel still \n     rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm.\n       God bless you all, and God bless America.\n       (Applause.)\n       Mr. McCONNELL. Please stand now as Pastor Kribyjon H. \n     Caldwell will now deliver the benediction, and afterward, \n     please remain standing for the singing of our National \n     Anthem, after which the ceremony will be concluded. I call \n     upon Senator Dodd to organize the Presidential party after \n     the ceremony has ended to depart the platform.\n       Pastor Caldwell.\n       Pastor CALDWELL. Thank you, Senator McConnell.\n       Let us pray, please:\n       Almighty God, the supply and supplier of peace, prudent \n     policy, and nonpartisanship, we bless Your holy and righteous \n     name. Thank You, O God, for blessing us with forgiveness, \n     with faith, and with favor. Forgive us for choosing pride \n     over purpose. Forgive us for choosing popularity over \n     principles. And forgive us for choosing materialism over \n     morals. Deliver us from these and all other evils, and cast \n     our sins into Your sea of forgetfulness to be remembered no \n     more. And Lord, not only do we thank You for our forgiveness, \n     we thank You for faith, faith to believe that every child can \n     learn and no child will be left behind and no youth will be \n     left out.\n       Thank You for blessing us with the faith to believe that \n     all of Your leaders can sit down and reason with one another \n     so that each American is blessed.\n       Thank You for blessing us with the faith to believe that \n     the walls of inequity can be torn down and the gaps between \n     the rich and the poor, the haves and the have-nots, the \n     uneducated and the educated, can and will be closed.\n       And, Lord, lastly, we thank You for favor. We thank You for \n     Your divine favor. Let Your favor be upon President Clinton \n     and the outgoing administration. May they go forth in \n     spiritual grace and civic greatness. And, of course, O Lord, \n     let Your divine favor be upon President George W. Bush and \n     First Lady Laura Welch Bush and their family. We decree and \n     declare that no weapon formed against them shall prosper. Let \n     Your divine favor be upon the Bush team and all Americans \n     with the rising of the Sun and the going down of the same. \n     May we grow in our willingness and ability to bless You and \n     bless one another.\n       We respectfully submit this humble prayer in the name that \n     is above all other names, Jesus the Christ. Let all who agree \n     say ``Amen.''\n       (Staff Sergeant Maly performed the National Anthem with \n     accompaniment.)\n       (Applause.)\n       The inaugural ceremonies were concluded at 12:24 p.m.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/22/senate-section/article/S423-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 73, S. 74, S. 75, S. 76, S. 78, and S. \n                                   79\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I rise to be critical of President \nClinton's recent actions dealing with the Antiquities Act in declaring \nmillions of lands national monuments. He did this without consulting \nwith the Governors, without consulting with elected officials, without \nconsulting Congress. I believe that to be almost an act of contempt of \nCongress and certainly in defiance of what is considered the \nAntiquities Act and the purpose of the Antiquities Act.\n  The Antiquities Act was written in 1906. It was established at that \ntime to protect very special historic, beautiful lands from \ndevelopment. It is a short act, and I will have it printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my speech.\n  The whole purpose of the act President Clinton has defied. It does \nnot say he is King or that he can take an unlimited amount of lands \nwithout consulting Congress or elected officials or local officials and \nsay, we declare this a national monument so you cannot touch it and we \ndon't care what you think.\n  I was amused when I noticed the Washington Post and other media said \nPresident Clinton was being active in the final days as President of \nthe United States. He was more than active when acting in a way I \nbelieve certainly exceeded the statutory language of the Antiquities \nAct. Certainly he was being more than active when he defied logic and \ndid not consult elected officials. I think he abused the Antiquities \nAct and his actions prove that it needs to be reformed.\n  When I read it, I wonder where he gets this authority. I think he \nexceeded the authority of the act. The authority of the act says:\n\n       The President of the United States is authorized, in his \n     discretion, to declare by public proclamation historic \n     landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other \n     objects of historic and scientific interest that are situated \n     upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the \n     United States to be national monuments, and may reserve as a \n     part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all \n     cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with \n     the proper care and management of the objects to be \n     protected.\n\n  And it continues.\n  The media reported that President Clinton has created more national \nmonuments than any other President going back to Theodore Roosevelt. I \nlooked back and Theodore Roosevelt didn't do as much as President \nClinton in the last month or certainly since the last election. \nTheodore Roosevelt, through his actions, did a total of 1.5 million \nacres. President Clinton did 2 million acres after the election. Why \ndid he do it after the election? Is it because there were hundreds of \nthousands of acres he did not consult with people? He didn't ask the \nelected officials. He said: This is what we will do; we will declare a \nnational acres monument. All together he has declared 5.7 million in \nnational monuments.\n  I mention the elections because obviously President Clinton used this \nact for election purposes. He did it in September of 1996 right before \nthe election, I might mention, and it dealt with the Grand Staircase-\nEscalante National Monument, 1.7 million acres, right before the \nelection in 1996. He announced it in Arizona, overlooking the Grand \nCanyon. That is interesting, but the Grand Escalante is not in Arizona; \nit is in Utah. Utah officials were outraged because they were not \nconsulted. The resources involved mineral deposits and coal, the value \nof which were billions of dollars and thousands of jobs. He did not \nconsult with anybody in Utah. There was public outrage, but nothing \nhappened. President Clinton did not declare any national monuments in \n1997, not in 1998, not in 1999.\n  Then we come to election year 2000 and President Clinton used a lot \nof declarations of national monuments in the year 2000 and particularly \nin the last couple of months. In the year 2000, all together he has \ndone a total of over 4 million acres. Since the election, over 2 \nmillion acres. In the last week, on January 17, he made eight more \ndesignations, just a few days ago, in his last week of office, of over \n1 million acres. He didn't consult with anybody.\n\n  In the House, we have a committee that deals with lands issues, and \nin the Senate we have a committee that deals with land and national \nresources, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, a bipartisan \ncommittee, working on land issues all the time. We pass literally \nhundreds of bills through the committee. That committee passes more \nbills than any other committee in the Senate. We deal with the bills, \nparticularly land issues, on a bipartisan basis. Most of the time on \nland issues we listen to the home State Senators. If they recommend a \nparcel of land be designated as a wilderness or national monument, we \nlisten to the Senators and we know they are held accountable in their \nStates. So we give them great respect and deference.\n  President Clinton didn't consult with Members of the Senate, and \ndidn't consult with the Energy and Natural Resources Committee; didn't \nconsult with the House Resources committee. He just designated a \nnational monument. Maybe he did it right and maybe he didn't do it \nright. My guess is he is bound to have made mistakes trying to appease \ngroups, perhaps environmental activists--I don't know.\n  I may well agree with many of these. I happen to be a \npreservationist. I happen to be a conservationist. I love the outdoors. \nI have been in the Colorado River. I love to hike. I love to camp. I \nlove to be outdoors as much as anybody. I love to hike on trails. I \nlove our natural resources.\n  What I don't like is a dictator. What I don't like is an emperor. \nWhat I don't like is to have a Presidential fiat, saying we will \ndesignate, and we don't care what the public thinks. We don't care what \nthe elected officials think. We don't care what the Governors think. \nThat is what I really object to.\n  I make the statements in great dissatisfaction with former President \nClinton because he showed contempt of Congress, contempt of the \nConstitution, contempt of the people who live in those districts.\n  I think Congress should look at some of these recent declarations and \nhave hearings. Did he draft these declarations correctly? Are the \nboundaries right? Are they too big? Are they too restrictive? Do they \nmake sense? What\n\n[[Page S425]]\n\nis the economic consequences on the local city and towns and \ncommunities? What does this mean for their taxes? What does this mean \nfor future royalties? What does this mean to Indian tribes? What does \nit mean for him to take these millions of acres and designate them a \nnational monument? I may agree with each one. I disagree with the \nprocess.\n  Again, I think it is very much in violation of the Antiquities Act, \nvery much in violation of the intentions of the Antiquities Act, very \nmuch an abuse of his office as President of the United States. There is \nno comparison to previous Presidents and what they have done.\n  I will have printed in the Record a list of all Presidents since the \ninception of the Antiquities Act, starting with Theodore Roosevelt, all \nthe way through listing every President and the number of acres they \nhad designated during their terms of office as national monuments. It \nshows no President has done as much as President Clinton, with the \nexception of President Carter when there was an enormous amount of land \nin the State of Alaska that was declared a national monument.\n  Other than that one act, President Clinton had exceeded any other \nPresident by multiples of at least two, three, four, or many times \nmore. President George Herbert Walker Bush had zero acres. President \nRonald Reagan had zero acres. President Jimmy Carter, I mentioned \nAlaska lands issued, so that was different. Gerald Ford had 86 acres. \nRichard Nixon had zero acres. Lyndon Johnson had 344,000 acres. \nPresident Clinton did more than 10 times L.B.J. John Kennedy did 26,000 \nacres; President Clinton did almost 5.7 million acres. John Kennedy did \n26,000 acres. This was a Land grab, a power grab, but more than that, I \nbelieve it was an unconstitutional expansion of the Antiquities Act.\n  I think he exceeded his constitutional power and I regret it. I think \nit was a mistake. I think it shows contempt of Congress. Why did he \nwait until after the election? Possibly because there would be a real \nsignificant uproar in these States for failing to consult them.\n  Under the way President Clinton has misused and, I believe, abused \nthe act, he has acted more like a emperor than President of the United \nStates.\n  I ask unanimous consent a list showing President Clinton's use of the \n1906 Antiquities Act and other Presidents and their use of the \nAntiquities Act in addition to copies of the Antiquities Act and the \nlimitations and the situation dealing with Alaska and Wyoming be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             PRESIDENT CLINTON'S USE OF 1906 ANTIQUITIES ACT\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Estimated      Date\n    William Jefferson Clinton (1993-Present)       acreage   established\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGrand Staircase-Escalante National Monument....   1,700,000     09-18-96\nAquafria National Monument.....................      71,100     01-11-00\nCalifornia Coastal National Monument...........       7,000     01-11-00\nGrand Canyon-Parashant National Monument.......   1,014,000     01-11-00\nPinnacles National Monument....................       7,900     01-11-00\nGiant Sequoia National Monument................     327,769     04-15-00\nCanyon of the Ancients.........................     164,000     06-09-00\nCascade-Siskiyou National Monument.............      52,000     06-09-00\nHanford Reach National Monument................     195,000     06-09-00\nIronwood Forest National Monument..............     129,000     06-09-00\nPresident Lincoln National Monument............           2     07-07-00\nVermilion Cliffs National Monument.............     293,000     11-09-00\nCraters of the Moon National Monument..........     661,000     11-09-00\nUpper Missouri River Breaks....................     337,000     01-17-01\nPompeys Pillar.................................          51     01-17-01\nCarrizo Plain..................................     204,000     01-17-01\nSonoran Desert.................................     486,000     01-17-01\nKasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks........................       4,100     01-17-01\nMinidoka Internment National Monument..........          73     01-17-01\nU.S. Virgin Island Coral Reef National Monument      12,708     01-17-01\nBuck Island Reef National Monument.............      18,135     01-17-01\n                                                ------------\n    Total......................................   5,683,838\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                   PRESIDENTS AND THE ANTIQUITIES ACT\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Total\n                         President                             acreage\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTheodore Roosevelt.........................................    1,529,418\nWilliam H.

Mr. President, it is a great honor and privilege for me \nto be standing before the Senate to speak for the first time since \nbecoming a Senator from the State of Michigan. I also am very humbled \nto be only the 40th Senator from our great State to ever serve in this \ninstitution. I am very proud of that.\n  I wish to speak about an important health care issue today and \nreference the fact that I have been involved in health care issues for \nover 20 years, starting, in fact, with my public service and \ninvolvement in politics, having been involved in an effort in my \ncommunity, in Lansing, MI, to save a nursing home. We brought citizens \ntogether from all across the community, spoke out, and were able to \nkeep that nursing home open that had been slated for closure. It was \nthat beginning that got me\n\n[[Page S426]]\n\ninvolved in the important issues of health care that affect our \nfamilies.\n  As we begin the 107th Congress, I think we have a great opportunity \nto get things done for the people we represent. We have a 50/50 Senate, \na divided House, and one of the closest elections we have seen in our \nhistory. Now is the time for us to reach across the aisle to colleagues \non the other side, to work together on behalf of the families all of us \nrepresent.\n  I come to the floor today to talk about one of the most important \nissues confronting us as a Congress and one of the best ways for us to \nstart the new year providing health care for the families we represent \nand that is the enactment of a strong Patients' Bill of Rights. I \nstrongly believe that every one of our citizens, child to senior, has \nthe right to quality, affordable health care. Whether we are talking \nabout access to nursing homes and home health care or lowering the cost \nof prescription drugs for seniors and our families or a Patients' Bill \nof Rights, I am pleased to have been involved in those efforts, and \nwill continue to be so, with my colleagues here in the Senate. In fact, \nhealth care is one of the top priorities because this is what I have \nheard from the people I represent in Michigan.\n  I would like to share a story with you, Mr. President, about the \nLuker family and their daughter, Jessica, of Royal Oak, MI. The Lukers' \nexperience is a compelling example of the need for a strong Patients' \nBill of Rights. I want to point to a replica of a picture of Jessica \nthat I have with me here today.\n  Jessica was born in 1975 with a rare metabolic disorder that required \nvigilant medical care. In the spring of 1999, Jessica's condition had \nworsened and she was having an average of 60 seizures a month. Her \ndoctor recommended surgery to prevent further seizures, and on May 12, \n1999, she had this successful surgery. Her seizures were once again \nunder control.\n  Unfortunately, a week later, on May 17, Jessica's family received a \nletter saying her insurance had been changed retroactively. The \ninsurance company refused to cover the surgery because the Lukers had \nnot received preapproval.\n  Jessica's mom, Tricia Luker, spent hours on the phone with the \ninsurance company explaining the situation. They, in fact, did not find \nout about the change that had occurred May 1 until May 17. It was not \npossible for them to get preapproval for the surgery.\n  After hours and hours on the phone, unfortunately, the Lukers were \nforced to pay for the surgery out of their own pocket. And they are \nstill paying today in 2001.\n  How could the Lukers know their insurance would change without \nreceiving any advanced notice? How could the insurance company refuse \nto pay, using the bureaucracy to stand in the way of common sense?\n  The insurance change meant more difficulties for the Lukers. \nJessica's specialist, who had been treating her for 14 years, was not a \npart of the HMO and was not allowed to continue to serve her. Again, \nthe Lukers were forced to deal with the insurance company, to try to \nfind a new doctor, and Mr. And Mrs. Luker spent hours on the phone, \npage by page, name by name, going through, calling doctors, hearing: \nNo, no, no, to serving and treating Jessica.\n  Jessica's parents continued with her regular doctor and paid for the \nappointments out of their own pocket, while having insurance under an \nHMO.\n  On September 10, 1999, Jessica passed away. In the final days of her \nlife, Tricia Luker talks about the fact that she wanted to be on the \nfront porch, blowing bubbles and reading books to Jessica, which she \nloved, but instead she was fighting the insurance company bureaucracy \nto get her the treatment from the doctor who had been with her for 14 \nyears.\n  Today, Tricia Luker's daughter Jessica is gone, but they are still \npaying the bills from the insurance company that refused to cover the \ntreatment that Jessica needed. Jessica's tragic story demonstrates why \nwe need a strong Patients' Bill of Rights, a bill that will help \npatients like Jessica who have complicated medical problems with access \nto specialists.\n  The bill would make insurance companies accountable for their \ndecisions. It would afford the Lukers the opportunity to appeal what on \nits face seems unreasonable and lacking in common sense.\n  Throughout my campaign for the Senate, I shared Jessica's story with \nthe people of Michigan. I pledged to bring a picture with me to the \nSenate and to keep my promise to Jessica's family, and to all of the \nfamilies of Michigan, to do everything I can to pass a Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n  Today I am taking my fight for Jessica to the Senate floor, and I \nhold great hope that this Congress, that this Senate, will do what \nothers have failed to do--pass a strong Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  A small version of this picture of Jessica sits on my desk in my \nSenate office. It will remain there with me until, in fact, we pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. No family should ever have to go through what \nCalvin and Tricia Luker went through, trying to get their daughter \ncare. In the memory of Jessica, I call on my Senate colleagues to make \npassing a strong Patients' Bill of Rights one of our top priorities.\n  I am very proud today to join with my colleagues, with our leader, \nSenator Daschle, to cosponsor the Patients' Bill of Rights and, in \nfact, this is the first bill that I am cosponsoring as a new United \nStates Senator.\n  The bill today is the same legislation commonly known as the Dingell-\nNorwood bill that was passed overwhelmingly in a bipartisan way in the \nHouse of Representatives. I was proud to be a cosponsor in my service \nin the House of Representatives last session, and I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill in the 107th Congress.\n  The legislation provides basic rights for patients to ensure access \nto care. Again, these are basic rights so that, regardless of your \ninsurance, you know what the basic protections are for your family: \nGuaranteed access to emergency room care at the nearest facility; \ndirect access for women to OB/GYN care; direct access to pediatricians; \na guaranteed option for patients to select doctors outside of their \nplan, if necessary; coverage for clinical trials; access to medically \nnecessary prescription drugs; and the right to an independent appeal \nfor any denied claim.\n  Most importantly, this legislation will hold insurance companies \naccountable for decisions they make regarding patient care, and this is \nthe most critical point.\n  I have spoken with families throughout Michigan and received \ncountless letters, e-mails, and phone calls from people pleading with \nus to help them and to pass this bill. Jessica's is just one of the \nmany tragic stories I have heard.\n  I want to mention just a couple of other names of people with whom I \nhave worked in the State of Michigan who have been struggling with \ntheir families to get the care they have paid for and they deserve. \nArdath and Frank Reagan of Holly, MI. Mr. Reagan became paralyzed from \nthe waist down from a rare disease. His insurance company refused to \npay for his surgery, saying he was not a good candidate. They told \nArdath to put her husband in a nursing home. The insurance company's \nfoot dragging forced her husband to wait before starting treatment and \nseverely aggravated the situation. Today, fortunately, Mr. Reagan is \nmaking a full recovery after intense work on his behalf by his family.\n  Michael Pesendorfer from the Metro Detroit area--Michael's mother \ndied of cancer. He has joined me on a number of occasions as well to \nspeak out for a Patients' Bill of Rights. The insurance company delayed \napproval for treatment. They finally did get the approval for the \nprocedure, but it was too late, and she died shortly after.\n  Susan and Sam Yamen from Birmingham, MI--I read their story on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives last year--are an example of why \nwe need the commonsense policy of saying you go to the nearest \nemergency room in a medical emergency.\n  Sam cut his leg with a chain saw from a business he operated. He had \na severe leg injury and went to the nearest emergency room. The doctors \nwere ready to operate to save his leg. They called the HMO, which said: \nStop, you are in the wrong emergency room. They would not approve the \nsurgery. The doctors said it was critical that it be done immediately \nto save the nerve endings in his leg. They would not approve the \nsurgery in this emergency\n\n[[Page S427]]\n\nroom and he, unfortunately, had to be placed into an ambulance and \ntaken across town to another emergency room where he sat for 9 hours \nbefore he could get any care and did not receive the surgery he needed. \nIn fact, Mr. Yamen has lost his tree trimming business and much of the \nnerve endings and feeling in his leg. His family has been in great \neconomic struggle as a result of this.\n  What these stories tell me is that patients enrolled in an HMO need \nbasic protections and guarantees of adequate coverage. Our families are \npaying for the insurance. They need to get the care, and they need to \nknow it is going to be there in an emergency.\n\n  I believe a strong Patients' Bill of Rights provides those \nprotections and guarantees for coverage. Certainly, Jessica and her \nfamily and the families I mentioned and all of the others I talked to \nall across Michigan have stories that need to be addressed because they \nare not just stories; they are reality for too many people.\n  I am committed to reaching across the aisle to work with our \ncolleagues to pass this critical health care legislation. I know that \nin order to keep my promise to Jessica's family, we have to get to work \nand we have to work together. I am ready to work with everyone who \nshares my goals and the goals and the needs of the families whom I \nrepresent. I look forward to working on the legislation that has been \nintroduced today and the opportunity for us to show clearly that we \nintend to work together for the people of our country by passing a \nstrong Patients' Bill of Rights as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak as in morning business for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, first, on behalf of my colleagues, permit me \nto extend a warm welcome to our new Senator from Michigan. It was an \nhonor to be on the floor as she made her first speech. I appreciate \nvery much her dedication and enthusiasm and her expressed commitment \nand interest in working together. I assure her we will have many \nopportunities in the months to come. All of us are going to have to \nwork together if we are going to make the kind of progress we wish.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bond pertaining to the introduction of S. 29 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/22/senate-section/article/S427-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11:30 A.M.
