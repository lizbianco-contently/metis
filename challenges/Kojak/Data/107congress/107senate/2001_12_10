These words spoken through Zechariah and \nrepeated during the days of Hanukkah have particular significance to us \nthis year. We claim the meaning of the word Hanukkah, ``dedication,'' \nas we rededicate our lives to serve You in the struggle to assure \nreligious freedom for all people. We join with Jewish people in the \ncelebration of the Feast of Dedication and remember the victory in 165 \nB.C. of the Maccabees over the tyrant Antiochus IV Epiphanes and his \ntroops who had occupied Jerusalem, desecrated the temple, and sought to \ndestroy forever the Hebrew religion.\n  We celebrate this victory that enabled the Jews to rededicate the \ntemple and once again worship You freely. Gratefully, we remember the \none remaining flask of pure olive oil left in the temple that You kept \nburning for 8 days and 8 nights until the supply could be replenished. \nNow, as Jews light menorahs, we ask You to light up all of our hearts \nwith Your truth so that we all can shine in the spiritual darkness of \nour time when evil things are done in the name of religion, and where \nreligious freedom is denied people. We dedicate ourselves to battle \ninjustice not by our might or our power, but by the courage of Your \nSpirit. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/10/senate-section/article/S12755-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/10/senate-section/article/S12755-4", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, now before the Senate is the farm bill. The \nfarm bill will do a number of things. First of all, it will stimulate \nthe economy. The need to stimulate the economy is something we need to \ndo right away.\n  Before getting into the intricacies of the farm bill, I refer to a \ncouple of pieces of mail I have received. Unfortunately, we don't get \nmail the way we used to, but I have some e-mails here.\n\n       Dear Senator Reid: We wish to thank you for the \n     Thanksgiving meal we received from you via the Culinary Union \n     here in Las Vegas.\n\n  During Thanksgiving break, I helped pass out some turkeys and other \nlittle boxes until we ran out. People were donating them. They thought \nthey would have enough. They weren't even close to having enough meals. \nBut this is a letter, an e-mail, that says:\n\n       My husband has worked here for 29 years plus and is out of \n     work. Never have we not had money for the holiday. We would \n     not have had the turkey dinner if wasn't for you. We have \n     even enjoyed leftovers. We just want you to know how we \n     appreciate it. Thank you very much. The Heller's.\n\n  Here is another one:\n\n       I was recently changed to part time at the corporation \n     where I work. This was done to reduce my hours and eliminate \n     my health insurance. The result is I am earning one half of \n     my prior income and I am paying $600 per month for COBRA. I \n     need temporary help in maintaining my health insurance \n     through COBRA. I understand there is legislation regarding a \n     tax credit for people relying on COBRA. Your endorsement of \n     this proposal would be of great help to me and my family. \n     Thank you for your support. Sharon Sharp.\n\n  These are two examples of things we need to do in addition to the \nfarm bill to stimulate this economy. No. 1, do something about \nunemployment compensation so people who, for example, have gone from \nwelfare to work and don't qualify for unemployment benefits can get \nsome unemployment benefits. If you want to stimulate the economy, give \nmoney to then people who are most likely to spend it. Then, of course, \nthis letter from Sharon Sharp, who talks about the importance of doing \nsomething about COBRA.\n  Two of the fundamental precepts of our economic recovery plan, our \nstimulus, should be to do something about unemployment benefits and to \ndo something about COBRA. I hope we will do both.\n  I was a little bit confused yesterday as Vice President Cheney blamed \nthe majority leader for the Senate's failure to pass an economic \nstimulus package. He even went so far as to call Senator Daschle an \nobstructionist. I know Vice President Cheney is very busy. Maybe he \nhasn't had the chance to see what goes on in this body.\n  The fact is, Senator Daschle has not obstructed anything. It appears \nto me the Republicans are protesting too much. They are saying Senator \nDaschle is obstructing this. Why? It is because under this unique \nsituation that has developed here, we are not going through the \nordinary process. We are not going through the ordinary process where \nyou would take a bill to the Finance Committee and report a bill out of \nthe Finance Committee.\n  That is not what we are doing because we received some suggestions \nthat maybe the committee process is not the right way to go. Senator \nDaschle agreed: OK, how do you want to do it then? Speaker Hastert sent \nhim a written proposal. Senator Daschle said: I accept it. He sent it \nback. That wasn't quite what they meant to say. They sent something \nelse back. Senator Daschle agreed to accept that as well.\n  The agreement is that, among other things, two Democrats from the \nSenate will join with our counterparts, Republican counterparts here in \nthe Senate and in the House. Senator Daschle selected the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, and Senator Jay Rockefeller, a \nsenior member of the Finance Committee, to represent the Democratic \nSenators. He told us in our conference when we met last Tuesday: Look, \nI trust these men implicitly. They will do the best they can, and they \nwill report back to us when they have an agreement.\n\n  Now, it has been suggested that he has called for a two-thirds \nratification. Well, he did call for a two-thirds ratification, but he \nsaid that Democratic Senators would have to agree with what Senators \nBaucus and Rockefeller negotiated. That certainly doesn't sound \nunreasonable to me. I hope that whatever the Republicans come back \nwith, they will want their conference to agree on it also. Or are we \ngoing to resort to a situation where whatever the President wants, we \njust blindly accept it?\n  I don't think that is the way the Constitution was established. I \nthink this little document--the Constitution--sets up three separate \nbut equal branches of Government, and I think we have should have some \nsay on what is produced. Senator Daschle is doing his job. We not only \nhave Vice President Cheney blaming Senator Daschle for obstructing an \neconomic stimulus package, but the minority leader in the Senate also \nstated he would rather have no bill than a bad bill. I think he speaks \nfor a lot of us here. But, he went on to say that if we can't get a \nbill done this week, we should put it off until next year. I don't \nthink that the American people want us to put off their work until next \nyear. I think we should work hard to get it done this year . . . this \nweek.\n  I think we should keep in mind the document off of which we are \nworking. The legislation pending at the desk is a bill passed by the \nHouse of Representatives. It is a bill that is really interesting, to \nsay the least. In fact, it's not an economic stimulus bill, it's a tax \nbill, because most of the proposals passed by the House and favored by \nthe Administration are approximately 90 percent in tax cuts, many of \nthem, retroactive. Senate Democrats favor tax relief--including \ncorporate tax relief--that would encourage American businesses to \ninvest more or accelerate certain purchases. However, we shouldn't be \npushing permanent, retroactive tax cuts while at the same time American \nworkers who have lost their jobs that their tax relief belongs on the \nback burner. Case in point: Permanent and retroactive repeal of the \ncorporate alternative minimum tax. That is a primary component of the \nHouse bill. This isn't something we are making up, this is in the House \nbill. How can anybody in good conscience tell a hard-working American \nsuch as Sharon Sharp and the Heller family from Nevada--people who lost \ntheir jobs--that we don't have enough money to extend unemployment \nbenefits for a few weeks, but we have enough money to give IBM a $1.4 \nbillion tax refund? These are taxes they have already paid, going back \nto 1988. Any tax you have paid since AMT was passed, they want to give \nit back.\n  If that doesn't give you a little bit of an alert, let's look at the \nlist. I will give you some of the companies on the list, and I think \nit's fair to comment that there is a heavy presence of the oil and \nenergy sector who will get a ton of money back if we accept the House \nbill that we are accused of obstructing: Ford would get $1 billion; \nGeneral Motors would get $832 million returned to them; General \nElectric, $671 million; TXU, $608 million. A foreign company--some of \nthese others are foreign--DaimlerChrysler gets a $600 million refund; \nChevron, $572 million; Enron--Enron, who has done a few things such as \nreally damaging people's pensions--some people had invested so heavily \nin some of these pension fund moneys in Enron stock, which dropped from \n$98 to 34 cents a share. Enron would get $254 million; Phillips \nPetroleum, $241 million; IMC Global, $155 million. Also, it is \ninteresting to note that United Airlines and American Airlines, for \nwhich we just appropriated $15 billion a few weeks ago, would get about \n$600 million; CMS Energy, $136 million.\n\n  Maybe we are doing a pretty good job of slowing things up. This is \nthe document from which we are working. It\n\n[[Page S12757]]\n\nwould be a shame if we passed this bill. I can't imagine why in the \nworld we would want to pass this piece of legislation.\n  I think it is important that we get a stimulus package. What will \nstimulate the economy more, money going to General Electric or any of \nthe companies on this list, or money going to people who have recently \nbeen unemployed? Who is going to spend that money? The unemployed \npeople are. They have no other money; they have to spend it to buy \ngroceries, clothing and, perhaps, a turkey for Christmas. As Sharon \nSharp says, she wants to keep her health insurance. Unemployment \nbenefits to people who will spend the money would stimulate the \neconomy.\n  So rather than giving all these corporations a retroactive tax \nbreak--remember, this was first enacted because of the widespread \nproblem of the large, highly profitable corporations which used to \nthrive on the loopholes and didn't pay a penny of corporate taxes. We \njust said: If you pay no taxes, there is going to be a minimum that you \nhave to pay. That is all we asked in the past. Now we are going to say: \nSorry, you don't have to pay any of those taxes. In fact, those of you \nwho did pay, we are going to give it back to you.\n  Permanent repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax might be \neven more expensive than just refunding past tax payments. The AMT \nreduces the incentive of corporations to find tax loopholes and take as \nmany deductions as possible and to pay at least a minimum tax. Without \nthis, we return to the days when corporations went to extreme measures \nto find tax loopholes and not pay taxes at all.\n  If it were up to the House and this administration, we would have \nenough money for more than $7 billion of retroactive corporate tax \nbreaks, but not any money to help American workers who have lost their \njobs. It is precisely these people--middle-income Americans--who are \nmost likely to spend additional money because they would stimulate the \neconomy. They have to; they have no other money. That is what we are \ntrying to do--enact an economic stimulus package that would stimulate \nthe economy.\n  So I say to my friend, with whom I served in the House of \nRepresentatives, the President of the Senate, the Vice President of the \nUnited States, he should get a better briefing as to what is going on \nbefore he makes statements that Senator Daschle is an obstructionist. \nSenator Daschle is doing the American public a service by standing in \nthe way of what they have done in the House of Representatives. It is \nblatantly unfair to call him an obstructionist, especially when the \nrepresentatives he appointed to this group of negotiators who are \ntrying to come up with a stimulus package--Senators Baucus and \nRockefeller--were prepared to attend a meeting that was scheduled for \nFriday afternoon to continue the negotiations on this package and the \nchairman of the group, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in \nthe House of Representatives, Mr. Thomas, goes to California to attend \na fundraiser. Chairman Baucus and Senator Rockefeller thought they had \na meeting scheduled, then it was abruptly canceled because the Chairman \nof the Ways and Means Committee wanted to leave town. Madam President, \nthey know how to spin this well because they have the bully pulpit. \nThey spin things pretty well. The minority leader gets on television \nand says: Why is Tom Daschle doing this? They have the Vice President \nget on TV and say he is an obstructionist. This is to cover up for the \nfact that their lead negotiator, Chairman Thomas, is in California \ndoing a fundraiser when he should be in Washington working. I think \nthey are protesting too much. I don't think they want a stimulus \npackage. So they are trying to point all their poison arrows at Senator \nDaschle, saying he is the reason why we don't have an economic stimulus \nbill. He is not the reason.\n  Last month, Senator Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, marked \nup an economic stimulus package and reported it to the floor, where \nSenator Daschle immediately called it up for consideration. What \nhappened? The Republicans killed it. Without any amendment process, it \nwas simply killed--no negotiation, no discussion of the amendments.\n  What makes it even more frustrating, while their excuse for killing \nthe economic stimulus package was that it violated the Budget Act--\ntheir own proposal violated the Budget Act. Had we really been trying \nto kill the stimulus package, we would have raised a budget point of \norder against their proposal. But in an effort to keep it before the \nSenate so that we could debate the substance and contents of an \neconomic stimulus, we decided not to raise a point of order. How can \nthey brand Senator Daschle an obstructionist? They are the \nobstructionists. I repeat, they are protesting too much.\n\n  For example, the former chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, came to me a few weeks ago with a proposal I think should \nhave the most serious of discussion. He said: Let's not have \nwithholding taxes collected from the employee or the employer for a \nmonth; a proposal that would cost approximately $38 billion. That money \nwould shoot back into the economy like an injection of penicillin. It \nwould be so good for the economy. But no, we were not given a chance to \nconsider that either.\n  I hope people understand this is a game that is being played. There \nare no negotiations going on. Our friends on the other side of the \naisle won't talk to us. The person supposedly leading the negotiations \nfor the Republicans headed off for California.\n  I hope Chairman Harkin gets into the meat of this discussion on the \nfarm bill and that we do not lose sight of the fact that not only are \nthese farm programs great for the country, because we all eat food and \nAmerica is the farm basket of the world, but they stimulate the \neconomy.\n  The provisions in this bill--I have worked with the chairman of the \ncommittee--are going to be good for the economy. I heard the Republican \nleader on television over the weekend say: Why do we need a farm bill? \nI hope the chairman of the committee will describe in detail today why \nwe need a farm bill. We really do need a farm bill. It is important we \nmove forward.\n  I want to reiterate my point about the meetings that were canceled \nover the weekend. In the spirit of an agreement reached by the Senate, \nthe House, and the administration, Baucus, Rockefeller, Grassley, \nThomas, Armey, and Rangel were supposed to meet on Friday. As I said, \nwithout the courtesy of even a simple phone call, the chairman of the \nWays and Means Committee, Mr. Thomas, took off for California. Even \nSenator Grassley, representing the Republicans, expressed dismay that \nthe negotiations had been rudely interrupted and canceled.\n  Madam President, with people refusing to meet and negotiate, I'd say \nthat it is pretty clear who is obstructing.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to my friend, the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the assistant majority leader for yielding, and I \nthank him for responding to some of the statements that were made over \nthe weekend.\n  I did not watch any of the Sunday morning shows, but I read the \npapers this morning. I saw that Vice President Cheney had referred to \nour majority leader, Senator Daschle, as an obstructionist, obstructing \nthe stimulus bill. I am delighted the Senator from Nevada has clearly \npointed out that no one on this side is obstructing anything. We have \nbeen more than willing to work with the other side on a number of \nitems, but it almost seems to this Senator that their definition of \nobstructionism is ``our way or the highway.'' If we do not do it all \nhow the President or how the Vice President wants or how the \nRepublicans want, then we are obstructionists.\n  We ought to work together across party lines, get bipartisan \nagreements, and move ahead. It is not this side that has been \nobstructing anything. We have wanted to move ahead with legislation.\n  Take the farm bill--and I will have more to say about it this \nafternoon. We have been trying to get some time agreements. A request \nwas proposed by our staff earlier that we have a time agreement and \nthat all first-degree amendments at least be laid down by tomorrow \nafternoon. It was objected to on the Republican side, not on this side.\n\n[[Page S12758]]\n\n  Everyone knew the farm bill was going to be up. It was laid down last \nweek. Yet they are objecting to having some meaningful debate. No one \nwants to cut off amendments, but at least we can have some amendments \nlaid down, have time agreements, and debate them.\n  Second, on the stimulus package, I think the Senator from Nevada is \nright. I think they are protesting too much on the other side. I smell \na little bit of a rat someplace because I have been hearing from my \nGovernor in Iowa, and I have heard from other people and other \nGovernors from around the United States about what bad shape their \neconomies are in right now and how their legislatures will be meeting \nin January.\n  Their budget situations look very dire. They are cutting expenses; \nthey are cutting education; they are cutting other programs around the \nStates. They have looked at the proposed Republican stimulus bill with \nall of the tax cuts, and they have now begun to figure out what that is \ngoing to mean in the States and how the State budgets are going to be \nimpacted by these proposed tax cuts the Republicans have proposed in \nthe stimulus package.\n  A lot of States are saying: Don't give us so much of this ``help'' \nbecause the tax cuts you are putting in there are going to help a lot \nof the large corporations, a lot of the wealthiest in our country, but \nat the same time it is going to take money out of our States at a time \nduring the recession when our States can ill afford it.\n  There is some feedback. Of course, our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle are a little bit in a bind. They promised their big-wig \nsupporters--the big companies and the big corporations--all these tax \ncuts they were going to get for them, and even though they want to \ndeliver, they cannot because they are going to hurt a lot of the \nRepublican Governors and Democratic Governors, too, in the State \nbudgets. Maybe our friends are caught in a little bit of a bind, \npromising too much to the large corporations and the wealthy of this \ncountry, and then finding out what the impact is going to be on our \nStates.\n  What they have come up with is not a stimulus package. It is simply a \ntax relief package for the biggest and wealthiest in our country. That \nis not stimulus at all.\n  If they want to sit down, negotiate, talk about it, and work out \nagreements, that is the spirit of this place and that is what we ought \nto be doing. To say it is their way or no way, and we say we want to \nwork it out, and they say we are being obstructionist--the American \npeople understand that. They understand we are not being \nobstructionists.\n  Talk about obstructionism, try this one on for size. We are now \nengaged in a conference with the House on the reauthorization of the \nelementary and secondary education bill. For years, people on both \nsides of the aisle--I will not point to one side or the other--people \non both sides of the aisle have been saying we need to meet our Federal \ncommitment to special education.\n  The agreement the Federal Government made 26 years ago was that the \nFederal Government would pick up at least 40 percent of the average per \npupil cost of educating kids with disabilities. Twenty-six years ago, \nthe Federal Government said that. Today our commitment is at about 15 \npercent. This is the single biggest issue in every school district in \nAmerica--the funding for special education.\n  The Senate adopted an amendment offered by me and by Senator Hagel \nfrom Nebraska that would put us on the pathway of fully funding special \neducation over 6 years by taking it off the appropriations side and \nputting it on the mandatory side. We are now in conference \nnegotiations.\n  The National Governors' Association, headed by a Republican Governor \nfrom Michigan, signed a letter, supported by every Governor in the \nUnited States, saying they supported the Senate's position of full \nfunding special education.\n  The National School Boards Association, the National PTA, the \nNational Education Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures--38 State legislatures have already passed resolutions \nsupporting this full funding. The only reason we do not have 50 is \nbecause some of them were not meeting this year after we adopted it. \nWait until January. All the legislatures are saying it is time the \nFederal Government stepped up and did its part in special education.\n  Here is the catch: The White House, the administration, has said no, \nthey will not agree with the Senate position on funding for special \neducation.\n  So we had our vote on it. The House voted against it. We voted for \nit. Okay. What is to be done then? Usually in a conference, \nnegotiations are started and compromise is attempted.\n  So we offered to the House a compromise, and the House said forget \nit, they are not going to compromise. They do not want to fund special \neducation one more nickel than what they have done in the bill. It is \nnot coming from the House side. It is coming down from the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue. It is coming from the White House. It is the White \nHouse that is stonewalling.\n  So talk about obstructionism, that is obstructionism when the White \nHouse refuses to negotiate or reach any kind of compromise with the \nSenate on full funding for special education. So I think before the \nVice President and others start throwing around words about \nobstructionism, they ought to pick up the mirror and look at \nthemselves, especially when it comes to funding for special education.\n  So I thank the Senator from Nevada for pointing out the fact we have \nnot been obstructing anything on this side, and for pointing out this \nso-called stimulus package is nothing more than the old ``trickle \ndown.'' If those at the top are given to it, some of it may trickle \ndown on the rest of us. We have tried that before and it has never \nworked; it will not work this time either.\n  Yes, we do need to do something about unemployment compensation. The \nbiggest stimulus we could have right now is getting health care for our \nchildren and health care for people who do not have health care \ncoverage right now. That is the biggest stimulus we could give to our \neconomy and help people at the same time.\n  I am going to wrap up my statement, and then I am going to talk about \nthe farm bill, another stimulus.\n  We are in dire straits. Rural America is hurting. We need a farm \nbill. When farmers know a bill is coming, they are borrowing money; \nthey are buying new equipment; they are doing the things that stimulate \nthe kind of growth and the kind of manufacturing we need in this \ncountry. So I sure hope we will not hear any more of this blame game, \ntrying to blame someone for being obstructionist when all we are trying \nto do is work in a bipartisan fashion, as we should be doing, to reach \nthe best decisions for the American people. So when they say \n``obstructionism,'' they say it is our way or the highway. To me, that \nis obstructionism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry: Am I entitled to speak for a \ngiven time or must I seek consent of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is on the farm bill, and the \nSenator may speak as long as he wishes on the farm bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that I speak for only 9 minutes \ninstead of as long as I wish, but that it not be on the farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 9 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/10/senate-section/article/S12758-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12758-S12761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WHERE IS THE DEMOCRATIC STIMULUS PACKAGE?\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, fellow Senators, especially to my good \nfriend, Harry Reid, I will not take time this afternoon to attempt in \nsome feeble way to rebut the statement with reference to the \npartisanship of the last month or so with reference to various items, \nincluding the stimulus package. Suffice it to say, the granddaddy of \nall partisanship occurred on the stimulus package that was reported out \nof the Finance Committee of the Senate because on that particular one, \nthe conferees were instructed by the Democratic majority--and I remind \neveryone that majority is by one vote--they told that committee to \nreport out a Democratic package every single Democrat Senator would \nsupport. That meant there were no Republicans because they had \nsomething\n\n[[Page S12759]]\n\nto offer, too. But rather they took a Democratic package, produced it, \nand then the big partisan debate started with reference to an attempt \nto get a stimulus package.\n  Where is that Democratic stimulus package? I do not have it. I wish I \ndid. I would love to read it to the American people so they could \nconclude whether it is going to make jobs for people, whether that is \ngoing to excite this economy. It is still pending at the desk. It is \nstill pending because those who produced it do not want to let the \nSenate vote on it because they are afraid there will be two \nnegotiations: One when we argue in this Chamber and one when they go to \nconference.\n  Whatever their reasons, the hangup is there is a bill at the desk \nthat was produced by a partisan majority that contains only things they \nwant and nothing the Republicans wanted. I submit we can throw those \nkinds of characteristics away and ask some experts whether that bill \nwill create new jobs.\n  Among the various proposals, it is the least productive of new jobs \nof all the proposals around. So with another effort on the part of the \nDemocratic leadership, we are led by my very good friend, Harry Reid, \nto bring this back and in some way blame the Republicans, who do not \neven control the Senate, for this big delay.\n  Then what happened to the House? The House produced their own \neconomic stimulus. Every time our friends on the other side talk about \nthe Republicans, everybody should know that was the House Republicans \nwho produced the bill they are speaking of, not those of us who are \ntrying to put a package together in the Senate. The House did their own \nthing. They got a majority vote, and that is the way they did it.\n  That is not going to end up being the law. We have to get together \nand resolve the issue in favor of the American people, instead of in \nfavor of who wins this bickering and this arguing.\n  So that is where we are.\n  Instead of there being a vote in the Senate on the stimulus package, \na deal was cooked up for which we would never vote in the Senate: just \ngo to conference with the House and have an argument with them and \ndecide between the Democratic proposal that was adopted without any \ninput from the Senate Republicans, whether that or a House-passed bill \nis going to be the law of the land, or which part will come out of it \nin terms of compromise.\n  Why did the House chairman call off the meetings? I never justify the \nHouse's activities, but the House chairman's reason was very simple: \nthe majority leader had said publicly there would not be a stimulus \npackage unless two-thirds of the Democratic Senators supported the \nprovisions of that stimulus package. The chairman of the House read \nthat and said, since that is their desire--and I do not go to committee \nmeetings negotiating with an unknown two-thirds Members who are not \neven present--why do we not go home, take a 5-day recess, and think it \nover. That is where we are.\n\n  Let anybody who would like lay blame for that 5-day delay, but it is \nnot all singularly the problem of the chairman of the House committee \nwhen, if it is true, the leader of the other side has indicated there \nis no use going to conference and negotiating because there is an \nominous presence that has to be looked to to make sure two-thirds of \nthe Democratic Senators support it.\n  That is pretty different than most conferences. I do not blame him \ntoo much for wondering what kind of conference they were going to have. \nIt has since been denied that it was said or that it meant that. What \nwe ought to do is actually forget about all of that.\n  Before I move to the stimulus package, I must take a couple of \nminutes to speak with reference to the farm bill. Tomorrow, we will \nhave plenty of time, I hope, to talk about the farm bill in more depth.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield on a point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On a point?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. The Senator from New Mexico said something I am not \nsure is accurate, and I wonder if I might ask a question about that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to finish. I do not have much time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am glad to extend the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I can handle anybody's question, but I want to finish \nmy thoughts and then I will yield to the Senator.\n  With reference to the farm bill, I do not come to this Chamber too \noften on a farm bill, but I will be on this one because, first of all, \nit is an abomination for milk production in America and for our \nchildren who drink a lot of milk and for those in America who are \nencouraged to drink a lot of milk. This is a bill calculated to \nincrease the price of milk dramatically so as to spread around a new \ntax so all of those producing milk can get a fair share of the new tax; \nnot so we will produce competition and there will be a big incentive to \nproduce good, solid, healthy milk at lower prices but, rather, to make \nsure those areas of the country that are not producing milk in a \ncompetitive manner will get made whole at the expense of the very \ncompetitive States such as mine and Idaho and others, that are \nproducing substantially new ways to be competitive, safe, sound, and \nproduce rather cheap milk for the American children and American \npeople. We will have plenty to say about that.\n\n  The bill they are talking about in agriculture, obviously, will never \nbecome law. It has some good arguing points for five or six States that \nwould like to convince others.\n  Having said that, I get back to stimulus. The news is not great with \nreference to the economy. It is very hard to figure out what is going \non in the economy because the numbers, the statistics, the assessments \nare mixed. Clearly, they are not so mixed that we should call off the \nstimulus package. We have to do one. We ought to decide now that we \ndon't have a lot of time and we ought to do a very simple bill.\n  I say to Senator Reid, what I will do today is introduce a very \nsimple economic stimulus package. The Senator might recall, in the \nChamber a couple of weeks ago I shared a proposal with you with \nreference to an economic stimulus, that we have a 1-month holiday from \nthe Social Security tax for both the employer and the employee. I think \nwe ought to have that as a cornerstone. Both sets of leaders in both \nHouses ought to agree that is the best stimulus around of any we have \nseen, and then just do two other things--and all the rest we will wait \nand do next year--do two other things and call it a stimulus package. \nIndeed, it would be.\n  First, the tax holiday will put $8 billion into the economy and 160 \nmillion working men and women in America get to keep the withholding. \nTheir employers will do the same. They will not have to remit theirs. \nThat ought to be the cornerstone. Do it for January, February. But do \nit. It will stimulate the economy and give it a good kick upwards. A \nlot of Democrats support that. It is when you put the rest of the \npackage together we get to arguing. I submit it is so important we get \nrid of the other things that cause Members to argue and do those \nanother day, another time, another way. They are not stimulus anyway.\n  We ought to do two things. Beyond the holiday, we ought to expand the \nsafety net for working Americans; that is, expand it and extend \nunemployment payments. Some Democratic Senators and some Republicans \nhave said we ought to do that. We ought to agree to that. An additional \n13 weeks of unemployment benefits, if passed, and expand that to part-\ntime workers--they ought to be in this alternative--that costs $9 \nbillion.\n\n  Last, we ought to go ahead and do the enhanced extending of cap \nexpenditures but reduce it to 20 percent instead of 30 percent, so we \nwould have 20 percent appreciation in 3 years.\n  An extension of expansion of the unemployment compensation and the \nstimulus package, the stimulus core, and the payroll tax holiday. I \nwish we could do that. I wish we could decide. There is not enough time \nto argue. Let's do something truly stimulative to get America going \nagain and let that do two other things the Americans need: One for the \nunemployment needs and one for business needs with reference to \nappreciation.\n  I put my statement in explaining the situation of the economy, \nexplaining the three provisions, and sending a bill along with it, in \ncase anybody wants to see what it should look like. I send a bill with \nit, and that includes only the three provisions: The holiday; the 20 \npercent depreciation instead of 30 percent for 3 years for the capital \naccount,\n\n[[Page S12760]]\n\nwhich is very much needed by small and large businesses; and last, a \ndrastic and much needed expansion of the unemployment code of this \ncountry. The three provisions make up about a $79 billion package. If \nwe can pass that this week--everybody knows what they are--that will be \ntruly something very positive.\n  I am happy to answer questions. If I made an error, I am happy to \ncorrect that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. On the point the Senator from New Mexico made about the \neconomic stimulus or recovery plan that came out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, the Senator from New Mexico indicated that was at the desk--\nor I guess first he asked where is it; and then, it is at the desk, why \nisn't it pending?\n  Isn't it the case the bill at the desk is a House bill which was \npassed by the House on a clearly partisan 216 to 214 vote. In fact the \nbill out of the Senate Finance Committee is not at the desk, but a \npoint of order was made against it. I believe the Senator from New \nMexico supported the point of order that took the Senate Finance \nCommittee bill off the floor, and it is not pending. I want to correct \nthat because I think the implication of the Senator was, well, that \nbill is at the desk, why isn't it here? Is it not the case it was \npending and a vote was held on a point of order? And I believe the \nSenator from New Mexico supported the point of order and therefore it \nis not pending.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that may be the case. If it is the case, \nI yield to the facts.\n  Still, the situation is that at an appointed time shortly after that \nevent, or surrounding that event, when it was declared to be violative \nof the Budget Act, it is quite clear the majority leader does not want \nto negotiate here with Republicans and in the House with Republicans \nand Democrats, again. So he prefers to go right to conference. He \ndoesn't seem to be terribly concerned about what happened to the \nDemocratic bill because he doesn't want to work anything out in the \nSenate because he says that means he will have to negotiate twice.\n  I believe we don't have to negotiate twice. We ought to look at these \nthree points. I can see in both bodies a very large majority for these \nthree points. That is ample for Members to go home at Christmas and \nsay, we have a good stimulus. It can be bipartisan because there are at \nleast 12 Senators, a mix of both sides, who support the holiday. The \nonly reason there are not more is that they are waiting for their own \nprovision that they supported to go away because they don't want to be \nfor two things. But if the leadership would say we should do a simple \npackage, one that is profoundly stimulative, we can forget about all \nthis arguing and forget about which week what happened.\n\n  But I will go back and say, if we said that the Democrat bill was \nsubject to a point of order, that is the way everything has been going \nhere, everything is subject to a point of order.\n  The truth is, it started off very nonpartisan because the Finance \nCommittee decided they would put together a bill to garner enough \nDemocratic votes to report it out of committee. I am not arguing that \nwe have the right to do that. I have done that on budget before. But \nyou cannot then say it is the Republicans who don't want a tax bill \nwhen you started this process, when you started this process by saying, \nwe want one but only if it is our way.\n  It is time we all forget about that. My speech is not intended to \nbring it all up again, just to clarify the record, and then to say \nforget about it and let us do something. This week we could get a \nstimulus done that would be about like the one I sent to the desk, we \ncould get the rest of our work done, and we could go home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is very curious. My friend from New \nMexico, when I asked the question about whether the bill is pending or \nat the desk, as was his implication, said that may or may not be the \ncase. It either is or is not the case.\n  The answer is, it is not the case. I don't want people to come to the \nfloor and say the stimulus program that came from the Senate Finance \nCommittee is somewhere around here and the majority leader doesn't wish \nto bring it back to the floor. It was on the floor, we had a vote on \nit, and in fact every Member on the other side of the aisle voted to \ntake it off the floor.\n  I think when the Senator says that may or may not be the case, this \nis a matter of fact. I don't want people to leave the implication that \nsomehow there is a bill sitting at the desk, ready to come to the \nfloor, but Senator Daschle chooses not to bring it to the floor. In \nfact, the bill at the desk is the House bill. That bill came from the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee. It was a partisan bill, written by \nChairman Thomas and the Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee--\nthe very process the Senator from New Mexico criticizes. That was \npassed by the House of Representatives 216 to 214. That is what is now \nat the desk. It came to the floor of the Senate, and we had a debate.\n  It is also the case that every bill, including the House bill, the \nSenate Republican bill, and the bill the Senate Finance Committee \npassed, had a point of order that could be lodged against it.\n  The only point of order that was lodged was against the bill that \nSenator Daschle tried to bring to the floor of the Senate. So it is, in \nmy judgment, a curious thing for those who voted to take the bill off \nthe floor of the Senate and have us cease its consideration with a \npoint of order, to now wonder aloud--repeatedly, in the last couple of \nweeks--where is the bill?\n  I said before this is not exactly a ``Where's Waldo'' exercise, a \ngame that most fathers have played with their children. We know where \nthe bill is. It was here. It is now gone--not because of something we \ndid. We wanted that economic stimulus and recovery bill to be passed by \nthe Senate and to go to conference. It is gone because it was taken off \nthe floor on a point of order--a point of order which, incidentally, we \ndid not raise against anything else. The point of order would exist \nagainst the House-passed bill and against the Senate Republican bill.\n  Because of that, the decision was made to try to find a way to create \na negotiation between the House and the Senate--and hopefully with the \ncooperation of the President--to see if we could construct some kind of \nstimulus package.\n  Is that an optimum way to do it or the best way to do it? I don't \nthink so. The best way to have done this, in my judgment, would have \nbeen to consider the bill that came out of the Senate Finance Committee \nand in regular order offer amendments to it, have votes on it, and then \ngo to a conference. That would have been my preference.\n  I must say to my friend from New Mexico that I have great admiration \nfor his legislative skills. He is a great speaker and good thinker, and \nI think the suggestion he has with respect to the payroll tax is, in \nfact, stimulative. The point is he has some suggestions that have some \nstimulus capability to them. But to go out and then go through 5 or 6 \nminutes of the same sort of thing we heard on the talk shows all \nweekend about Senator Daschle and say that is not what it is all about, \nlet's forget what I just said--you know, somehow that doesn't make much \nsense to me.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. In the end, the question before the American people about \nhow you fix and provide lift to the American economy is not about \nRepublicans or Democrats. It also is not about conservatives or \nliberals, and it is not about the House or the Senate. It is about \nright and wrong. There is a right way to do this and a wrong way to do \nit. Most of us are not certain what is right or wrong. But consult with \nthe best economists in America, just consult with the best economists \nyou can find in this country, and ask them: Which set of policies do \nyou think give us the best chance for this economy to recover? You know \nthat the answer is not this.\n  The Senator will say that is what the House did: That is exactly what \nwe are negotiating at this point because Chairman Thomas brings this to \nthe negotiating table. What ``this''? Let me read--I will be happy to \nyield in a moment. Let me read from the Wall Street Journal--no liberal \nbastion, I might say.\n\n       When President Bush and Congress sat down to another round \n     of tax-cutting this fall in the hopes of stimulating the \n     economy, business groups were welcomed to the table.\n\n[[Page S12761]]\n\n      Now, many of the country's biggest corporations are reaching \n     for an oversized portion.\n\n  The companies could end up grabbing refund checks worth hundreds of \nmillions of dollars each, thanks to one of the many business breaks in \nthe tax-cut package fashioned by House Republican leaders that could \ncome to a House vote this week. Democrats' objections are to be \nexpected, but even some Senate Republicans and Bush officials have \ndistanced themselves.\n  As you know, the Secretary of the Treasury called this ``show \nbusiness.'' Those are the words to describe what the House of \nRepresentatives did.\n  I don't come here to decide that one side is all right or one side is \nall wrong. But I am a little chagrined about what is happening here, \nabout people talking about what the majority leader has or hasn't done, \nwhat the majority leader could or could not do. The majority leader did \nthe responsible thing. He brought a stimulus bill to the floor of the \nSenate for debate. It wasn't his action that took it from pending \nconsideration. It was a point of order made by the other side, \nRepublicans, that actually took it off the Senate floor.\n  I will, without losing my right to the floor, be happy to yield to \nthe Senator from New Mexico for a question.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not have a question. If I may just \nhave a minute to make a statement, the Senator can then take as much \ntime as he would like to rebut me.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, of course I will allow the Senator from \nNew Mexico to make a minute statement. The purpose of discourse on the \nfloor is to ask questions and respond to questions. But if the Senator \nwould like to have a minute--without my yielding the floor--I would be \nhappy to do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just want to make one statement as to the issue of \nwhether or not the American people were going to ever get a stimulus. \nThey could look up here and say Congress passed a bill that people \noutside of government, who know about our economy, say will help us, \nthe American consumers. That started down the partisan path when the \nFinance Committee of the Senate was told it was to produce a Democratic \nbill. They did. They got every Democrat to vote for it and no \nRepublicans.\n  All I am suggesting is, that started us down a path that was full of \npartisan thorns. Instead of us going down a nice, easy street to get \nAmericans what they deserve, we started down a partisan path that got \nus here today.\n  The House may be as partisan as can be. Their bill may be everything \nthe distinguished Senator is going to say about it. But it may not, \nalso. But it may be. That is his assessment of their bill.\n  We do not have a bill we are going to discuss because they produced a \npurely Democratic bill that did not have any Republican support. If in \nfact we did what he said, it was subject to a point of order and we \nvoted it down so it would not be the pending business. Those are still \nthe facts. I regret that it doesn't set too well with the other side \nwhen somebody comes down here for 8 or 9 minutes--and that is all the \ntime we have been here--and interrupts their conversation, which has \nbeen going on day after day, that kind of blames all this on the \nRepublicans. I do not choose to blame it on the Democrats. I choose to \nsay let's get a stimulus package and let's have some leadership, to say \nit is too late to get everything we want and it is too late to argue. \nLet's just get a stimulus package by going to conference with some \nleadership saying let's do a simple but good thing.\n  I offer a suggestion today as to what that could be. I am just as \nvulnerable to being prejudiced in favor of the holiday portion of it as \nothers are for business or labor provisions that they want in this. But \nI think we should get off the partisan path, get onto another one. And, \nfrankly, the Agriculture bill can be debated, the remaining \nappropriations bill, and a nice, simple stimulus package could be put \ntogether if indeed we just chose to move to another path.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator for yielding to me.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I may continue, I find this really \ninteresting. I believe this past spring the Budget Committee sent out a \nwholly partisan document supported only by the Republicans after they \nrefused to meet with the Democrat members of the committee.\n  I don't think we are interested in a lot of finger pointing. I think \nthe American people are interested in a question of who is going to \noffer proposals that constructively help this American economy.\n  I am going to say some things about the House bill because the House \nbill is what comes to the conference. It is not a question of may or \nmay not be good. The House bill is atrocious. Does anybody in this \ncountry think that, with an economy that is very weak, with an economy \nwith a substantial overcapacity, the way to resolve the problems of \nthis economy and provide lift and opportunity in this economy is to \ngive Ford a $1 billion tax rebate check, or IBM, a $1.4 billion tax \nrebate check for corporate alternative minimum taxes paid going back to \n1988? They won't do that for individuals who paid an alternative \nminimum tax but just for corporations at a time when there is \novercapacity.\n\n  Is there anyone who can find an economist who thinks this is going to \nhelp the American economy? It is not.\n  How about the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost their \njobs?\n  Every economist will concede that one way to stimulate this economy \nis to help those people who have lost their jobs with extended \nunemployment benefits. A fair number have no benefits at all and we \nshould provide something to help them during these tough times. Every \neconomist says that will help this economy because every one of those \ndollars will be spent almost immediately. That is the way you help this \neconomy.\n  There are other ways as well: A combination of tax breaks, yes--for \nbusiness and others--rebates to be helpful to some people who didn't \nget tax breaks earlier this year; and, extend unemployment benefits. \nThere are other things we can do.\n  But what was done in the House of Representatives--you talk about the \nsounds of the hogs in the corn crib just grunting and shoving around \ndoing what they can to cobble together a bill with left-over policies \nthey didn't get done in any other tax bills is exactly what happened \nhere. This has nothing to do with stimulus.\n  That is not why I came to the floor. I am just curious. My colleague \ncame to the floor to spend about 5 to 6 minutes talking about what the \nDemocrats have done to make all of this partisan and political, and \nthen said: But it is not my intention to cast blame or to talk about \nthe Democrats--after the first 5 minutes talking about the Democrats \nand Senator Daschle.\n  Let me make this point about this issue. We brought this stimulus \nbill to the floor of the Senate. It is not here now because a point of \norder was lodged against it, and every Member of the minority party in \nthe Senate voted to sustain that point of order. That is why it is not \nhere. The next time somebody asks the question, write it down. Take a \n2-by-5 card and write it down for those who voted to sustain a point of \norder. Write a little note that says: I voted to take the stimulus bill \noff the floor of the Senate so it couldn't any longer be considered so \nyou will know that. You don't have to repeatedly ask these questions.\n  We have this negotiation going on. It is supposed to go on. The \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee went to California this \nweekend instead of meeting over the weekend as previously decided. I do \nnot know about all of that.\n  But at the end of the day, the American people deserve to have a \npackage of proposals from this Congress that really gives a lift to \nthis economy. This economy is in trouble. We have a responsibility to \nhelp. It is not going to help by people coming here and pointing this \nway or that way. As I said, there is not a Republican or Democratic way \nto stimulate the economy, but there is the right way and the wrong way. \nWe have received some pretty good advice on which is which.\n  My judgment is that in the coming days we can put together a proposal \nthat will be helpful to this country. That is our obligation.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/10/senate-section/article/S12762-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12762]]\n AGRICULTURE, CONSERVATION, AND RURAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2001--Resumed\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the underlying farm bill is on the floor \nof the Senate. When you talk about economic recovery and economic \nstimulus, what can promote economic recovery better in this country \nthan to help those on America's farms? Recovery, in my judgment, begins \nat the roots. It seems to me that what has always nourished America has \nrolled from the family farms to the small towns and big cities. Whether \nit is economic opportunity or economic progress, family values have \nalways nourished our country.\n  Our farmers are in significant trouble. We have struggled and fought \nand scrapped and tried to get this bill to the floor of the Senate. We \nhave the Secretary of Agriculture calling around saying don't do it. In \nfact, the Secretary of Agriculture pushed very hard to prevent the \nHouse from doing it, and Congressman Combest, who is of the other \npolitical party--God bless him--said: I am going to do it anyway. It \nneeds to be done; it ought to be done now. And he did it, and ran a \nfarm bill through the House. Good for him.\n  We are struggling to get a farm bill through the Senate. Senator \nHarkin brought a farm bill from his committee, and it is now on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Let me read from a letter of December 10 addressed to Senator Daschle \nand Senator Lott. It says:\n\n       The undersigned farm, commodity and lender organizations \n     write to thank you for your efforts to expedite the debate \n     and consideration of a new farm bill in the United States \n     Senate, and urge that the legislation be completed in a \n     timely manner without delay. We believe it is vitally \n     important that this legislation be enacted this year to \n     provide an important economic stimulus to rural America \n     before Congress adjourns.\n       We fully understand the policy differences exist regarding \n     this important legislation, and would encourage a healthy \n     debate on these issues. However, we are very concerned that \n     the timeframe to pass this legislation is rapidly drawing to \n     a close. We believe this will require the Senate to complete \n     a thorough debate and achieve passage of the legislation by \n     Wednesday evening, December 12th.\n\n  I will include in the Record a list of who is who in American \nagriculture. It is virtually every organization: American Farm Bureau, \nNational Farmers Union, National Corn Growers, National Cotton Council. \nVirtually every organization that represents family farmers is asking \nthis Senate to do the right thing, to consider this farm bill, move it \nalong today, tomorrow, or the next day, and offer amendments to try to \nget it out of the Senate and get it into conference so we can put a \nbill on the desk of the President for signature.\n  My hope is that we can do that before we leave town. It is a \nstruggle. It is not easy, but it is achievable.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                December 10, 2001.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I would like to talk about a number of \nthings.\n  First, we are talking about the farm bill, but we have taken many \ndifferent directions in terms of the economic stimulus. It needs to be \nextended.\n  The President suggested a package. The Republicans did not have \nanything to say about the bill that came out of committee. It was \ntotally Democrat.\n  We need to make some changes in order to get this done. This isn't \nabout the House. The only talk has been about what the House has done. \nThey can do what they choose. We ought to do what we think is right.\n  The President asked for an extension of unemployment benefits for 13 \nweeks for Americans who lost their jobs due to the terrorist attacks. I \nam sure some will agree with that. He asked for $11 billion for the \nStates to help low-income workers obtain health insurance for a certain \nperiod of time. I suppose everyone would agree with that to maintain \nthat sort of help, wouldn't they?\n  Also, of course, in order to create some jobs, we have been talking \nabout accelerated depreciation to encourage companies to go ahead and \npurchase material and purchase machinery to create jobs. That is really \nwhat it is all about. Partial expensing, tax relief for low- and \nmoderate-income workers--these are things that are all in the package.\n\n  It isn't as if everyone has a different idea, but we ought to have a \nchance to talk about them. We ought to have a chance to bring up those \nthings and to decide what the majority of this body would like. I am \nsorry, I do not quite understand how we got off into this: If the \nDemocrats do not agree, then nothing should happen; if the Republicans \ndo not agree, then nothing should happen. That is not the way we should \noperate. So I am hopeful we can do this. I indeed think we should.\n  We are going to have to make some decisions in terms of priorities. \nObviously, there is not much time left, whether we get out this week or \nwhether we stay until Christmas. In either case, there is not a lot of \ntime.\n  We have three more appropriations bills in conference that have to be \nresolved. Those have to be done. We got through a tough appropriations \nbill last Friday by staying here until 12:30 on Friday night. We will \nhave a tough one with Health and Human Services, I am sure. But those \nneed to be done.\n  Then we need to make judgments whether we are going to have energy, \nwhether we are going to have a farm bill, whether we are going to have \nthe insurance package--a lot of things that people talk about having. \nThe question\n\n[[Page S12763]]\n\nis, What is the priority for us at this time?\n  Quite frankly, I think the leadership has been a little slow in \ntrying to set forth their priorities. There is no use listing 15 \ndifferent things people would like to do. We are not going to do that, \nobviously.\n  Indeed, in many cases we perhaps are better off to take a little more \ntime on these tough bills to really decide where we want to be in 10 or \n15 years, such as in agriculture, as to what we want agriculture to \nlook like over a period of time. What we do on this bill is going to \nhave a great deal of impact on agriculture.\n  This bill will last for 6 years, but it will have an impact beyond \nthat. Quite frankly, we have wrestled with this issue for quite some \ntime. I have been involved in agriculture all my life in one way or \nanother. We seem to kind of move in short spurts to take care of what \nthe problem is here, what the problem is there; and, yes, you have to \ndo that, of course. But the fact is, we ought to be looking at a policy \nthat takes us down the road to where we want to be, where we have a \nsafety net of some kind for agriculture, where agricultural production \nis needed in the marketplace, where there is a marketplace for \nagricultural production, where we do some of the kinds of things that \nwill maintain open spaces and the conservation and land over time that \nwe would like to have. Those are the kinds of long-term things that I \nthink are very important.\n  So as we undertake farm bills, they need to be given a lot of \nthought. That did not happen in the committee, as a matter of fact. We \nonly had a very short time to deal with it. And it became an issue for \nthe chairman, the leadership, to get that bill out in 10 days, or a \nweek or so. So we were talking about various numbers of titles. We \nwould get the title of the proposal one night and try to vote on it the \nnext morning. That isn't the way to do it. We did not have time to \ndigest it, let alone have an opportunity to talk with the people at \nhome in terms of how it would impact agriculture. And that really is \npart of it.\n  The bill that is before us now is, of course, the Harkin bill. I \nthink we need to support a bill that will continue to move agriculture \ntowards a market-oriented situation so that the emphasis and the \nincentives for agriculture are to produce those things the price would \nindicate are to be marketed.\n\n  There are programs in the past we have used with certain very high \nprice supports that encouraged production in which there was no \nmarketability. Everyone wants to have this underpinning support, of \ncourse, but then you have to be very careful as to what you do with \nthat.\n  We need to place more emphasis on broader agriculture. Agriculture \nbills that started generally in the 1930s were oriented towards what \nare called the program crops. They are corn and soybeans and half a \ndozen crops, mostly in the Middle West. And now agriculture has changed \nto where you have all kinds of crops in all kinds of places.\n  So I think in the future, as we look to where we want to go, we have \nto find a program that deals with more people in agriculture for some \nkind of safety net security.\n  Some 40 percent of agricultural products goes into foreign trade. So \nwe have to deal with the kind of trade arrangements that we have around \nthe world, WTO particularly. We have to have a farm program that does \nnot conflict there or allows other countries to put up obstacles to our \nforeign trade. So those are the kinds of issues that need to be \nconsidered.\n  We need to keep working lands in production. The idea of having a \nprogram that sets aside acres and acres of land in some kind of \nconservation reserve, where they are no longer productive, is not an \neconomically sound policy to have over time. What we need to do is have \na conservation program that impacts all of these acres and lets them \ncontinue to be useful, whether it is grass, whether it is trees, or \nwhatever it turns out to be.\n  The bill before us generally takes us in the wrong direction, takes \nus back towards the agricultural programs of the 1930s during the \nDepression. It endorses higher loan rates which would encourage \noverproduction. Prices for U.S. products, that are almost out of reach \nfor our markets around the world, will be even higher.\n  It has a commodity title that puts, because of our arrangements in \nworld trade, our producers and industry at risk of retaliation. It \nthreatens to exceed our so-called ``amber box'' obligations in WTO. \nThey are watching every move we make to see if that is or is not the \ncase. And it can impede us with the kinds of difficulties it brings.\n  The conservation title is really sort of a gimmick. It substantially \nboosts conservation spending in fiscal years 2002 to 2006 and then \nreduces it dramatically for the remainder of the time simply to make it \nfit into the budget. That isn't going to work over a period of time. \nThat is a ballooning of expenditures early to make it acceptable, and \nthen it does not continue until the bill expires.\n  So these are some of the issues with which we are faced. We can \nchange those if we have an opportunity to have amendments, if we have \nan opportunity to consider a bill that will be proposed as an \nalternative that has some different ideas in it. We should have an \nopportunity to vote on that.\n  But with more and more environmental provisions that landowners and \nfarmers and ranchers have to abide with--and, indeed, in some cases at \nleast they should--then there needs to be assistance for that, \nassistance in the future to have the kind of technical help that is \nrequired, for instance, in nonpoint source water protection.\n  There are lots of things that have to be done to comply with EPA \nregulations by landowners. They need help to do that. That is one of \nthe things that ought to be done. We ought to be able to have a budget \nthat goes out over time.\n  The Cochran-Roberts amendment will be a substitute that takes a \nlittle different direction, gives us an option, gives us a chance to do \nsome things. The payments are considered to be WTO ``green box'' \npayments, so you can have support for agriculture without running into \nconflicts in terms of trade. It will not place our producers at risk \nfor a challenge from other countries. It gives an opportunity to \nproducers to obtain support through a farm savings account so they can \ncontinue to save with the help of Government contributions.\n  The conservation title has programs that keep working lands in \nproduction, and it extends it beyond the program crops. My State, of \ncourse, is largely a livestock State, so conservation that applies to \ngrasslands, and those kinds of things, is equally as interesting.\n  There is a program called the Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram, QUIP, which provides technical assistance. That is a program \nthat is quite important, I believe.\n  So we are going to have an opportunity to look at some of the options \nto see if we can do the things that I think are most important; that \nis, to have a plan over time that provides for the encouragement of \nproduction, production that will then be marketed, that provides for \nthe conservation of all the lands, so when we are through with the \nland, we will see that we have open spaces and that we have an effort \nmade through this program to develop more and more markets, whether \nthey be overseas or whether they be domestic, and that it is fiscally \nresponsible so that we have a budget for the entire length of the bill \nand one that is trade compliant.\n  I am certainly in favor of us having a bill. I don't think it makes a \nworld of difference whether it is done in the next week or whether it \nis done in the early part of next year. The Budget Committee chairman \nfrom North Dakota continues to say we won't have the money next year. I \ndon't see any reason why we don't have as much money in February as we \ndo in December. There won't be a new budget by that time. Things will \nnot have changed. If we could do a better job by having a little more \ntime to work on it, I favor that. If we can get the job done in the \nshort while and have the opportunity to make the changes, have the \nopportunity to examine the contents of the bill--which, frankly, most \nof us have not even had, and we are on the committee--then that is the \nneed that we must have.\n  I look forward to us moving forward and accomplishing those things. I \ndo hope that we do set our priorities on timing and do not move into \nthis question of trying to do everything. That is always a problem at \nthe end of a session. Everything that has not been\n\n[[Page S12764]]\n\ndone up to that time, regardless of the reason it has not been done, \nsuddenly becomes the most important action that could ever occur and \nhas to be done in the last few days. We have had enough experience of \nknowing that many times those things don't turn out as well as they \nshould.\n  I am hopeful we will deal with these things with as much time and \nknowledge and opportunity to participate as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/10/senate-section/article/S12764-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12764-S12768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAGRICULTURE, CONSERVATION, AND RURAL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the bill before the Senate now is the \ncommittee-reported farm bill, a 5-year farm bill. It is a comprehensive \nbill providing major improvements to the farm commodity and income \nprotection programs, conservation, rural economic development, trade, \nresearch, nutrition assistance, renewable energy, credit, and forestry.\n  The legislation is within our budget limitations for the new farm \nbill. We were allowed $7.35 billion for fiscal year 2002, and $73.5 \nbillion for 10 years above baseline spending. The bill is fully within \nthose limitations. I hope we can move forward and work our way through \nthis bill. We are, of course, ready to consider amendments tomorrow and \ndebate the issues and pass the bill, go to conference, and send it to \nthe President. The sooner we can get the amendments debated here and \nvoted on, the sooner we can get to conference.\n  There is a need to move ahead with this bill now. Farmers around the \ncountry need to know what the farm program will be for next year so \nthey can make decisions, arrange their financing, their loans, line up \ntheir input and supplies for next year. It is important for farmers to \nget this legislation passed.\n  It is important for all of America to get this bill passed because, \nas has often been said, it all really does start on the farm. With food \nbeing such a critical commodity for our own people but also in our \ntrade relations, it is necessary that we send clear signals that we are \ngoing to have a meaningful farm program for next year and the year \nbeyond.\n  That is part of the reason. There is another reason why we have to \nmove ahead. That is the area of conservation. Some of the critical \nconservation programs are out of money. The wetlands reserve program, \nthe farmland protection program, and the wildlife habitat incentives \nprogram are out of money now. The longer we wait and delay on the farm \nbill in getting it to the President to get it signed, that means that \nmore and more we will have a backlog of needs in all of those areas of \nconservation.\n\n  The environmental quality incentives program is underfunded and far \nshort of resources that are needed. The bill before us would \nsubstantially increase funding for all of these important conservation \nprograms. However, if we don't pass it soon, the USDA will not be able \nto carry out effective programs during the present fiscal year.\n  In addition, this bill will provide important and immediate help in \nthe areas of rural economic development, trade, and research, as I \nmentioned. We need to move ahead without delay.\n  I will take the time now to discuss some of the principal features of \nthe bill. In order to proceed to the bill, tomorrow I will be offering \na substitute amendment that will include modifications to the dairy and \nconservation provisions of the legislation reported from the committee. \nThat will be an amendment in the nature of a substitute. Hopefully, \nthere won't be any objections to that, and then we will move ahead with \namendments to that as the underlying bill on the floor.\n  First, title 1 on commodities, the bill continues direct payments but \nadds countercyclical contract payments to assure that in the years of \nlow prices, producers will receive additional support. The bill \nestablishes income protection prices for each of the contract \ncommodities. If the price for the commodity plus the direct payment for \nthe year falls below the income protection price, producers would \nreceive a countercyclical payment to make up the difference. For the \nfirst 2 years, the direct payments would be generous enough that there \nwill be no countercyclical payments. For the third, fourth, and fifth \nyears, the direct payments will be lower but the difference would be \nmade up by the countercyclical payments in those years.\n  Quite frankly, this was really the goal of the Freedom to Farm bill \nthat was passed in 1996. That would be direct payments; that those \npayments would phase down at some point. As we saw because of low \nprices, world conditions, other conditions, the Congress had to come in \nyear after year after year and pass emergency funding legislation for \ndirect payments and to add to those direct payments.\n  What we should have had at the start was a countercyclical program so \nthat in times when prices are good, you don't need all those direct \npayments. But when prices are low, that is when you need to come back \nin.\n  When Freedom to Farm first passed, there were farmers who, quite \nfrankly, had a pretty darn good year and prices were high, but they got \na direct payment anyway. That didn't seem to make very good economic \nsense or policy sense. So I understand that we can't pull the plug \nright now. We continue the direct payments. They start to go down, but \nin place we have the countercyclical payments that come in in case \nprices are low; we all hope prices stay high. But in case they do go \ndown, we do have the countercyclical program. We also attempt to have \nadditional countercyclical support through the loan program.\n  Our bill raises loans for every commodity with one exception, extra \nlong staple cotton, which was held constant, and for soybeans, which we \nreduce from $5.26 a bushel to $5.20 a bushel. Again, all of this was an \nattempt to balance loan rates so that one would not be encouraged to \nplant one crop over another to plant for the loan benefits.\n\n  For other crops, the loan programs have discouraged planting of some \ncrops, such as barley, oats, dried peas, and lentils. Those crops \nreceived better treatment in this bill, including a loan rate boost for \nfeed grains other than corn and a new loan program for dry peas, \nlentils, and chickpeas.\n  The bill gives producers the option of retaining their current \ncontract acres and adding oilseeds or updating their contract acres and \npayment yields.\n  They will be given choice. Farmers can upgrade their base acres in \nyields or they can remain with the ones they have. Farmers who have \ntaken advantage of flexibility to switch to other crops will not lose \nbase acres. Those who are of fewer acres covered by the current \nproduction flexibility contract will be able to update those acres and \ntheir payment yields.\n  In the area of dairy, the bill includes supplemental income \nassistance payments for dairy farmers. That is a system of payments \ndesigned to assist providers in the northeast part of the country that \nwill help compensate for them getting out of and off of the Northeast \nDairy Compact. In addition, there is a national dairy payment program \nfor the remainder of the country. I might add that earlier on in the \nday the Senator from New Mexico was talking about a national tax and a \npayment by dairy farmers. That is not in the substitute bill that I \nwill be offering tomorrow. I hope those who looked at the earlier \nversion will look at the substitute because that taxing provision is \nnot included.\n  American sugar producers have been facing sugar prices at or near 22-\nyear lows for most of the past 2 years.\n  Our committee bill reestablishes marketing allotments for sugar in an \nattempt to limit domestic production levels that, with imports, will \nnot exceed the demand for sugar for human consumption. The bill also \nprovides the Secretary with the tools she will need to bring sugar \nproduction in line with demand.\n  The committee bill makes a dramatic change in the program for peanut \nproducers to bring it more in line with other commodity programs. The \nbill abolishes marketing quotas. That has been a staple of peanuts ever \nsince I have been here--for the last 27 years. It establishes a new \nsystem of peanut base acres and payment yields. The new program creates \na safety net for producers in the form of marketing loans, direct \npayments, and countercyclical supports. So basically, the\n\n[[Page S12765]]\n\npeanut program will be phased out and the new one will be phased in and \nit will be similar to other commodity programs.\n  Finally, the commodity title provides for higher levels of purchases \nof fruits and vegetables for distribution through the important \nnutrition programs such as the National School Lunch Program and the \nEmergency Food Assistance Program.\n  Next, dealing with title II, conservation, in addition to producing \nfood and fiber, America's farmers and ranchers are also our stewards, \nplaying a critical role in protecting natural resources for future \ngenerations. This new farm bill recognizes that conservation is a \ncornerstone of sound farm policy. It will greatly increase our \ncommitment to helping agricultural producers and landowners to protect \nand conserve soil, water, air, and wildlife--especially on land that is \nin production.\n  Senator Lugar and I, and many members of the committee, share a \nlongstanding view that the new farm bill should place a larger and much \ngreater emphasis on conservation.\n  Over the past months, we and our staffers have worked together to \ndevelop the conservation title reported out of committee.\n  I point out that this title was reported unanimously out of committee \nbecause it reflects good policy that helps the full array of producers \nrepresented in the committee and in the Senate. The substitute I will \nbe offering will build on the committee's conservation title and will \nadd about $1 billion more in conservation funding to focus additional \nfunding in the 5 years covered by the bill.\n  The conservation title basically doubles our funding for conservation \nby adding $21.5 billion to baseline spending for conservation programs, \nfor a total of $43 billion over 10 years. We basically double funding \nfor conservation.\n  Our bill also brings balance to spending on land retirement programs \nsuch as the Conservation Reserve Program and the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram, balancing that with programs for working lands such as the \nConservation Security Program, EQIP, and the Wildlife Habitat \nIncentives Program.\n  Our bill will establish a new incentive payment program and the \nConservation Security Program, which will both improve farm income and \nincrease agricultural conservation. This program adopts a \ncomprehensive, inclusive national approach to conservation on working \nlands. It provides incentive payments to farmers and ranchers who \nvoluntarily maintain and adopt conservation practices that are \nappropriate for the local areas and each individual operation. In this \nway, we not only retain the conservation achievements of the past, but \nwe encourage increased conservation in the future.\n  Again, I point out that the conservation and security program is not \na top-down, one-size-fits-all. It is designed to be geared toward the \nindividual farmers in different parts of the country. What may be good \nfor conservation in West Virginia may not be good in Iowa. This bill \nrecognizes that it has to come really from the bottom up, within \ncertain guidelines, and protecting air, oil, water, and natural \nhabitats. But that is basically what the conservation and security \nprogram is designed to do, to help farmers with their conservation on \nthe land they have in production.\n  The acreage cap for the Conservation Reserve Program has been \nincreased from 36 million acres, the present limit, to 42 million \nacres. The legislation more than doubles the Wetlands Reserve Program. \nIt increases the acreage cap by 1.25 million acres above the current \n1,075,000 acres. There is also an allowance for 25,000 acres annually \nto be enrolled in the Wetland Reserve Enhancement Program.\n  The legislation increases funding for the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, which is important to our livestock producers, up \nto $1.5 billion a year, which is 7 times over the current figure. So in \nthe critical area of helping livestock producers prevent soil runoff, \nwater runoff, polluting rivers, streams, the Chesapeake Bay, and in \nother areas, we increase that program 7 times more than what it is \nright now. Contract amounts have been increased to $150,000, with a \n$50,000 maximum being earned in any year of the 3- to 10-year contract.\n  Our bill provides for 10 times more funding over the next 5 years for \nthe Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program than was provided in the last \nfarm bill. We go from $50 million to $500 million in that area.\n  More funding will be provided over the next 5 years for the Farmland \nProtection Program. This program allows for farmland and the \nenvironmental benefits of this land use to be preserved for future \ngenerations. The last farm bill allocated $35 million for the Farmland \nProtection Program. Our bill increased that amount to $1.75 billion.\n  A new Grassland Reserve Program to purchase permanent and long-term \neasements on 2 million acres of grasslands is also included in the \nlegislation. This program will offer long-term easements, technical \nassistance, and restoration costs to restore or keep private lands in \nnative grasses.\n  The legislation provides additional new programs besides the \nGrassland Reserve Program. The Water Risk Reduction Program provides \nfor purchase of flood plain easements that retard runoff, prevent soil \nerosion, and safeguards life and property from floods. The Great Lakes \nBasin Program for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control will provide \ndemonstration grants, technical assistance, and carry out information \nand education programs to improve water quality in the Great Lakes.\n  As chairman, I am proud that we have developed a strong, balanced \nproposal that greatly strengthens our commitment to conservation as an \nintegral part and cornerstone of our agricultural policy. The \nconservation title represents a real win for farmers, landowners, and \nfor all Americans who have a vital interest in conserving and \nprotecting our natural resources.\n  The trade title was put together on a consensus basis in the \ncommittee. It was reported out, also, on a unanimous vote. This should \ngo a long way toward improving existing export and food aid programs. \nWe have seen that export markets do not serve as a reliable safety net \nin and of themselves. But trade is and will continue to be a key outlet \nfor U.S. agricultural products.\n\n  Over the last few decades, the U.S. agricultural economy has derived \nbetween 20 and 30 percent of its gross income from exports. United \nStates agricultural exports have exceeded U.S. agricultural imports \nsince the late 1950s, generating a surplus in U.S. agricultural trade--\nI might add, helping our overall balance of trade. So our trade title \nprovides about $2 billion above baseline over the 10-year period, \nroughly split between the commercial export programs and the food aid \nprograms. The bill more than doubles existing funding for the Market \nAccess Program, ramping up to $190 million annually by the end of the \n5-year bill. We also put additional resources into the Foreign Market \nDevelopment Program, which helps our agricultural groups serve \ncustomers in overseas markets.\n  The Supplier Credit Program allows short-term loans to be made \ndirectly to importers rather than through a bank intermediary. We allow \nthe length of the loan to be extended from 6 to 12 months.\n  There is also a strong demand for resources to help educate children \nin the developing world. The United Nations World Food Program believes \nthat there are some 300 million children worldwide who are not \nreceiving an education due to economic hardships faced by their \nfamilies. With a desire to address that issue, our bill establishes and \nfunds the International Food for Education and Nutrition Program, \nwithin or under the banner or heading of the Food for Progress Statute. \nThis proposal was introduced last year by former Senators Dole and \nMcGovern, long-time advocates of domestic and international feeding \nprograms.\n  The shorthand phrase for this really is the ``international school \nlunch program.'' We are trying to develop in emerging nations, in \nnations that have a need for this, the low-income places, a school \nlunch program so that families would see that as a benefit to send \ntheir kids to school. Right now, a lot of families in Third World \ncountries send their children out to work as an additional income to \nthe family. In the United States, giving a free meal to someone may not \nbe that big a deal since we spend less than 10 percent of our income on \nfood. But in poorer parts of the world, they are spending 60 to 70\n\n[[Page S12766]]\n\npercent or more of their disposable income on food. If we can give a \nfree school lunch to a child and maybe give them something to take \nhome, it will not take long for that family to figure out that is a big \naddition to the family income. It will serve to not only increase \nnutritional benefits of kids but also serve as a magnet to get them out \nof the workplace and into schools.\n\n  The trade title also provides more resources for the Food for \nProgress program and reforms and streamlines the operations for all \nfood aid programs run by USDA and the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment. The bill makes it easier in a number of ways for groups \nsuch as Save the Children, CARE, and Catholic Relief Services, who run \nmany food aid projects overseas, to do their jobs while still \npermitting USDA and USAID to monitor them effectively.\n  Finally, this title also addresses the access of United States \nagricultural exports to Cuba. While Cuba remains a cash-poor economy, \nit imports a substantial share of its food, with an average value of \n$660 million annually over the last few years. In particular, it is a \nsignificant buyer of rice, and prior to imposition of sanctions in the \n1960s, Cuba was the single largest market for United States rice.\n  A February 2001 report by the U.S. International Trade Commission \nestimates that if we did not have the sanctions on Cuba, Cuba could buy \nas much as 400,000 tons of wheat, 300,000 tons of rice, and 500,000 \ntons of feed grains from the United States.\n  The Commission estimates that U.S. exports to that country could \nreach about $400 million annually. By eliminating, as we do, the \nrestriction on private financing of sales of food and medicine in \ncurrent law, the bill permits U.S. exporters to begin to access this \nmarket. Again, there would be no U.S. Government funds involved. This \nwould all be through the private sector. If the private sector wants to \nfinance these sales, let them do it. It would be a heck of a good \nmarket for producers in this country.\n  Next, title IV, our nutrition title. Again, in this title we are \ntalking about something that affects all of America, rural and urban \nalike. In October, we lost 415,000 jobs in America. The unemployment \nrate jumped to 5.4 percent. It did that in September, the largest 1-\nmonth jump in 21 years. We are facing a recession this winter. We do \nnot know how long it is going to last. Of course, we hope it is not \ngoing to last long, but we do not know.\n  One of the best underpinnings for families who are out of work in \nAmerica, who are looking for employment, facing some tough times, is a \nprogram that has proven its worth year after year, and that is the Food \nStamp Program. Along with unemployment insurance, it is the vital part \nof our front-line defense against recession.\n  If we are talking about a stimulus package, which we talked about \nearlier today and about which we will be hearing more, this is \nstimulus, making sure that those who are out of work and are seeking \nemployment have the nutrition they and their children need.\n  It is a travesty that although we have the safest, most abundant food \nsupply in the world--hunger in America has also been reduced in the \nlast 30 years--still 10 percent of America's households face the \npossibility that they will worry about or actually not have enough food \nto eat.\n  The people who are going hungry include the working poor, single \nworking mothers with children, seniors forced to choose between paying \nfor food and paying for prescription medicine, and families forced each \nwinter to choose between heating and eating. With the current economic \ndownturn, we can only expect the situation to worsen.\n  At this time it is all the more critical that we strengthen our \nNation's nutrition safety net. Part of that safety net, as I said, \nincludes the Food Stamp Program, which is one of the most effective and \nefficient ways to help low-income families, the elderly, and the \ndisabled. It is our Nation's largest child nutrition program since 50 \npercent of Food Stamp Program participants are children. In addition, \nfully 9 out of every 10 food stamp households include a senior, a \ndisabled person, or a child.\n  Our bill provides $6.2 billion over 10 years for improvements in the \nFood Stamp Program. It includes several eligibility and benefit \nimprovements, as well as important simplifications to improve the \naccess of working families to the program.\n  Provisions in the bill accomplish three key goals:\n  First, to strengthen the program to help people more successfully \ntransition from welfare to work and to help shield low-wage working \nfamilies from the recession, this legislation extends the period of \ntime that a former welfare recipient is able to participate in the Food \nStamp Program without having to fill out any extra paperwork and \nreapply from 3 months to 6 months.\n  Second, it extends the period of time that able-bodied adults without \ndependents may participate in the Food Stamp Program to allow time for \nthem to find and keep a job.\n  To simplify the program and to lighten the administrative burden and \navoid excluding people who qualify for the program, the bill has a \nnumber of bipartisan provisions that would simplify the program in \nareas such as income and resource counting, assessment of expenses for \ndeductions, and determination of ongoing eligibility.\n  We cut the redtape in the program and increase coordination between \nother programs, such as Medicaid and Temporary Assistance to Needy \nFamilies, the TANF program. This is so people do not have to apply for \nMedicaid, then apply for temporary assistance, and then apply for food \nstamps. We are trying to wrap it into a one-stop-shopping concept.\n  A third key goal is to make a concerted effort to reach all children \nwho are poor and for whom a proper diet is particularly crucial. It \nincludes a provision that modestly increases benefits for larger size \nfamilies with children and restores food stamp benefits to all poor \nlegal immigrant children.\n  The credit title reauthorizes all current direct and guaranteed USDA \nfarm loan programs, and it focuses on providing more credit \nopportunities for beginning farmers and ranchers.\n  The title also includes other facets of the USDA farm lending \nprograms, for example, by making the interest rate reduction program \npermanent and providing that reduced paperwork requirements be \navailable to more farmers. To address the credit needs of farmers in \nthis time of sustained low commodity prices, the title expands the time \nof eligibility for direct operating loans from 7 years to 9 years.\n  In the area of rural development, title VI, this bill will make a \nreal difference in economic and community development in rural America.\n  Rural communities have many advantages, but a lot of the time they \nhave not shared in our country's prosperity. For too long, they have \nlagged behind. Rural America needs facilities and services that meet \nthe standards of 21st century America, from basic services, such as \nsewer and water, to the basic services we need to compete and live in \nthe 21st century, such as broadband Internet access. Without them, the \nquality of life in rural communities will be impaired and businesses \nwill not thrive.\n  One of the largest problems facing rural businesses is the lack of \nadequate equity capital at competitive rates. While many rural \nbusinesses are not directly associated with agriculture, ventures to \nincrease the value of agricultural commodities in rural areas are a \ngreat potential as an engine for growth. If these value-added \nenterprises are largely owned by agricultural producers or co-ops, \nthere is a double benefit of economic growth and increased farm income.\n  These are some of the key goals for rural development that our \ncommittee has been working toward. I will just mention a few of the key \nprovisions.\n  We fund a new program called the Rural Business Investment Program \nand a bold new program called the National Rural Cooperative and \nBusiness Equity Fund. We provide substantial funding for value-added \nagricultural product market development grants to help develop solid \nnew enterprises owned by agricultural producers in rural areas.\n  We improve the business and industry loan guarantee program and \nestablish a new way to fund the Rural Economic Development Grant and \nLoan Program.\n  To help smaller communities, the title applies $100 million a year \nfor broadband Internet access.\n  We also provide funding for firefighting and first responder training\n\n[[Page S12767]]\n\nand include a program to clear the large backlog in the USDA sewer and \nwater and community facility program.\n  In title VII, the research title, the central purpose of the farm \nbill is to ensure the security and vitality of our food and \nagricultural system in rural communities. Research plays a vital but \noften unappreciated role in accomplishing this.\n  The fact that resources devoted to agricultural research have been \ninsufficient to keep pace with the increasing needs of farms and rural \ncommunities has been of great concern to many in the agricultural \ncommunity.\n  However, this private sector funding is mostly targeted toward \naddressing the needs of production agriculture, leaving the needs of \nmany other sectors of the agricultural and rural sector unaddressed. \nThe only way to meet these unfulfilled needs is through allocating a \nportion of the funds given to the committee to research programs. \nTherefore, we increase funding for the Initiative for Future \nAgricultural and Food Systems to $145 million a year.\n  We also provide $15 million a year in funding for a competitive \ngrants program focused on rural policy research. This program will \nprovide research grants on topics such as rural sociology; effects of \ndemographic change; needs of groups of rural citizens; rural community \ndevelopment; rural infrastructure; rural health; rural education; rural \nextension programs, all of these in a policy research program.\n  The changing nature of agriculture has created a great need for \nfarmers and ranchers to be able to utilize a wide range of tools such \nas risk management, precision farming, crop protection, and business \nplanning. The bill provides $15 million a year for a competitive grants \nprogram focused on providing beginning farmers and ranchers the \ninformation and the support they need to acquire the kind of knowledge \nthey may not heretofore have received.\n  The end of the cold war, along with recent tragic terrorist attacks \nin America, have focused national attention on our vulnerability to \nbiological and chemical terrorism. Agriculture is widely considered to \nbe a vulnerable target for bioterrorism. The committee has therefore \nincluded in this title several new authorizations to bolster the \nFederal Government's biosecurity planning and response capabilities.\n  Title VIII is the forestry title. We include a sustainable forest \nmanagement program to provide forest landowners and States assistance \nto meet multiple resource objectives on private forest lands. Funds may \nalso be used for conservation easements to maintain forest cover and \nprotect important forest values. The title also contains an initiative \nto help establish private forest landowner sustainable forestry \ncooperatives.\n  Title IX, the energy title, is a new title. This has never been in \nthe farm bill before. It is not in the House bill, but I am hopeful the \nHouse will accept it. It was unanimously adopted by our committee. We \ncreate a number of initiatives to develop new uses and markets for \nagricultural products and renewable energy, including biofuels such as \nethanol and biodiesel, biomass, wind, and solar energy.\n  We include a grant and loan program to help establish farmer-owned \nrenewable energy businesses to market electricity. There is also a \ngrant and loan program to provide financing assistance to farmers so \nthey can purchase renewable energy systems such as wind turbines, solar \nheat pumps, solar energy, solar electricity or solar water, methane \ndigesters, and to make energy efficiency improvements.\n\n  Another program bolsters the development of bio-refineries to convert \nbiomass and agricultural wastes into fuels, chemicals, and power. I \nbelieve that renewable energy will become a major cash crop for \nfarmers, ranchers, and rural communities across the country in the \ncoming years. We can provide new income streams for our producers, \nenhance rural economic development, make environmental and public \nhealth gains by reducing pollution, and increase our Nation's energy \nsecurity. Promoting renewable energy as part of this bill will also \nchange the way we think about agriculture.\n  I truly believe we can produce just about anything from corn, \nsoybeans, and other agricultural products that we can produce from oil. \nThe energy title will bring us a significant step closer to that end.\n  I have in my office--the office I cannot get to right now, but \nhopefully we will get back to our offices sometime pretty soon--a \npicture that was taken in 1939, the year I was born. It is an original \npicture of Henry Ford. He has a baseball bat and he is hitting the \ntrunk of a car, a 1939 Ford, with the baseball bat.\n  This was a demonstration for the press on what Henry Ford considered \nto be the car of the future. He predicted at that time cars of the \nfuture would be made out of soybeans, and the trunk of the car was made \nfrom soybeans. So he was hitting the trunk with the baseball bat to \nshow it would not dent, it would not crack, and the baseball bat just \nbounced right off. So Henry Ford had predicted all of the things that \nwere in a car made from petroleum products would very shortly be made \nfrom soybeans.\n  The war came, and we needed to ramp up our petrochemical industries. \nWe needed petroleum for the war effort. The United States spent \ntrillions of dollars in World War II. We spent a lot of taxpayer money \ndeveloping the oil industry in this country and enhancing the \npetrochemical industry of this country.\n  After it was developed after World War II, it was obviously then much \ncheaper to make all of these things from oil, to make plastics out of \npetrochemicals, than it was to make it from our agricultural produce.\n  I think the time has come to start turning that corner back again, to \nrecognize all of the things that go into an automobile today that are \nmade from petroleum-based chemicals and plastics can indeed be made \nfrom--well, it does not have to be soybeans. It can be a lot of other \ndifferent types of agricultural products. All the steering wheels, all \nthe plastic, all of the stuff that goes in a car can, indeed, be made \nfrom soybeans.\n  This title of this bill is to begin that process of ensuring we can \nstart making more and more of our products for automobiles and for \nother items from agricultural-based entities rather than from \npetroleum.\n  So this energy title is one of the most exciting efforts we have ever \nundertaken in the farm bill. There are a lot of initiatives: wind \nenergy, for example. We can produce a lot of wind energy in this \ncountry, so we provide grants and loans to farmers and ranchers to buy \nand put up windmills.\n  One might say, what does that have to do with agriculture? The fact \nis if we are going to build windmills to make electricity, we are not \ngoing to build them in the cities. They are going to have to be built \nin rural areas. They are going to have to be built where we have farms \nand ranches. I think this would be a source of income for farmers, plus \nit would add to the national grid the help from electricity. Biomass, \nmethane production--there is an ethanol plant in Kansas right now that \nis producing ethanol and their entire heat source comes from good old \nmethane. So there is a lot of it, it seems to me, we can begin doing. I \nthink this is one of the most exciting parts of the farm bill.\n  Those really are, in a nutshell, the different titles of the farm \nbill. As I said, every title of this farm bill was voted unanimously in \nour committee, with one exception, and that is the commodity title.\n  I understand that people have different ideas on commodities, but \nwhat we tried to do in the commodity title was to provide a balance so \nthat one part of the country was not getting an undue amount of money \nover another. We tried to keep the commodities in balance so a farmer \nwould not be encouraged to plant one crop over another; that they truly \ncould plant for the market and not because one had a higher loan rate \nthan another, that type of thing. So we spent a great deal of time \nworking to balance it, and we did come out of the committee with a \nbipartisan vote. It was not unanimous. I admit it was not a unanimous \nvote on the commodities title, but it is a measure of how much work \nthis committee did--I do not mean just this member but Democrats and \nRepublicans did--on this bill. Every single title got a unanimous vote, \nas I said, with the exception of commodities, and I believe we will be \nable to work that out.\n  I have not seen it yet, but I guess Senator Roberts and Senator \nCochran\n\n[[Page S12768]]\n\nwill be offering an amendment on the commodities title to change it. We \nwill have a debate on that. I have not seen it, so I cannot debate it. \nWe will look at it. We will consider it.\n\n  Now, Senator Roberts and Senator Cochran offered an amendment in \ncommittee. That approach was turned down. Whether or not this amendment \nwill be the same, I don't know. I have heard it will be changed, but I \nhave not seen it. We certainly will debate it. I hope we have a \nreasonable time limit on debate. I hope we don't drag this out longer \nthan necessary. All who have been on the committee understand the \ndifferent aspects of our commodity programs. I don't think it will take \na huge amount of time to debate.\n  I believe we have a good, sound farm bill that is in the interests of \nall Americans--not just one area, not just one group, but all of \nAmerica. I believe some of the things we have done in conservation, \nwhich is the cornerstone of this bill, are charting a new path for our \nfarmers, a way where they can actually receive income because they are \nbeing good stewards of the land. I believe the new energy title will go \na long way to helping make the United States more energy independent in \nthe future.\n  The new rural equity fund we have set up is going to help bring \nbusiness, provide the kind of venture capital we need. The money we \nprovide for broadband access to our small towns and communities can be \nthe highway to the new technologies so businesses can locate there.\n  All in all, it is a good farm bill. Is everything in it exactly as I \nwould like it? Probably not; I would probably make some things \ndifferent. But everything of this nature represents compromise and \nconsensus. It came out on a bipartisan vote. All titles except one were \nunanimously approved. It represents a good compromise, a good \nconsensus, a good balance between interests. That is why we are here--\nto work across party lines, to try to work together, knowing I can't \nhave my way all the time and you can't have your way all the time, but \ntogether we work these things out. That is what we have done in the \nfarm bill.\n  I know we will not have votes today, but I hope tomorrow when we come \nin we can proceed on amendments. I hope we can have some time limits. I \nhope the other side will agree. We tried to get an agreement earlier \ntoday to say that at some point tomorrow afternoon all first-degree \namendments would have to be filed. That was objected to. We will \nrevisit that tomorrow and perhaps reach an agreement. With healthy \ndebate and amendments tomorrow, and perhaps Wednesday, we should be \nable to finish this bill sometime on Wednesday. I see no reason at all \nto carry it any further than that, and that is with meaningful debate \non amendments.\n  I encourage all Senators who have amendments on the farm bill to \nplease get them filed so we can look at how many there are and perhaps \nreach an agreement on time limits to get this bill out of here by \nsometime late Wednesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rockefeller).

Madam President, this past Saturday, the University of \nNorth Dakota's Fighting Sioux won the division II national championship \nfootball game. Anyone who watched that game on ESPN marveled at the \ngame itself. It was one of the most exciting football games I have ever \nwatched. It was decided in the last couple of seconds. The two teams \nplayed wonderful football. They played Grand Valley State of Michigan \nin division II. Grand Valley State had a 14-to-10 lead with just over 2 \nminutes left. The University of North Dakota actually had a fourth down \nwith 50 seconds or so left at about the 41-yard line. It didn't look \ngood. With 60 yards to the goal line, they passed and went down to the \n1-yard line. And they drove it in.\n  It was one of the most exciting finishes I have ever seen.\n  As an alumnus of the University of North Dakota, I wanted to \ncongratulate the coach and the team and say how proud we are of the \ndivision II football champions.\n  We have been national champions in division I in hockey many times. \nWe won our national championship in women's basketball, and now in \ndivision II football.\n  The University of North Dakota Sioux had a wonderful day on Saturday. \nI congratulate these young men who made all of North Dakota proud. And \nI congratulate their coach.\n  As a graduate of the University of North Dakota, I am enormously \nproud of what they have done.\n  To recap, rare are the athletic programs that can claim the \nextraordinary success that the University of North Dakota has had over \nthe last year: It has played national championship games in hockey, \nwomen's basketball and, on just this Saturday, football.\n  As a graduate, I'm pleased to be able to announce here on the Senate \nfloor today that the University of North Dakota Fighting Sioux won that \nnational Division II championship football game. And they did so in \ntruly epic fashion, coming from behind in the final seconds.\n  Their opponent, Grand Valley State of Michigan, had taken a 14-10 \nlead with less than three minutes to play. After taking the ensuing \nkickoff, UND appeared to have stalled on their own 41 yard line where \nit was fourth down and four yards to go. But receiver Luke Schleusner \ncaught a short pass from quarterback Kelby Klosterman, slipped what \nappeared to initially be a sure tackle, and ran 58 yards to within \ninches of the goal line. On the next play, with just 29 seconds left, \nJed Perkerewicz darted across. It was an electrifying conclusion that \nmarks the Sioux's first national football championship.\n  As an alum, I have a special affection for the University and am \nenormously\n\n[[Page S12769]]\n\nproud of its distinguished and remarkable achievements in athletics, \nresearch, and academics.\n  Saturday's dramatic football victory fills the alumni, staff, \nstudents and friends of the university with understandable pride. And, \nimportantly, our entire state of North Dakota shares the pride in this \nmemorable triumph.\n  And so I salute the school's administration, athletic program, \nfootball staff--led by coach Dale Lennon, and, most importantly, the \nyoung men of the University of North Dakota football team. The hard \nwork, the long hours, and the pain have paid off. We can all learn \nimportant lessons about life from these champions--lessons about \nperseverance, about working together and helping each other, about \nbeing a good sport.\n  In fact, one of the images from the game that's brightest in my mind \nis how the members of the Sioux team were repeatedly helping their \nopponents up off the turf and patting them on the back in an \nencouraging way it was an admirable display of sportsmanship.\n  These scholar-athletes play football because they love the game and, \nin the process, serve as role models for youngsters. In fact, they can \nserve as role models for the adults of this world.\n  And we can savor the feeling of having national champions in our \nmidst. My congratulations to a truly superb team.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/10/senate-section/article/S12769-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AMTRAK AMENDMENT ON DOD APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, John O'Sullivan is one of the wisest \nmen I know. Advisor to Margaret Thatcher, editor of National Review and \nauthor of political commentary here and abroad, O'Sullivan has been \nconcerned for years about the future of Western civilization in general \nand the United States in particular.\n  In the December 17, 2001 issue of National Review, he weaves together \nideas of John Fonte of the Hudson Institute, Samuel Huntington and \nJames Burnham to elaborate on his theme that our civilization is under \nfundamental assault from modern liberalism, what he calls an ``anti-\nWestern impulse'' assaulting ``the institutions invented by classical \nand constitutional liberalism in its great creative phase, not merely \nthe free market, but also individual rights, free scientific inquiry, \nfree speech, the rule of law, majority rule, democratic accountability, \nand national sovereignty.''\n  Skeptical? Then I challenge you to read what follows: ``Safe for \nDemocracy, and a Nation--The idea of this country post-9/11.'' It is \nthe best statement I've seen of the challenges we face from what Fonte \ncalls ``trans-national progressivism.''\n  I ask that the commentary be printed in the Record.\n  The commentary follows.\n\n               [From the National Review, Dec. 17, 2001]\n\n  Safe for Democracy, and a Nation--The Idea of This Country Post-9/11\n\n                          (By John O'Sullivan)\n\n       One of the difficulties bedeviling political science is the \n     protean nature of political words. As Robert Schuettinger \n     pointed out in his study of European conservatism, the phrase \n     ``a conservative socialist'' could mean a hardline Stalinist, \n     a social-democratic revisionist, or merely a socialist who \n     dressed and acted in a modest, inconspicuous way. When words \n     like ``conservative'' and ``liberal'' are being used, context \n     is all. So the theme of this article is advertised in neon \n     when I begin with the definitions of these philosophies \n     advanced by two distinguished American political theorists: \n     Samuel Huntington and James Burnham.\n       Writing in The American Political Science Review in 1957, \n     Huntington defined conservatism as that system of ideas \n     employed to defend established institutions when they come \n     under fundamental attack. As Huntington himself put it: \n     ``When the foundations of society are threatened, the \n     conservative ideology reminds men of the necessity of some \n     institutions and the desirability of the existing ones.''\n       And in his 1964 book, The Suicide of the West, James \n     Burnham described liberalism as ``the ideology of Western \n     suicide''--not exactly that liberalism caused that suicide; \n     more that it reconciled the West to its slow dissolution. \n     Again, as Burnham himself put it: ``It is as if a man, struck \n     with a mortal disease, were able to say and to believe, as \n     the flush of the fever spread over his face, `Ah, the glow of \n     health returning' . . . If Western civilization is wholly \n     vanquished . . . we or our children will be able to see that \n     ending, by the light of the principles of liberalism, not as \n     a final defeat, but as the transition to a new and higher \n     order in which mankind as a whole joins in a universal \n     civilization that has risen above the parochial distinctions, \n     divisions, and discriminations of the past.''\n       If we put these two quotations together, the function of \n     contemporary conservatism becomes clear: to defend the \n     institutions of Western civilization, in their distinct \n     American form, against a series of fundamental assaults \n     carried out in the name of liberalism and either advocated or \n     excused by people calling themselves liberals.\n       To say that liberalism advances Western suicide, of course, \n     is to say something controversial--but something much less \n     controversial than when Burnham wrote forty years ago. When \n     Ivy League students from mobs chanting ``Hey, hey, ho, ho, \n     Western Civ has got to go,'' when their professors happily \n     edit the classics of Western thought out of their curricula, \n     and when the politicians preside happily over a multicultural \n     rewriting of America's history that denies or downplays its \n     Western roots, no one can plausibly deny that an anti-\n     Western impulse is working itself out.\n       This liberal revolution is an assault on the institutions \n     invented by classical and constitutional liberalism in its \n     great creative phase--not merely the free market, but also \n     individual rights, free scientific inquiry, free speech, the \n     rule of law, majority rule, democratic accountability, and \n     national sovereignty. It promises, of course, not to abolish \n     these liberal institutions so much as to ``transcend'' them \n     or to give them ``real substance'' rather than mere formal \n     expression. In reality, however, they are abolished, and \n     replaced by different institutions derived from a different \n     political philosophy. John Fonte of the Hudson Institute has \n     mapped out the contours of this revolution in a series of \n     important essays, and most importantly in ``Liberal Democracy \n     vs. Transnational Progressivism.'' What follows in the next \n     few paragraphs borrows heavily from his work, though the \n     formulations are mine. Among the more important changes \n     advanced by transnational proressivism (as I shall here \n     follow Fonte in calling it) are:\n       One: The replacement of individual identities and rights by \n     group identities and rights. Race and gender quotas are the \n     most obvious expression of this concept, but its implications \n     run much furthher--suggesting, for instance, that groups as \n     such have opinions or, in the jargon, ``perspectives.'' \n     Individuals who express opinions that run counter to the \n     perspectives of their group, therefore, cannot really \n     represent the group.\n\n[[Page S12770]]\n\n       Two: An attack upon majority rule as the main mechanism of \n     democratic government. Majority rule, its opponents contend, \n     gives insufficient weight to minority or ``victim'' groups, \n     and should be replaced by a power-sharing arrangement among \n     different groups. This ambitious concept has not been totally \n     enacted anywhere, but steps towards it have been taken. The \n     Voting Rights Act, for example, requires that election \n     districts be drawn in such a way as to ensure specific racial \n     outcomes; and some European nations have recently introduced \n     laws requiring political parties to ensure that a given \n     percentage of their election candidates are women.\n       Three: Transferring power from political institutions \n     directly accountable to the voters, such as Congress, to \n     judges, bureaucratic agencies, and international \n     organizations outside the control of the voters. Originally, \n     this transfer of power required the consent of the elected \n     bodies; increasingly, however, judges interpret international \n     law, including treaties that have not been ratified or that \n     have been greatly expanded in scope since ratification, as \n     overriding domestic law. This process, still in its nervous \n     infancy in the U.S., is far advanced in the European Union--\n     where the courts have overruled national legislatures on \n     issues as different as territorial fishing rights and the \n     right of soldiers to become pregnant. If allowed to continue, \n     this trend must first erode and eventually render obsolete \n     both national sovereignty and self-government.\n       Four: De-constructing and re-constructing the self-\n     understanding of America. Every nation has a sense of itself \n     and its history that is embedded in a national narrative \n     marked by heroic episodes. In this traditional narrative, \n     America is the progressive universalization of English \n     civilization--Magna Carta expanded to accommodate slaves, and \n     later immigrants, and enriched by the cultures they brought \n     with them. It is therefore a branch of a branch of Western \n     civilization; but multiculturalism seeks to undermine this \n     self-understanding and to replace it with an entirely \n     different narrative, in which America is seen as a \n     ``convergence'' of European, African, and Amerindian \n     civilizations (and therefore the natural basis for a \n     political system based on group identities and rights). \n     This re-constructionist impulse has become the orthodoxy \n     in many public schools.\n       Five: Re-constructing the people by mass immigration from \n     other cultures. As long as new immigrants are assimilated \n     into the existing nation, no problem arises; if assimilation \n     fails to occur, the nation is gradually dissolved into a \n     Babel of different cultural groups with conflicting \n     allegiances. Under existing law, however, assimilation is not \n     only made difficult by the sheer numbers of people arriving, \n     it is also discouraged by official policies of \n     multiculturalism and bilingualism.\n       Six: Divorcing citizenship from nationality and bestowing \n     the rights of citizens--including the right to vote--on all \n     residents in the nation, including illegal immigrants. \n     According to this theory, citizenship should be carried on an \n     immigrant's back to whichever nation he manages to sneak \n     into. If seriously implemented in law, it would transform \n     nations into mere places of residence; the symbol of this \n     kind of citizenship is Mohamed Atta, the hijacker who \n     destroyed the World Trade Center.\n       In the post-national world Fonte described, nations are no \n     longer peoples united by a common history and culture, and \n     ``the mystic chords of memory''; they are simply the varied \n     inhabitants of an arbitrary piece of real estate. Political \n     authority is no longer constitutionally limited and located \n     in particular national institutions; it is diffuse, and \n     scattered among bodies at different levels. Politicians no \n     longer have to take responsibility for hard decisions; they \n     can pass them onto higher organs of unaccountable power. \n     Civic patriotism is no longer the prime civic virtue; it is \n     displaced either downwards, by a narrow ethnic loyalty, or \n     upwards, by a cosmopolitan loyalty to international \n     institutions.\n       But a terrible beauty has not been born. Instead, \n     Leviathan, by dividing itself up into several spheres, has \n     slipped free of constitutional restraints and popular \n     control. For the ordinary voter the world has become a \n     mysterious place, far more difficult to navigate, let alone \n     control. For political elites, it has become a market in \n     power in which bureaucrats, pressure groups, businesses, and \n     international lawyers exchange favors behind a veil of post-\n     national irresponsibility.\n       For years, this progressivist revolution proceeded rapidly, \n     chiefly because the public was paying little or no attention \n     to it. But whenever it emerged into the light of \n     controversy--as when Lani Buiner's nomination led to the \n     revelation that law professors believed in something like \n     John C. Calhoun's ``concurrent majorities''--the public \n     reacted violently against it. The typical lack of public \n     interest was due in part to the GOP's nervous reluctance to \n     raise such issues as racial preferences, bilingual education, \n     or even the International Criminal Court. Although \n     conservatism dictated a principled defense of the \n     Constitution against these attacks, the Republicans backed \n     off. In effect, they went from ignoring such assaults under \n     Reagan, to going along with them quietly under George H. W. \n     Bush; to even embracing some of them with a show of \n     enthusiasm under George W. Bush. If the revolution were to be \n     stopped, the political equivalent of a thunderbolt would be \n     required.\n       To everyone's horror, that thunderbolt was delivered, in \n     the form of the attack on September 11; as everyone agrees, \n     that changed everything. In particular it revealed that \n     America had deep reserves of patriotism and that there was a \n     wide, though not universal, desire for national unity. In one \n     terrifying moment, it created or revived constituencies for a \n     firm assimilationist approach, for tighter immigration \n     policies that protected U.S. security, for a reading of \n     American history as the narrative of a great achievement, and \n     for the celebration of U.S. power against all the recently \n     fashionable follies of post-nationalism. In foreign policy, \n     the Bush administration met this public appetite with a clear \n     declaration of war on terrorism, and a clear military \n     strategy for waging it; it has been rewarded for this with \n     high popular support.\n       In domestic policy, however, it has been largely inert--\n     preferring to constrain liberties internally rather than to \n     strengthen protections against external threats. In the less \n     tangible but vitally important matter of national unity and \n     moral, it has concentrated entirely on (very proper) warnings \n     against anti-Muslim sentiment--but without asking for \n     expressions of loyalty from Muslim leaders or, more \n     generally, asking immigrant communities to make a public \n     commitment of their loyalty to the American nation. That is a \n     profound mistake. Most immigrants would be happy to make such \n     a commitment; it is America's cultural elites who would \n     resist it most strongly.\n       But then, they are the shock troops of post-national \n     progressivism; and they would realize that the demand for \n     loyalty would be an unmistakable sign that America had \n     recovered complete confidence in itself, in its own \n     institutions of constitutional democracy, and in its \n     historical mission. Without such a demand, moreover, many \n     decent moderate people might drift idly into the kind of \n     multicultural extremisms that helped shelter the World Trade \n     Center attackers. For, as Americans above all should know, \n     you can't beat something with nothing.\n       This, then, is a moment of great significance and \n     opportunity in American politics. Democracy and the nation-\n     state are the Siamese twins of political theory; democracy \n     rarely survives apart from its twin. Every attempt to create \n     a multicultural democracy either has failed or is deeply \n     troubled. Bush could very reasonably weave a national appeal \n     around the theme of defending American democracy--with equal \n     emphasis on both words. It would resonate strongly with the \n     American majority; command the support of many voters in \n     minority groups; provide the GOP with a raft of popular \n     domestic policies; and attract Democratic constituencies such \n     as patriotic blue-collar workers. and if such an appeal is \n     not make, the progressivist revolution is going to end up \n     winning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/10/senate-section/article/S12770-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12770-S12771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN MEMORY OF JAMES CLOEREN AND JERRY NORTON.\n\n Mr. SARBANES.

Mr. President, I rise today to note the \naccomplishment of the University of North Dakota football team, who on \nSaturday won the NCAA Division II football championship, defeating \nGrand Valley State University of Michigan.\n  It was a nail-biter, and one of the most remarkable, last-minute \ncomebacks in the history of championship football.\n  UND's spectacular defense held the Grand Valley State team to 14 \npoints, but with less than three minutes to play, and 80 yards to go, \nwe were trailing 14-10. A field goal wouldn't do it. We had to drive \nthe length of the field and score a touchdown. It looked as though the \nchampionship would slip from our grasp.\n  Moving the ball out to their 41-yard line, UND faced a crucial \nfourth-down play, needing four yards to keep the drive alive. \nQuarterback Kelby Klosterman linked up with wide receiver Luke \nSchleusner on an incredible 58-yard pass play, landing us on the one-\nyard line. Running back Jed Perkerewicz took the ball the final yard in \nthe last 29 seconds to win the game and the championship for Grand \nForks and North Dakota. It was the first national football title in the \nschool's 105-year history.\n  These were well-matched teams and worthy opponents. Yardage and time \nof possession were very close, almost identical. UND's 80-yard final \ndrive made the difference. Imagine the pressure.\n  Only minutes left on the clock, a national championship at stake, and \nnearly the whole field left to drive. It's a measure of this team's \ngrit and determination that the final drive was marked by two fourth-\ndown conversions. Converting on a fourth down is do or die, fail, and \nit's all over. UND did it not once, but twice. That's a demonstration \nof real character.\n  All of North Dakota is celebrating this tremendous win, but this is \nan especially sweet victory for the people of Grand Forks. They know \nabout comebacks against long odds. After the floods of 1997 all but \ndestroyed the town, and badly damaged the university, they came back. \nAnd Grand Forks is on its way to being bigger and better than ever.\n  Grand Forks is a comeback town, and North Dakota is a comeback team. \nI could not be more proud of these fine young athletes and their \ncoaches.\n  And I look forward to the conclusion of a little bet that Senator \nDorgan and I made last Friday with our dear colleagues from Michigan, \nSenators Levin and Stabenow. I look forward to hearing them recite the \nwords of the UND fight song, loud and clear from the steps of the \nUnited States Capitol this week.\n  While the two final plays in the game put us over the top, everyone \nknows that at UND, it's teamwork that matters. Every member of this \nteam contributed to the victory. I would ask to have printed in the \nRecord the full roster of this championship team, and their first-rate \ncoaching staff. They have made us very proud.\n  The roster follows:\n\n         University of North Dakota Fighting Sioux Team Roster\n\n       No. 1, Thayne Bosh.\n       No. 2, Jesse Smith.\n       No. 3, Dustin

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor economic security and recovery, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on finance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, the economy remains weak and the \nunemployment rate released last Friday for the month of November topped \n5.7 percent. This is the highest level in over 6 years, and many \neconomists expect it to exceed 6 percent in the coming months.\n  Recently the economy officially was put in the category of \n``recession'' beginning last March by the National Bureau of Economic \nResearch.\n  The economy measured by its gross national product, declined at a 1.1 \npercent rate in the third quarter of this year.\n  Corporate profits are down nearly 22 percent compared to last year, \nand consumer confidence is down 51 points in three months, the steepest \ndrop since 1980.\n  While there are a couple of ``not so bad'' economic factors out \nthere, low consumer prices, low interest rates, low oil prices for \nconsumers, and record high auto sales, these all could be temporary \nphenomena related to a broader weak economy and low consumer demand.\n  For all these reasons, I believe Congress needs to act on a stimulus \nbill before it adjourns this first session of the 107th congress.\n  The American public deserves action on a stimulus bill and we need to \nact quickly. Too much time has passed and we cannot let politics as \nusual keep us from putting together a bill that can achieve wide \nbipartisan support quickly.\n  I have come to the conclusion that we should adopt a bill that is not \ncontroversial, politically speaking, and that can actually do some good \nfor the American economy in a short time period.\n  I therefore am introducing today a bill that does three very simple \nthings that I think we can all agree on:\n  First, a one-month payroll tax holiday, that will provide relief from \nthe regressive payroll tax. It would eliminate the need for both \nemployers and employees to pay the current 12.4 percent tax.\n  I have found wide bipartisan support for this proposal. Unfortunately \nit is\n\n[[Page S12773]]\n\nprobably too late now to implement it successfully in the month of \nDecember but I still believe it can be enacted in time to provide real \nrelief in the first month of 2002.\n  This proposal will provide nearly $40 billion in immediate, temporary \ntax relief to working Americans and businesses, and to State and local \ngovernments that must pay the tax also.\n  Second, expand the safety net for working Americans by extending \nunemployment insurance for 13 weeks, and providing nearly 300,000 part \ntime workers eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits and \nadjusting the ``base period'' for determining eligibility. These latter \ntwo changes were recommended by a blue ribbon commission charged with \nmaking recommendations for reforming the UI program.\n  In total the changes I am recommending would increase the cost of the \nprogram by about $9 billion this year, and only $12 billion over the \nnext decade.\n  Finally, the bill I am proposing today would provide for an \nenhancement of expensing for capital purchases, a 20 percent bonus for \ndepreciation with a 3 year sunset. The tax benefit to businesses for \nnew capital purchases would be nearly $26 billion this year, and $12 \nbillion over the next decade.\n  In total, these three provisions, packaged together to provide quick \nand affordable economic stimulus, would not exceed $73 billion this \nyear and less than $62 billion over the next decade.\n  Like so many on my side I wish we could do more in the way of \nspeeding up the marginal tax rate cuts we enacted last spring, but it \nis clear that that can not pass the political test of other side.\n  Some on the other side want to have a major expansion of health care \nbenefits in any stimulus package, but it should be clear now that that \nwill not pass the political test on this side of the aisle.\n  For these reasons, I believe with time running short, this is the \nbest possible package that we can put together that will win wide \nbipartisan support in the shortest amount of time and I encourage those \ndirectly involved in the, what appears to be faltering negotiations on \na stimulus bill, to look at this package as a solution to acting \nquickly.\n  I submit the bill to the desk for referral and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the bill and a table outlining the proposal be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1791\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Congressmen \nFord of Tennessee and Congressman Osborne of Nebraska are offering \ncompanion legislation in the House, and I want to thank them for their \nstrong, bipartisan leadership in the face of America's new challenge at \nhome and overseas.\n  All of us welcome the support of America's Promise, Teach for \nAmerica, AmeriCorps Alums, City Year, the National Association of \nService and Conservation Corps, the Naval Reserve Association, the \nReserve Officers Association, the American Legion, and many other \ngroups dedicated to service to our nation.\n  Our legislation is not a Democratic or Republican initiative. Duty, \nhonor, and country are values that transcend party or ideology. This is \na uniquely American moment in which a crisis becomes an opportunity to \nharness our\n\n[[Page S12776]]\n\nunity and channel is into what historian Stephen Ambrose describes as \n``common-patriotism.''\n  In the aftermath of September 11, the American people have \ndemonstrated, through their courage and generosity, that they are \nprepared to meet the challenge that confronts our Nation. Yet, our \nfellow citizens ask how they can do more for their country. That is why \nwe should act to provide more opportunities for public service.\n  Forty years ago, at the height of the cold war, President John F. \nKennedy issued his famous call for service, ``Ask not what your country \ncan do for you, but rather what you can do for your country.'' His \nclarion challenge inspired millions of Americans to enter into public \nservice. President Kennedy created both the civilian Peace Corps and \nthe Green Berets as avenues to serve.\n  Now, we are confronted with a new challenge.\n  In this battle against terror, there are both foreign and domestic \nfronts. The heroic sacrifices of the New York City firefighters and \npolice have truly moved the public. Thousands of men and women in \nuniform are now in harms way to defend our liberty and freedom.\n  The American people are also ready to serve at home. Walk down any \nstreet and you will see a blizzard of American flags. Over a billion \ndollars have been contributed to the victims of the terrorist attacks. \nWe should seize this moment and issue a new call to service. There will \nbe many tasks ahead, both new and old. On the home front, there are new \nsecurity and civil defense needs. The military will also require new \nrecruits to confront the challenges abroad and within our borders. And, \nof course, there are many other ongoing service opportunities ranging \nfrom combating illiteracy to helping children and our elderly.\n\n  A major component of our legislation would be to expand AmeriCorps. \nSince it was created, more than 200,000 Americans have served one-to-\ntwo year stints in AmeriCorps, tutoring children, building low-income \nhousing or helping flood-ravaged communities. AmeriCorps achievements \nare impressive: thousands of homes constructed; hundreds of thousands \nof seniors assisted to live independently in their own homes; millions \nof children taught, tutored, and mentored. The program receives broad \nbipartisan support, with 49 of the Nation's 50 Governors signing a \nletter last year urging Congress to support AmeriCorps.\n  But for all its concrete achievements, AmeriCorps has a fundamental \nflaw: In its seven years of existence it has barely stirred the \nNation's imagination. Two out of every three Americans say that they \nhave never heard of the program. We seek not only to expand the \nprogram, but also make certain that it has national objectives. We also \ncharge the program with the task of assembling a plan to assist the new \nneeds in the area of Homeland Defense.\n  We must also ask our Nation's colleges to step up to the plate and \nmore aggressively promote service. Currently, only a small fraction of \ncollege work-study funds are devoted to community service, far less \nthan what Congress originally intended when it passed the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965. Our legislation requires universities to being \ntruly complying with the intent of the act to promote student \ninvolvement in community activities.\n  We should also be concerned by the growing gap between our nation's \nmilitary and civilian cultures. While the volunteer military has been \nsuccessful, fewer Americans know first-hand the sacrifices and \ncontributions of their fellow citizens who serve in uniform.\n  There are also many civil defense needs that must be met to defend \nour Nation against terrorists attacks and having a shorter-term \nenlistment option will help provide the manpower to defend the security \nof our Nation. An October 15 article in the Los Angeles Times described \n``the sheer size of the task of protecting targets'' within our \nborders. And a recent Newsweek cover story, ``Protecting America: What \nMust Be Done,'' cited a long list of potential terrorist targets, \nincluding nuclear power plants, seaports, dams, chemical plants, \nairports, water supplies, and government buildings across the United \nStates.\n  To bolster our preparedness against terrorist attack, our legislation \nallows that Defense Department to create a new short-term enlistment to \nencouraging more young Americans to serve in the military. This new 18-\n18-18-enlistment option would provide an $18,000 post-service award for \n18-months of active duty and 18 months of reserve duty.\n  Our legislation also significantly improves the benefits of the \nMontgomery GI bill by doubling the annual education benefit from $7,800 \nto $15,600 and by encouraging service-members to participate in the \nprogram through the elimination of the current 10-year requirement from \nuse of the GI Bill educational benefits.\n  Our legislation also ensures maximum accessibility to colleges and \nhigh schools by military service recruiters. We close loopholes in \ncurrent recruiting access statutes, especially where colleges may be \nallowing access but not providing, in the spirit of the law, full \naccess to recruiters in terms of both information they require and \nreasonable physical presence.\n  Finally, our legislation establishes a 9-member Commission on \nMilitary Recruitment and National Service to be appointed by the \nSecretary of Defense and Secretary of State to examine such things as \nways to shrink the civilian-military gap and develop ways to bring in a \nlarger, broader pool of recruits.\n  As a country, we should strive to make national service a rite of \npassage for young Americans. Not only will our Nation benefit, but \nthose whose serve will find their lives transformed. They will be able \nto glimpse the glory of serving a cause greater than their self-\ninterest. They will come to know both the obligations and rewards of \nactive citizenship. Over the past few years, we have celebrated the \nachievements of the Greatest Generation. Now a new generation is \nconfronted with a challenge to defend our great nation. Let us seize \nthe moment and provide Americans with the opportunity to serve our \ngreat nation.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nJohn McCain to introduce the Call to Service Act of 2001. I want to \nexpress my appreciation to Senator McCain; without his leadership we \nwould not be here today. I also want to extend my thanks to Congressman \nHarold Ford and Congressman Tom Osborne for their strong leadership in \nthe House on this issue.\n  In addition, former President Clinton deserves our thanks and \ngratitude. He championed public service and AmeriCorps during his \ntenure. We build upon his legacy today and acknowledge with pride the \nimportant contribution to America's well-being he has made in this \narea.\n  We are introducing this legislation at a time of great challenge for \nour country. But within this challenge lie the seeds of opportunity if \nwe can seize the moment, the seeds of opportunity for civic renewal \nacross the United States of America.\n  Everywhere I have gone since the tragedy of September 11, people of \nevery age are asking, What can I do? How can I help? So to those who \nare looking for a way to help to put something back, we are here today \nto say that the Call to Service Act will give you those opportunities.\n  We expand the AmeriCorps program fully fivefold, increasing the \nnumber of volunteers annually, from 50,000 to 250,000, so that every 4 \nyears, 1 million young people will have the opportunity to serve our \ncountry. Fifty percent of the new volunteers will be focused on \nhomeland defense to meet the many issues that have come to light and \nneed attention since the events of September 11. With this dramatic \nexpansion, we include strong accountability measures to ensure \nmeasurable, positive outcomes for the communities served by AmeriCorps.\n  The Call to Service Act significantly expands the serve study \ninitiative. Work-study in our colleges was originally intended to get \nkids involved in public service and community work, but unfortunately, \nit has not lived up to that initial promise. The requirement today is \nthat 7 percent of students involved in work-study have to be involved \nin community service. We expand that more than threefold to 25 percent, \nto get America's best and brightest giving back to the community. This \nmeans that every year, approximately 250,000 students will be \ncontributing to their communities. Expanding the community service \nportion\n\n[[Page S12777]]\n\nof work-study has broad bipartisan support. In May 2000, General Powell \nsent a letter to the Nation's college presidents to ``work toward a \ngoal of dedicating a greater and greater portion of your Federal \nCollege Work Study funds each year to community service.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                America's Promise,\n\n\n                                       The Alliance For Youth,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 30, 2000.\n       Dear Friend: President Clinton has written you and I join \n     him in enlisting your support in a very important endeavor--\n     the well being of our Nation's young people.\n       Three years ago at the Presidents' Summit for America's \n     Future held in Philadelphia, all the living Presidents of the \n     United States and thousands of other national leaders pledged \n     to harness the power of volunteerism in the service of our \n     Nation's most important resource, our youth. The organization \n     I chair, America's Promise. The Alliance for Youth, was born \n     at the 1997 Presidents' Summit, and it continues today \n     mobilizing communities, individuals, organizations, and \n     institutions to make five key promises to every youngster: an \n     ongoing relationship with a caring adult--parent, mentor, \n     tutor or coach; safe places and structured activities during \n     non-school hours; a healthy start; a marketable skill through \n     effective education; and an opportunity to give back through \n     community service.\n       Colleges and universities can play a crucial role in this \n     movement. Actually, many have already enlisted in our crusade \n     by becoming Colleges and Universities of Promise. With that \n     pledge they make a commitment to keep the Five Promises to \n     young people in their communities.\n       One very substantial way you can contribute is by using the \n     Federal College Work Study Program to enable hundreds of \n     thousands of college students to serve in the communities \n     where they study. By being tutors or mentors, or by working \n     with local schools and youth-service organizations, college \n     students can make a tangible difference in the lives of young \n     children. I can attest that there are thousands more \n     nonprofit organizations and community groups serving young \n     children and youth that would benefit profoundly from the \n     energy and idealism of your students.\n       In that spirit, President Clinton is asking you to commit a \n     greater share of your work study assignments to community \n     service. I second the President's request and encourage you \n     to work toward a goal of dedicating a greater and greater \n     portion of your Federal College Work Study funds each year to \n     community service. Institutions of higher learning have \n     always been leaders in the life of our nation. I hope you \n     will seize this opportunity to demonstrate that leadership \n     again.\n       Please join in this effort. Help us to keep America's \n     Promise. Thank you and best wishes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                  Gen. Colin L. Powell, USA (Ret),\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 1794. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to prohibit \nthe unauthorized circumvention of airport security systems and \nprocedures; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will make it a Federal criminal offense to intentionally \ncircumvent an airport security checkpoint. This morning I chaired the \nfirst Senate Commerce Committee hearing on aviation security since the \nlandmark aviation security bill was signed into law earlier this fall. \nThat historic piece of legislation was enacted as a response to the \nevents of September 11, when terrorists commandeered U.S. commercial \njets filled with passengers and used them as weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Those terrorist attacks have precipitated a sea-change in attitude on \nhow we view our homeland security. There is no such thing as ``business \nas usual,'' especially at our airports across this country. Immediately \nafter the events of 9-11, the Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation took steps to tighten aviation security \nacross the country. U.S. airlines and airports put in place additional \nsecurity safeguards. And Congress passed the most sweeping aviation \nsecurity bill in history.\n  Under the new law, every commercial airport will now have a Federal \nsecurity manager and the manager will conduct an immediate assessment \nof safety procedures at the busiest airports in the country. We will \nhave strict and uniform national standards for the hiring and training \nand job performance of the men and women who are on the front lines of \nensuring that our airports and airplanes are not only the safest in the \nworld, but are also the most secure. Because of this legislation, every \nairport screener must now be a U.S. citizen. He or she must pass a \ncriminal background check, and they must perform well in their job. If \nthey don't, and this includes federal screeners, they can and will be \nfired immediately. Cockpit doors will be fortified, the number of air \nmarshals on airplanes will be significantly increased, and \ninternational flights must provide the U.S. Customs Service with \npassenger lists before they can land in this country.\n  Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport, the world's busiest \nairport, Delta, with its world headquarters in Atlanta, and AirTran are \nkey not just to Georgia's economy, but to our national aviation system \nas well. At the Commerce Committee hearing this morning, Spokespersons \nfrom each of these Georgia giants, told us about the security measures \nthat have been put in place since the September 11 hijackings and what \nfurther steps they plan to take in light of the requirements of the new \naviation security law.\n  At the hearing, Hartsfield's General Manager, Mr. Benjamin DeCosta, \naddressed the incident of November 16 when an individual breached \nsecurity at the Atlanta airport. The security breach triggered the \ntotal evacuation of Hartsfield and a temporary halt of incoming \nand outgoing air traffic. That action caused a ripple effect of delays \nand flight cancellations. I might add that I have firsthand knowledge \nof those delays, since I spent some ``quality time'' on the tarmac in \nAtlanta that day. But I want to stress that despite those delays, the \nsystem worked. Hartsfield correctly followed the FAA directive, put in \nplace after September 11, that required airport lock-down until airport \nsecurity could be assured.\n\n  However, the November incident revealed a glaring loophole in the \nsystem, even after enactment of the new airline security legislation. \nCurrently, an intentional security violation aboard an aircraft is a \nFederal crime, but a willful breach of an airport security checkpoint \nis punishable only by local criminal penalties and federal civil \npenalties. Just as we have at last stepped up to the plate to assure \ngreater uniformity and greater accountability through federalizing the \nairport security workforce, I believe it is the responsibility of \nCongress to address this shortcoming in our federal laws. Accordingly, \nI am introducing legislation, the Airport Checkpoint Enhancement, or \nACE, Act, to make willful violations of airport security checkpoints a \nfederal crime. We should send a message loud and clear that airport \nbusiness is serious business, that if you come to a U.S. airport for \nmischief or for folly, you will pay the consequences.\n  My legislation addresses the all-important issue of aviation security \nwhich, as we have recently learned in the most painful way possible, is \na matter of national security. Specifically, the ACE Act will amend the \nrecently-passed Aviation and Transportation Security Act to provide a \nfederal criminal penalty for individuals who intentionally circumvent \nor breach an airport security checkpoint. It was amazing to me to learn \nthat in Georgia, an individual who willfully violates the secure area \nof an airport is only subject to a misdemeanor which means a maximum \npenalty involving a civil fine up to $1,100 and a year in jail. My \nlegislation will mean that violators could face up to 10 years in \nprison. This legislation is supported by Atlanta's Hartsfield \nInternational Airport, Delta Airlines, the Air Carrier Association of \nAmerica, and the Office of the Solicitor General, Clayton County, GA. \nWe have only just begun to improve airport security and therefore, I \nlook forward to continuing this discussion with airport officials and \nlaw enforcement officers across the country on how we can best protect \npassengers, airport workers, and air travel in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1794\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 90\n\n       Whereas on June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, \n     thereby initiating the Korean War, leading to the loss of \n     countless lives, and further polarizing a world engulfed by \n     the Cold War;\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the Korean War, the division of \n     the Koreas at the 38th parallel separated millions of Koreans \n     from their families, tearing at the heart of every mother, \n     father, daughter, and son;\n       Whereas on June 13 and 14, 2000, in the first summit \n     conference ever held between leaders of North and South \n     Korea, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung met with North \n     Korean leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang, North Korea's \n     capital;\n       Whereas in a historic joint declaration, South Korean \n     President Kim Dae Jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il \n     made an important promise to promote economic cooperation and \n     hold reunions of South Korean and North Korean citizens;\n       Whereas such reunions have been held in North and South \n     Korea since the signing of the joint declaration, reuniting \n     family members who had not seen or heard from each other for \n     more than 50 years;\n       Whereas 500,000 people of the United States of Korean \n     ancestry bear the pain of being separated from their families \n     in North Korea;\n       Whereas the United States values peace in the global \n     community and has long recognized the significance of uniting \n     families torn apart by the tragedy of war; and\n       Whereas a petition drive is taking place throughout the \n     United States, urging the United States Government to assist \n     in the reunification efforts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Congress and the President should support efforts to \n     reunite people of the United States of Korean ancestry with \n     their families in North Korea; and\n       (2) such efforts should be made in a timely manner, as 50 \n     years have passed since the separation of these families.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today along with my \ncolleagues Senator Hagel and Senator Boxer to submit a concurrent \nresolution that expresses the sense of Congress that the Congress and \nthe President should support efforts to reunite Americans of Korean \nancestry with their families in North Korea.\n  Following a historic summit in June, 2000 in Pyongyang, North Korea, \nSouth Korean President Kim Dae Jung and North Korean leader Kim Jon II \nagreed to hold reunions of South Korean and North Korean families \nseparated at the 38th parallel since the start of the Korean war. Since \nthen, three reunions have taken place and more than 3,400 citizens of \nNorth and South Korea have been reunited after more than 50 years.\n  I applaud these reunions and I believe they are an important step \ntowards improving relations between North and South Korea and promoting \npeace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Unfortunately, more than \n500,000 Americans of Korean ancestry, many of whom reside in my home \nstate of California, who likewise have been separated from loved ones \nin North Korea for half a century have not been able to participate.\n  Time is of the essence. Family members in North Korea and the United \nStates are entering the twilight of their lives. Many have died. Many \nsimply do not know what has happened to their loved ones. We now have \nan opportunity to lend our support to efforts to reunite families who \nhave spent far too long suffering from separation and uncertainty.\n  The resolution is simple.

Report on Progress Toward Implementation of \n     Comprehensive Nuclear Threat Reduction Programs to Safeguard \n     Pakistani and Indian Missile Nuclear Stockpiles and \n     Technology. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Since 1991 the Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction \n     initiative with the Russian Federation has sought to address \n     the threat posed by Soviet-era stockpiles of nuclear, \n     chemical, and biological weapons-grade materials being \n     illicitly acquired by terrorist organizations or rogue \n     states.\n       (2) India and Pakistan have acquired or developed \n     independently nuclear materials, detonation devices, \n     warheads, and delivery systems as part of their nuclear \n     weapons programs.\n       (3) Neither India nor Pakistan is currently a signatory of \n     the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or the Comprehensive \n     Test Ban Treaty or an active participant in the United \n     Nations Conference of Disarmament, nor do these countries \n     voluntarily submit to international inspections of their \n     nuclear facilities.\n       (4) Since the commencement of the military campaign against \n     the Taliban regime and the al-Qaeda terrorist network in \n     Afghanistan, Pakistan has taken additional steps to secure \n     its nuclear assets from theft by members of al-Qaeda or other \n     terrorists sympathetic to Osama bin Laden or the Taliban.\n       (5) Self-policing of nuclear materials and sensitive \n     technologies by Indian and Pakistani authorities without up-\n     to-date Western technology and expertise in the nuclear \n     security area is unlikely to prevent determined terrorists or \n     sympathizers from gaining access to such stockpiles over the \n     long term.\n       (6) The United States has a significant national security \n     interest in cooperating with India and Pakistan in order to \n     ensure that effective nuclear threat reduction programs and \n     policies are being pursued by the governments of those two \n     countries.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in \n     cooperation with the Secretaries of State and Energy, shall \n     submit a report to Congress describing the steps that have \n     been taken to develop cooperative threat reduction programs \n     with India and Pakistan.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``American Servicemembers' \n     Protection Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 9002. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 17, 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic \n     Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an \n     International Criminal Court, meeting in Rome, Italy, adopted \n     the ``Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court''. The \n     vote on whether to proceed with the statute was 120 in favor \n     to 7 against, with 21 countries abstaining. The United States \n     voted against final adoption of the Rome Statute.\n       (2) As of April 30, 2001, 139 countries had signed the Rome \n     Statute and 30 had ratified it. Pursuant to Article 126 of \n     the Rome Statute, the statute will enter into force on the \n     first day of the month after the 60th day following the date \n     on which the 60th country deposits an instrument ratifying \n     the statute.\n       (3) Since adoption of the Rome Statute, a Preparatory \n     Commission for the International Criminal Court has met \n     regularly to draft documents to implement the Rome Statute, \n     including Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Elements of \n     Crimes, and a definition of the Crime of Aggression.\n       (4) During testimony before the Congress following the \n     adoption of the Rome Statute, the lead United States \n     negotiator, Ambassador David Scheffer stated that the United \n     States could not sign the Rome Statute because certain \n     critical negotiating objectives of the United States had not \n     been achieved. As a result, he stated: ``We are left with \n     consequences that do not serve the cause of international \n     justice.''\n       (5) Ambassador Scheffer went on to tell the Congress that: \n     ``Multinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country \n     that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the Court's \n     jurisdiction even if the country of the individual \n     peacekeeper has not joined the treaty. Thus, the treaty \n     purports to establish an arrangement whereby United States \n     armed forces operating overseas could be conceivably \n     prosecuted by the international court even if the United \n     States has not agreed to be bound by the treaty. Not only is \n     this contrary to the most fundamental principles of treaty \n     law, it could inhibit the ability of the United States to use \n     its military to meet alliance obligations and participate in \n     multinational operations, including humanitarian \n     interventions to save civilian lives. Other contributors to \n     peacekeeping operations will be similarly exposed.''.\n       (6) Notwithstanding these concerns, President Clinton \n     directed that the United States sign the Rome Statute on \n     December 31, 2000. In a statement issued that day, he stated \n     that in view of the unremedied deficiencies of the Rome \n     Statute, ``I will not, and do not recommend that my successor \n     submit the Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent until \n     our fundamental concerns are satisfied''.\n       (7) Any American prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied procedural \n     protections to which all Americans are entitled under the \n     Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, such as the \n     right to trial by jury.\n       (8) Members of the Armed Forces of the United States should \n     be free from the risk of prosecution by the International \n     Criminal Court, especially when they are stationed or \n     deployed around the world to protect the vital national \n     interests of the United States. The United States Government \n     has an obligation to protect the members of its Armed Forces, \n     to the maximum extent possible, against criminal prosecutions \n     carried out by the International Criminal Court.\n       (9) In addition to exposing members of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States to the risk of international criminal \n     prosecution, the Rome Statute creates a risk that the \n     President and other senior elected and appointed officials of \n     the United States Government may be prosecuted by the \n     International Criminal Court. Particularly if the Preparatory \n     Commission agrees on a definition of the Crime of Aggression \n     over United States objections, senior United States officials \n     may be at risk of criminal prosecution for national security \n     decisions involving such matters as responding to acts of \n     terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, and deterring aggression. No less than members \n     of the Armed Forces of the United States, senior officials of \n     the United States Government should be free from the risk of \n     prosecution by the International Criminal Court, especially \n     with respect to official actions taken by them to protect the \n     national interests of the United States.\n       (10) Any agreement within the Preparatory Commission on a \n     definition of the Crime of Aggression that usurps the \n     prerogative of the United Nations Security Council under \n     Article 39 of the charter of the United Nations to \n     ``determine the existence of any . . . act of aggression'' \n     would contravene the charter of the United Nations and \n     undermine deterrence.\n       (11) It is a fundamental principle of international law \n     that a treaty is binding upon its parties only and that it \n     does not create obligations for nonparties without their \n     consent to be bound. The United States is not a party to the \n     Rome Statute and will not be bound by any of its terms.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States is among the leading nations in the \n     world in conducting basic scientific research;\n       (2) that leadership position strengthens the economy and \n     national defense of the United States and provides other \n     important benefits;\n       (3) the Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota, owned by the \n     Homestake Mining Company of California, is approximately \n     8,000 feet deep and is situated in a unique physical setting \n     that is ideal for carrying out certain types of particle \n     physics and other research;\n       (4) the Mine has been selected by the National Underground \n     Science Laboratory Committee, an independent panel of \n     distinguished scientists, as the preferred site for the \n     construction of the National Underground Science Laboratory;\n       (5) such a laboratory would be used to conduct scientific \n     research that would be funded and recognized as significant \n     by the United States;\n       (6) the establishment of the laboratory is in the national \n     interest, and would substantially improve the capability of \n     the United States to conduct important scientific research;\n       (7) for economic reasons, Homestake intends to cease \n     operations at the Mine in 2001;\n       (8) on cessation of operations of the Mine, Homestake \n     intends to implement reclamation actions that would preclude \n     the establishment of a laboratory at the Mine;\n       (9) Homestake has advised the State that, after cessation \n     of operations at the Mine, instead of closing the entire \n     Mine, Homestake is willing to donate the underground portion \n     of the Mine and certain other real and personal property of \n     substantial value at the Mine for use as the National \n     Underground Science Laboratory;\n       (10) use of the Mine as the site for the laboratory, \n     instead of other locations under consideration, would result \n     in a savings of millions of dollars for the Federal \n     Government;\n       (11) if the Mine is selected as the site for the \n     laboratory, it is essential that closure of the Mine not \n     preclude the location of the laboratory at the Mine;\n       (12) Homestake is unwilling to donate, and the State is \n     unwilling to accept, the property at the Mine for the \n     laboratory if Homestake and the State would continue to have \n     potential liability with respect to the transferred property; \n     and\n       (13) to secure the use of the Mine as the location for the \n     laboratory, and to realize the benefits of the proposed \n     laboratory, it is necessary for the United States to--\n       (A) assume a portion of any potential future liability of \n     Homestake concerning the Mine; and\n       (B) address potential liability associated with the \n     operation of the laboratory.\n\n[[Page S12810]]\n\n     SEC. 103.

Murrah \n     Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on April 19, \n     1995;\n       Whereas there are numerous Federal programs that help \n     prepare first responders from across the Nation, including \n     the Domestic Preparedness Program and other training and \n     exercise programs administered by the Department of Justice;\n       Whereas there are also domestic preparedness programs \n     administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \n     which together with the programs of the Department of Justice \n     support State and local first responders with funding, \n     training, equipment acquisition, technical assistance, \n     exercise planning, and execution;\n       Whereas many of the first responders who participate in \n     such programs do so on their own time;\n       Whereas an effective response of local first responders to \n     a terrorist attack saves lives; and\n       Whereas in response to a terrorist attack, first responders \n     are exposed to a high risk of bodily harm and death as the \n     first line of defense of the United States in managing the \n     aftermath of the attack: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) expresses its profound sorrow for the deaths and \n     injuries suffered by first responders as they endeavored to \n     save innocent people in the aftermath of the terrorist \n     attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on \n     September 11, 2001;\n       (2) expresses its deepest sympathies to the families and \n     loved ones of the fallen first responders;\n       (3) honors and commends the first responders who \n     participated in evacuating and rescuing the innocent people \n     in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon after the \n     terrorist attacks;\n       (4) encourages the President to issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to pay respect \n     to the first responder community for their service in the \n     aftermath of the terrorist attacks and their continuing \n     efforts to save lives; and\n       (5) encourages all levels of government to continue to work \n     together to effectively coordinate emergency preparedness by \n     providing the infrastructure, funding, and interagency \n     communication and cooperation necessary to ensure that if an \n     attack occurs, first responders will be as prepared as \n     possible to respond effectively.\n\n  Mr. REID.
