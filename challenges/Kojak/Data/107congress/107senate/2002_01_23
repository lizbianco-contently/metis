Mr. President, the start of a new session of Congress is \nalways a hopeful time, and this session is no exception. These are days \nof great and important challenges for our Nation and for our world, \nwhich means we have the opportunity to do great and important work. It \nis an honor to be part of this Congress and to be able to work with so \nmany fine men and women, Republicans and Democrats. I am going to have \nmore to say this afternoon about the legislative agenda for the year. \nFor now, let me welcome back my colleagues to this second session of \nCongress. Let me welcome our staffs and all of those who are associated \nwith making this Senate work as it does each and every day.\n  This is only the second time I have had the privilege of opening a \nsession of Congress. The first time was a year ago during my first 17-\nday term as majority leader. In my remarks that day, I mentioned the \nBrumidi corridor, the incredible frescoes that line the walls on the \nfirst floor of this building. They were painted more than 125 years ago \nby an Italian immigrant named Constantino Brumidi. Some people refer to \nhim as ``America's Michelangelo''--with good reason. He spent 25 years \nof his life painting the walls and the great dome of this Capitol. It \nwas a labor of love for his adopted country. Over the years, Brumidi's \nmagnificent paintings were covered over by layers of paint and varnish. \nFor the last several years, art conservators have been painstakingly \nscraping away those layers to reveal the original works of art \nunderneath.\n  I have often thought of that process as a good metaphor for the \nSenate. Over the years, a layer of partisanship has sometimes settled \nover the Senate. Even with that disadvantage, it has remained the \ngreatest legislative body in the history of the world and one in which \nI am very proud to serve. But it is when we are able to transcend the \nlayers of partisanship, as we did last year in response to the attacks \non our Nation, that the real beauty and genius of this institution are \nrevealed.\n\n  Very often, as I leave work at the end of the day, I walk down the \nBrumidi corridors on my way out the door. I take a quick look to see \nthe progress the conservators have made. I remember one evening \nparticularly well. It was late October. For much of the time since \nSeptember 11, and since the anthrax letter was opened in my office, \nwork on the corridors had stopped. But that evening, the conservators \nwere back at work making progress. Their work, it seemed to me, was an \nact of faith that 125 years from now, and long after that, this \nbuilding will still be standing; people will still come from all over \nAmerica and all over the world to see the miracle of democracy in \naction.\n  Mo Udall wrote a book called ``Too Funny to be President'' about his \nyears in the Congress. He dedicated it to the 3,000 Members of \nCongress, living and dead, with whom he served for nearly three \ndecades. As we begin this new session of Congress, let us remember that \nwe are part of a continuum of all who have come before us and all who \nwill come after us, and let us pledge to work in a way that will honor \nthem all.\n  With that, I wish my colleagues well. I welcome them back. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain \nthe presence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll, and the \nfollowing Senators entered the Chamber and answered to their names:\n\n[[Page S2]]\n\n                             [Quorum No. 1]\n\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Daschle\n     Feinstein\n     Inouye\n     McCain\n     Reid\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, after the holiday season it is good to \nbe back to do the people's business in the Senate. We have a lot of \nunfinished business, and we need to do some of this unfinished business \nright now.\n  I think the American people are looking for the bipartisanship of the \npost-September 11 environment to continue. I think they are hopeful \nthat a lot of very important legislation will pass, and I hope they are \nin a position of helping all of us reject political posturing and \ndueling with press statements. The American people really want results. \nI guess one would say they want action, not words.\n  Yet we adjourned before the holidays before we could take steps \nnecessary to aid our economy. We did not pass an economic stimulus \nbill, and we did not pass Trade Promotion Authority. We must do better. \nWe need to pass both of these because they are very central to \nstimulating the economy, which we always think of being short term, but \nwith the President's authority to negotiate trade agreements, we can \nhave a long-term revival of the economy.\n  I emphasize trade by often quoting President Clinton, who said one-\nthird of the jobs created during his administration were created by \ntrade, which means trade is very important to the betterment of our \neconomy. Generally, trade-related jobs are very good, higher paying \njobs.\n  So we did not pass a stimulus package and we did not pass trade \npromotion authority, although there was bipartisan support for both. \nThere was overwhelming bipartisan support for trade promotion \nauthority, as that bill was reported out of our Finance Committee 18 to \n3. So since we did not pass these, I believe we need to do better.\n\n  Last week, President Bush was in Louisiana where he called upon the \nSenate to pass Trade Promotion Authority as a necessary part of our \neconomic recovery. He also spoke on this issue near my State of Iowa, \nacross the river in Illinois, in what we call the Quad Cities of our \nState. He was in Moline, IL, to promote trade promotion authority \nlegislation and economic development legislation.\n  President Bush said, as President Clinton has said, that trade is \nvery much a jobs issue. He said if we trade more, there are more jobs \navailable for hard-working Americans. He is as right as President \nClinton was right on this very issue.\n  Trade is essential to our economy. The United States exported over \n$780 billion in goods and services to more than 200 foreign markets \nlast year. Exports provide more than one-fourth of all economic growth \nin America. Trade is a very important part of our economy generally \nover a long period of time, at least for the last 50 years. In the case \nof the post-September 11 recession, it is very important to our long-\nterm economic recovery.\n  Of course, President Bush knows that trade is an important part of \nour economic recovery, and that is why he called upon the Senate of the \nUnited States to put our political parties aside and focus on what is \nbest for the United States of America and the American people.\n  As I said, we did act on this issue in the Finance Committee before \nthe holidays. We came together in a bipartisan way and, in a vote of 18 \nto 3, voted out trade promotion authority. The key to the strong \nbipartisan vote can be found in one word, and that one word is \n``compromise.''\n  Let me be clear. The trade promotion authority bill that passed the \nSenate Finance Committee is a good bill. It deserves our support. In \nnegotiating that bill with the chairman of the committee, my friend \nSenator Baucus, we included some items I may not like, but that is the \nessence of compromise.\n\n[[Page S3]]\n\n Neither one of us got everything we wanted, but we put aside our \ndifferences to do what is right for the American people. We came \ntogether, Democrat and Republican, and passed a good bill out of the \nFinance Committee that will help create jobs in America. Trade-related \njobs, as everybody knows, pay 15 percent above our national average.\n  For that compromise, I commend Senator Baucus. Now we need to do the \nsame thing in the full Senate. We need to do it, and hopefully do it \nvery quickly. The reason for doing it very quickly is that starting, I \nbelieve the date is February 7, there are negotiations following on the \nnew round that was agreed to by the 142 nations of the World Trade \nOrganization last November in Doha, Qatar, a new round, and the \nnegotiations would start next month.\n  We can start those negotiations without passing this bill, but the \nPresident will never be credible in these negotiations with the other \n142 nations unless the President has this trade promotion authority. So \nwe need to do this, and hopefully not have the partisan bickering we \nhave had on some legislation, so we can get it done very soon.\n  Trade promotion authority to the President is not only key to our \neconomic recovery but is also a very important tool which helps us help \nother nations in the world, especially poorer countries, and maybe was \nbest said by President Kennedy 40 years ago when he said trade, not \naid, is the leadership the United States ought to take in the way of \nhelping other nations.\n  We have been giving aid since then, but the long-term benefit is \nhelping another country to help itself, and the ability for them to \nsell their goods to us and for us in turn to sell our goods to them is \nvery good. It not only is good economically, but I think it brings \nabout a closeness of people around the world, of different societies, \nof different nations, so we have a greater prospect for peace. That \nshould not be forgotten as well. Although we always talk about this in \neconomic terms, we ought to think in terms of other things it does as \nwell.\n  So it helps us help poorer countries in a way that helps them to help \nthemselves. It creates jobs. It helps lift people out of poverty. \nPoverty is our enemy. Poverty leads people in the wrong path, towards \nwar, political instability, religious fanaticism.\n  Following World War II, we stabilized Europe through the Marshall \nPlan and economic development. We won the cold war through our economic \nstrength. Now we are fighting the war on terrorism. We need to keep up \nstrong international economic leadership and bring more nations of the \nworld into democracy and prosperity.\n  The President's political leadership, as our chief diplomat, does \nthat. He does that through his leadership as our Commander in Chief. \nAlso, the President can do this as our chief trade negotiator and know \nthat he not only wants political leadership in the United States, he \nwants the United States to give economic leadership and do it in a way \nto help other countries help themselves and have long-term economic \nrecovery. Trade helps America do all these things, and trade promotion \nauthority for President Bush is the key. There is really no reason to \nwait.\n\n  The bill has strong bipartisan support. It will pass the Senate by a \nstrong margin. That is why I urge today, as I have in several speeches \nover the last month, that our distinguished majority leader put trade \npromotion authority on the floor for a vote in February. There is no \nreason to wait on trade promotion authority. There is no need to waste \ntime in giving the President the authority he needs to open new markets \nand create new jobs for the American people.\n  By passing trade promotion authority early this year, the Senate will \nhelp the President spur economic growth and continue our world economic \nleadership, as well as military and political leadership. We will \ncreate new jobs.\n  In this time of war on terrorism, it seems when a lot of people are \npleading, and probably rightly so, that a lot of fanaticism comes when \npoverty is present, we will help fight terrorism by bringing more \nnations into democracy and prosperity.\n  It is time to get the job done. The American people expect no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Oregon, Mr. \nSmith.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, we all come back having \nexperienced different things and having heard different messages in our \nStates. But as the Budget Committee took up its duties this morning and \nbegan hearing economic reports, it was clear to me on the committee \nthat there is overwhelming bipartisan support for winning the war \nabroad and for better homeland defense here. Then differences begin to \nemerge as to how best to strengthen America's economic security. \nClearly, the economic stimulus package is a priority for many, and \ncertainly for the State of Oregon which I am privileged to represent. \nWhen we list all of those priorities, we wonder what is left to help \nwith the other priorities this Nation has.\n  I rise to speak of a priority I have, that I began working on in the \nlast session of this Congress, with my colleague, Ron Wyden, the issue \nof the burgeoning ranks of the uninsured. I rise to talk about that \nsubject.\n  I stand to say that health insurance is something about which we \nshould all be concerned. Living without health insurance can result in \nbankruptcy, unnecessary delays in treatment, and, in some tragic \ncircumstances, even death itself. We need to be concerned about it, not \njust because we all may at some point in our lives become uninsured. We \nneed to be concerned about the uninsured because it is a moral outrage \nthat so many Americans have no health coverage even as they live and \nwork in the wealthiest nation on Earth.\n  We have heard the statistics: Over 40 million Americans do not have \nhealth insurance. We have heard the number so many times that it seems \nto have lost its impact, in this place at least. Let's look at the \nnumber more closely: 40 million Americans is one in six people in our \ncountry who do not qualify for Medicare. That number includes citizens \nfrom every conceivable walk of life: children, pregnant women, parents, \nsingle adults, full-time workers, self-employed individuals, and \nstudents. The 40 million people include those who have lost their jobs \nas the economy has worsened. It includes people who have worked hard \nfor small companies that cannot afford to offer health benefits to \nemployees. It includes people who work for companies that offer health \nbenefits, but who cannot afford their share of the premium. Most \nAmericans would be surprised to know more than 80 percent of all \nuninsured children and adults live in families who have at least one \nadult working.\n\n  This week the country celebrated the life and work of Dr. Martin \nLuther King, Jr. More than 30 years after his death, it seems \nincredible that the racial disparity in health care is still so \nevident. More than any other group, the people who are living without \nhealth insurance in the United States are Hispanic and African \nAmerican. Thirty-two percent of all Hispanics in this country had no \nhealth insurance coverage last year; the number is even worse for low-\nincome Hispanics, 43 percent of whom live without insurance. This \nsituation should no longer be tolerated.\n  As the Senate convenes for the second session of the 107th Congress, \nthere has never been a better time to address the issues of the \nuninsured. Americans are losing their jobs as the recession continues, \nwithout the benefit of any economic stimulus legislation from this \nCongress.\n  In addition, the brief era of stability in health insurance premiums \nseem to have ended. In 2001, the average cost of employer-sponsored \nhealth insurance coverage rose 11 percent. Those who work in small \nfirms saw increases substantially higher than that.\n  There can be no doubt what will happen this year. It has already \nbegun. Through no fault of their own, many employers will have to raise \ncopayments and premiums, while reducing\n\n[[Page S4]]\n\nbenefits, if they are able to continue to offer insurance to their \nemployees at all. The bottom line is that more people than ever will \nlose their health insurance.\n  These numbers are truly startling. But behind every one of those, \nevery single case of those 40 million people, there is an American face \nand a human story.\n  As I travel around Oregon visiting community health centers, I meet \nmore and more people who live without health insurance. I hear their \nstories. There are many ways we can help shrink that gap between the \ninsured and the uninsured. We should pursue that goal with the policy \nwe begin formulating in the Budget Committee.\n  While the stories of all of the people I meet are different, they \nare, in most cases, quite tragic, and the circumstances that have \nbrought them to these places are often similar. The loss of a job. An \nincrease in insurance premiums. A serious illness. These are \nunavoidable circumstances that could happen to any American.\n  While I understand the looming budget deficit this year will make new \ninitiatives difficult, the current economic climate is all the more \nreason to focus attention and resources on covering the uninsured this \nyear. In the immortal word of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.: ``The time \nis always right to do what is right.''\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S4-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4-S6]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          AGENDA FOR THE SECOND SESSION OF THE 107TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I came to this Chamber just as we opened \nthe session to welcome back our colleagues and staff and all of those \nwho are so much a part of this great institution. I reiterate that \nwelcome again this afternoon. I am sure we all hope this new year and \nthis new session will be constructive and productive.\n  Much has happened in the weeks since we adjourned. In the war on \nterrorism, President Bush and his national security team continue to do \na superb job. And our men and women in uniform continue to inspire us \nwith their heroism and their success.\n  Closer to home, workers in New York continue to clear away the \nwreckage at ground zero. At the Pentagon, rebuilding is already \nunderway.\n  In Princeton, NJ, a tiny 15-day-old baby girl--the daughter of Scott \nand Lisa Beamer--is living proof that the spirit of the heroes of \nUnited flight 93 will never die.\n  And just yesterday--more than 3 months after the largest bioterrorism \nattack in our Nation's history forced it shut--the Hart Senate Office \nBuilding finally reopened.\n  Those are all reasons to be hopeful about this new year. But there \nare also reasons to be concerned. In all, there are now more than 8.3 \nmillion Americans who want to work but do not have jobs. The collapse \nof Enron has cost thousands of Enron employees their jobs--and their \nretirement savings. Tens of thousands of other Americans who have \ninvested part of their retirement savings in pension funds have also \nbeen hurt by Enron's implosion.\n  In South Dakota and all across America, people are working hard to \nraise their children, pay their bills, and maybe, if they are lucky, to \nput something away for the future. Our job this year is to help them, \nby strengthening our national security, our economic security, and the \nsecurity of our democratic institutions.\n  As we begin this new session, we face two significant challenges. The \nfirst is fiscal. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated \nthe Federal Government would run a $5.6 trillion surplus over the next \ndecade. This morning the CBO released new reports showing that $4 \ntrillion of the projected surplus has disappeared in the space of just \n7 months.\n  Instead of surpluses every year from now until 2011, current \nprojections indicate that even if you include the Social Security and \nMedicare surpluses, the Government will run deficits at least in the \nyears 2002 and 2003. And it will be forced to use $1.2 trillion in \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds over the next decade to pay \nfor other essential Government programs. That is before we add one \npenny for the Medicare prescription drug benefit or strengthen our \nmilitary or increase our investments in homeland security, education, \nor other critical priorities. It is also before we add one penny for an \neconomic recovery package.\n  The second challenge we face is ideological. There are some who \npredict we will accomplish little this year because of our genuine \ndifferences in philosophy on many issues and because this session is so \nshort and the stakes in the November elections are so high. But we do \nnot have to accept that prediction. Important issues do not have to be \ninsoluble. The new education bill we passed last year is proof of that.\n\n  Six days from today President Bush will deliver his first State of \nthe Union Address. Six days after that, he will send the Congress his \nbudget proposal. Democrats will give the President's proposals very \ncareful and respectful consideration. He deserves every aspect of \nrespect and care that we can give his budget.\n  Today I would like to say a few words about what we see as our \npriorities for the coming year. And I might say that we look forward to \nworking with the President and with our Republican colleagues to find \nprincipled compromises on each of them.\n  The first thing we need to do is finish our work from last year. We \nshould start by passing an economic recovery plan that will create jobs \nand get America's economy moving in the right direction again.\n  Both the Democratic and Republican economic recovery plans are more \nthan 75 percent tax cuts.\n  Over the holidays, the Congressional Budget Office analyzed all of \nthe major economic recovery proposals and indicated that the least \nhelpful would be repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax and \nspeeding up the income tax rate reductions passed last summer.\n  Earlier this month, in an effort to get the negotiations moving \nagain, I proposed two new business tax cuts for every company in \nAmerica that creates new jobs or invests in new equipment and \ntechnology. But today, I offer another proposal for breaking the \nimpasse.\n  There are four ideas that appear in every major economic plan--\nDemocratic and Republican. The first is to extend unemployment benefits \nby 13 weeks. Republicans and Democrats have suggested that.\n  The second is to provide tax rebates for workers who did not get a \nrebate the first time. Again, both Republicans and Democrats have \noffered that.\n  The third is to provide bonus depreciation to encourage business \ninvestment. Again, both groups have proposed that.\n  And finally, the fourth is to provide fiscal relief for States to \nhelp them avoid cutting critical services--especially health care--or \nraising taxes during the recession.\n  I hope we can at least take up these four measures immediately. If \nthere are others for which there can be agreement--perhaps New York \nassistance, perhaps the extenders, perhaps other issues--where we can \nfind common ground, I would like to be able to do that. I hope we can \ndo it this week.\n  I have begun talking with Senator Lott, and he has been extremely \nresponsive in his desire to try to find a way to move this legislation \nalong. I commend him and thank him for that.\n  Later on this afternoon we will offer a unanimous consent request \nthat will accommodate Senators' wishes to offer amendments but also, I \nhope, Senators' desires to get something done. So I am hopeful we can \naccomplish that this week.\n  I might add, we have a very limited period of time. We have a couple \nof days this week. And because of agreed-to schedules, we only have a \ncouple of days next week. And then we have just 2 weeks after that \nbefore the Founders' Day recess. In that period of time it would be my \nhope we could do the economic recovery, the election reform, the farm \nbill, and an energy bill as well.\n  That is a lot to do, but if we can make every day count--beginning \nwith this one--I think we can do it. I am\n\n[[Page S5]]\n\nhopeful Republicans and Democrats can work together to ensure that \nhappens.\n  As I said, we also need to finish the farm bill. We do not need \nanother year or another month to know we have to build on what has been \ndone already.\n  Since the Freedom to Farm bill was passed in 1996, farm income has \ndropped 25 percent. USDA now warns that unless we pass a new farm bill \nor more emergency assistance quickly, farm income could drop another 20 \npercent this year alone.\n  The farm bill is economic recovery for rural America. So we ask that \nwe can work together again on this legislation. Let's work to pass it \nimmediately. Let's go to conference. Let's resolve our differences. And \nlet's get this legislation on the President's desk.\n  As I noted, the President shares the view that Republicans and \nDemocrats have advocated with regard to energy. We need a national \nenergy plan. The administration has proposed a plan which relies a good \ndeal on adding to production. Their view is that we drill on certain \nsensitive lands on which I personally have some objection. The House-\npassed version of that plan would add $34 billion in tax relief for \nenergy companies.\n  What Democrats would do is have a balance between the need for new \nproduction and what we ought to do with conservation and with \nalternative energy development. Let's reduce America's dependence on \nnot just foreign oil but on oil, period. That ought to be part of the \ndebate we have on energy.\n  There is a lot of work to be done in a very short period of time. I \nhope we can do all of that in the time we have allotted for these very \nimportant bills.\n  We also need to pass terrorism reinsurance. Efforts to solve this \ncomplex problem last year were impeded by some who sought to use this \nissue to push other extraneous issues. This year we will need to work \ntogether to assess the real needs of the marketplace and provide real \nsolutions--the sooner, the better.\n  Our second responsibility is to continue to lay the foundation for \nlong-term economic growth. An essential part of that foundation is \nexpanded trade. Last month, the Finance Committee passed a bill that \ngives the President expanded trade promotion authority and addresses \nimportant labor and environmental issues related to trade. The \ncommittee also passed a bill to expand trade adjustment assistance, \nincluding assistance for farmers who are displaced by global trade.\n  Early this year we will bring to the Senate floor a fast-track bill \nthat includes both of these essential components, and I hope we will \npass it with broad bipartisan support.\n  Expanded trade was a key factor in the economic boom of the 1990s. \nOther key factors were fiscal discipline and increased productivity \nmade possible by advances in technology. To keep America's \ntechnological edge, we should take final action on the Export \nAdministration Act this year. We should expand broadband Internet \naccess and work to make it universal, the same as telephone service, \nthis year. We should find a way to make R tax credits permanent this \nyear, and we should build on the bipartisan success of our new \neducation bill passed last year by expanding opportunities to go to \ncollege or attend a training program and by working toward full funding \nof the Individuals with Disabilities Act so that children with \ndisabilities can develop their skills to the fullest potential. After \nall, the minds of our young people are our best hope for long-term \neconomic growth.\n\n  Our third responsibility is to increase families' economic security. \nWe should raise the minimum wage $1.50 an hour over 2 years so people \nwho work full time don't have to live in poverty. In 1996, we changed \nwelfare programs to say if you are able-bodied, you should work. Since \nthen we have seen dramatic decreases in the State caseloads and \nincreases in the number of people moving from welfare to work. For too \nmany families, however, moving off welfare has not meant moving out of \npoverty. We need to strengthen welfare reform this year and make sure \npeople who move from welfare to work have access to affordable child \ncare, transportation, and health care so they can actually make a \nbetter life for themselves and their children.\n  We need to expand affordable health coverage to uninsured Americans. \nWe need to pass a real, enforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. Insurers \nshould not be able to deny medical care once you get sick, and \ncertainly they should not be able to deny care or coverage based on the \nresults of genetic tests that indicate you might get sick someday.\n  President Bush says he opposes genetic discrimination. We hope to \nwork with him this year to prohibit both employers and insurers from \nusing genetic test results as a basis for discrimination and to prevent \ndisclosure of genetic information to banks, employers, and anyone else \nwho has no legitimate need for information.\n  The collapse of Enron has left thousands of former Enron employees \nsuddenly fearful of growing old in poverty. For every Enron worker, \nthere are tens of thousands of workers in other companies who worry \nthat they could share the same fate. We have a responsibility to look \nat everything from Federal rules governing 401(k) pension plans to \ncorporate disclosure requirements under securities laws, to accounting \nreforms and whether the accounting industry's self-regulatory system is \nsufficient.\n  We need to learn what happened and then work together to prevent it \nfrom ever happening again. We must also work together this year to \nprotect, not privatize, America's public retirement system, Social \nSecurity, and Medicare, and to add real prescription drug coverage to \nMedicare. Half measures such as voluntary discount cards that just push \nthe costs off on pharmacists and provide little savings to seniors are \nsimply not adequate.\n  Our fourth responsibility is to strengthen homeland security. On \nSeptember 11 and when the anthrax letter was opened in my office, we \nsaw how devastating it can be when terrorists are able to slip through \nthe holes in our homeland security. We need to work in a bipartisan \nmanner to close those holes as quickly as possible.\n  We were puzzled during the debate on economic recovery when some \ninsisted that strengthening our homeland defense was not an emergency. \nWe are pleased by new reports that indicate the administration has now \ndecided to devote real attention and resources to homeland security, \nand we will certainly work with them to do so.\n  Our fifth responsibility is to strengthen the security of our basic \ndemocratic rights and institutions. That includes the right of every \nAmerican to vote and have that vote count. A year ago, we had just come \nthrough the most difficult Presidential election in our lifetimes. \nSince then, Senators Dodd, McConnell, Bond, Schumer, and Torricelli \nhave come up with a bipartisan plan to strengthen our election system. \nI intend to bring their bill up as soon as possible. The American \npeople are asking--fairly, I believe--whether our campaign system is \npart of the reason Enron was able to do what it did. Whether that is \ntrue or not, the mere suspicion that it might be true is damaging to \nour democracy.\n\n  House supporters need only three more signatures on a discharge \npetition to bring the Shays-Meehan bill to the floor. I expect they \nwill get those votes and pass a good, comprehensive campaign finance \nreform bill this year. We must change the system now.\n  One of the heroes who defied the hijackers on flight 93 was Mark \nBingman, a gay man. His courage may have helped save this very \nbuilding. This year we should have the courage to pass ENDA, the \nEmployment Non-Discrimination Act, and prohibit employers from \ndiscriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. We must also pass \nthe bipartisan bill expanding the Federal hate crimes law to include \ngender, sexual orientation, and disability, and to provide greater \nprotections against crimes motivated by racial and religious bias.\n  Scott Beamer will always be remembered for those final brave words: \n``Let's roll.'' His new daughter Morgan, born just 15 days ago, is \nprobably the best known of the babies born to fathers who died in the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks. But she is not the only one. So far \nthere are 17 such babies, including a pair of twins. By summer there \nwill be 40 more babies born to fathers who died in the September 11 \nattacks. Every day in America, 11,000 babies are born.\n\n[[Page S6]]\n\n  Last year was one of the saddest in our Nation's life. As we begin \nthis new session, with its new challenges and new opportunities, let us \nremember those who died on September 11. But let us also remember the \nchildren they left behind, some of whom they never even had the chance \nto see or hold. Let us also remember the other children who are \ndepending on us to pass on to them an America that is filled with as \nmuch hope, freedom, and possibility as the Nation we inherited from our \nown parents.\n  Let us resolve together to find a way to meet the most important of \nall of our responsibilities. I am confident that we can.\n  I look forward to working with our Republican leader, as I have \nalways done at the outset of a new session of Congress. This year is \ncertainly one of those years again.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S6-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6-S8]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WORKING TOGETHER FOR AMERICAN SECURITY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Daschle for his \nopening statement. I see a lot in his remarks that should give us \nencouragement and hope that we can come together and achieve things \nthat need to be done this year in the Congress for the American people. \nRegardless of party, regardless of past difficulties, we should try to \nfind a way to work together.\n  There's a common word between what Senator Daschle said and what I \nwill be saying, if you look at what we have in our remarks and the \nthrust of those remarks. That word is ``security.'' We need to pay \nclose attention this year more than ever to that issue, that word. We \nneed strong national security. We need to make sure that our men and \nwomen have the tools, the weapons, whatever they need to deal with the \nthreat of terrorism and with threatened democracy wherever we may find \nit in the world. We also need to have personal security for our people \nhere at home.\n  Last year brought so many startling things to our attention. Never \nbefore had we been attacked here at home like we were last year. And \nso, this year working on homeland security, working on personal \nsecurity, we have to find a way to protect American people. Surely \nthat's one of the obligations that we have as a Congress, to at least \nbe safe and secure here at home.\n  The only way we can look after our national security and personal \nsecurity is to have economic security. We've got to make sure that \nAmerica is strong, that our economy is growing, that jobs are being \ncreated, that Americans have the opportunity to get a job, a good \npaying job, and to keep that job. And when they have a problem, on a \ntemporary basis, that there's something there for them, that there will \nbe unemployment compensation. But we don't want them just to have a \ncheck for tomorrow.\n  We want a job for the future. Both of them are important. But we've \ngot to look at economic security this year. We've got to take some \nactions in the Congress, by restraint, perhaps, by encouragement in \nother ways, so that we can have a stimulus to the economy, so there is \nsome commonality in the themes of what's been said here today.\n  I think we've gotten off to a good start this morning. The President \ncalled the bipartisan, bicameral congressional leadership to the White \nhouse, and we met for 35 minutes, started right on time, ended right on \ntime. He talked to us about what's happening around the world, our \nthreats abroad and at home and what we needed to do with the economy. \nHe listened to us. He extended a hand of cooperation. I believe that \nthis President has changed the tone in Washington. He has tried to work \nwith the Congress. We have produced a bipartisan vote, House and \nSenate, for major tax reform and tax relief for the American people \nlast year. We did come together on the most fundamental education \nreform in 35 years. A lot of people thought the Thursday before we got \nthe conference agreement it couldn't happen, but it did happen. And we \ncame together--Republicans, Democrats, Liberals, Conservatives, \nPresident Bush. We got an agreement the America people liked.\n  I think that President Bush is going to be persistent in calling on \nus to do our work, to work through the procedure, the process. But to \ndo our work, to produce the things we need for our country.\n\n  Last year we had a tremendous period of cooperation and \nbipartisanship. And then we kind of lost it there at the end. Maybe--\nmaybe we were tired. The issues were different. Maybe we got to \nthinking about politics again. We kind of lost our ability to come \ntogether on an economic stimulus package. We didn't produce an energy \nbill. We didn't do trade. We didn't do agriculture. And we left a lot \nof nominations on the calendar. That was last year.\n  Now let's do it. Let's get this job done. And each one of those--\nthose issues--were mentioned by Senator Daschle in his remarks, today.\n  Right now we're working to see if we can come up with some substance \nand a process and a procedure so that we can, in fact, consider and \nhopefully get a result on the economic security package, and we're \nworking on what the substance might be and what the procedures may be. \nRight now we're working in a bipartisan way with three Senators, \nMcConnell, Dodd, Bond, and others--Senator Dodd as chairman of the \nRules Committee. They've come together on election reform.\n  Now, is it perfect? Would we all like it just like it is? Not \nnecessarily. Will some amendments be offered? Surely. But there's a \ncase where when it looked like it was going to be a partisan shootout, \nthey've come together. And so this afternoon we're working to see if we \ncan identify amendments and come up with a procedure to do this bill, \nperhaps in short order. Boy, wouldn't that stun people? The House has \nacted. Let's act in the Senate. Let's do it in a bipartisan way.\n  So, I'm encouraged. It is a new year. We have a window of \nopportunity. The President is doing his part. We're working to see if \nwe can move some of these things that have stalled out. We should do \nthat, and I will do all I can to try to encourage that and foster that. \nIt'll take, again, working together and a little trust here and there, \nbut there is a period here when we can accomplish, I think, a good deal \nfor the country.\n  As we look back on last year and the horrors of September, we've been \ndoing a lot. We've come together. I think we've changed. We changed for \na while last year. Could we build on that attitude this year?\n  You know, the American people's attitude toward the Congress in terms \nof a favorable rating went up to the highest its ever been. Why was \nthat?\n  It's because the American people saw us working together and doing \nwhat ought to be done. Rising above party. Now, over the last couple of \nmonths, those numbers have started coming back down. I would like to \ndrive them back up. When you talk pure politics I've been on both \nsides. I've been in the majority and the minority. I've been in \nsituations where we gained seats, held our own, lost seats. But I've \nfigured out something. When we do our work, when we produce results, if \nyou're in a leadership position, it pays positive dividends. People \nlike it when they see us doing what we ought to be doing.\n  So we should look at the courage and the sacrifice of those who gave \ntheir lives last year, the families that have endured a terrible time \nhere over the past four months--the courage of the firefighters, the \npolicemen, the calm of Mayor Giuliani. Now there's a guy who rose above \npolitics. I saw people cheering for him, chanting his name when they \ncould have been chanting Senator Daschle's and mine. No, they were \nchanting Giuliani when we went to see Ground Zero. He rose to the \noccasion. When we look at the loyal support from overseas, the \nleadership of the President, when we look at how we did come together, \nthen I think we can and should be able to learn from that and rise \nabove just the normal things we get into here.\n\n  Our soldiers are fighting overseas right now. They're fighting for \nfreedom. They're counting on us to give them the help they need. It \nwould help if we could show this is a different time and a different \nplace and we all learn something from September.\n  Next Tuesday, President Bush is going to deliver his State of the \nUnion Address. I think the Congress will be wanting to hear what his \nagenda is, will listen very carefully to it. I believe\n\n[[Page S7]]\n\nhe'll call for the country and the American people to come together and \nsupport him and follow him. Yes, there's a legislative process and this \nvery morning he said, I think we need a stimulus package. I understand \nthe Senate has got a unique set of rules. You've got to deal with the \nprocess. You deal with the process but let's get this job done. He'll \ngive us an agenda, and I believe the American people and the majority \nof the Senate of both parties, a large number in the Senate, will \nsupport what he wants to do in economic security, energy security, \nnational security. I do think that we need to pay attention to the \neconomy. There are signs that, well, yes, maybe it's improving but \nwe're not quite sure exactly if it's improving enough. We see States \nstruggling with their budgets.\n  We had a recession coming on going back to last March. It was clearly \nexacerbated by September 11. Are there some things we could do to at \nleast sort of fill the interim here to help those who are unemployed \nbut also to give incentive to small businessmen and women to create \nsome more jobs, to have the economy grow?\n  We may not need it, but what if we do? What if we say let's wait and \nsee and we wake up 6 months, 9 months, a year from now and say oh, my \ngoodness this recession is not ending like it should? We can give some \nincentives that would be positive. I think we ought to try and find a \nway to do it. There are going to be people who try and find a way to do \nnothing. We can have gridlock. I don't want that. I think we ought to \nfind a way to get a result to produce an economic stimulus package that \nis stimulative, not one that raises taxes, not one that's just more \nspending but one that actually will contribute to the creation of jobs.\n  So I think that's something we should focus on here in the next few \ndays. And I'm willing to work with Senator Daschle and see if we can do \nthat.\n  As a part of our economic security, we need a trade bill. I can \nunderstand that there will be features of the trade debate that need to \nbe discussed. There will be amendments. But we passed a bill out of the \nFinance Committee 6 weeks ago or so on a large bipartisan vote. I voted \nfor it. Senator Daschle voted for it. Let's get it up. Let's get it \npassed. Let's get to the President the authority he needs to expand the \nopportunity for trade. I think it will help our farmers. I think it \nwill help out small businessmen and women. I think it will help our \nneighbors.\n  When I look to Central and South America, I see millions upon \nmillions of people that could benefit from the trade, the products, the \ncommodities that we could provide them. Let's pursue that. That would \nhelp our farmers. We need a farm bill, no question about it.\n  I was very unhappy with the way we ended on the farm bill. Maybe we \nhad to do that. Maybe we had to wring out the politics a little bit so \nwe can then really produce a farm bill. I would call upon Senator \nHarkin and the leaders on both sides of the aisle to see if we can find \na way to improve the bill that's pending, get a bipartisan bill, but \nget it into conference and get something that hopefully won't take too \nlong, that hopefully will not hurt agriculture in the future, that the \nPresident can sign so that our men and women in the businesses and all \nthe people who depend on agriculture--including the consumer--some \ncertainty as what they could expect. Again it won't be perfect but just \nthe knowledge that it's coming and what they'll be able to do would be \nvery positive.\n\n  I've been complaining about the energy situation for years. I really \ndon't understand why in America we can't have a national energy policy. \nI don't understand why we are dependent for 59.6 percent of our energy \nneeds on foreign oil.\n  Some people say, oh, you guys, all you want is just more opportunity \nto drill. That's not so. I do think we could get more oil of our own. \nI'm from an area where there's a lot of natural gas--clean--and I think \nit can be made accessible to the American people if we can get it out \nof the ground or from under the gulf or wherever it may be and develop \na transmission or grid system to get it where it needs to be. I think \nwe need to use coal.\n  I think we ought to pursue clean coal technology. I think we ought to \npromote conservation, encourage alternative fuels. I don't think we \nought to believe that we're really going to conserve ourselves out of \nthe need for energy. We're going to need it. And even though there may \nbe tremendous opportunities technologically for the future and we \nshould pursue those, I don't think that we're going to be able to \nproduce 20 percent or 25 percent of our energy needs from alternative \nfuels or things that we don't now have for years. Let's be realistic \nbut let's do it.\n  We went through the fiasco in the late 1970s of gas lines. We passed \nlegislation. We tried to use alternative and find alternative fuels. A \nlot of them didn't work out. I was willing to try some of them. As I \nrecall, coal gasification was one. I don't know if that ever quite \nworked. Maybe we've learned more since then and we can go into that \narea. But let's just do it. The day is coming when our energy needs are \ngoing to be a huge problem. It's going to be a national security \nproblem, an economic problem. If just one oil producing country had a \nproblem and cut us off, 25 percent of the world's oil needs would \ndisappear. I don't like that. I'm looking for alternatives.\n  We've got a lot of products in Mississippi we could use, maybe in a \ndifferent way like wood chips. We've got derivatives from cotton \nproducts. If there's some way we can burn that or convert it as a form \nof power, we ought to try it. I think we should go forwards.\n  Senator Daschle has committed to me and to the American people that \nwe're going to go to this bill in early February, and we should not let \nit be taken down by a filibuster one side or the other. Let's get it \ndone. We'll find a way to do it, I believe.\n  Nothing will be more important this year than what we do in national \nsecurity defense. The President is going to ask for increased funds. I \nthink he's going to be in a mood to introduce reform of our defense \ncapabilities. I think that's needed. We need to continue to have \nmultinational support.\n  When I look at the support we have gotten from countries all around \nthe world--Britain, Australia, Italy, Germany, New Zealand, Russia, \nCanada, Turkey, Jordan, Poland, Japan, and countries we never before \ncould have counted as allies. Look at what has happened with Russia. \nWho would have believed a year ago we would be doing the things we're \ndoing with Russia today. Very few people.\n  But we still have a lot of challenges there. And we see opportunities \nwith other countries. Is there some hope in some of those countries \nthat have harbored terrorists but now are saying maybe we don't want to \ndo that anymore. The President has been willing to step up and say \nmutual assured destruction is a relic of the past. Europeans say, oh, \nmy goodness, he can't say that. What will the Russians say. They say we \ndon't agree but we understand. We will work with America. America is \nnot our enemy anymore. That's an incredible development.\n\n  So I think this is going to be an area that's going to take a lot of \ntime and thought from all of us. And there will be nothing more \nimportant.\n  I think we should build on what we did in education. We haven't yet \nsucceeded in reaching a situation where we'll leave no child behind. We \nneed to go back and look at other education reform.\n  I think the Disabilities and Education Act will require reforming. I \nthink the system is being abused by many people who should not be on \nthe program and therefore is taking away from others who do need \nadditional help. We can work through that.\n  I call on Senator Daschle and the Democrats to work with us on these \nnominations. This President is entitled to his nominees unless there's \na huge problem. We've got nominees on the calendar here that got held \nup for a variety of reasons. We had Senators who were concerned about \ncertain bills, so they objected to moving nominations. But we don't \nhave an Ambassador to the Philippines. We have a nominee on the \ncalendar. It's been reported out of the committee. We've got troops \ngoing into the Philippines. We don't have an Ambassador.\n  The position of the person who is in charge of nuclear safety is \nempty, yet the nominee is on the calendar. There's 50 such nominations \non the Senate calendar. Let's try again. Let's move\n\n[[Page S8]]\n\nthose nominees, particularly for the President's administration. It is \nhis administration. Surely Assistant Secretary, Solicitor's General, \nInspector's General, Ambassadors should be confirmed. And the judges, \nI'm not going to go through the litany here.\n  The fact is we've got a lot of people who are not being treated \nfairly. I don't understand why Miguel Estrada has not been moved. He's \nan immigrant from Honduras. He's well educated and is an outstanding \nattorney but hasn't even had a hearing. We ought to move not only the \ndistrict judges but the circuit judges. Let's move judicial nominees if \nthere are not problems. Let's pick up the speed. I know the President \nwould appreciate that. The President deserves that. We can do better.\n  There will be those we want to fight over. We'll have a vote on them. \nWe'll have a debate on them, but let's at least do it. My impression is \nwe have about 50 on the calendar and about a hundred in committees--150 \njudges and administration officials. I think we need to go back and \ntake a deep breath and get that job done.\n  From my discussions with this President, I can tell you: He is as \ndetermined to pull this country out of this economic recession as he \nhas been to put an end to the terrorist threat.\n  It was 100 years ago that President Teddy Roosevelt uttered that quip \nwe all remember: ``Speak softly and carry a big stick.''\n  One thing I have found out about President Bush is that he does speak \nsoftly, but he carries a heavy agenda because the needs of our country \nare great and the expectations of the American people are great. But \nour opportunities for accomplishment are great, too. And frankly, our \nchances as a government institution are great at showing the American \npeople how men and women of good will can meet halfway and then when \nthey disagree, take a fair vote to see whose argument will prevail, \ncomplete their work on that matter, and move on to the next priority. \nThat's all we on the Republican side of the aisle can ask.\n  Let's begin today. Let's get some agreements on how we'll proceed on \nthese to important bills. Let's continue next week when we hear the \nPresident's State of the Union Address. Let's see how much we can do in \nthe next 3 months. I believe that American people want that. And I know \nthey would appreciate it. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I commend both leaders for their comments \nabout the proposed agenda. While I certainly am not in a position to \ncomment on the merits or demerits of the various proposals that have \nbeen suggested, there is one item in which the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky and I are particularly interested. We are grateful to the \nmajority leader and the Republican leader for making specific reference \nto the election reform proposal the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. \nMcConnell, Senator Bond, Senator Schumer, Senator Torricelli, Senator \nDurbin, and others have worked on to bring legislation to the point \nwhere we think we have a good product to present to our colleagues, to \nthe Congress as a whole, ultimately to the President for his signature, \nand, more importantly, to the American people in response to a \nsituation that did not merely occur in one State, in one election, but \nas we all know now for a number of years a slow deteriorating process \nof our election system to such a degree that it was crying out reform.\n  While we have not solved every single problem, we think we have set \nup a mechanism for the first time to deal with election issues for the \nforeseeable future, under a proposal offered by my colleague from \nKentucky, a permanent commission, which I think is an excellent \nsuggestion. We deal with some fraud issues that Senator Bond thinks are \nvery important if we are going to have an election reform issue. While \nwe may not have dealt with every issue, we think we have taken a major \nstep in addressing some of the concerns he has raised.\n  For those of us who are interested in the disabled in this country, \nthose who were denied an opportunity to vote who had a right to vote--\nmany studies indicate that happened in far more cases than any of us \nwould like to admit--we think we have put together a pretty good \npackage for which we are very proud. That is not to suggest we have \ndotted every ``i'' and crossed every ``t'' and thought about every \npossible reform or improvement, but we think we have about as good a \nproduct as could be presented to a body such as this for their \nconsideration.\n  I do not know what the agenda will be of the leadership, but I think, \nfor myself and Senator McConnell, we are prepared to go forward when \nthey would like us to go. Whenever that is appropriate, we are ready to \npresent a proposal we think will enjoy very broad-based support, not \nonly in this Chamber but throughout the country, including the National \nAssociation of Secretaries of State and others who have worked with us, \nand various other organizations around the country that are deeply \ninterested in the election process.\n  I see my friend from Kentucky, to whom I would be happy to yield, but \nI say first when the bell rings and the leadership decides it is \nappropriate, these two Members and others who joined us and are \nprepared to present a proposal that we hope will enjoy the kind of \nsupport for which we think it is deserving.\n  I yield to my friend from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I echo the remarks of my good friend \nfrom Connecticut. Election reform had the potential of being an \nintensely partisan issue. While we know that may still develop, let me \nsay we have had all of those discussions over the last 6 months in our \nnegotiating process, and we have now come together with the hope we \nwill be able to go forward in a totally bipartisan way to improve the \nelection system in this country.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut, who has provided outstanding \nleadership on this issue, has indicated, we have dealt with the fraud \nissue, which is important to a lot of people on this side of the aisle. \nNo one has been a more forceful advocate for removing barriers for the \ndisabled to exercise the franchise. Senator Dodd carried that ball very \neffectively in our negotiations.\n  I thought we needed a permanent repository for this kind of \nexpertise, so we set up a commission with Presidential appointees \nequally divided between Republicans and Democrats. It would be the one \nplace in America that States and localities could go for objective \nadvice, not somebody knocking on the door trying to sell them a \nparticular system but objective advice about the best way to meet their \nparticular election needs.\n  We did not wipe out any particular election system in America. We did \nnot mandate the use of any particular election system. We did provide \nsome real money that would be dispensed on a matching fund basis by \nthis Presidential commission to those who were interested in upgrading \ntheir system.\n  I think we have come forward with a good bill, and I thank my friend \nfrom Connecticut for his leadership on this subject. I have been happy \nto join with him on it. If and when we do go to this--and we think it \nwill be early in the session--we would encourage people to offer \namendments that are related to the subject. We think this is a bill \nthat needs to move along, not be bogged down in extraneous matters \nunrelated to the subject.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I look forward to \nworking with him. We are ready to go whenever the leaders decide this \nis the subject matter before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I anticipate the arrival of my colleague \nfrom New Jersey, Senator Corzine, at any moment because we would like \nto at least put our colleagues on notice today of our intention to \nintroduce legislation to strengthen the independence and objectively of \ncorporate audits in this country.\n  I have the fortunate job of being the chairman of the Securities \nSubcommittee of the Banking Committee\n\n[[Page S9]]\n\nof the Senate. I have held that position for a number of years, both as \nchairman and as the ranking Democrat during Republican majorities in \nthis Chamber, and have worked very closely with a number of my \ncolleagues on a variety of issues affecting the securities industry, \nthe confidence in our markets.\n  Obviously, the events we have heard about over the last number of \ndays involving the Enron Corporation and Arthur Andersen's accounting \nfirm and other questions have raised some issues that Senator Corzine \nand I think need addressing. They have been discussed in the past. We \nhave never codified some of these issues, but they have been the \nsubject of extensive debate and discussion as how best to proceed.\n  We do not have the specific bill yet to put before the Senate today. \nWe will in the coming few days, possibly as early as next week or the \nweek after. We will lay out what we think is a framework for how, at \nleast from the perspective of investor confidence, the accounting \nindustry particularly needs to deal with the issue of consultive \nservices and auditing services that they provide.\n  Our financial markets are the most vibrant in the world. That is \nstated over and over again. It cannot be stated often enough because it \nis true. There is a very simple reason for that continued success and \nthat is because investors have confidence when they take their hard-\nearned money and in America they invest it in the public companies of \nthis Nation. The world comes to the United States to invest because \nthey know they will receive, very simply, a fair and honest deal. It is \nthat simple.\n  There may be other factors and certainly we know that around the \nworld there may be potentially a better return on one's investment in \nAsian markets and European markets or elsewhere, but the world comes to \nthe United States because they know, while there may not be the \nopportunity to maybe make as much on their investment as may be offered \nelsewhere, that in this country if one comes here, our system is fair. \nOur system is fair and just, and that is one of the great attractions \nto domestic investors as well as foreign investors.\n  We can point to the depth of liquidity in this country, the degree of \nefficiencies in our markets, but ultimately the investing public, both \ninternationally and domestically, invests in our markets and our \ncompanies because they believe the public information about these \ncompanies is true and it is accurate.\n  The accounting profession has played an incredibly important role in \nattaining and ensuring this investor confidence, and they deserve great \ncredit, in my view, for the tremendous job they have done historically. \nThe seal of approval that our accounting firms provide is a franchise \nof which we should be immensely proud in this country, and I think most \nof us are.\n  However, that franchise is in danger of losing the investing public's \ntrust. Once lost, that trust would be difficult, if not impossible, to \nrecover, at least in the short term.\n\n  In recent years, there have been a series of very high-profile \naccounting failures. The Enron failure may be the most prominent case, \nbut it is certainly not an isolated incident. Indeed, it is only the \nlatest, perhaps the most publicized, incident in a troubling series of \nincidents calling into question the integrity of corporate audits. More \nfinancial restatements on corporate earnings have been filed in the \npast 3 years than in the previous 10 years combined. These restatements \nhave in most instances dramatically downgraded the financial health of \nthe companies in question.\n  The collapse of Enron, specifically the seemingly massive failure of \nauditors to recognize and act on the myriad of financial reporting \nirregularities, focuses our attention on a central question: Are \nreforms needed to preserve and strengthen the integrity of the audit \nprocess? I have come to the conclusion that they are.\n  The accounting profession is undergoing tremendous change. Accounting \nfirms no longer simply provide audit services. In response to our \ndynamic economy, they have adapted to become full-service financial \nconsulting companies. I strongly support the diversification that is \noccurring in the accounting industry. In many cases, this development \nof expanding their services has allowed them to provide far better \naudits than they did in the past. However, these changes must not come, \nin my view, at the expense of these accounting firms' Federal mandate \nto provide objective and independent financial reporting. Conflict of \ninterest, even the perception of conflict, undermines the confidence of \nthe investing public.\n  I do not believe the Enron collapse was caused solely by the lack of \nauditor independence. That would be a terribly naive conclusion to \ndraw. Many facts are yet to be uncovered. However, it is well known \nthat the company's auditor received greater compensation for the \nnonaudit services it provided to Enron than for the audit services it \nprovided. No one could fail to be troubled by the simple fact that \nthere was compensation of $27 million for consulting services and $25 \nmillion for auditing services. No one can say it does not raise \nquestions about the objectivity of the audit process.\n  No one, I believe, can seriously argue that when all the questions \nhave been raised, we should not do everything possible to strengthen \nthe independence and objectivity of financial audits. That is what we \nrely on.\n  There is an inherent conflict. The auditor's compensation is paid for \nby the very company being audited. We cannot change that. The only way \nI suppose would be to establish some Government agency or huge division \nwithin the Securities and Exchange Commission that would conduct the \nGovernment audits of public companies. I don't know that anyone \nsuggests that. I am not suggesting we ought to change the present \nsystem of having these accounting firms conduct these audits.\n  The problem is, if that same company is not only providing the audit \nbut also providing a variety of other services, there is the \nperception, at the least, of a problem. I use the analogy of hiring a \nconstruction firm to build your house while the contractor is also the \nbuilding inspector. One may end up with a great house, but there are \nsome inherent concerns for the homeowner about whether or not the \nconstruction would be done as well, as soundly, and met all the \nrequirements.\n\n  I do not believe the fact that the Enron Corporation hired Arthur \nAndersen to be its consultant and auditor necessarily caused this \nentire problem, but the fact is when a firm is doing both those \nfunctions for the same company, the investor confidence so critical to \nthe success of our markets comes in question.\n  For those reasons, Senator Corzine of New Jersey and I plan to \nintroduce legislation in the coming days to implement four critical \nreforms to the auditing process.\n  First, it restricts auditors from offering nonaudit service to audit \nclients. Accounting firms could continue to provide audit and nonaudit \nservices to clients, but they could not offer both services to the same \nclient. I don't think that is an outrageous suggestion. I am not \nsuggesting they ought not provide consulting services. It strengthens \nthe audit process. If one client is providing those two services to the \nsame client, there is at least a perception of a serious problem. I \nsuggest that Enron's problem is not an isolated case; it is more \nwidespread.\n  Again, accounting firms continue to provide audit and nonaudit \nservices. They cannot offer both. This restriction builds upon the \nimportant work in this area performed by former SEC Chairman Arthur \nLevitt and former SEC chief accountant Lynn Turner, who should be \ncommended for their tireless efforts. The SEC's current auditor \nindependence rule has helped but, in my view, is inadequate to ensure \nfull auditor independence.\n  Second, we propose a prohibition on any accounting firm providing an \naudit for a company whose comptroller or chief financial officer has \nworked for such accounting firm in the previous 2 years. This will help \nreduce the potential for conflict of interest that may arise when \naccountants become senior executives at companies they audited.\n  Third, we strengthen the independence of the standard-setting body \nfor the accounting profession, the Financial Accounting Standards \nBoard. The FASB is acknowledged around the world as the best accounting \nstandard setter. But the FASB often comes\n\n[[Page S10]]\n\nunder tremendous pressure from a variety of sources to adopt standards \nthat could cloud rather than clarify a company's health from the point \nof view of investors.\n  A few years ago a suggestion was made that Congress would legislate \ncertain accounting practices that the FASB would have to sanction. I \ndid not necessarily disagree with some who were raising the issue about \nvarious accounting procedures or practices. The idea that Congress \nwould get in the business of legislating, by margins of 51-to-49 votes \nin this body, is a frightening prospect--that we would so politicize \nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board. I can only thank those who \nmay have agreed as I did, or at least partially agreed with some who \nmade the suggestion, that we did not allow that to happen. Certainly \nFASB needs to remain independent and not subjected to the kind of \npolitical pressures suggested some time ago.\n  Our legislation also improves the independence and effectiveness of \nFASB by securing a steady funding source and encouraging greater \ntimeliness of actions. One problem is they are very slow. They cannot \nkeep up with what is going on in the real economy. FASB needs to act \nexpeditiously in response to issues.\n\n  Lastly, our legislation improves the ability of the SEC to improve \naudit quality by doubling the size of the SEC accounting staff. \nPresently, the accounting staff is 20 to 25 people, the size of a \ncongressional office, for oversight over all of the accounting firms \nand the audits that occur in the country. I am not suggesting just more \npersonnel will necessarily solve the problem, but by increasing the \nsize of that staff, and then having more random audits of the audits \ndone, the prospect has its own obvious benefit to this potential \nproblem. SEC accountants would help the agency do a better job of \nensuring that audits meet the high standards of independence and \nobjectivity that have been a hallmark of the American accounting \nprofession.\n  In closing, I have spoken about the reforms with a number of \nknowledgeable people over the last several days, including those in the \naccounting profession. They have said privately these reforms go a long \nway to strengthening audits and the confidence of the American public. \nI look forward to working with Chairman Sarbanes, who has already \nannounced good hearings on the broader issue we are dealing with, and \nwith the former SEC Commissioners, and has invited the chief \naccountants of the SEC to talk to our committee in a formal hearing \nsetting. That will be tremendously helpful in examining what may be the \nbest way to proceed. What we want to do after we lay down a bill is \ninvite these people to respond before the committees conducting \nhearings on the subject matter.\n  I see my friend and colleague from New Jersey who brings a wealth of \nexperience to this subject matter. In his previous life he worked for \nmany years in the financial services sector. He is recognized in this \nChamber and elsewhere for the tremendous amount of knowledge he \nacquired over the years in this area. I am pleased to be joining with \nhim in this piece of legislation.\n  Before I turn to my friend from New Jersey, my friend from Missouri \nis here. He is a knowledge builder as to this subject matter as well. \nAs on most subjects, he has very strong feelings. I will not lure him \ninto that at this particular moment because I want to hear his \ncomments, if I may indulge my friend from New Jersey for a moment. \nSenator Bond and Senator McConnell and I have worked, for almost a \nyear, putting together an election reform bill. Senator McConnell was \nhere a few minutes ago talking about where things are and our \nwillingness to come to the floor for our leadership, who asked us to do \nso. I again say publicly how much I appreciate the tremendous effort of \nmy friend from Missouri. He is a great debater and tough negotiator, \nbut when he gives his hand and shakes, it is a done deal.\n  I ask unanimous consent to yield to my friend from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The time of the \nSenator from Connecticut has expired; he cannot yield. However, the \nChair recognizes the Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S10-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ELECTION REFORM\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut for \nattempting to be a floor manager, and I apologize to my colleague from \nNew Jersey.\n  I make a brief statement joining with my good friend from Connecticut \nand my friend from Kentucky in commending to this body the election \nreform bill. It was not just hours but weeks, and perhaps months, we \nworked on this. His dedication to getting a good election reform bill \nthrough means we will have something good with which to work. There \nshould be a lot of interest in this body because every single Member \ngot here through the process of politics. This measure, that will be \nbrought up, we hope very shortly, should ensure that everybody in \nAmerica is treated fairly in the election process. And that has no \ngreater champion than my friend from Connecticut.\n\n  As he indicated, I was interested in assuring that we prevent fraud. \nFor those who may not have read it, I commend to them an article by \nGeorge Will in the Washington Post today headlined, ``A Long Election \nDay in Missouri.'' He outlines the case far better than I would on the \nfloor. I just ask my colleagues to read it and see why part of the \nelection reform proposal goes to combating fraud.\n  As Mr. Will points out, our Secretary of State, Matt Blunt, reviewed \na small sample of ballots.\n\n       . . . among 1,384 ballots illegally cast [in St. Louis] \n     were 62 by felons, 79 by people registered at vacant lots, 68 \n     by people who voted twice and 14 [votes] cast in the name of \n     dead people.\n\n  The only thing we missed out on in that go-around was in the past we \nhave had dogs registered in St. Louis. As far as we could tell, no dogs \nvoted in the last election.\n  I had an opportunity to address a leadership group in St. Louis--a \nvery large group of people--during the recess. I told them the purpose \nof the Dodd-McConnell bill was to make sure that every American \ncitizen, and, frankly, for Missourians, every Missouri citizen, who was \na human adult American citizen entitled to vote had an opportunity to \nvote--once. I think everybody in St. Louis understands that. I think \neverybody around the country will.\n  We are going to have a very interesting discussion when we get onto \nthis bill. We have spent a lot of time crafting it. I do not doubt that \npeople will have new ideas they will bring to the floor. It should be a \nvery interesting debate, but it is something that goes to the heart, \nthe very heart of our form of government.\n  Everybody who is a U.S. citizen who is duly registered and entitled \nto vote in his or her State ought to have the opportunity to vote, but \nonly to vote once. If we can pass this bill and combine it with the \nbill the House has passed, I hope we will see a much improved voting \nsystem in the United States for the 2002 election.\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut. I look forward to working with \nhim and I, again with my apologies to my friend from New Jersey, yield \nthe floor. We look forward to getting on with it, to pursue the vitally \nneeded election reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I very much appreciate the opportunity to \nwork with Senator Dodd on something that I think is vital to the \nAmerican public, vital to the functioning of our financial markets and \nthe health of the economy generally. Just as electoral reform is \nimportant, and I congratulate yourself and the Senator from Missouri \nand others who are leading us in that fight, I hope we can get the same \nkind of bipartisan focus on something that I think will make a \ndifference to the functioning of our economy and our financial markets \nand the protection of investors that we are suggesting in the bill we \nare introducing today.\n  It is also unique on this side of the table to work with Senator \nDodd. I remember, as a former businessperson, testifying in Congress. \nSenator Dodd always asked the toughest, meanest questions of folks with \nideas they wanted to suggest. He was always spot-on with regard to \ntheir strengths and weaknesses. It is a great honor to work\n\n[[Page S11]]\n\nwith him in the effort to protect American investors by strengthening \nthe regulation of our accounting profession.\n  The dramatic and sudden collapse of the Enron Corporation has shined \na spotlight on the critical importance of auditors, the accounting \nfunction, in the operation of our economy. Enron's collapse has left \nthousands without a job and, maybe more important for many, without a \nchance for a meaningful retirement program that we worked so hard and \nlong to provide.\n  It has been an economic disaster for pensioners, individual \ninvestors, and even institutional investors who relied upon the \naccounting statements, earnings statements, balance sheets, and \nanalyses that flowed from that. Frankly, a lot of people think this \ncame right out of the blue. A year ago this was the company with the \nseventh largest revenue in the country. Today it is bankrupt. It did \ncatch people by surprise.\n\n  Now it appears that for years Enron engaged in a variety of \nquestionable and certainly gray accounting practices--not the most \ntransparent to the world--to hide debt and inflate its earnings so they \nwould have the ability to position their stock at a higher value over \ntime. We all took the hook. Yet Enron's auditors blessed these \narrangements and raised no serious red flags for investors, even though \nthey had some questions in their own minds. It is now obvious those \nindividual auditors failed, and I think failed miserably, in making \nsome judgments about what should have been published at the time.\n  Unfortunately, the failure of the auditors in the Enron case is not \nunique. We have seen several examples, highly public examples, of \nquestionable accounting practices leading to serious problems in the \nstatements of financial condition of companies across the country over \nthe last few years. There has been a failure to blow the whistle when \nthat should have occurred. In fact, we have seen a regular pattern that \nhas developed of earnings restatements by some of the finest companies \nand corporations in America.\n  That in and of itself gives cause for concern, since people make \njudgments about what it is they are going to do in the investment world \nbased on their interpretation of balance sheets and income statements \nthat are presented at a given point in time. That is how they make \nfuture judgments. Clearly, some of those judgments in history were \nwrong because the restatement of earnings indicates there were \ndifferences in fact.\n  I think we need to be much more careful in this whole process. There \nis a whole series of detailed issues that I think need to be \naddressed--maybe not by Congress but in a much more fast-footed FASB, \nor Financial Accounting Standard Board, than we have had.\n  Based on my experience in the real world--or the financial world; I \ndon't know whether that's the real world--I can point to several \npossible explanations for these accounting failures. One is the serious \nincrease in the complexity of these financial arrangements generally. \nThe issue of derivatives and off-balance-sheet financing and the matter \nof notional amounts versus revenue standards--all of those things are \nvery complicated in and of themselves. But there is an inadequacy, I \nbelieve, in our existing accounting structure to really scrutinize \nthese and get to the nub of how they are reported on a timely basis.\n  Another problem is accounting firms increasingly are facing extreme \npressures to find other sources of revenue, which often means \ngenerating new forms of revenue from the same businesses they audit. \nThis, obviously, can create conflicts in reality and certainly in \nappearance. And I think they undermine the independence required of \nauditors as we go forward.\n  Another problem is that our regulatory structure, in my view, has \nbeen inadequate. It has relied far too heavily on self-regulation by \nthe industry. That is a little bit like, what? Having the fox watch the \nhen house. Certainly I think it deals with an appearance issue that the \npublic has a right to have us ventilate as we go through this debate. I \nthink we need to do something about it.\n  Another problem is the integrity of the process for setting \naccounting standards. I talked about this before and whether that \nprocess has been compromised or certainly complicated by the nature of \nhow that process takes place. In some cases, as I heard Senator Dodd \ntalk about, the fault may lie right here in this body, in the Congress. \nCertainly there is the appearance of political pressure getting wrapped \nup in how FASB, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, sets its \nrules.\n  These are true professionals who work very hard to try to get to \nsetting down rules that will work in the accounting world. But these \nare complicated issues. And then sometimes people enter in from the \npolitical process and stop it, halt it, and we have not seen the kind \nof progress for the kind and nature of complexity that has developed in \nthe financial world.\n  The bill Senator Dodd and I are proposing is a significant first step \ntowards addressing the problems I have outlined in the accounting \nprofession. It includes tough new provisions to ensure the independence \nof auditors and restrict their ability to provide nonaudit services \nthat inevitably create conflicts of interest. Whether that comes when \nyou are working with the company or you separate it, I think we have \nsome real reasons for debate on that. But I think we will work very \nhard to make sure people have confidence that we are auditors and we \nare working on functioning with a given company to present the data in \na way that works a lot more like what the former SEC Chairman, Arthur \nLevitt, would suggest.\n  Also, our bill strengthens the Securities and Exchange Commission to \nput them in a better position to deal with the accounting industry on a \nreal-time basis. I heard Senator Dodd talk about 20 or 25 accountants \nfor the largest economy in the history of the world. A 10-trillion-\ndollar account economy, and we have 25 accountants sitting over in a \nbuilding across the street trying to figure out whether we are \nreporting accurately for all these companies. Just on the surface of \nit, it does not meet the standard of common sense.\n\n  We propose to double the size of the SEC's accounting staff. I think \nwe need to seriously review what resources are necessary to deal with \nthese problems so the public can have confidence with regard to what is \ngoing on in our accounting statements across the country.\n  In addition, the bill would help close the revolving door between \nauditors and their clients which also creates real conflicts of \ninterest. We have set up rules in other parts of our economy for people \nwho work in a particular area. An example is, if a person works in the \nEnergy Department, they cannot go to work for an energy company an hour \nand a half after they leave their job.\n  I think it raises serious issues involving conflicts of interest when \npeople go through a revolving door format going from being auditors to \nauditees. I think we need to look at those issues to make sure we have \nconfidence that the chief financial officers, and others who have \nworked with the accounting firms, are truly being challenged \nindependently by the accounting function. It is important.\n  As a former CEO, it was good to know that people could come in and \nsay: You have these kinds of problems you need to check out. That is \nwhere the independent auditor performs an enormous service, aside from \nthe financial statements. When that gets compromised because people are \nso close to one another, I think you run risks of setting up dangerous \nprecedents on how decisions are taken within the audit function.\n  Finally, our bill would strengthen the independence of the Financial \nAccounting Standards Board--I have talked about this; so has Senator \nDodd--which sets the accounting standards. We would do this by \nestablishing a steady funding source and demanding greater timeliness \nof action by the FASB. This is truly one of the issues that needs to be \naddressed.\n  We need to get on with a lot of the specific issues that have been \naddressed and have been tied up in knots for literally years and \ndecades inside the Financial Accounting Standards Board. I think we can \nmake a big difference in the functioning of our accounting system if we \nmake sure we provide the resources to allow them to do their job \nappropriately.\n  I believe these proposals will go a long way toward strengthening the \naccounting profession and protecting the\n\n[[Page S12]]\n\nintegrity of the markets and protecting, ultimately, the investors and \nthe retirees who are dependent on the information they derive from \nthese accounting statements.\n  It is absolutely essential we have this debate, this discussion, and \nthat we are intent on making sure we get to a secure system and that \nthis not be a political issue. This is about making sure our financial \nmarkets work effectively.\n  I look forward to working with my senior colleague from Connecticut \nwho has done such an outstanding job on a whole host of these issues. \nWe are working to gain the public's trust. One way to do that is to \nmake sure independent auditors are exactly that--independent.\n  I think we need to respond. I hope we can do that quickly. We need to \ndo it thoughtfully because we do not want to cause more problems than \nwe fix. It is one of those things where making sure it is done right is \nvery important because we are tinkering with the fundamentals of our \neconomy. But we need to have good accounting statements to make sure \npeople can make decisions on their investments in a way that is \nsensible and true to the facts as they stand.\n  I appreciate very much this opportunity to work with Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, over the recess I had the \nprivilege of going to the other side of planet Earth in the area of \ncentral Asia with 8 other of our colleagues. The delegation was led by \nthe Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, and the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain. In 7 days, we visited the heads of government of 6 \nnations. And what was a delightful surprise to our delegation was the \nfact that each one of the leaders of those countries wanted to express \nappreciation to the United States for us being involved in their \ncountries to help rid them of terrorists.\n  They implored us, after this initial thrust of military success, not \nto turn on our heels and walk away. Indeed, if you look back in \nhistory, the United States made a mistake a little over a decade ago. \nWe were involved, in the 1980s, in Afghanistan--albeit clandestine--as \nwe were helping the Afghans try to repel and expel the Soviet Union, \nwhich was trying to take over Afghanistan. And when the Soviet Union \nwas whipped and tucked its tail between its legs and left, then the \nUnited States left also. That created a political vacuum--a vacuum that \nbegs to be filled by political leaders, and that is the vacuum that was \nfilled by the terrorists--ultimately, the very repressive Taliban \nregime.\n  So let's take a lesson from history and let's not repeat it. Let's \nlisten to those leaders who said they don't necessarily want us to be \nthere in the long run in a military situation, but they want our help \nin advising them technically, agriculturally, about communication, and \nindeed in Afghanistan about stabilizing the country, about setting up a \nnational government, about setting up a national army so they can \nprotect themselves from these outside forces and from these insidious \nforces that well up within, which was the terrorist organizations.\n  It was quite illuminating. We met with the Prime Minister of Turkey, \nthe President of Uzbekistan, and the President of Turkmenistan.\n  We then flew into Bagram airfield with lights out in the middle of \nthe night for security reasons. Those young pilots were using night \nvision equipment, and I am telling you, Mr. President, they greased \nthat plane on to that runway with no runway lights, no airplane lights, \nand lights out on everything because of snipers, mortar, and rocket \nfire.\n  The descent was rapid, and the pilot did evasive maneuvers with the \nplane. The first instruction given to us before we stepped off the \nplane was: Do not dare step off the concrete tarmac because of the \nknown and the unknown landmines.\n  The sergeant who escorted me through the darkness told me about his \nbuddy who had his foot blown off just 2 days before traversing a \nfootpath that the sergeant who escorted me had traversed many times \nbefore and had escaped the lethal explosion of a landmine that \nultimately caught his buddy and caused the amputation of his foot.\n  We had the opportunity to meet with the interim Government of \nAfghanistan, with Chairman Hamid Karzai and his cabinet. What was very \ndistinct--not only their enthusiasm, their absolute intent on making a \nsuccess of a new kind of government that was not a repressive one--was \nthe fact that, for the first time, the cabinet had a new minister: A \nminister of women's affairs, a prominent Afghan woman. As we met with \nthat cabinet, they shared that message about being involved.\n  Chairman Karzai gave us an example of how for the long run he needed \nour help. He explained to us he was so appreciative of the humanitarian \nassistance and that it looked as if, for this winter, most of the \nstarvation had been avoided but for the long run they needed \nagricultural assistance. They needed the rains to come because without \nthat, the farmers were not going to be able to grow crops in the \nspring, and they were going to return to growing poppies and, thus, in \nthe drug trade and, thus, all the more ripe for exploitation by the \nterrorists we are trying to get rid of in that part of the world.\n  All of our Senators would be so proud of what we saw on the faces of \nthose young men and women in the uniform of our country at Bagram \nairfield in the dead of night. They were absolutely resolute in being \nable to successfully fulfill their mission. They had tasted success. \nThey knew their cause was just, and they were absolutely intent on \nseeing it through to a successful conclusion.\n  Whether we met young Americans in uniform in the neighboring \ncountries, such as Uzbekistan to the north or Pakistan to the south, \nwhether we met Americans in the diplomatic service or in the \nhumanitarian component of our assistance, whether we met those young \nmen and women in full-combat, cold-weather gear at the Bagram airfield \nright outside of Kabul, Afghanistan, or whether we met our marines at \nthe airfield on the coast of Pakistan on the Arabian Sea, or whether we \nmet our sailors and our pilots out on the aircraft carrier, the \nTheodore Roosevelt, off the Pakistani coast, they all had that \nconviction of expression on their faces: Absolutely intent on \npersevering and succeeding, knowing their cause is just.\n  We spent a good hour with the President of Pakistan. It has been said \nmany times that President Musharraf, well before September 11, offered \nleadership by recognizing that he had a problem with terrorism in his \nown country. In early June, well before September 11, he had met with \nreligious leaders and said: We are going to have to start dampening \ndown the religious extremism. In his country, there are 3,000 of these \nmadrasahs, which are religious extremist schools.\n  The President of Pakistan recognized he had a problem because where \npoverty exists and fathers and mothers cannot support their children, \nthese children get shipped off to these religious schools where they \nprovide the basic necessities for them but in the process train them in \nthe ways of terrorism and extremism and teach them a doctrine that is \nnot taught in the Koran.\n  The President of Pakistan saw well ahead of September 11 that he was \ngoing to have a problem. He started laying the groundwork so that when \nthe awful events of September 11 came and he knew he was going to have \nto make a choice--was he going to fight with a coalition of nations led \nby the United States to rid that part of the world of terrorism, \nincluding the terrorists in his country, or was he going to stay with \nthe longstanding policy where the Government of Pakistan had even \nrecognized officially, diplomatically, the Taliban Government, and\n\n[[Page S13]]\n\nwas he going to break relations with them and cast his lot with the \nnations of the world that were trying to get rid of the terrorists--he \ndid just that.\n  Of course, at the time my colleagues and I were there, we had another \nreason to be concerned about that part of the world because two armies \nwere amassing on either side of the Kashmir border, two armies of \nnuclear nations which portend awful things for the peace of this world \nshould they get into a hot war, not even to speak of how it would drain \nPakistan's energies and military activities away from helping the \ncoalition of nations try to get the Taliban, the al-Qaida, and the \nterrorist leaders as they attempt to flee into Pakistan.\n  We went up to the Khyber Pass and met with the commanding general who \nwas commanding about 33,000 troops all in that sector of the Afghan-\nPakistan border where we are concerned that al-Qaida are trying to \nflee.\n  The general assured us that with all of their troops on the border, \nplus all of their friendships and lines of communication they have \nbuilt with the native Pakistanis in all of those villages, they will \nknow when one of those terrorists comes across.\n  At the time we were there, which was about 2 weeks ago, they had \nalready captured in excess of 200 al-Qaida. We went on to Muscat, Oman, \nand met with the Sultan of Oman. Again, it is a different kind of \ngovernment in that region of the world and yet one that is very \nnecessary in helping us as we knit and keep together this fragile \ncoalition of nations, most of them being Muslim, as we fight terrorism \nin that part of the world.\n  I believe the leaders in Central Asia now recognize terrorist \nactivity is one of the greatest threats to the stability of their \ncountries, and I believe they are now much more enthused in supporting \nthe coalition efforts because of the extraordinary success we have had.\n  I will conclude with this: The commander in chief of the Central \nCommand I have the pleasure of having reside in my State, General \nFranks. He is stationed at MacDill Air Force Base where not only the \nCentral Command is located but also the Special Operations Command. We \nhave another commander in chief on the same base.\n  I think the military success of this war effort thus far is \nillustrated by the photograph we saw on the front pages of so many of \nour newspapers, which was the Special Operations troop, American, on \nhorseback, riding with other Afghan troops on horseback. The difference \nwas the U.S. Special Operations person was calling in pinpoint \nairstrikes from his vantage point traversing the terrain on horseback. \nIt is a combination of low tech and high tech. It is a commitment of \nvery specialized troops, few in number, but backed up by the \nsuperiority of the skies, the precision of the weapons, and the instant \ncommunication between the low-tech troop on horseback, or on the \nground, with the high-tech arsenal represented by the skies and by the \npinpoint accuracy of the weapons.\n  So the terrorist is in a compound, suddenly there is an explosion, \nand he flees and all of a sudden sighs relief that he escaped, and then \nwhammo, the second precision pinpoint-accurate weapon hits. Talk about \ndemoralizing the enemy.\n  Why have we had success? Because of the combination of that and, in \nconclusion, because of the absolute determination of our men and women \nin uniform. That is what made me so proud for all of us, what made all \nof us in our nine-senator delegation so appreciative that we could \nexpress to those troops whom we saw the appreciation of the American \npeople for their dedication and for their success.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton).

Mr. President, as long as we have a lull, on a \nmuch lighter note I note for my colleagues some of the conversations I \nhad prior to the Christmas recess and prior to all the bowl games. It \nso happened Florida had three college teams in bowl games, and so in \ntrying to be a good Senator representing my State of Florida, I went to \nthe respective Senators from the States with the other three teams.\n  Given the fact that the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville was being waged \nbetween Florida State University and Virginia Tech, I naturally went to \nSenator Warner and Senator Allen and suggested we have a friendly wager \non the game. What Senator Allen and I agreed to was we would wager a \ncrate of Florida oranges and a bushel of Virginia peanuts.\n  I am one who absolutely loves peanuts, and I am going to thoroughly \nenjoy those Virginia peanuts that are going to be presented to me by \nSenator Allen next week. We will have an appropriate ceremony and may \neven have the president of Florida State University present for this \nsolemn occasion.\n  Then I went to the other Nelson in the Senate, our fellow freshman, \nBen Nelson of Nebraska, and suggested that something as monumental as \nthe national championship being played in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena was \ncertainly worth us determining we would put something of specialty of \nour State on the line, backing up our boast that our team was going to \nbe the national champion: The University of Miami versus Nebraska, the \nHurricanes versus the Cornhuskers. So we determined in a friendly \nconclusion it would be a crate of Florida oranges versus a box of Omaha \nsteaks. I am already stoking up my grill.\n  For the third bowl game of a Florida college team, the Orange Bowl in \nMiami pitting the University of Florida Gators against the Maryland \nTerrapins, I searched and searched for Senator Mikulski, and I could \nnot find her in the remaining hours of the session. I finally found \nSenator Sarbanes. I explained what I had done in the other bowl game \nand what was on the line in Miami in the Orange Bowl. Senator Sarbanes \nchose not to engage in a friendly wager, of which I have just had the \noccasion today to remind him. He suggested he was wise beyond his years \nin not taking up my challenge.\n\n  Early in our tenure one day I overheard the other Nelson in the \nSenate speaking to a group, in a voice sufficiently loud that he knew I \ncould overhear his statement. I will sum up the conversation in this \nspirit of levity. Senator Ben Nelson said to them, within my hearing: \nOh, you must understand, I am the Nelson in the Senate who comes from \nthe State with ``the'' football team.\n  I sauntered over and I said: That's right, Ben, you come from \nNebraska, with the great Nebraska Cornhuskers, which I have great \nrespect for, one of the finest football programs in the Nation. But, \nBen, you must explain to your folks that I am the Nelson in the Senate \nwho comes from the State with six professional football teams: the \nDolphins, the Bucks, the Jaguars, the Gators, the Hurricanes, and the \nSeminoles.\n  I think that has now been amply demonstrated by the bowl games we \njust witnessed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, with the announcement that the \nFederal Government is facing near-term budget deficits, as opposed to \nlong-term budget deficits, for the next\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\n2 or 3 years, but not for the next 10 years, we will hear a lot of talk \nfrom the critics about the need to postpone or repeal last year's \nbipartisan tax cut. The critics say we should revisit the tax cut for \ntwo reasons. First, they claim the tax cut is responsible for a return \nof budget deficits; second, the critics claim the tax cut will \njeopardize our long-term economic growth. I will consider each of these \nclaims.\n  According to the CBO projections, the tax cut is responsible for less \nthan 15 percent of the reduction in this year's surplus and less than \n40 percent of the reduction in the surpluses for the 10 years we \nproject ahead. The slowdown in our economy and the additional spending \nenacted last year are responsible for most of the deterioration in our \nbudget outlay. The second criticism is that the tax cut will reduce the \nsurplus, thereby exerting upward pressure on interest rates and reduce \nfuture economic growth.\n  A recent study by the congressional Joint Economic Committee \nconcludes there is no evidence to support the criticism that interest \nrates rise because there is budget surplus or that there is a \nrelationship.\n  According to the Joint Economic Committee:\n\n       Empirical studies on interest rates have uniformly failed \n     to find any statistical significant relationship between \n     interest rates and the budget balance of the U.S. government.\n\n  This result is likely due to the fact that the deficits we have seen \nin the past were not large enough to affect the interest rates given \nthe overall size of our financial markets which would also include the \nglobal financial markets.\n  If the tax cut is not responsible for the rising deficits and higher \ninterest rates, then why do the critics still complain? Maybe they have \nnot read the studies to which I have referred.\n  Based on the studies, I asked critics the legitimate question, What \nis there to complain about? One reason I believe they want to delay \nrepeal of the tax cuts is because they have a desire to spend the \nmoney, which, in the end, actually, then, if you spend it, because you \nincrease taxes, you still do not have any less deficit.\n  Some critics have already announced they have plans to spend the \nmoney by raising taxes, or delaying the tax cuts, as they call it. As \nother spending plans become public, it will become obvious their cries \nfor fiscal discipline are nothing more than crocodile tears.\n  In addition to the critics who want to spend the tax cut, there are \nalso critics who insist we cannot afford the tax cut because our long-\nterm budget projections show Federal spending will exceed revenue by 25 \npercent within the next 50 years. To argue, as they do, that we cannot \nafford a modest tax cut today because we will need a huge tax increase \nin future years ignores the obvious: Congress cannot provide more \ngovernment than the taxpayers are willing to pay for. Through our \ncountry's history, the Federal Government has never taken more than \none-fifth of our Nation's income in taxes. That includes even in \nwartime. If we are not willing to pay 25 percent more for government, \nif we are not willing to do that now, why should we be willing to put \nourselves into a spending policy where we expect our children and \ngrandchildren to have higher taxes so they can pay for programs we \ninstituted at a time when we were not willing to put taxes higher than \nthey have ever been in the history of our country? Our challenge today \nis to get beyond the rhetoric and make affordable government once \nagain.\n  In addition to this point, as we prepare for the next budget season, \nI participated today in the Budget Committee review of the CBO \nreport. Once again we are having this issue brought up about the tax \ncut being responsible for the budget deficits, as opposed to the war on \nterrorism, as opposed to the recession that is a result of the war on \nterrorism, and some technical budget adjustments that are made \nannually.\n\n  In regard to the accusation that the tax cuts proposed by President \nBush in the last election, and then in turn enacted by Congress--and in \nturn when it was enacted, it was enacted as a bipartisan tax relief \npackage because several members of the Democratic Party voted for it--\nin regard to that being the cause of the deficit, as is the insinuation \non the part of those people who make that argument, I made the point \nthis morning, and I would like to repeat the point I made in the Budget \nCommittee to the Members of the entire Senate, that if you look at the \n$1.3 billion tax cut the bipartisan Members of this body voted for and \nthe President signed on June 7, and you say that is the cause of the \ndeficit, you have to also look at the fact that there was an \nalternative called the Daschle-Carnahan amendment that was offered that \nwas $1.265 trillion, just 6-percent less than what the President \nsigned.\n  That amendment got 48 votes. It lost, but almost every member of the \nDemocratic Party voted for that amendment.\n  So whether you look at $1.3 billion that passed by a bipartisan \nmajority, and a pretty overwhelming majority, or whether you look at \nthe Daschle-Carnahan amendment, we have all but two or three Members of \nthis Senate who voted for tax cuts of at least $1.265 trillion or the \n6-percent higher figure that was finally adopted of $1.3 trillion. \nEither way, just considering that 6-percent differential, you are going \nto end up with about the same budget deficit situation, short term or \nlong term, under a policy either way that was backed by all but about \ntwo or three Members of this body last spring.\n  So my point is this: It is wrong for Democratic leaders to blame the \nbipartisan tax cut that the President signed on June 7 for the deficit \nsituation without taking credit themselves for backing such a tax \npolicy that was only 6-percent less than what the President had already \nproposed.\n  So I don't think we have a bad situation because of the reduction of \ntaxes. We have a bad situation because of the war on terrorism, the \neconomic recession caused by the war on terrorism, because of technical \nadjustments in the budget, and because of the additional appropriations \nwe had to have for the military and for the domestic war on terrorism.\n  That is where it is. But if you want to blame taxes, there are 97 or \n98 of us in this body who have to share that blame, not just the 48 \nRepublicans and 12 Democrats who voted for the bill the President \nsigned.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to bring to the attention of the \nSenate a situation on which we need to take some action. Presently in \nthe Philippines there are two Kansans being held hostage by a group of \nterrorists called the Abu Sayf group. It has links to al-Qaida and bin \nLaden. They got their start through al-Qaida and bin Laden and now are \noperating in the Philippines.\n  They have taken a number of people hostage over a period of 8 months. \nA number of these individuals have been released. One has been \nbeheaded, a Californian. The two who are Kansans and a Filipino remain \nhostage. This matter was discussed on the TV show, ``48 Hours,'' Monday \nnight of this week.\n  They are in a desperate situation; Martin and Gracia Burnham are the \ntwo Kansans. They are missionaries. Their parents are missionaries in \nthe Philippines. They have taken up that calling as well. They were \nthere and taken hostage and have been held by this group now for 8 \nmonths.\n  The Senate has before us, nominated to be the United States \nAmbassador to the Philippines, Ambassador-designate Ricciardone. He is \nqualified and knowledgeable. He was cleared through the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. He is the appropriate and right person for this \njob. He remains stalled in this body, unfortunately, at this point in \ntime.\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\n  I take this opportunity to ask my colleagues if there is a way that \nwe could get this nomination cleared. I know there are a number of \ndifficult and nettlesome issues in front of the Senate, and sometimes \nthings are associated one with the other. But if possible, if we could \nfree this nomination to move it forward so the United States would have \nan ambassador to the Philippines to negotiate and to see to the safe \nrelease of these two hostages, it would be important to America, \nimportant to the Philippines, and to the overall world effort.\n  The United States is involved in some delicate issues with the \nPhilippines at the present time. I will not speak about that. The \ncurrent issue I am concerned about is not only the work the United \nStates is doing with the Philippines--the Philippine military has taken \non this exercise to free the Burnhams; they have been aggressively \npursuing the terrorist group for some period of time--but we need a \nleader from the United States. We need our ambassador to the \nPhilippines in this delicate situation.\n  If the Presiding Officer or other Members of the Senate could have \nseen ``48 Hours,'' they would have seen Gracia Burnham pleading: Will \nsomebody please show us mercy. Will somebody please notice that we are \nhere and help us out. She said that morning she awakened with chest \npains. They are living in the jungle, being moved daily and on the run. \nIt is a difficult, horrible situation. They need our key representative \nin that country.\n  I ask other Members of the Senate to please consider and see fit to \nmoving forward on this nomination that has cleared unanimously the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee--a professional, highly qualified \nfor this position, which would mean so much for our efforts in the \nPhilippines to date. If my colleagues could see to that, this would be \nan important addition to the international portfolio of ambassadors.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S15-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15-S16]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NEW YORK'S GROUND ZERO CLEANUP: AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND UNDER BUDGET\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, along with my colleague Senator \nSchumer, and Congressman Nadler in the House, I reaffirm the commitment \nof this Congress and this Nation to the rebuilding of New York.\n  One hundred thirty-five days after the worst attacks in history on \nU.S. soil, I ask my colleagues to join me in a pledge to fulfill our \npromise to all Americans to make New York--our financial, our cultural, \nand media heart--whole again.\n  The World Trade Center attacks claimed the lives of close to 3,000 of \nour fellow citizens, as well as those who had come from other countries \nto America seeking a better life. The emotional toll has been \nstaggering. I have met with countless family members who lost mothers \nand fathers, sisters and brothers, husbands and wives, daughters and \nsons. While there is nothing we can say or do that will bring these \nloved ones back to their families, the outpouring of compassion and \nkindness from all over the Nation has brought comfort to many.\n  Along with this heartfelt sympathy, I believe we have an obligation \nto help not only those who lost their loved ones but also help those \nwho lost their livelihoods rebuild their lives and reclaim their \nfutures.\n  New Yorkers were comforted when the President and leaders from the \nHouse and the Senate came to ground zero and stood in the House and \nSenate promising to make New York whole again. Their determination in \nthe face of what seemed at the time great odds reinforced the workers \nwho labored day after day, night after night, at ground zero. Despite \nthe many obstacles, the recovery effort has moved forward faster than \nanyone could have predicted.\n  Some months ago, I told my colleagues our best estimate was that with \n24-hour-day shifts, we would perhaps have to take an entire year to \nclear the site to be ready to rebuild. I am very proud of the \nconstruction workers who have been working day in and day out, often at \ngreat personal sacrifice and risk, as well as the contractors who have \nworked with the city, to the end that we now believe this cleanup \neffort will be completed 4 months ahead of schedule and billions of \ndollars under budget.\n  That does not in any way take away from the fact that the financial \ntoll has been enormous. In fact, the terrorist attacks are estimated to \ncost New York City and its businesses over $100 billion in financial \nlosses over the next 2 years. Lower Manhattan's business district has \nbeen decimated. Nearly 25 million square feet of office space, 20 \npercent of all of downtown New York's office space, was damaged or \ndestroyed by the attacks, leaving 850 businesses and over 125,000 \nworkers physically displaced.\n  The effects of these attacks have also been staggering on New York's \nworkforce. New York City's unemployment rate spiked to 7.4 percent in \nDecember, nearly a 3-year high, from 6.9 percent in November. The \nSeptember 11 attacks ruined our small businesses, destroying and \nseverely impacting nearly 15,000 of them. Businesses that were thriving \non September 10, employing people, building a positive future for \nthemselves, were destroyed, and they remain out of business 4\\1/2\\ \nmonths later. We are expected to lose nearly 150,000 jobs, and that is \nan unsustainable loss.\n  The number of private sector jobs sank 3 percent last year, more than \ntwice the national rate. We are struggling to make sure the aid that \nwas voted for at the end of last year gets out as quickly as possible, \nand especially gets into the hands of these small businesses that are \ndesperate for some kind of assistance.\n\n  We also face a big job in cleaning up, repairing, and rebuilding the \ninfrastructure. The attacks left 42 percent of Lower Manhattan's subway \nsystem unusable. That translates into significant disruptions in the \ndaily commutes of 335,000 passengers who ride to Lower Manhattan every \nday.\n  We are going to be getting some positive plans adopted soon, we hope, \nthat will show what needs to be done to repair this infrastructure. I \nknow this body will be there to help.\n  I have been especially concerned about the air quality at and near \nground zero. Many of our rescue workers, firefighters, police officers, \nconstruction workers, residents, and others have been complaining of \nrespiratory problems. Some call them the World Trade Center cough or \nthe 9-11 cough. It is a significant health problem.\n  I have visited with physicians who are treating the firefighters and \nthe construction workers. They are concerned because a lot of people \nare really encountering severe respiratory problems and developing \nasthma. We have many families and residents who still are afraid to \nmove back into their homes, leaving large parts of Lower Manhattan \nuninhabited, leaving buildings that were once prime real estate nearly \nempty.\n  I am pleased the Clean Air, Wetlands and Climate Change Subcommittee \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee has honored my request \nand will hold a hearing in New York City on these issues in a few \nweeks. We really do not know the effects of the exposure on those who \nhave been most directly involved in the work at ground zero and others \nwho are within the vicinity, but we owe it to them to find answers. We \nhave to make sure we know what the health risks are for the children \nwho are being asked to move back into the elementary schools that were \nvacated near ground zero. I am hopeful this hearing will get to the \nbottom of some of these issues.\n  We also have to be sure our workforce is not forgotten. So many of \nthem need some extra unemployment insurance. So many are about to lose \ntheir health insurance.\n  I went to a hearing last week that was held with hundreds and \nhundreds of people. We had testimony from representatives of various \ngroups, and the biggest concern among the workers who had worked in the \nWorld Trade Center or at a neighboring business\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\nwas that their health insurance policies were about to run out and they \ndid not know where to turn.\n  We have been discussing what should be done on a recovery package for \nthe Nation, but I know from firsthand experience we really must focus \nattention on New York's needs in terms of unemployment insurance, \ndisaster unemployment assistance, and the extension of health care \nbenefits in order to give some help to those people who, through no \nfault of their own, were left unemployed directly because of the \nattacks.\n  Similarly, we have to continue to support both the public and the \nprivate sector in meeting the needs that come out of 9-11.\n  I thank Chairman Baucus and ranking member Senator Grassley for their \nhelp to Senator Schumer and myself as we have tried to draft policies \nthat will make a direct impact on the financial burdens being \nshouldered by the public and private sector. We need tax incentives. We \nneed bonding authority. We need advanced refunding authority. All of \nthat has been worked through the Finance Committee. A similar proposal \nhas passed the House. I am hopeful we will be able to get something \nalong those lines through the Congress and to the President very soon, \neither standing alone or as part of a larger economic recovery \nproposal.\n  One issue that is now more pressing than when we left a month ago is \nthe impact on States across the Nation of the economic slowdown and of \n9-11. We are seeing increases in unemployment in many parts of the \ncountry. We see many people lose their health insurance. We expect to \nsee millions more added to the Medicaid roles. It has been predicted \nthat the number of children on Medicaid could increase as much as 11.3 \npercent. At a time when State budgets are already reeling from reduced \nrevenues, when States--unlike the Federal Government--have to run a \nbalanced budget, they cannot spend more than they take in. They may not \nhave the resources needed to address these increasing health needs.\n  That is why I hope, in a bipartisan manner, we can provide some \nrelief to States. They are desperate for it. Whether Republican or \nDemocratic Governor, we are hearing they need help. They need help not \nonly to meet health needs but also law enforcement and homeland \nsecurity needs. If we do not provide direct assistance to cities and \ncounties, they are going to be running in the red, with the overtime \nthey are now paying and with the additional responsibilities imposed on \npolice, firefighters, and emergency workers.\n  We have our work cut out for us. I am confident that under the \nleadership in this body and in the House and with the support of the \nadministration we can meet the needs of New York and we can assure the \npeople who were so directly devastated by these attacks that we stand \nwith them.\n  Earlier today I was privileged to be at the White House. It was a \nnostalgic return visit for me, sitting in the East Room, surrounded by \nmy colleagues from New York, New Jersey, and Virginia, all of whom had \ngathered to witness the President signing the Victims Tax Relief Act, \nsomething I fought very hard for because it was a tangible way of \nproviding assistance to those who were directly impacted with the loss \nof a loved one on 9-11. I am proud we included Oklahoma City victims \nand victims of the anthrax attacks because we need to demonstrate \nAmerica is united not only in our war against terrorism but on behalf \nof the victims of terrorism. I was very proud when the President signed \nthat bill, surrounded by so many of the families from New York and New \nJersey with whom I have met, as well as other families from around the \ncountry who lost a loved one on one of the planes in the Pentagon \nattack or in the fields of Pennsylvania.\n  It was a very reassuring moment to see how all levels of government \nwere supporting those who woke up on September 11--on a beautiful \nautumn day for flying, for going to work, for minding one's own \nbusiness--and ended a day having lost a relative, a friend, knowing \ntheir lives would never be the same.\n\n  I strongly hope Congress will pass this resolution and reaffirm our \ncommitment to New York by continuing to provide the much needed Federal \nassistance that New Yorkers require to recover from these horrific \nattacks that were, as we know so well, attacks on America.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to take a few minutes to set the stage \nand remind everyone that, although we face future challenges with the \ncontinuing war on terrorism to make sure national security is as strong \nas we can make it, to ensure we are doing everything possible to \nenhance our homeland security and that we take necessary steps to \nassure economic security in the face of the economic downturn and the \nattacks on 9-11, that we also remain united behind the needs of New \nYork.\n  It is an honor to represent New York. It is often a challenge to \nconvey the needs I see every day. I try to do my best to speak for \nthose who will never stand in this Chamber but who are living every day \nwith the consequences of those horrific attacks. It is such an honor to \nrepresent such brave and courageous Americans as I do in New York. I \nlook forward to the continuing help I have received with such \ngraciousness from my colleagues to make sure that New Yorkers know \nAmerica stands with us.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for himself \n     and Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 2698.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished Republican leader for this ongoing effort to try to get \nto this point. This is not what he would have subscribed to; this is \nnot what I would have subscribed to necessarily.\n  Basically what this does is provide us with an opportunity to move \nforward on an economic stimulus package. It is open to amendment. But \nwhat I have done with the amendment I have just offered to the bill, \nH.R. 622, which is the adoption tax credit bill that had been on the \ncalendar, is simply provide an opportunity now for us to move forward.\n  The amendment I have just offered is comprised of the four components \nI have been talking about on the floor and off the floor. The amendment \nincludes, first, the bonus depreciation legislation, the tax rebate, \nthe unemployment legislation, and the so-called FMAP, the resources \nprovided to the States to help them offset the cost of Medicaid.\n  Those four components are components in various forms, of course, \nthat have been supported by Republicans and Democrats. It is the right \nof any Senator now to offer an amendment,\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\nwhether it is the complete substitute that some might prefer or \ntargeted amendments dealing with these four components or something \nelse.\n  My hope is, however, at some point in the not too distant future we \ncan complete our work on this and go to conference so we can ultimately \ncomplete our work on a bill that enjoys both House and Senate support \nand hopefully the support of the President as well.\n  That is, in essence, what we have done today. I appreciate the help \nand the cooperative effort that has been made by a number of our \ncolleagues, not the least of whom is the Republican leader. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I believe Senator Daschle has \nappropriately described the procedure that is being employed in this \nsituation. It is highly appropriate we begin this new year by trying to \nwork through the amendments and the process that can get us to an \neconomic security package.\n  I do think the economy needs some stimulus. I do think we need \nadditional unemployment compensation. I think we need to look at ways \nto give incentives to small businessmen and women to create jobs so we \nhave growth in the economy, so we are not just trying to help our \npeople make sure they have something to live on this week but so they \ncan get and have a good paying job in the future.\n  We could debate about when we should have done it and how we should \ndo it, but the fact is we should do this. We have talked back and forth \nduring the past 24 hours about the best way to proceed. I obviously \nthought the best way to proceed was to call up the House-passed \nbipartisan bill, have it open for amendment and debate and see how it \nmoved and to get a vote on that, but we could not come to agreement to \nget that done.\n  We also looked at coming up with this so-called common approach with \nthe four components and limiting amendments. Part of the problem was \nthe fourth item, the Federal assistance to the States. The way it was \ngoing to be introduced was not in the bipartisan House-passed package \nso it was thought this was not a common approach provision by our \npeople.\n  There also was some resistance, I think in both conferences, to say \nwe can only have two or three amendments. I believe by having an \nopportunity to offer amendments on both sides after a reasonable period \nof time Members are going to make a decision. We need to go ahead and \nget this done and get it to conference or, if we cannot come to \nagreement on something, it deserves to go forward. It is going to be \ndifficult because at this point procedurally 60 votes are required for \namendments or substitutes. We will have a full debate. We will have a \nchance to offer amendments, and I think it is necessary and appropriate \nthat we try to get a stimulus package done.\n  So after a lot of discussion back and forth, this is the best \nprocedure we could purpose. We did not require a vote on the motion to \nproceed to the bill that was being used to call up this procedure, and \nwe are not filibustering it. We want it resolved. I think this could \nget it resolved, but it is going to be tough. It is going to take some \ngive and take on both sides. We have to try to come up with something \nthat will enjoy bipartisan support to get 60 votes. We will see if we \ncan get that done. It is certainly worth the effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, it has long been recognized that the \nDepartment of the Interior's Indian trust fund accounting and \nmanagement systems have struggled with the challenge of meeting the \nGovernment's trust responsibility to Native Americans. Shortly before \nthe Christmas break, to her credit, the Secretary of the Interior \nacknowledged this fact and proposed reorganizing the way the Department \nhandles its trust asset management responsibilities.\n  The Secretary has proposed creating a new Bureau of Indian Trust \nAsset Management to manage Indian trusts. It is now the job of the \nDepartment, Congress, and the tribes to assess how this plan would work \nin practice.\n  Tribal leaders in South Dakota have emphasized to me their concern \nthat any BIA reorganization plan that has not been thoroughly discussed \nwith the Native American community nationwide could hold potentially \nadverse consequences for tribal members. The leaders of the nine tribes \nin my State, for example, ask how such a proposal would address the \nunderlying issues of trust fund management in light of the pending \nCobell vs. Norton class action suit; how it would impact funding for \nother programs upon which tribes depend; and how it would affect the \nself-governance of Tribes.\n  These are legitimate questions, and tribal leaders and their members \ndeserve satisfactory answers prior to the implementation of any \nreorganization plan. I hope that a more concerted effort will be made, \nby the Department and Congress, to involve tribal leaders fully in the \ndecision-making process on the BIA reorganization effort. Certainly no \nsignificant organizational changes within the BIA should be made \nwithout adequate consultation with tribal leaders across the country. \nThe essence of the Federal Government's trust relationship with the \ntribes requires no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S17-3", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S17-S18]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO MAJOR JEFFREY W. PRICHARD, U.S. AIR FORCE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize and say farewell to an outstanding Air Force officer, Major \nJeff ``JoBu'' Prichard, upon his departure from my staff. Major \nPrichard was selected as an Air Force Fellow to work in my office \nduring the First Session of the 107th Congress due to his outstanding \nprofessional reputation and superior knowledge of Defense issues, the \nUnited States Air Force requirements process, and the military presence \nin my home State. He has been a valued team member and it is a \nprivilege for me to recognize his many outstanding achievements and the \nsuperior service he has provided the United States Senate, the Air \nForce, and our Nation.\n  Major Prichard, a native of the State of Mississippi, graduated from \nthe University of Southern Mississippi and was commissioned a Second \nLieutenant through the Reserve Officer Training Corps, ROTC. Since \nthen, Major Prichard has spent the majority of his career patrolling \nthe world's skies as an Air Force fighter pilot. Following flight \ntraining, he began his service flying the F-15C ``Eagle'' in the 67th \nFighter Squadron, 18th Tactical Fighter Wing in Okinawa, Japan. During \nthis tour, Major Prichard was selected as a member of the 18th Wing \nteam that won the 1992 Worldwide William Tell Air-to-Air Weapons \nCompetition and he out flew all competitors to win the coveted \n``Topgun'' Trophy. After his tour in Japan, he reported to the 60th \nFighter Squadron in Ft. Walton Beach, FL, where he deployed in support \nof Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti and Operation SOUTHERN WATCH \nwhere he lead 34 combat missions patrolling the skies over Iraq \nenforcing the no-fly zone. Also during this tour, Major Prichard \nattended the Air Force's Weapons School at Nellis AFB, NV, and in \nSeptember 1996 was handpicked to return as an instructor. In 1999, \nMajor Prichard left the cockpit to serve on the staff of the Secretary \nof the Air Force in Washington, DC, as the Air-to-Air Missile Program \nManager and then was selected to serve as a Military Legislative Fellow \nduring the 1st session of the 107th Congress.\n  Major Prichard quickly became a valued member of my staff sharing his\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\nproven operational experience and insightful knowledge on a number of \nDepartment of Defense issues, including defense health care, \noperational beddown of C-17 and C-130J aircraft, various weapons \nsystems, military construction, and university research programs. \nSpecifically, Jeff was instrumental in helping the Air Force craft a C-\n130J Roadmap for future beddown of operational assets that took into \naccount Congressional concerns. He helped me articulate a successful \ncase for adding funding for additional maintenance training simulators \nand military construction projects that will help ensure the successful \nbeddown in Jackson, MS of the first ever C-17 aircraft assigned to the \nNational Guard. He helped craft new legislation that will ensure the \nfinancial viability of our Armed Forces Retirement Homes and the \nquality of life for the residents well into the 21st century. He also \nprovided extremely valuable inputs in helping to craft legislation that \nestablished the future site of the Air Force Memorial while preserving \nas much acreage as possible for the Arlington National Cemetery. Major \nPrichard's coordination with the staffs of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the Senate Appropriations Defense Subcommittee led to \nover $28 million in additional military construction funding for \nMississippi's military bases and yielded over $100 million in research, \ndevelopment, test, and evaluation funds for universities in \nMississippi.\n  Major Prichard is married to the former Wendy Lynn Hurlbert of \nMinneapolis, MN. They have three children, 10-year-old daughter Sydney, \n8-year-old son Jeffrey Jr., and 5-year-old daughter Hailey. Among Major \nPrichard's many awards and decorations are the Meritorious Service \nMedal, Air Medal, Aerial Achievement Medal, Air Force Commendation \nMedal, and Air Force Achievement Medal.\n  Major Prichard will return to the Air Force at Langley AFB, Virginia, \nwhere he will once again control the skies in the F-15C. I have \nappreciated greatly Major Jeff Prichard's contributions to my team and \nI will miss him. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nI wish Major Prichard and his family ``Good Hunting and Godspeed.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S18-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER MICHAEL LIPSKI, U.S. NAVY\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

After his \ncompletion of the Navy's Surface Warfare Officer School in 1985, he \nserved as Auxiliaries Officer and Main Propulsion Assistant on USS \nOliver Hazard Perry, FFG-7, where he earned his qualification as a \nSurface Warfare Officer. In 1988, Commander Lipski became an Assistant \nProfessor of Naval Science at Florida A University where he \ninstructed Midshipmen in ship systems engineering, weapon systems \ntheory, shipboard operations and navigation. While at Florida A, he \nalso earned his Craftmaster qualification and served as the Officer-in-\nCharge of the Naval Sail Training Vessel Dolphin, NSY-29. In December \n1989, Commander Lipski was designated a Civil Engineer Corps Officer \nand served on the staff of the Officer-in-Charge of Construction, \nMariana Islands as an Assistant Resident Officer-in-Charge of \nConstruction. After leaving Guam in 1992, he was assigned to Naval \nComputer and Telecommunications Station, Cutler, ME, as the Public \nWorks Officer and Officer-in-Charge of Naval Facilities and Engineering \nCommand Contracts. After a follow-on assignment to the Naval \nPostgraduate School, where he earned a Masters degree in Financial \nManagement, Commander Lipski served as the Public Works Officer at the \nNaval Mobile Construction Battalion Center in Gulfport, MS. While in \nGulfport, he superbly managed over $60 million in military construction \nprojects. He also wrote a Master Plan for Seabee Base Gulfport that led \nto over $100 million in quality of life and mission support military \nconstruction projects that have greatly improved the operational \ncapability and morale of the Seabees and their families stationed in \nGulfport. Prior to joining my staff in January 2001, Commander Lipski \nserved with distinction for two years on the staff of the Chief of \nNaval Operations ensuring that our sailors and their families had top-\nnotch bachelor quarters and family housing to live in.\n  Commander Lipski quickly became a valued member of my staff where he \nled several legislative initiatives that enormously benefitted the \nDepartment of Defense, the Navy, and the State of Mississippi. He \nworked hard to ensure that the Defense authorization and appropriations \nbills for fiscal year 2002 included legislative provisions and specific \nprograms aimed at modernizing and recapitalizing our military and \nimproving the quality of life of our service members and their \nfamilies. Specifically, he did a great deal of research and analysis \nthat led to a complete rewrite of the statutes governing the management \nand oversight of the Armed Forces Retirement Homes. This new \nlegislation will ensure the financial viability of our Armed Forces \nRetirement Homes and quality care for the residents well into the 21st \ncentury. Commander Lipski also articulated a successful case for adding \n$28 million in military construction projects for Mississippi's \nmilitary bases. Commander Lipski's strong leadership, hard work, and \nvision led to congressional actions that will ensure our military is \nproperly equipped and trained to meet head-on the challenges it will \nface in the future.\n  Commander Lipski is married to the former Jill Daria Wiltzius of \nSpooner, WI. He is the son of John and Eleanor Lipski of Long Beach, \nMS. Mike is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of \nMississippi, a member of the Navy Acquisition Professional Community, \nand a member of the Society of American Military Engineers. His many \nawards and decorations include the Meritorious Service Medal, Navy \nCommendation Medal, Navy Achievement Medal and numerous other service \nawards.\n  Throughout his career, Commander Lipski has served the United States \nNavy and our Nation with excellence and distinction. He will be sorely \nmissed on Capitol Hill but his return to the Naval Service will benefit \nNaval Air Station Jacksonville, the Navy's commands in the southeastern \nUnited States, and our great Nation. On behalf of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, I wish Mike and Jill ``fair winds and following \nseas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S18-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18-S19]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, today I rise to pay tribute to a great \nman, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King was born on January 15, 1929. \nAs a nation, we have celebrated his life and accomplishments every \nthird Monday in January since 1986. However, in my home State of \nIllinois, we have been celebrating this great man for almost 30 years, \nsince 1973.\n  Late in 1955, Montgomery, AL, civil rights activist Rosa Parks \nrefused to obey the city's rules mandating segregation on buses. Five \ndays later, Dr. King was elected by his supporters to be president of \nthe Montgomery Improvement Association. As president, he participated \nin the bus boycott that eventually led to the Supreme Court declaring \nMontgomery's segregation laws unconstitutional. As Dr. King gained \nnational prominence he was repeatedly attacked for his beliefs and \nbecause of the color of his skin. Sadly, violent acts against Americans \nof different beliefs, ethnic groups, and hues continue to plague our \nnation today.\n  Building on the success of the Montgomery boycott movement, Dr. King \nand other southern African-American ministers founded the Southern \nChristian Leadership Conference. With his colleagues, Dr. King promoted \nthe goal of voting rights when he spoke at the Lincoln Memorial during \nthe 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom.\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\n  Dr. King also guided mass demonstrations in Birmingham, AL, with \nothers in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. The protests \ncaught headlines around the world, as clashes between protesters and \npolice turned violent. Despite police dogs and fire hoses, Dr. King \npersevered, leading to the decision by President Kennedy to submit \nbroad civil rights legislation to Congress, and eventually to the Civil \nRights Act of 1964.\n  Despite becoming Time magazine's Man of the Year in 1964, Dr. King \ncontinued to face many challenges to his nonviolent tactics. While \nattempting to assist a garbage workers' strike in Memphis on April 4, \n1968, Dr. King was assassinated. The world changed for many on that \nday. Many thought that Dr. King's message of tolerance, equality, and \nlove for our fellow men and women would die with his death. It did not. \nRather, Dr. King's message and legacy continue to spread.\n  In the wake of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon \non September 11, many have found it difficult to adhere to Dr. King's \nmessage.\n  As we searched for understanding, many mistook symbols of religious \ntenets, such as beards and turbans, for symbols of distrust and terror. \nArab Americans and Sikh Americans have been harassed, threatened, and \nassaulted because of the physical and religious similarities they share \nwith the terrorists who took the lives of thousands of Americans four \nmonths ago. The passage of a resolution condemning hate crimes against \nSikh Americans, which I sponsored and worked to include in the \nantiterrorism bill, underscores Congress's commitment to prevent any \nsuch acts of bigotry and violence.\n  A Human Rights Watch report revealed that over 1,100 individuals have \nbeen detained as part of the Justice Department's terrorism \ninvestigation after the September 11 attacks. Scores of detainees are \nstill in custody today, some having been detained for over two months \nwith no explanation to family members or friends. We need to be \ncareful. History has taught us that in times of war, our government has \nsometimes acted in haste and in error. We can point to incident after \nincident where the Executive Branch implemented measures that in \nhindsight went too far and infringed on our civil liberties. Let us \nmake sure that history does not repeat itself as the Justice Department \ncontinues its investigation of the terror attacks of September 11.\n  In celebrating Dr. King's birthday, we continue to learn from his \nwords. I am proud to say our nation is a melting pot of different \nethnic groups, and together we form the strongest nation in the world. \nIn his famous ``I Have a Dream'' speech, Dr. King said, ``Let us not \nwallow in the valley of despair. I say to you today, my friends, that \neven though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still \nhave a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have \na dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the meaning \nof its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \ncreated equal.''\n  Let us not forget the truths Dr. King taught us. We must join \ntogether to celebrate his triumphs, and live out his words, that all \nmen and women, having been created equal, will be treated with equal \ndignity and respect.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Madam President, earlier this month I had the \nopportunity to visit our troops in Afghanistan who are on the front \nlines in the global war to conquer terrorism. I also spoke with new \nAfghani leaders, who desire a far different future for their people. \nWhile visiting with them, I was reminded of a quote from Martin Luther \nKing Jr.'s letter from Birmingham city jail: ``Injustice anywhere is a \nthreat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network \nof mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one \ndirectly affects all indirectly.''\n  The life of Dr. King always reminds me of the power of one; the \npossibility that each of us has for righting wrong, no matter who we \nare or where we are. When Dr. King began his work, he was not a \nprominent political figure. He did not have great financial resources \nat his command. He was a simple Baptist preacher.\n  He was walking in the footsteps of those who had gone before him. \nPeople like Sojourner Truth who embodied the power of one. She was not \nfamous in any way; she was a humble slave woman with a commanding \npresence and a heart-wrenching story.\n  There was Harriet Beecher Stowe, writer of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin.'' She \nwas not a social philosopher or a theologian; she was a housewife with \nseven children.\n  Rosa Parks was not a revolutionary; she was a woman who was tired \nafter a day's work and wanted to sit down on a bus.\n  None of these people began with great wealth, fame, or political \npower. Yet they harnessed the inner strength to challenge traditional \nthinking and to change the course of our Nation, not with guns and \nhatred, but with nonviolence and love.\n  This past year we saw the heroism of average working Americans--\nfirefighters, police officers, emergency medical personnel, postal \nworkers and members of the armed forces. We learned again that each of \nus owes a debt to freedom.\n  Dr. King reminded us that ``the arc of the universe is long, but it \nends in justice.'' For more than 200 years, Americans like Sojourner \nTruth, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Rosa Parks and Dr. King himself have \npushed and prodded our Nation toward greater equality. Now in this \ncentury, it is up to us to continue that long journey. We cannot be \nbystanders to history. We all have some Martin Luther King in us. His \nwork is now our work, and there is much to be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S19-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S19-S21]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC STIMULUS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, the Senate has failed to follow the House \nof Representatives in passing compromise, bipartisan legislation to \nhelp stimulate our economy and provide temporary assistance to \ndisplaced workers. While the Bush administration and the House \ncompromised, some would say too much, in their effort to act \nresponsibly and find the middle ground, opponents of this legislation \nwere tireless in their efforts to undermine its passage. I applaud the \nHouse, the Bush administration, and the Senate Republican leadership, \nincluding Senator Grassley, for their effort to provide the Senate with \nan opportunity to pass an economic stimulus package.\n  Sadly, the majority leader refused even to allow a simple vote on \nthis legislation. Why? Was it because he knew that this compromise \nwould pass the Senate? If the economy continues to falter, there can be \nno question where the blame lies.\n  Voting on the economic stimulus package would have provided an \nexcellent opportunity for members to put aside their partisan \nobjectives, and come together in the best interests of the American \npeople. The economic data are compelling. The terrorist attacks have \nthrown an already struggling economy into a tailspin, and the dismal \neconomic reports released for the months of October and November, \ndetailing the rise in unemployment and the decline in manufacturing \nactivity, confirmed these worst fears; that we are in the midst of a \nrecession.\n  As many economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan \nGreenspan, have correctly noted, this is an ``investment'' recession, \nmeaning that the slowdown is caused by a contraction of business \ninvestment, with resultant job loss and economic dislocation. Yet the \nmajority leader fought against proposals that would have provided \nincentives for investment, and innovation. He and his supporters \nincomprehensibly denied the unarguable truism that meaningful economic \nstimulus emanates from the private sector, from businesses both large \nand small. An objective observer would likely note that, having already \npassed legislation that provides for $40 billion in emergency spending \nfor disaster relief, and $15 billion in additional spending for an \nemergency airline package to deal with the temporary shut-down of air \ntravel, it made sense for Congress to balance this spending, and any \nfurther spending, with tax relief targeted towards stimulating economic \nactivity in the private sector.\n  The majority leader argued instead that spending would be more \nbeneficial. But it should already be obvious that the perils of \nunrestrained spending are real. Congress has already\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\nspent all of the Social Security surplus, and our Federal budget is now \nin a deficit position. Consequently, additional Federal spending will \nrequire the Federal Government to issue new debt in order to finance \nnew spending. This new debt will mean that the government, in addition \nto maintaining post-World War II record high levels of income tax \nburdens of Americans, must again borrow from the American public to \nfinance its operations. This renewed Federal borrowing may cause \ninterest rates to rise, which in turn would slow down our economic \nrecovery. In short, Congress must be extremely skeptical about any new \nspending, especially when it results in deficit spending.\n\n  The real point, however, is that we cannot spend our way out of a \nrecession. Everyone agrees that some additional spending is needed to \nassist the hundreds of thousands of workers both directly, and \nindirectly affected in the aftermath of September 11. But should the \ngoal be to provide these workers with unemployment checks? Or should it \nbe to provide them with paychecks? Clearly, people would prefer to \nwork, not collect unemployment benefits. And creating jobs starts with \nspurring investment so that entrepreneurs are able to form and grow \nbusinesses, which in turn, will be able to employ workers.\n  Nearly 2 months ago, President Bush proposed a package that promised \nto both provide additional spending to support those workers who lost \ntheir jobs and, at the same time, enact fundamental tax relief measures \nto promote investment and ensure that those same workers would be able \nto find work again in the near future. In the effort to avoid a \npartisan debate at this critical time, he included several \nrecommendations from the Senate majority in his bipartisan proposal. It \nwas a balanced and responsible combination of tax relief and temporary \nspending.\n  Prior to September 11, our economy was beginning to show signs of a \npossible turnaround. The bipartisan tax relief package passed by \nCongress, and signed into law by President Bush on June 7 was just \nstarting to make its way through the economy. However, any progress on \nthe road to recovery has all but been lost due to the terrorist \nattacks. In fact, the general economic situation has worsened \nsubstantially. That is why the Senate would have passed the President's \nproposal.\n  First, it would have accelerated all of the marginal income-tax rate \ncuts that became law this summer, but are now delayed until 2004 and \n2006. The proposed plan would have them take effect on January 1, 2002, \nand would have applied to rates at every level of income. Considering \nthat roughly one-third of personal tax filers are actually small \nbusinesses, I believe that it is essential that the 40 percent top \nmarginal tax rate come down immediately to 33 percent to help \nunincorporated small firms retain and create more jobs. Entrepreneurs \nand the customers they serve are the life-blood of our economic system. \nMore money in their hands means more money moving through the entire \neconomy.\n  In an effort to encourage investment, the President's original plan \nalso incorporated a 30 percent depreciation bonus for the purchase of \nany new capital assets. This would enable companies to get much-needed \nequipment and other resources that might not otherwise have been \naffordable.\n  Furthermore, his original plan included a full repeal of the \ncorporate alternative minimum tax, AMT, a thoroughly regressive, \ntortuously complicated, and utterly unfair tax that literally imposes a \nheavier burden on companies when their income falls. On November 6, the \nTreasury Department released data showing that, in 1998, some 30,226 \ncompanies paid higher taxes due to the corporate AMT than they would \notherwise have paid. Thus, during an economic downturn like the one we \nare currently experiencing, as companies are currently seeing their \nsales and profits dip, their tax burden is actually increased.\n\n  The President's original plan advocated a prospective repeal of the \ncorporate AMT, unlike other proposals that are retroactive. Repeal \nwould have immediately freed up monies for investment and employee \nretention. What's more, elimination of this administrative nightmare \nwould dramatically lessen the tax code's current drag on the economy. \nIt's really quite simple; repeal of the corporate AMT yields immediate \nshort-term relief at a time when the economy needs it most.\n  Lastly, in a bipartisan effort, the President reached across the \naisle and embraced a Democratic proposal that would provide rebates of \nup to $300 for workers who filed income-tax returns but did not have an \nincome-tax liability.\n  Senate Republicans embraced the President's reasonable and \nresponsible approach. We urged the majority leader to quickly act upon \nhis plan and the first economic stimulus package that the House passed.\n  Personally, I strongly supported the President's plan; however, I \nbelieved it could have been strengthened by a couple of key provisions. \nFirst, I believe it is absolutely crucial that we make the provisions \nof the tax law signed on June 7 permanent, especially with respect to \nrepeal of the estate tax. The importance of permanence cannot be \nunderstated. It is critical to the financial planning of families and \nbusinesses, all of whom must make important decisions based on what \nthey expect will be the tax laws in the future. Assuring taxpayers that \nthe tax relief they now have will still be there 10 years down the line \nprovides a level of economic certainty in these less-than-certain \ntimes, helping to bolster consumer confidence and encourage investment.\n  Second, if we are to prevent thousands of bankruptcies, hundreds of \nthousands of lost jobs, and many other indirect consequences to the \nrest of the economy, we need to specifically help our struggling travel \nand tourism industry. Accordingly, I introduced legislation that I had \nhoped would be included in the economic stimulus package. My bill, \nentitled the Travel America Now Act of 2001, would provide a $500 tax \ncredit per person, and $1,000 for a couple filing jointly, for personal \nexpenses for travel originating within the United States. This includes \ntravel by airplane, ship, train, car, and bus, hotel and motel \naccommodations, and rental cars, but not meals. As first drafted, the \ncredit would have been effective from the date of enactment until \nDecember 31, 2001. The most important effect of such legislation is \nthat it would get America moving and doing business again. Millions of \nsmall businesses would have benefited.\n  I believed that the President's plan could be improved by these two \nproposals, but I supported the President's plan because I wanted to \nhelp enact legislation to help our economy get back on track.\n  Unfortunately, most members of the Senate majority were less \ninterested in compromising. In November, they crafted a partisan bill \nin the dead of night that was a special interest grab bag of new \nspending items, enhanced entitlement programs, and expanded \nbureaucracy. Its meager $20 billion business investment proposal, and \nthe $14 billion consumer spending proposal would have done very little \nto stimulate consumer activity, and even less to stimulate investment.\n\n  The bill increased spending and reduced revenues by $67 billion in \nfiscal year 2002, and $53 billion through 2011. However, two items made \nthe real cost much more expensive than the advertised price tag might \nhave suggested. First, the majority leader insisted on amending this \npartisan bill with an additional $15 billion of new spending, which \nwould have included a veritable collage of new projects, from tunnels \nfor Amtrak, ferries for New Jersey and New York, agriculture research, \nto highway repairs. Second, the unemployment provisions contained in \nthis partisan bill included some $19 billion in accelerated Reed Act \npayments. The result: taxpayers would have seen a significant increase \nin their tax burden, approximately $14 billion, over the next 10 years.\n  The bill was rammed through the Finance Committee on a strict, \npartisan vote. When it became clear that this partisan legislation \ncould not pass on the Senate floor, the majority leader chose to stop \nthe consideration of an economic stimulus package and move to low-\npriority legislation. The House had acted, as had the President, but in \nthe Senate, the majority leader continued to block consideration of an \neconomic stimulus package.\n  He brought up a big spending railroad retirement bill and then a \npork-laden farm bill, both of which could have\n\n[[Page S21]]\n\nwaited until next year. For several weeks, the Bush administration, the \nmajority in the House, and the minority in the Senate negotiated with \nthe majority leader's deputies in an effort to craft a bill he would be \nwilling to bring to the Senate floor for a vote. These deputies erected \nvarious roadblocks to disrupt these negotiations. Then the majority \nleader, himself, unilaterally raised the bar to agreement by insisting \non a compromise package that would be acceptable to two-thirds of the \nDemocrats in the Senate. Despite these deliberately constructed \nobstructions to compromise, advocates of an economic stimulus package \ncontinued to work hard to construct a compromise that would be \nacceptable to a majority of the House and Senate.\n  The administration made significant compromises, especially related \nto greatly expanded health insurance benefits to the recently \nunemployed through an individual tax credit for health insurance. The \nmajority leader once again raised the bar and insisted that these \nbenefits be provided to employers for the benefit of all workers who \nare unemployed. Under his proposal, even those workers who chose to \nretire early would be entitled to this new expansive health care \nprogram. Additionally, he refused to empower these displaced workers \nwith individual tax credits, but insisted on burdening businesses with \na new government mandate.\n  With three days left until the holiday weekend, the administration, \nthe House, and a majority in the Senate agreed on a bipartisan \ncompromise on economic stimulus and aid to dislocated workers. The \nHouse then passed this legislation. Despite the fact that a majority in \nthe Senate was committed to voting for it, the majority leader still \nrefused to allow this compromise legislation to come to the Senate \nfloor. So the 2001 session ended without Senate action on the most \nimportant issue facing the country.\n  Contained within this legislation is $60 billion of investment \nstimulus--just the sort of assistance that Chairman Greenspan had urged \nus to enact. Under the bipartisan stimulus package, the current 27 \npercent rate would drop to 25 percent in 2002. This provision \naccelerates the bipartisan decision the Senate made last summer to \nreduce individual tax rates. Under last summer's tax cut bill, the 27 \npercent rate would have fallen to 26 percent in 2004 and 25 percent in \n2006. This cut benefits married couples with taxable income between \n$45,200 and $109,250; singles with taxable income between $27,050 and \n$65,550; heads of household with taxable income between $36,250 and \n$93,650. Acceleration of the 27 percent rate reduction would yield \n$17.9 billion of tax relief in 2002 for over 36 million taxpayers, or \none-third of all income taxpayers.\n\n  The bipartisan stimulus package provides 30 percent bonus \ndepreciation for three years. Property eligible for the 30 percent \nbonus depreciation includes property depreciated over 20 years or less, \nwater utility property, computer software, etc. Property which takes \nlonger than three years to construct will qualify for bonus \ndepreciation on a pro-rata basis, if the property is placed in service \nbefore 2007. The portion eligible for bonus depreciation would be the \ncosts incurred within the three-year bonus depreciation window. This \nprovision would encourage accelerating long-term construction activity \ninto the next three years.\n  Additional investment stimulus included in this legislation is an \nextension of net operating loss carrybacks for two years, corporate \nalternative minimum tax relief, and an increase of the small business \nexpensing amount to $35,000. All of which would help stimulate economic \nactivity in our country.\n  The House-passed bipartisan stimulus package would also provide \nchecks to low-income Americans in order to stimulate consumer spending. \nThe legislation also would extend popular expiring tax provisions, \nprovide targeted incentives to help with the New York City \nreconstruction, and exempt the victims of terrorist attacks from \nfederal taxes. Finally, the bill would provide nearly $20 billion of \naid to dislocated workers in the form of greatly expanded unemployment \npayments and health benefits.\n  This proposal was a compromise. It is not the legislation that I \nwould have written. But this legislation was a carefully crafted \nbipartisan, bicameral compromise that the President would have signed. \nIt passed the House. It had the support of a majority of the Senate. \nBut it died because the majority leader was unwilling to let the \nmajority act.\n  So the economy will not be helped. Unemployed workers will not be \nhelped. Small businesses will not be helped. Taxpayers will not be \nhelped. Workers hoping to save their jobs will not be helped. All \nbecause of one man. Remember that next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S21-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S21-S22]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE AMERICAN SMALL BUSINESS EMERGENCY RELIEF AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the behalf of \nthousands of small business owners across this country who are still \nstruggling to keep their businesses open in the aftermath of the \nterrorist attacks. They're having a tremendously tough time paying \ntheir bills and making payroll, and they need access to affordable \nloans so that they have sufficient working capital as they adjust to \nthe market or until business returns to normal.\n  Senator Bond and I put forth a comprehensive bill in the last \nsession, shortly after terrorist attacks, that addressed not only \ndisaster assistance and the worsening credit crunch that has compounded \nthe financial problems of small businesses, but also the need for \nbusiness counseling and protection in recovering lost revenue from \nfrozen federal contracting jobs. I am talking specifically about S. \n1499, the American Small Business Emergency Relief and Recovery Act of \n2001.\n  For the sake of small business owners and their employees, I wish I \ncould say that I was here to speak about implementation of this \nlegislation. But I cannot. S. 1499, was blocked by the Administration \nand a few Republican Senators. So here I am, at the beginning of \nanother session, a new year, and four months after the bill was \nintroduced, talking about the Senate acting on emergency legislation as \nsmall businesses wait for us to do something to help them. I really do \nnot know how anyone in this body could stand to go home after Congress \nadjourned and explain to their constituents how we could provide \nbillions in loans and grants to airlines, but we could not provide a \nmodicum of that assistance to small businesses.\n  Republicans holding the bill in the Senate tell me and the press that \nthey blocked the bill and still have holds on the bill because the \nAdministration has problems with it. The Administration says they have \nproblems with the bill because they do not believe there is a credit \ncrunch making it harder and more expensive for small businesses to get \nloans. They do not believe we need to provide incentives to stimulate \nborrowing or to encourage banks to make loans to small businesses.\n  How can there be no credit crunch when survey results by the Federal \nReserve reveal that as many as 51 percent of banks have reduced lending \nto small businesses? How can there be no credit crunch when established \ngiants like the airlines could not get loans in the post-September 11th \neconomy?\n  Please tell me how the Administration's priority is an economic \nstimulus package, but the Administration wants us to drop the stimulus \nprovisions in S. 1499? What better way to stimulate the economy than \nthrough business investment and job creation? What is homeland security \nwithout economic security? They want us to drop the protection for \nsmall businesses doing business with the Federal Government. And they \nwant us to drop incentives making the Small Business Administration's \nloans more affordable for borrowers and lenders.\n  Senator Bond and I asked them to meet us halfway, and they said no. \nWe asked them to give us alternative language, and they didn't give us \nany. We spent more than 20 hours negotiating on this bill and it \nappears as if the Administration never had any intention of finding \ncommon ground. It appears as if it was an exercise in delay.\n  Let me describe briefly where I disagree with the Administration \nabout how to help small businesses battling bankruptcy and employee \nlayoffs triggered by the terrorist attacks and economic downturn. The \nAdministration believes that all assistance should be\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\ndelivered through the SBA's disaster loans, which are administered \nthrough only four regional offices. From talking to small businesses \nand SBA lenders, Senator Bond and I have concluded that small \nbusinesses would be better served through a combination of disaster \nloans and government guaranteed loans. Government guaranteed loans are \nalmost five times cheaper than what the Administration has proposed, \nhave less risk for the taxpayer, and can reach more small business \nowners because they are delivered through more than 5,000 private \nsector lenders who know their communities and have experience making \nSBA guaranteed loans. Our proposal combines public and private sector \napproaches to ensure small businesses nationwide receive the maximum \namount of assistance.\n  The economy was fizzling before September 11th, and small businesses \nwere already feeling the pain. To stay financially healthy, they were \ndoing their part by cutting back on spending, investing and hiring, and \nthe Federal Reserve was cutting interest rates in an attempt to keep \ninflation in check. After September 11th, small business owners across \nthis country put on black arm bands. The plug was pulled on their \nbusiness.

The Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 would add \nnew categories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred November 21, \n1995 in West Hollywood, CA. A male transvestite was beaten by several \nmen yelling anti-gay epithets. The assailants, Agaron Guylbkyan, 21, \nHarutun Pagaryan, 18, and Vahagn Arutyunyan, 19, were charged with \ncivil rights violations in connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S22-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S22]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. KYL.

I qualify \nthat support because there are numerous programs and pork projects that \nwill not support the critical needs of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand Marines.\n  Even worse, there are projects that I believe are necessary to our \nnational defense which have been severely under-cut to meet the top \nline numbers while these less than mandatory projects have been added \nand given millions, if not billions, of dollars. I agree with my \ncolleague from Arizona that, once again, the Appropriations Committee \nhas run roughshod over the legislative process, circumventing the \nauthorization process and the will of the Senate at the last minute of \nthe last day of the session.\n  Obviously, we must fund our current military campaign and our other \ndefense needs; so I will support this bill to provide necessary \nfunding.

A \nnative resident of Xenia, OH, Chip Noble has raced to 3,293 victories \nand three North American Driving Championships.\n  Chip learned how to race through the tutelage of his father, getting \nhis start at the Lebanon Raceway. In a normal year, Chip drives in \nabout 500 to 1,000 races. The percentage crown winner in 1978, 1981, \nand 1983, Chip has earned over $17.6 million for the owners of the \nhorses he drives.\n  This past summer, Chip Noble competed in the World Driving \nChampionships as the representative of the United States. He was one of \nten drivers world-wide who competed in this prestigious event, which is \nbelieved to be the world's oldest international harness racing \ntournament. Proudly displaying the colors of our country, Chip drove to \nfour heat victories, the most individual victories amassed during the \ncompetition, and finished fourth overall.\n  I congratulate Chip Noble on his tremendous performance in the World \nDriving Championship and for his wonderful career in harness racing. He \nis a true ambassador of the sport, and I wish him the best of luck in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S22-5", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S22-S23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO RANDIE BLAUTH AND ADRIENNE THOMAS\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI.

As members of the Glen Ridge community, Ms. Blauth \nand Ms. Thomas have demonstrated an extraordinarily high level of \ncommitment and selflessness to which we should all strive to achieve.\n  However, the impact of their service reaches far beyond the \nclassroom. Both Ms. Blauth and Ms. Thomas have dedicated themselves to \ncreating a supportive and productive environment for the youth of Glen \nRidge. They have helped to shape the minds and encourage the spirit of \nthese young individuals during a crucial stage of development in their \nlives.\n  Ms. Blauth's and Ms. Thomas' accomplishments, throughout their years \nof service, reflect only a small portion of the many contributions they \nhave made to the people of Glen Ridge. Their efforts have touched the \nlives of their students as well as those throughout their community.\n  They are an example of the professionalism that we look for in our \neducators, and the type of citizens that we hope to find in our \nneighborhoods, which is why their dedication is to be recognized and \ncommended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S23-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO COLONEL BENJAMIN L. CASSIDY, USMC\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I recognize Colonel Benjamin \nL. Cassidy, United States Marine Corps, on the occasion of his \nretirement from active duty. During his twenty-eight years with the \nCorps, Colonel Cassidy served our nation with distinction and aplomb.\n  After having graduated from Brown University in 1975, Colonel Cassidy \nwas commissioned aboard the U.S.S. Constitution in Boston Harbor. Upon \ncompletion of The Basic School in 1975, he was transferred to Camp \nLejeune, NC where he served as the Battalion Logistics Officer, \nExecutive Officer, and Platoon Commander, 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines, \n2nd Marine Division.\n  In 1978, Colonel Cassidy was assigned to 3rd Reconnaissance \nBattalion, 3rd Marine Division in Okinawa, Japan where he served as \nCompany Commander and Platoon Commander. He was transferred to Fort \nBenning, GA in 1980 where he attended the Infantry Officers Advanced \nCourse. Upon graduation, he accepted orders to Recruiting Station, \nHartford, CT and served as the Recruiting Station Executive Officer \nfrom 1981 to 1984.\n  From 1984 to 1987, he served with the 1st Battalion, 8th Marine \nRegiment, 2nd Marine Division, Camp Lejeune, NC as the Battalion \nOperations Officer and Company Commander. In 1987, he attended the \nMarine Corps Command and Staff College at Quantico, VA and was later \nassigned as an Instructor.\n  From 1989 to 1991, Colonel Cassidy served as the Marine Corps' \nExchange Officer to the Brazilian Marine Corps, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. \nFrom 1991 through 1993, he served with the Bureau of International \nNarcotics Matters, U.S. Department of State, Washington, D.C. During \nthis time, he also earned a Masters in National Security Studies at \nGeorgetown University.\n  He next served as Battalion Inspector-Instructor and Marine Corps \nAdvisor, 4th Reconnaissance Battalion, 4th Marine Division, San \nAntonio, TX. In 1995, he served as Marine Corps Liaison and student at \nthe Chilean Naval War College, Valparaiso, Chile.\n  Many of you know Ben personally, as he has served for almost 4 years \nas the Director of the Marine Corps' Senate Liaison Office. During \nColonel Cassidy's tenure here at the United States Senate, he planned \nand led numerous congressional delegations on fact-finding trips around \nthe world. He coordinated these delegations flawlessly and with \nmeticulous attention to detail. In addition, he has overseen the \nresolution of hundreds of congressional inquiries that have been \nsubmitted to the Marine Corps for clarification and assistance. Colonel \nCassidy has also worked to ensure that members of the Senate have a \nbetter understanding of the requirements and capabilities of the Navy/\nMarine Corps Team.\n  We in the Senate have benefitted from Colonel Cassidy's dedication, \nsense of duty and outstanding work ethic, and I have made certain that \nwe continue to benefit by hiring him as my Defense and Foreign Affairs \nLegislative Assistant. I wish Colonel Cassidy, his wonderful wife \nKathleen, and their children Alanna, Ben, and Caroline, fair winds and \nfollowing seas as he begins this new chapter of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S23-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL JOHN D. HAVENS\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I am honored today to pay \ntribute to the outgoing Adjutant General of the Missouri National \nGuard, Major General John D. Havens.\n  Governor Carnahan appointed him to this post on March 6, 1997. For \nthe next 4 years, General Havens was responsible for leading 10,000 \nMissouri Army and Air National Guard personnel as well as the State \nEmergency Management Agency and Civil Air Patrol.\n  Under his stewardship, the State's Guard was always ready for action; \nready to respond to disasters both in Missouri and elsewhere when duty \ncalled. In addition, the Missouri Guard was ready to aid in our \ncountry's national defense. General Havens has been in command of our \nMissouri Guard men and women as they performed missions in defense of \nfreedom throughout the world. His troops have graced the sky or put \nboots on the ground of 18 States and 26 countries.\n  General Havens created several ground-breaking programs as well. He \nwas instrumental in establishing Missouri's Show-Me ChalleNGe Program \nfor our State's youth. His Guardsmen created an educational program \nthat instilled discipline and motivation in teenagers who had dropped \nout of school. To this day, the valuable program continues to enhance \nthe responsibility and self-esteem of Missouri's ``at-risk'' youth.\n  General Havens fostered a culture of success by growing an \norganization that emphasizes skill, talent, and dedication, and values \ndiversity. This philosophy enabled him to improve recruitment in both \nrural and urban areas, as demonstrated by our impressive retention \nrates under General Havens' administration. Missourians are proud to be \nassociated with our Guard. For his action, the NAACP presented the \nGeneral with its prestigious 2001 Roy Wilkins Renown Service Award \nhonoring his concern for the diversity, health, strength, comfort and \naccomplishments of the Guard's men and women.\n  Throughout his military career, General Havens earned several other \nawards, including the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal, \nthe Army Commendation Medal, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, the Army \nReserve Component Achievement Medal, and the National Defense Service \nMedal.\n  But more important than any of these awards, was the honor and \nrespect he enjoys from the men and women who served under him. General \nHavens is truly a people's general, and he will be missed.\n  In the past, I had the opportunity to work with Guard members first \nhand as they helped Missourians cope with natural disasters. I saw the \ndeep commitment and compassion General Havens had instilled in them. I \nwill also never forget the tremendous kindness shown by General Havens \nand members of the Guard during my husband's funeral.\n  General Havens' career reflects the ideal of service represented by \nGeneral George Washington when he said, ``When we assumed the Soldier, \nwe did not lay aside the Citizen.'' Throughout his career of service to \nour State and to this Nation, he truly epitomized the concept of \nCitizen Soldier.\n  General Havens has served our Nation and our State honorably. I wish \nhim all the best in retirement. He will be remembered as a patriot, a \nleader, a Missourian, an American, and a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S23-3", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S23-S24]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO THE CITY OF AKRON\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the citizens \nof Akron, OH, for their selfless actions following the September 11 \nterrorist attacks. Specifically, the Akron Beacon Journal, the City's \nlargest daily newspaper, launched a campaign to collect donations to \npurchase a fire truck for New York City.\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\n  As we all know too well, on September 11, terrorists attacked our \ngreat Nation in a way many of us thought unimaginable. While these acts \nwere, indeed, horrific, instead of leaving us frozen and helpless, so \nmany Americans have banded together and acted in ways that exemplify \nwhy this country of ours is so great. The citizens of Akron are a \nperfect example of this.\n  After deliberating about what could be done to help the people of New \nYork City, the executives of the Akron Beacon Journal came up with an \nanswer: a fund to purchase a new fire truck for the city of New York.\n  On September 16, the Akron Beacon Journal opened the fund with a \ndonation of $25,000 and then asked the citizens of Akron to donate, as \nwell. The people of Akron answered this call, and responded in a \nresounding way. Immediately, money began pouring in for the fund.\n  A month later, over $1.3 million had been raised with donations from \nalmost 50,000 individuals and companies and organizations. With this \nmoney, the City of Akron was able to purchase a 95-foot ladder fire \ntruck, as well as two EMS vehicles and three police cars.\n  I am proud of the people of Akron. And, I thank them for their \nextraordinary gift. This donated equipment has done more than just help \nNew York City rebuild some of what was lost. it has reminded us all of \nthe amazing things we can accomplish when we pull together. Their gift \nwas one from the heart and I thank each and every one who helped make \nthis possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S24-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S24]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING DR. MOISES SIMPSER\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a fine \nhumanitarian and Floridian, Dr. Moises Simpser. Throughout his career \nas a pediatric pulmonologist, Dr. Simpser has worked for the well-being \nof all sick children; particularly those that are technology dependent \nand otherwise referred to as ``fragile children.'' Dr. Simpser's goal \nhas been an admirable one--to achieve the best medical care for all \nchildren of all economic strata and backgrounds.\n  Since his arrival in Florida in 1984, Dr. Simpser has been an \nunyielding advocate for the young patient. As Dr. Simpser's patients \nare technology dependent, they were only cared for in Intensive Care \nUnits of hospitals, where they became virtual prisoners in the unit. He \nfought diligently for the State of Florida to cover the cost of \nhomecare for a ventilator dependent child. Through this program, even \nthe youngest of children on ventilators were sent home for care in \ntheir familiar and familial environments. However, even at home, the \nchildren increasingly became isolated within their own four walls. To \nhelp free these children, Dr. Simpser developed and founded the first \nVentilator Assisted Children's Center Camp or VACC Camp.\n  VACC Camp is a place where both families and technology dependent \nchildren can be in an environment that allows these fragile children to \ndo everyday activities that were once unavailable to them. These \ninclude activities such as swimming, boating, sailing, visiting malls, \nand many others. These children, always ventilator dependent and \nusually wheelchair bound and afflicted with additional diseases, are \nable to enjoy the wonders of Florida's nature and outdoors at no cost \nto their families.\n  VACC Camp has allowed both abled and disabled children to come \ntogether for a life broadening experience by providing an incentive for \nabled children to participate. Dr. Simpser has worked with Florida's \nMiami-Dade County school system to create a 100 percent volunteer \nstaff, with the school board furnishing high school students with \nservice credits for their volunteer efforts. This remarkable camp, now \nin its 16th year, earned Dr. Simpser the prestigious 1998 Governors \nCommunity Service Award from the College of Chest Physicians.\n  In addition to his development of VACC Camp, Dr. Simpser has \nestablished a pediatric asthma center for underprivileged children. He \nreceived a combined grant which allowed him to demonstrate that \nproviding quality medical care to this population can reduce emergency \nroom visits and hospitalizations in these children by 70 percent.\n  He has also established a Cystic Fibrosis Center in South Florida, \nthe first such center to be associated with the National Cystic \nFibrosis Foundation. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation honored him as the \nrecipient of the first Lucent Technologies Humanitarian of the Year \nAward.\n  Dr. Simpser's altruism and dedication to quality health care for \nchildren regardless of race, gender, and economic status are a positive \nstatement for doctors across America. Dr. Simpser has been honored and \nshould be admired for the good he does every day, for his persistence \nin always improving the delivery of quality healthcare, and for his \nvision to meet the needs of severely debilitated children. I am indeed \nproud to acknowledge the work of Dr. Moises Simpser.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S24-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S24-S25]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO LOU ``THE TOE'' GROZA AND ERIC TURNER\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I honor two titans of the \ngridiron--Lou ``The Toe'' Groza and Eric Turner. These men both played \nfootball for the Cleveland Browns. And, sadly, both have passed away, \nleaving enormous voids not only in the lives of their families and \nfriends, but also in the hearts of the millions of fans who admired \nthem.\n  I'd like to spend a few minutes telling my colleagues about these two \nmen. Both on and off the field, Lou Groza was a model sportsman and \ncitizen. In the 1940s, Lou Groza had no time for football because he \nwas serving his country as a medic in Okinawa. Upon his return from the \nwar, Groza joined Paul Brown's Cleveland team and capped the 1950 \nseason with a NFL championship field goal against the Los Angeles Rams. \nThat championship was the first of 12 in which Groza would compete. \nThroughout his 21-year career, the longest serving Brown player, Groza \nwas selected for the Pro-Bowl nine different times.\n  During his football career, he totaled an incredible 1,608 points, \nappeared in 13 pro-football championship games, was a six-time All-NFL \noffensive tackle, and was the last member of the Browns inaugural team \nto retire. Groza's outstanding service to the Browns, and to football, \nwas rewarded in 1974 with his induction into the Hall of Fame.\n  Lou Groza, who dearly loved his hometown of Berea, OH, and the \nBrowns, was a man who really seemed larger than life. He was nothing \nsort of a sports legend. When Lou retired in 1967, it marked not only \nthe end of his football career, but the end of a glorious era in Browns \nhistory.\n  Lou Groza's football achievements speak for themselves, but it was \nwhat Groza did off the field that fellow Clevelanders remember him for \nmost. After retiring from the Browns, Groza became a partner in a \nsuccessful insurance company. He was constantly giving back to the \nCleveland community through charitable organizations, such as the \n``Taste of the NFL,'' which has raised millions for the hungry. Groza \nalways had the time to sign an autograph and often was overheard \nsaying: ``I'm no better than the fans who rooted for me all those \nyears.''\n  In speaking of a man who cared so much of his community and his team, \nwe should not forget another Brown star recently passed away. That man \nis Eric Turner. He was a safety, who was drafted second overall, the \nfirst defensive player to be picked that high since 1956. Although he \nonly played a few years in Cleveland before the team was moved to \nBaltimore, Eric made it known that his heart would never leave the \nBrowns of their wonderful fans. Eric was an active participant in the \nUnited Way, a devoted father, and a mentor to his teammates. His warm \npersonality and generosity are truly missed.\n  Lou Groza and Eric Turner had a love for football and for those \naround them. They gave to their team, to their families, and to their \ncommunities. I think it is only fitting that we give a little back to \nthem by honoring them today and by keeping them and their families in \nour prayers.\n  I feel honored today to stand before this body and pay my respects to \nthese two fine men. They both displayed courage on the playing field, \nas well as in their own personal battles. Each man fought their failing \nhealth. Each man fought the good fight.\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\n  Tennis great, Arthur Ashe, whose own life ended all too soon, once \nsaid something that I think helps describe the kind of people, the \nkinds of heroes, that Lou Groza and Eric Turner were when they were \nalive and how they will be remembered in their deaths. Ashe said:\n\n       True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is \n     not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the \n     urge to serve others at whatever cost.\n\n  Today, we honor them as for their virtue and their strength of \ncharacter.

FINZER\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Mr. \nNicholas Finzer, an Arkansas native who this month will end a long \ncareer in public service as an employee of the U.S. Forest Service.\n  A 1963 graduate of the University of Arkansas, Nick joined the Forest \nService in Montana before leaving to serve his country in Vietnam. Nick \nlater returned to the Forest Service, working in forest and timber \nmanagement and as a forest ranger in Idaho, Montana, Arkansas, North \nCarolina, and Texas, before returning to Arkansas for good in 1984.\n  That is when Nick began his tenure as Lands and Minerals Staff \nOfficer on the Ouachita National Forest. One of his top priorities in \nthis position was acquiring new lands in order to accomodate the \npublic's interest to expand the forest. In nearly two decades service \nin the Ouachita National Forest, Nick always took a pro-active approach \nto acquiring new lands for the Forest Service, either through exchanges \nor purchases.\n  In 1996, Nick oversaw the exchange of over 180,000 acres from \nWeyerhauser Company for nearly 48,000 acres of government property. \nThis transaction took in land over two States, Arkansas and Oklahoma, \nand required Congressional legislation to complete. At the time, it was \nthe largest land exchange in the history of the Forest Service. Nick's \ncolleagues attribute the success of this massive exchange to his \nwisdom, expertise, and perseverance.\n  Nick also spearheaded efforts to develop new programs in the Forest \nService. He recognized the potential of the Ouachita Mountains as a \npart of the Forest Service's geological program. Some people may not \nrealize it, but the Ouachita Mountains are home to a series of world-\nclass quartz crystal deposits, many of which are located in the \nOuachita National Forest. These deposits have attracted both commercial \nactivity, mineral collectors, and tourists, and Nick should be saluted \nfor recognizing the possibilities of these minerals. Years ago, he sat \ndown with my predecessor, Senator Dale Bumpers, and convinced him of \nthe significance of mineral resources in our Nation's forests, \nparticularly the importance of managing these resources. With Nick's \nhelp, Senator Bumpers focused on a number of important land and mineral \nissues that were important to the Ouachita National Forest, to the \nbenefit of all Arkansans.\n  Nick Finzer's farsighted approach to forest management has brought \ngreat benefits to Arkansas and to the United States. His efforts have \nhelped to preserve and improve the Ouachita National Forest for us and \nour children. For that and many other accomplishments, we owe Nick a \ntremendous debt of gratitude, and I am honored to pay tribute to \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S25-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S25]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S25-3", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S25]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S25-4", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S25]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE RISK OF \n NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION CREATED BY THE ACCUMULATION OF WEAPONS--USABLE \n FISSILE MATERIAL IN THE TERRITORY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 63\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nperiodic report on the national emergency with respect to the risk of \nnuclear proliferation created by the accumulation of weapons-usable \nfissile material in the territory of the Russian Federation that was \ndeclared in Executive Order 13159 of June 21, 2000.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 37 Carl Path in Deer Park, New York, as the \n``Raymond M. Downey Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nGovernment Affairs.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto pay tribute to a great New Yorker, a beloved leader and noble public \nservant, Deputy Chief Ray Downey of the New York City Fire Department. \nThe legislation I'm introducing today with my colleague, Senator \nSchumer, would name a post office in Deer Park, New York as the \n``Raymond M. Downey Post Office Building.''\n  Firs, I want to express my deepest sympathies to his wife, Rosalie, \nand their five children for their terrible loss.\n  A hero among heroes, Ray Downey was one of the most decorated members \nof the Fire Department, awarded five medals for valor and 16 unit \ncitations. His esteemed career spanned nearly 40 years with the New \nYork Fire Department, including service with both ladder and engine \ncompanies, as well as rescue squads. A former Marine, Downey joined the \nNew York fire department in 1962, first serving in Brooklyn.\n  From the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 to the 1993 \nWorld Trade Center bombing, Chief Downey helped lead the department \nwith his skill and courage. He was considered a leading expert on \nrescues involving collapsed buildings. For nearly 15 years, he \ncommanded Rescue Company 2 and in August, because of his leadership and \nskill, he was promoted to Special Operations Command, which dealt with \nhazardous materials and rescue work. The reach of his work extended \nbeyond New York City. He was a leader of the Urban Search and Rescue \nTeam, which assisted in the Walton Floods response in Upstate New York, \nas well as the ``ice storm'' that hit Upstate in 2000 and Hurricane \nGeorges and the Dominican Republic.\n  Due to his incredible knowledge of how buildings fall down, he has \nbeen described as having ``rock star'' status among firefighters across \nthe country. Congressman Israel, who introduced the companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives, summed it up well, saying, \n``He is a national treasure.'' I could not agree more.\n  Chief Downey was also a member of a national advisory commission on \ndomestic response to terrorism. Nearly five years ago, he warned that \nour next war would be fought in an urban area, and, unfortunately, he \nwas right. Early on September 11, at age 63, just like he did a \nthousand times before, Ray Downey responded to the call for duty. In \nspite of his age, he joined the heroic and unforgettable effort to save \nlives in World Trade Center towers. The unmistakable courage and the \nincalculable sacrifices that he and all the public safety officers who \nresponded that day made for the good of their communities and their \ncountry are the kinds of virtues and values that make them real-life \nheroes.\n  It has been reported that after September 11, Ray Downey's wife \nRosalie, found a manila folder in his brief case filled with letters \nand praise from his lifetime of service. This modest man, who never \nboasted of his incredible rescues, had immense pride in his work, and \nrightly so. He quietly chronicled his service to the city and the \nmanila folder grew thicker.\n  His life of service will also live on in the hearts and minds of all \nthose whose lives he touched through his bravery and leadership. We \nwill never forget Ray Downey's extraordinary career and I ask you to \njoin us today in supporting this legislation, which will create a \nlasting tribute to this legendary figure. Ray Downey leaves behind a \ngrateful city, in awe of all he achieved on its behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S33-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S33]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 200--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \nNATIONAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR THE ELDERLY, ON THE OCCASION OF THE 30TH \n                    ANNIVERSARY OF ITS ESTABLISHMENT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following \nresolution;

Res. 200\n\n       Whereas on March 22, 1972, President Richard Nixon signed \n     Public Law 92-258, which amended the Older Americans Act of \n     1965 to establish a national nutrition program for the \n     elderly, commonly referred to as the ``Elderly Nutrition \n     Program'';\n       Whereas the Elderly Nutrition Program has been expanded \n     since its inception in 1972 to include 3 distinct components: \n     congregate meals, home delivered meals, and the Nutrition \n     Program for the Elderly in the Department of Agriculture;\n       Whereas the Elderly Nutrition Program operates in every \n     State and most counties and cities in the United States, \n     providing seniors with guaranteed meals;\n       Whereas these meals each provide at a minimum 33 percent of \n     the recommended daily allowances of nutrients;\n       Whereas the Elderly Nutrition Program has provided more \n     than 4,700,000,000 meals;\n       Whereas the Elderly Nutrition Program is a vital component \n     of a service network, providing a continuum of home- and \n     community-based long-term care for seniors and helping them \n     to avoid premature or unnecessary institutionalization;\n       Whereas the Elderly Nutrition Program provides a powerful \n     socialization opportunity for millions of seniors to help \n     combat loneliness and isolation;\n       Whereas a strong national network of nutrition service \n     providers and thousands of dedicated volunteers administer \n     the Elderly Nutrition Program; and\n       Whereas under the Elderly Nutrition Program, more than \n     272,000,000 meals are provided each year to older individuals \n     in the greatest economic or social need and to older Native \n     Americans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of \n     the establishment of a national nutrition program for the \n     elderly, commonly referred to as the ``Elderly Nutrition \n     Program''--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that the program, of \n     great importance to the health and well-being of \n     participants, is well-run and continues to achieve its \n     objectives on behalf of the senior citizens it serves; and\n       (2) the Senate--\n       (A) expresses appreciation for the daily work of all the \n     individuals, including volunteers, who administer the program \n     at the local level; and\n       (B) recognizes the importance of the present and future \n     health and well-being of the millions of senior citizens \n     across the Nation, including the maintenance of their \n     independence and dignity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/23/senate-section/article/S34-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S34]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2698.

INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY REGULAR BUDGET \n                   ASSESSMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of State has concluded that the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency (hereafter in this section \n     referred to as the ``IAEA'') is a critical and effective \n     instrument for verifying compliance with international \n     nuclear nonproliferation agreements, and that it serves as an \n     essential barrier to the spread of nuclear weapons.\n       (2) The IAEA furthers United States national security \n     objectives by helping to prevent the proliferation of nuclear \n     weapons material, especially through its work on effective \n     verification and safeguards measures.\n       (3) The IAEA can also perform a critical role in monitoring \n     and verifying aspects of nuclear weapons reduction agreements \n     between nuclear weapons states.\n       (4) As the IAEA has negotiated and developed more effective \n     verification and safeguards measures, it has experienced \n     significant real growth in its mission, especially in the \n     vital area of nuclear safeguards inspections.\n       (5) Nearly two decades of zero budget growth have affected \n     the ability of the IAEA to carry out its mission and to hire \n     and retain the most qualified inspectors and managers, as \n     evidenced in the decreasing proportion of such personnel who \n     hold doctorate degrees.\n       (6) Although voluntary contributions by the United States \n     lessen the IAEA's budgetary constraints, they cannot readily \n     be used for the long-term capital investments or permanent \n     staff increases necessary to an effective IAEA safeguards \n     regime.\n       (7) It was not the intent of Congress that the United \n     States contributions to all United Nations-related \n     organizations and activities be reduced pursuant to the \n     Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001 (as enacted \n     into law by section 1000(a)(7) of Public Law 106-113; 113 \n     Stat. 1501A-405 et seq.), which sets 22 percent assessment \n     rates as benchmarks for the general United Nations budget, \n     the Food and Agricultural Organization, the World Health \n     Organization, and the International Labor Organization. \n     Rather, contributions for important and effective agencies \n     such as the IAEA should be maintained at levels commensurate \n     with the criticality of its mission.\n       (b) Additional Funding for the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Secretary should negotiate a gradual and sustained \n     increase in the regular budget of the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency, which should begin with the 2002 budget;\n       (2) if a regular budget increase for the IAEA is achieved, \n     the Secretary should seek to gain consensus within the IAEA \n     Board of Governors for allocation of a larger proportion of \n     that budget to nuclear nonproliferation activities; and\n       (3) if such a reallocation of the regular IAEA budget \n     cannot be obtained, the United States should decrease its \n     voluntary contribution by $400,000 for each $1,000,000 \n     increase in its annual assessment.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--Of the funds \n     authorized to be appropriated for international \n     organizations, $60,000,000 are authorized to be appropriated \n     in fiscal year 2002 for the payment of the United States \n     assessment to the International Atomic Energy Agency, and \n     $75,000,000 shall be available for that purpose in fiscal \n     year 2003.\n\n     SEC. 308. REVISED NONPROLIFERATION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Section 308 of Public Law 102-182 (22 U.S.C. 5606) is \n     hereby repealed.\n\n   Subtitle B--Russian Federation Debt Reduction for Nonproliferation\n\n     SEC. 311. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Russian Federation Debt \n     Reduction for Nonproliferation Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 312. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is in the vital security interests of the United \n     States to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction \n     to additional states or to terrorist organizations, and to \n     ensure that other nations' obligations to reduce their \n     stockpiles of such arms in accordance with treaties, \n     executive agreements, or political commitments are fulfilled.\n       (2) In particular, it is in the vital national security \n     interests of the United States to ensure that--\n       (A) all stocks of nuclear weapons and weapons-usable \n     nuclear material in the Russian Federation are secure and \n     accounted for;\n       (B) stocks of nuclear weapons and weapons-usable nuclear \n     material that are excess to military needs in the Russian \n     Federation are monitored and reduced;\n       (C) any chemical or biological weapons, related materials, \n     and facilities in the Russian Federation are destroyed;\n       (D) the Russian Federation's nuclear weapons complex is \n     reduced to a size appropriate to its post-Cold War missions, \n     and its experts in weapons of mass destruction technologies \n     are shifted to gainful and sustainable civilian employment;\n       (E) the Russian Federation's export control system blocks \n     any proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the means \n     of delivering such weapons, and materials, equipment, know-\n     how, or technology that would be used to develop, produce, or \n     deliver such weapons; and\n       (F) these objectives are accomplished with sufficient \n     monitoring and transparency to provide confidence that they \n     have in fact been accomplished and that the funds provided to \n     accomplish these objectives have been spent efficiently and \n     effectively.\n       (3) United States programs should be designed to accomplish \n     these vital objectives in the Russian Federation as rapidly \n     as possible, and the President should develop and present to \n     Congress a plan for doing so.\n       (4) Substantial progress has been made in United States-\n     Russian Federation cooperative programs to achieve these \n     objectives, but much more remains to be done to reduce the \n     urgent risks to United States national security posed by the \n     current state of the Russian Federation's weapons of mass \n     destruction stockpiles and complexes.\n       (5) The threats posed by inadequate management of weapons \n     of mass destruction\n\n[[Page S42]]\n\n     stockpiles and complexes in the Russian Federation remain \n     urgent. Incidents in years immediately preceding 2001, which \n     have been cited by the Russia Task Force of the Secretary of \n     Energy's Advisory Board, include--\n       (A) a conspiracy at one of the Russian Federation's largest \n     nuclear weapons facilities to steal nearly enough highly \n     enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb;\n       (B) an attempt by an employee of the Russian Federation's \n     premier nuclear weapons facility to sell nuclear weapons \n     designs to agents of Iraq and Afghanistan; and\n       (C) the theft of radioactive material from a Russian \n     Federation submarine base.\n       (6) Addressing these threats to United States and world \n     security will ultimately consume billions of dollars, a \n     burden that will have to be shared by the Russian Federation, \n     the United States, and other governments, if this objective \n     is to be achieved.\n       (7) The creation of new funding streams could accelerate \n     progress in reducing these threats to United States security \n     and help the government of the Russian Federation to fulfill \n     its responsibility for secure management of its weapons \n     stockpiles and complexes as United States assistance phases \n     out.\n       (8) The Russian Federation suffers from a significant \n     foreign debt burden, a substantial proportion of which it \n     inherited from the Soviet Union. The Russian Federation is \n     taking full responsibility for this debt, but the burden of \n     debt repayment could threaten Russian Federation economic \n     reform, particularly in 2003 and beyond.\n       (9) The Russian Federation's need for debt relief has been \n     the subject of discussions between the United States and the \n     Russian Federation at the highest levels and is cited by \n     United States officials as one reason why the Russian \n     Federation has recognized that its future lies with the West.\n       (10) Past debt-for-environment exchanges, in which a \n     portion of a country's foreign debt is canceled in return for \n     certain environmental commitments or payments by that \n     country, provide a model for a possible debt-for-\n     nonproliferation exchange with the Russian Federation, which \n     could be designed to provide additional funding for \n     nonproliferation and arms reduction initiatives.\n       (11) Most of the Russian Federation's official bilateral \n     debt is held by United States allies that are advanced \n     industrial democracies. Since the issues described pose \n     threats to United States allies as well, United States \n     leadership that results in a larger contribution from United \n     States allies to cooperative threat reduction activities will \n     be needed.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--\n       (1) to recognize the vital interests of the United States, \n     its allies, and the Russian Federation in reducing the \n     threats to international security described in the findings \n     set forth in subsection (a);\n       (2) to facilitate the accomplishment of the United States \n     objectives described in the findings set forth in subsection \n     (a) by providing for the alleviation of a portion of the \n     Russian Federation's foreign debt, thus allowing the use of \n     additional resources for these purposes; and\n       (3) to ensure that resources freed from debt in the Russian \n     Federation are targeted to the accomplishment of the United \n     States objectives described in the findings set forth in \n     subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 313.

CONSULTATIONS WITH CONGRESS.\n\n       The President shall consult with the appropriate \n     congressional committees on a periodic basis to review the \n     operations of the Facility and the Russian Federation's \n     eligibility for benefits from the Facility.\n\n     SEC. 325.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) United States nonproliferation efforts in the \n     independent states of the former Soviet Union have achieved \n     important results in ensuring that weapons of mass \n     destruction, weapons-usable material and technology, and \n     weapons-related knowledge remain beyond the reach of \n     terrorists and weapons-proliferating states;\n       (2) although these efforts are in the United States \n     national security interest, the effectiveness of these \n     efforts suffers from a lack of coordination within and among \n     United States Government agencies;\n       (3) increased spending and investment by the United States \n     private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent \n     states of the former Soviet Union, specifically, spending and \n     investment by the United States private sector in job \n     creation initiatives and proposals for unemployed Russian \n     Federation weapons scientists and technicians, are making an \n     important contribution in ensuring that knowledge related to \n     weapons of mass destruction remains beyond the reach of \n     terrorists and weapons-proliferating states; and\n       (4) increased spending and investment by the United States \n     private sector on nonproliferation efforts in the independent \n     states of the former Soviet Union require the establishment \n     of a coordinating body to ensure that United States public \n     and private efforts are not in conflict, and to ensure that \n     public spending on efforts by the independent states of the \n     former Soviet Union is maximized to ensure efficiency and \n     further United States national security interests.\n\n     SEC. 333.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On April 24, 1997, the Senate provided its advice and \n     consent to ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention \n     subject to the condition that no sample collected in the \n     United States pursuant to the Convention would be transferred \n     for analysis to any laboratory outside the territory of the \n     United States.\n       (2) Congress enacted the same condition into law as section \n     304(f)(1) of the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation \n     Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6724(f)(1)).\n       (3) Part II, paragraph 57, of the Verification Annex of the \n     Convention requires that all samples taken during a challenge \n     inspection under the Convention shall be analyzed by at least \n     two laboratories that have been designated as capable of \n     conducting such testing by the OPCW.\n       (4) The only United States laboratory currently designated \n     by the OPCW is the United States Army Edgewood Forensic \n     Science Laboratory.\n       (5) In order to meet the requirements of condition (18) of \n     the resolution of ratification of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, and section 304 of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention Implementation Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6724), the \n     United States must possess, at a minimum, a second OPCW-\n     designated laboratory.\n       (6) The possession of a second laboratory is necessary in \n     view of the potential for a challenge inspection to be \n     initiated against the United States by a foreign nation.\n       (7) To qualify as a designated laboratory, a laboratory \n     must be certified under ISO Guide 25 or a higher standard, \n     and complete three proficiency tests. The laboratory must \n     have the full capability to handle substances listed on \n     Schedule 1 of the Annex on Schedules of Chemicals of the \n     Chemical Weapons Convention. In order to handle such \n     substances in the United States, a laboratory also must \n     operate under a bailment agreement with the United States \n     Army.\n       (8) Several existing United States commercial laboratories \n     have approved quality control systems, already possess \n     bailment agreements with the United States Army, and have the \n     capabilities necessary to obtain OPCW designation.\n       (9) In order to bolster the legitimacy of United States \n     analysis of samples taken on its national territory, it is \n     preferable that the second designated laboratory is not a \n     United States Government facility. Further, it is not cost-\n     effective to build and equip another Government laboratory to \n     meet OPCW designation standards when such capability already \n     exists in the private sector.\n       (b) Establishment of Second Designated Laboratory.--\n       (1) Directive.--Not later than February 1, 2002, the United \n     States National Authority, as designated under section 101 of \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1998 \n     (22 U.S.C. 6711), shall select, through competitive \n     procedures, a commercial laboratory within the United States \n     to pursue designation by the OPCW.\n       (2) Delegation.--The National Authority may delegate the \n     authority and administrative responsibility for carrying out \n     paragraph (1) to one or more of the heads of the agencies \n     described in section 101(b)(2) of the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention Implementation Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6711(b)(2)).\n       (3) Report.--Not later than March 1, 2002, the National \n     Authority shall submit to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress a report detailing a plan for securing OPCW \n     designation of a third United States laboratory by December \n     1, 2003.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Chemical weapons convention.--The term ``Chemical \n     Weapons Convention'' means the Convention on the Prohibition \n     of Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical \n     Weapons and on Their Destruction, Opened for Signature and \n     Signed by the United States at Paris on January 13, 1993, \n     including the following protocols and memorandum of \n     understanding:\n       (A) The Annex on Chemicals.\n       (B) The Annex on Implementation and Verification.\n       (C) The Annex on the Protection of Confidential \n     Information.\n       (D) The Resolution Establishing the Preparatory Commission \n     for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.\n       (E) The Text on the Establishment of a Preparatory \n     Commission.\n       (2) OPCW.--The term ``OPCW'' means the Organization for the \n     Prohibition of Chemical Weapons established under the \n     Convention.\n\n             TITLE VII--AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER NAVAL VESSELS\n\n     SEC. 701.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nconsideration of S. Res. 199 submitted earlier today by Senators Levin, \nDeWine, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n\n[[Page S48]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 199) honoring the life of Rex David \n     ``Dave'' Thomas and expressing the deepest condolences of the \n     Senate to his family on his death.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, today I join a large number of my \ncolleagues in the Senate in recognizing and mourning the loss of a \nselfless, dedicated American who was an unyielding advocate and \nactivist for the cause of adoption.\n  Rex David ``Dave'' Thomas was born on July 2, 1932, in Atlantic City, \nNJ, and was adopted soon afterward by Rex and Auleva Thomas, who lived \nin Kalamazoo, MI. Dave Thomas passed away on January 8 of this year at \nthe age of 69. The bipartisan resolution which the Senate is about to \nadopt, hopefully today, extends condolences to Dave's wife of 47 years, \nLorraine, and their 5 children: Pam, Ken, Molly, Wendy, and Lori, and \ntheir 16 grandchildren.\n  The Thomas family has much to be proud of and to cherish. Dave Thomas \nled a life of dynamic public and human service. He was a man of vision, \naction, and compassion, and for generations to come the fruits of his \nlabor will continue to improve the lives of the multitude of children \nwho seek a permanent home and loving family and the multitude of \nfamilies who wish to enrich their lives through adoption.\n  Dave Thomas was 12 years old when he got his first restaurant job as \na counterman. At 20, he successfully turned around four failing \nrestaurant franchises. He became a millionaire by the age of 35. In \n1969, Dave Thomas started the company for which he is most famous, \nWendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers. It was and is a success by any \nstandard. Dave Thomas was able, through sheer determination, \nunpretentious know-how, and love for the restaurant business, to rise \nto the top of his chosen field. Dave Thomas was exemplary in the degree \nto which he gave back. He became famous through his numerous television \ncommercials, which were so successful because they reflected his \nmagnetic and joyful personality. He used that fame to become one of the \nmost outspoken proponents of adoption in America.\n  In 1992, he established the Dave Thomas Foundation For Adoption, and \nhe donated his speaking fees and profits from the sale of his books to \nadoption causes. From 1990 through 2000, he headed up numerous White \nHouse adoption and foster care initiatives. His fingerprints are on the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, the purpose of which is to \ndecrease the number of children placed in foster care and to legally \nfree those who cannot be safely returned to their homes; the Adoption \nAwareness postage stamp, and the shaping of health policy for numerous \ncorporations to cover adoption benefits and expenses.\n  Though Dave Thomas was a successful businessman, as well as a \ngenerous philanthropist, he was first and foremost committed to \nactively improving the lives of children in foster care and helping to \nfacilitate their adoption. He did more than just use his irreproachable \nreputation to improve the lives of thousands of children; he personally \ndonated millions of dollars to the Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital at \nOhio State University, to Children's Hospital in Columbus, OH, and to \nthe Thomas Center at Duke University, which he founded. Through these \nand many more charitable contributions, Dave Thomas advanced the \nAmerican dream. He was a man who gave not out of a sense of obligation \nbut because he believed it was simply the right thing to do.\n  So, Madam President, David Thomas was a remarkable man, and his too-\nearly death will leave many people with one fewer friend. He was \ngreatly respected, much loved, and he will be deeply missed by all who \nknew him. The resolution, which I hope will be cleared for passage \ntoday, is a testament to the respect and the high esteem in which this \nbody holds Dave Thomas and his memory.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the names of the Senators, including our \nPresiding Officer, who join me in sponsoring this resolution be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Cosponsors of the Dave Thomas Resolution as of January 23, 2002\n\n       Senators Levin, DeWine, Landrieu, Stabenow, Craig, Clinton, \n     Helms, Voinovich, Rockefeller, Grassley, Baucus, Chafee, \n     Crapo, Inhofe, Feinstein, Hollings, Lugar, Hagel, Hutchison, \n     Allen, McCain, Johnson, Nickles, Burns, Sessions, and Durbin.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, today I pay tribute to the life of Dave \nThomas. The adoption community has suffered a huge loss through his \ndeath on January 8th, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Senate \nresolution honoring his life.\n  As a founding member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I \nhave had the opportunity to recognize people who have been exceptional \nadvocates for the adoption community, and Dave Thomas is at the top of \nthat list.\n  An adopted child himself, Dave Thomas made it his lifelong goal to \nfind every child a home. In 1990, Dave answered the call of President \nGeorge Bush, who asked him to be the spokesperson for his national \nadoption program called ``Adoption Works. . . . For Everyone.'' After 2 \nyears, Thomas decided he wanted to do more, and so he created his own \nnonprofit organization to make it easier and more affordable for people \nto adopt children. Thomas' efforts, backed by the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption, have streamlined the adoption process and \nreduced the financial barriers many families face when they adopt \nchildren, especially those with special needs.\n  The Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption provides a voice for 134,000 \nchildren across our country who are waiting to find a loving family. \nThe efforts of the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption and Wendy's have \npaid off. Forty percent of all callers into the National Foundation for \nAdoption's toll free number cite trayliners, public service \nannouncements and posters that they have seen inside Wendy's \nRestaurants as the reason for their call.\n  Dave was a tireless advocate for the adoption community, and \nthankfully his legacy will live on through the thousands of children \nwho have found a loving home because of his efforts. If everyone \nsubscribed to Dave's theory that no child is ``unadoptable,'' this \nworld would be a better place.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution and the preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.
