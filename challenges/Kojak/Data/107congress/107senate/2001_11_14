Thank You that the fabric of that freedom was woven by \nlodestar leaders like William Penn who in 1701 published a charter of \nprivileges ensuring that everyone would be given liberty to worship You \naccording to the dictates of his or her beliefs and conscience. We are \nmoved by the fact that the bell celebrating the jubilee founding of \nPennsylvania was cast in 1751 and became the Liberty Bell which rang \nduring the first reading of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. \nLast night, an exact replica cast by the same works in England was \ndedicated to be taken around the Nation and rung. The words cast into \nthis Spirit of Liberty Bell are the same as the original from Leviticus \n25:10. ``Proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the \ninhabitants.'' As this Spirit of Liberty Bell rings throughout the \nland, help us to rededicate ourselves to maintain religious freedom in \nour own lives. Forgive any prejudice in our hearts and purge from us \nany vestige of judgmentalism for people whose expression of faith in \nYou differs from our own. As we battle against terrorists and nations \nwho persecute people because of their religious beliefs, help us make \nAmerica a nation where we live by George Washington's motto: ``To \nbigotry, give no sanction . . . to persecution, no assistance.'' In \nYour liberating name. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/14/senate-section/article/S11737-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Jon S.

Mr. President, 5 months ago, America had a projected \nbudget surplus of $2.7 trillion over the next 10 years. The stock \nmarket was soaring. The question before us was one that most leaders \ncould only dream of: ``What should we do with our prosperity?''\n  At that time, the debate was focused on tax cuts--how much, for whom, \nand could we also provide for America's unmet needs? Regardless of \none's view about that debate or its outcome, there can be no doubt that \nthis is a very different moment.\n  Two months ago, more than 6,000 innocent men and women lost their \nlives to terrorism. In the weeks since, a wave of anthrax attacks has \ntaken lives, closed offices, and sown fear.\n  Our President, rightfully, has assembled an international coalition \nto fight those who attacked us, and those who aided them. We are at \nwar.\n  The Federal Government is helping those areas destroyed and damaged \nby the attacks to rebuild. We passed legislation to keep our airlines \nflying, and to give our law enforcement the tools needed to fight \nterror.\n  Our economy, which was already weakening before September 11, has \ncontinued to deteriorate.\n  The question facing America is no longer, ``What should we do with \nour prosperity?'' The question now is, ``How do we protect our \ncitizens, strengthen an ailing economy, and win this war against \nterrorism?''\n  I believe history will judge this Congress by how well we answer that \nquestion.\n  Shortly after September 11, I visited a call center in Rapid City, \nSD, that handles United Airlines' frequent flyer\n\n[[Page S11738]]\n\nprogram. The 235 people there were working hard--helping people get \ntickets and arranging travel in the chaotic days after September 11. It \nwas a tough job, on the phone hour after hour, helping scared, angry, \nand confused callers. All they could do was to ask people to be patient \nand to be understanding.\n  In the past couple of weeks, nearly 50 of those hard-working \nemployees have lost their jobs. Like most hard-working people in \nAmerica, these people don't expect or want the government to do \nanything for them that they can do for themselves. But now, due to no \nfault of their own--no lack of skill or ambition or work ethic--they \nare no longer working.\n  They are not alone. More than 7 million Americans are out of work. \nLast month, the unemployment rate took its largest jump in 21 years. \nFor too long, we have asked America's laid off workers to be patient \nand understanding. Too many Americans fear for their future. Because of \nwhat our nation has experienced in the last 2 months, they fear for \ntheir safety. We need an economic recovery plan that addresses both \nfears and offers real help.\n  Today, Democrats are offering a plan that will help bring back \nAmerica's economic prosperity and help workers who have lost their \njobs. It is a plan that strengthens our homeland defense in the \nprocess. This is, simply, the right plan for the right time.\n  In the weeks following the September 11 attacks, Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate asked the experts, including Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin: \nWhat are the most effective steps we can take to shore up our economy?\n  Here is what they told us: Put money into the hands of low- and \nmiddle-income workers; they are the ones who will spend it quickly. \nMake sure that workers who have lost their jobs receive unemployment \nbenefits. And cut taxes for businesses--but limit the tax cuts to those \nthat actually help create jobs.\n  They told us that any plan to stimulate the economy should help \npeople regain the sense of security they need to shop, travel, and \ninvest.\n  Finally, they said our plan must be affordable and temporary. After \nall, the baby boomers will start retiring in less than a decade, and we \nshould not be taking on major long-term spending or revenue obligations \nthat will make it even more difficult to meet our responsibilities to \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  Our plan heeds that simple but sound advice. It includes unemployment \ninsurance and health care for laid-off workers, tax cuts for \nindividuals and businesses, and investments in our homeland security. \nIt does all of these things in a way that is fiscally responsible and \nfundamentally fair. I would like to take a moment and outline the four \nkey components of our plan.\n  First, it provides unemployment insurance for laid-off workers.\n  Providing unemployment insurance to laid-off workers isn't just the \nright thing to do. It's the smart thing to do. It puts money into the \nhands of people who are most likely to spend it immediately. As Robert \nRubin has said, unemployment insurance is ``a near-perfect stimulus.''\n  But more than half of unemployed workers are not covered under the \ncurrent unemployment insurance system, even though they pay into it. \nMany of these are the part-time and temporary workers who often most \nneed the help.\n  And for those who are eligible for unemployment insurance, the \nbenefits often do not last long enough. Next year, an estimated 5 \nmillion Americans will use all 26 weeks of their benefits, and still be \nwithout a job.\n  Our plan extends unemployment benefits an additional 13 weeks in all \n50 States; it expands coverage to millions of workers who are not \ncovered under the current system.\n  During the first Bush Administration, when we were facing a \nrecession, Democrats and Republicans agreed to extend unemployment \ninsurance--four times. We were able to agree that extending \nunemployment benefits was the right approach to an economic slowdown \nthen, we should be able to agree that it is the right approach now.\n  Second, we provide health coverage for workers.\n  Democrats also believe that extending health coverage for laid-off \nworkers and their families should be part of any real economic recovery \npackage. The average cost of COBRA health coverage for a family is $588 \na month--half the monthly unemployment benefit.\n  That is simply too much money for families hit by a layoff. As a \nresult, only about 20 percent of dislocated workers who are eligible \nfor COBRA coverage actually purchase it. Too often, when a head of a \nhousehold is out of work, parents and children go without health \ninsurance.\n  That is wrong.\n  We propose paying up to 75 percent of the cost of COBRA coverage, \ngiving States the option to provide Medicaid coverage to those who \naren't eligible for COBRA, and providing a temporary increase in the \nMedicaid payment rate for States, so that States will not have to cut \nMedicaid or raise taxes in order to keep their budgets balanced.\n  Third, we provide tax cuts for families and for businesses that \ninvest and create jobs.\n  Most economists agree: to jump start the economy, individual tax cuts \nshould put money quickly into the hands of middle- and low-income \npeople--because they are the people who are mostly likely to spend it \nimmediately.\n  Our plan provides tax rebates for the 45 million low-income taxpayers \nwho pay Federal payroll taxes but got little or no rebate at all last \nsummer.\n  Our plan also includes new business new tax cuts to encourage job \ncreation and investment. In sum, these are tax cuts that will help Wall \nStreet and Main Street.\n  Fourth, we provide for strengthening homeland security.\n  We can pass tax cut after tax cut. In the end, no tax cut--even the \nright tax cuts--will stimulate the economy if people are afraid to \ntravel or go about their business.\n  If we are serious about repairing damage to America's economy--and \navoiding future terrorism-related financial disasters--we must \nstrengthen America's homeland security so people can feel safer getting \non a plane, going about their business, and living their lives.\n  That is why our plan includes $15 billion for homeland defense. It \nwill help protect Americans from threats such as the recent anthrax \nattacks that have so shaken our nation and our own offices, as well as \nother biological, chemical, and nuclear threats. It will strengthen our \ntransportation security and help protect our food and water supply.\n  All told, our plan costs $74 billion in the first year, and $84 \nbillion over 10 years. It is both effective and responsible, and we \nbelieve it is the right approach for America's economic recovery and \nfuture safety.\n  Regrettably, Republicans have chosen to take a different approach.\n  Many things, as I said, about America changed on Sept. 11. One thing \nthat seemed to change--for the better--is the way Washington works. \nDemocrats and Republicans in Congress have been working together, and \nCongress has been working well with White House.\n  This unprecedented level of consultation and bipartisanship is what \nhas, to date, allowed us to respond so quickly to the attacks and the \nongoing terrorist threat.\n  It was my hope that we would follow that same bipartisan approach on \nthe subject of economic stimulus as well. Indeed, that is how the \nprocess began. Early on, Chairman Baucus led a bipartisan series of \nmeetings with Senator Grassley, their House counterparts, outside \nexperts, and the Administration.\n  Unfortunately, Republican leaders in the House withdrew from that \neffort. Instead, they pushed through--on a party line vote--a bill that \nis not a recovery bill at all but merely another laundry list of tax \ncuts--just another page out of the Republican Party's pre-existing tax \ncut agenda.\n  Although they masquerade as stimulus plans, no serious observer \nbelieves that the Republican proposals are anything of the kind.\n  The centerpiece of the Senate Republican proposal is a plan to \naccelerate by 4 years the rate cuts in the $2 trillion tax cut enacted \nearlier this year.\n  Speeding up the rate cuts would cost $121 billion over 10 years. That \namounts to 69 percent of the total cost of their plan.\n  And what would Americans get for their $121 billion? Most would get \nvery little.\n\n[[Page S11739]]\n\n  But the top 1 percent of taxpayers--people making an average of $1.1 \nmillion a year--would get an additional $16,000 tax cut next year. They \nwould get additional tax cuts the year after that, and the year after \nthat, and the year after that.\n  In total, over the next 4 years, the Senate Republican plan would \ngive a $52,000 tax cut bonus to every millionaire in America--the very \npeople who are least likely to spend it and help the economy.\n  America needs a plan that will help the economy now, not years from \nnow. We need a plan that puts money in the hands of people who need it \nmost, not the people who need it least.\n  I have yet to understand how giving millionaires tens of thousands of \ndollars in additional tax breaks 3 and 4 years from now will stimulate \nthe economy today.\n  The second-largest part of the Senate Republican plan would spend $22 \nbillion to repeal the corporate alternative minimum tax, or AMT.\n  The corporate AMT was enacted as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 \nbecause certain corporations, using legions of tax lawyers, had become \nso clever at exploiting loopholes in the tax code that they were able \nto pay no taxes at all.\n  So Congress said to those corporations: regardless of how many \nloopholes you can exploit, you must pay at least a minimum tax.\n  Now Republicans want to do away with the minimum tax, forever. How \nwill returning to the days when certain profitable corporations paid no \ntaxes at all stimulate our economy now?\n  Small businesses create most of the new jobs in America, and most of \nthem are not incorporated. So they won't get a penny from repealing the \ncorporate AMT.\n  If this proposal does not seem fair or stimulative, that is because \nit is not.\n  What is perhaps even more troubling about the Republican approach is \nwhat it fails to address.\n  The Republican plan provides next to nothing for workers who have \nlost their jobs. And it provides nothing at all for homeland security.\n  When you read their plan for the first time, you assume it is missing \na page. Not a dime for bioterrorism preparedness? Not a nickel for food \nsafety or for security at our nuclear plants? Can this really be a plan \nto restore confidence and stimulate the economy?\n  Evidently, these items weren't omitted because of cost concerns. \nQuite the contrary. The Republican plan is more than twice the size of \nour plan. And the exploding price tag of the Senate Republican plan--\n$175 billion over 10 years--may not even account for its true cost.\n  It will not make America safer. It will not help the economy. In \nfact, it may do real economic harm by driving up long-term interest \nrates.\n  Now, if the Republican plan sounds familiar, that is because it is. \nIt is a collection of leftover tax breaks that our friends on the other \nside of the aisle weren't able to pass last spring.\n  Reading their plan, it's as though September 11 never happened. They \nhave re-labeled these tax breaks as, ``stimulus,'' but they are really \njust more of the same pre-September 11 tax cut agenda that we have \nheard our Republican colleagues talk about for months, if not years.\n  Tax cuts for wealthy Americans and profitable businesses do not solve \nevery problem--and they will not solve this one.\n  The Republican plan is not about getting the most stimulus per dollar \nspent. It is not about getting help to those who most need it. It is \nnot about strengthening our national security. It is about ideology.\n  It is about seizing on a moment of crisis in order to advance \nunrelated political goals. It is driven by a conservative Republican \northodoxy that is so rigid, and so myopic, that it cannot or will not \nsee what is obvious to every fair-minded observer: this is the wrong \nplan for America, especially at this moment in our history.\n  I will say one thing for this approach: it has managed to achieve a \ndegree of unanimity. It has been unanimously rejected by economists, \nGovernors, State legislators, editorial writers, and business leaders.\n  Two weeks ago, Senator Lott and I received a letter from the National \nGovernors' Association, signed by its Chairman, Governor John Engler, \nRepublican of Michigan, and its Vice-chairman, Governor Paul Patton, \nDemocrat of Kentucky. The NGA is a majority Republican group that \nrepresents all of America's governors--29 Republicans and 19 Democrats, \nand 2 Independents.\n  The Governors asked us, as we consider economic stimulus, to ``help \nprotect health and human services for vulnerable Americans, address \nemployment and training for dislocated workers, and stimulate the \nnational economy through targeted capital investment.''\n  Interestingly, they make no mention of huge new tax breaks for \nprofitable corporations. No mention of huge new tax breaks for the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  Republican leaders got this letter. Sadly, I don't think they got the \nmessage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Daschle and Senator Lott: The nation's \n     Governors appreciate the bipartisan efforts of Congress to \n     develop an economic stimulus package. On October 4, we sent \n     you a list of policy options to consider in developing your \n     final plan. We are updating our recommendations to reflect \n     the recently clarified size and focus of the options you are \n     considering. Our recommendations also reflect the further \n     deterioration of states' fiscal positions as detailed in the \n     ``economy.com'' report sent to your earlier this week.\n       With respect to our fiscal position, most states have made \n     a series of spending cuts. Many are now implementing a second \n     round and in some cases a third. A number of states now have \n     revenue shortfalls in excess of $1 billion and many are \n     scheduling special legislative sessions to address mounting \n     fiscal problems. The cumulative states' current revenue \n     shortfall is $10 billion and growing. Moreover, new and \n     unprecedented state responsibilities for homeland security \n     are exacerbating serious fiscal conditions.\n       The House economic stimulus bill, if enacted, would further \n     educe state revenues by at least $5 billion annually. This \n     revenue reduction would dramatically increase existing state \n     shortfalls and result in significant state budget cuts. These \n     cuts, in turn, would hamper the effectiveness of any federal \n     stimulus package. Similarly, absent any changes in the Health \n     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or new \n     federal funding for HIPAA implementation in state-\n     administered programs, states will have little choice but to \n     divert scarce funds to comply with this federal mandate. This \n     means that significantly less state funds will be available \n     of reduction, critical state services, capital investment, \n     infrastructure improvement, and additional efforts to respond \n     to bioterrorism and other threats to homeland security.\n       Specifically, the Governors offer the following \n     recommendations to Congress in the attached documents to help \n     protect health and human services of vulnerable Americans, \n     address employment and training for dislocated workers, and \n     stimulate the national economy through targeted capital \n     investment.\n       Congress has many difficult tasks to complete before \n     recessing for the year. As a bipartisan group of government \n     leaders, the Governors look forward to working with you.\n           Sincerely,\n     John Engler,\n                                                         Chairman.\n     Paul E. Patton,\n                                                    Vice Chairman.\n\n                  Protections for Vulnerable Americans\n\n       Temporary Increase in Medicaid FMAP for children and \n     Families.--Congress should temporarily increase the federal \n     medical assistance percentage (FMAP) in Medicaid by 10 \n     percent for acute care services for families and children. \n     The territories should receive comparable relief. This will \n     lessen the pressure on states and territories to cut Medicaid \n     health care benefits or reduce the number of people served.\n       Medicaid FMAP Hold Harmless Provision.--Congress should \n     provide a ``hold harmless'' provision for states that were \n     scheduled to have their Medicaid FMAP reduced for fiscal \n     2002. These reduced rates were based on outdated per capita \n     income data collected at a time when state and federal \n     economics were in much better health.\n       TANF Supplemental.--The Governors continue to urge Congress \n     to approve a one-year extension of supplemental grants under \n     the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program (TANF). \n     Without an extension of the TANF supplemental grants this \n     year, 17 states will face a substantial cut in funding for \n     programs that assist families in moving from welfare to work.\n\n[[Page S11740]]\n\n       Health Care for Dislocated Workers.--As Congress considers \n     proposals to assist dislocated workers in gaining access to \n     health insurance, Congress must recognize that states will \n     not have available funds for any new matching requirements or \n     options.\n\n             Employment and Training for Dislocated Workers\n\n       Expansion of Eligibility for Unemployment Benefits.--By \n     temporarily modifying existing Disaster Unemployment \n     Assistance (DUA) eligibility requirements, the DUA program \n     (already in operation or on ready standby in all states) \n     could be used only to provide Unemployment Insurance (UI) \n     equivalent benefits to individuals affected by declared \n     disasters, but also to those affected by resulting economic \n     contraction. These UI-equivalent benefits would be \n     particularly beneficial for those who do not qualify for UI \n     benefits due to insufficient duration of employment or level \n     of earnings.\n       Extension of Unemployment Benefits.--Congress also should \n     temporarily extend the duration of regular UI benefits \n     through 100 percent federal funding to ensure that unemployed \n     workers can secure employment prior to the termination of UI \n     benefits.\n       Acceleration of Reed Act Distributions.--Congress should \n     accelerate distribution to state accounts of excess funds (as \n     defined by the Reed Act) being held in the Federal \n     Unemployment Trust Fund. This could be achieved by retaining \n     the 0.25 percent ceiling on the Federal Unemployment Account. \n     The immediate transfer of an estimated $9.3 billion can be \n     used by states only for providing UI benefits, employment \n     services, and program administration.\n       Increase Funding for Dislocated Workers Employment and Job \n     Training Services.--Fiscal 2001 funds for this Workforce \n     Investment Act (WIA) programs were rescinded by $177.5 \n     million, while the President's proposed fiscal 2002 budget \n     requests a reduction of $207 million. Congress should restore \n     these funds.\n\n            Stimulate the Economy Through Capital Investment\n\n       State Match.--Temporarily reduce or eliminate state match \n     requirements for capital investment programs.\n       Federal Investment.--Increase federal funding for \n     infrastructure investment critical to homeland security.\n       Private Activity Volume Cap.--Lift the private activity \n     volume cap, which would accelerate housing and economic \n     development construction activities.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there is another important point that \nmust be made today. Five months ago, when we last considered a huge tax \ncut that mostly benefitted the wealthiest Americans, the money to pay \nfor it was to come from the non-Social Security surplus.\n  Today those surpluses are gone. So whatever is spent on this stimulus \npackage will, at least over the next 5 years, come mainly out of Social \nSecurity and Medicare funds. We may even return to deficit spending, if \nwe are not careful. That is why we must be even more prudent, and more \nvigilant, about what is included in this economic recovery package.\n  The Democratic plan has a one-year cost of $74 billion. Over 10 \nyears, its cost increases to $84 billion. As I said, the Republican \nplan costs $89 billion in 2002. Over 10 years, it explodes to $175 \nbillion--and it runs the risk of damaging our long-term economic \nhealth.\n  Their plan costs more but does less for our economy, less for laid \noff workers, and nothing for homeland security.\n  I hope every Senator will ask himself or herself a simple question: \nWould my constituents want their Social Security and Medicare money to \nbe spent on this proposal?\n  Democrats have tried to write our package with this concern in mind. \nWe think the American people want us to invest in bioterrorism \npreparedness, for example.\n  But would Americans want their Social Security payroll tax money \nspent on new tax cuts for the wealthy or on huge permanent new tax \nbreaks for profitable corporations? I don't think so.\n  In fact, it seems especially unjust when you consider that Americans \nat the lower end of the income scale pay payroll taxes on every dollar \nof their income. Meanwhile, wealthy Americans pay zero in Social \nSecurity payroll taxes on all income above $80,000.\n  In other words, the Republican plan would spend the hard-earned \nSocial Security payroll tax dollars of ordinary workers at the bottom \nand use them to pay for tax cuts for corporations and people at the \ntop.\n  We have been told that Senate Republicans will attempt to raise a \nbudget point of order against this bill.\n  Let me make clear what that means. A budget point of order is a \nprocedural technicality aimed at killing this bill by saying that what \nour nation is now facing is not an emergency.\n  A vote for this procedural motion is a vote to kill unemployment \ninsurance for laid off workers.\n  It is a vote to kill health care for struggling families.\n  It is a vote to kill tax cuts for businesses that create jobs and for \npeople who did not get a rebate in the last round.\n  It is a vote to kill funding to build our national pharmaceutical \nstockpile, security at our nuclear power plants, protections for our \nbridges, tunnels, and ports, and the safety of our food and water \nsupply.\n  This is a vote to kill all of these items by saying that this is not \nan emergency.\n  Thousands of people have lost their lives. Millions of people are out \nof work. We are at war abroad, and we are facing threats to our safety \nhere at home.\n  If that's not an emergency, I don't know what is.\n  There is still time for us to come together and pass an economic \nrecovery plan that will work for the nation.\n  In the days since September 11, we have seen more clearly than ever \nthat we are indeed one nation, indivisible.\n  The victims of those attacks were from all races and ethnicities, all \nsegments of society.\n  The heroes who came to their aid didn't ask, What's in it for me?\n  As we look to lift up the economy for all Americans, the most \nfortunate among us should not be asking what's in it for them.\n  Those workers I met in Rapid City aren't looking to us to solve all \nof their problems. They are just looking for a little help to get \nthrough one of the most difficult times of their lives.\n  It may be difficult for us to reach agreement, but for them--and for \nour nation--it is vitally important that we do so.\n  I strongly believe that with every challenge comes an opportunity, \nand right now we have an opportunity to help those who are hurting, \nlift our economy, and secure our Nation.\n  We will be judged on whether we seize it.\n  I hope and pray that we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/14/senate-section/article/S11740-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11740-S11741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I would like to amend that. I don't know \nwho else will come to speak. I would like to amend that to say I will \nbe recognized to follow the Senator from Kentucky, if no one else is \nhere.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I object.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what we have tried to do--as I explained to \nSenator Bunning this morning--is, until there is some reason not to do \nso, we would alternate back and forth. I would also think it would be \nappropriate that Senators speaking during morning business be limited \nto 10 minutes each.

Reserving the right to object, if the chairman would like \nto speak after the Senator from Kentucky, that would be fine.

I think maybe what we should do is extend the morning \nbusiness time until 11:45, with Senator Bunning having 15 minutes, \nSenator Baucus having 15 minutes, and Senator Gramm having 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I rise in support of a strong economic \nstimulus package to help create jobs and to kick-start our economy. \nRight now, I don't think there is a doubt in anyone's mind that we have \nfallen into a recession.\n  Consumer confidence is down. Layoffs are up. Economic activity has \nslowed dramatically. After years of economic good times, we are \nskidding into a sharp downturn.\n  Before the horrific terrorist attacks on September 11, our economy \nwas already teetering on the brink. But that day sent us over the edge. \nIn the third quarter, gross domestic product ended up actually \nshrinking by an estimated four-tenths of 1 percent. When the revised \nfigures come out, I am afraid that number will fall even further down, \nmaybe a full percentage point.\n  I think there is a chance that the fourth quarter could be worse and \nwe could see GDP contraction of minus 2 or 3 percentage points, plus \nunemployment rising from 5.4 percent--which it is now--to well over 6 \npercent. In other words we have hit the wall.\n  Now we have to ask: What is the best way to get America moving again. \nThat is the issue confronting the Senate. Do we try to cut taxes and \nprovide for efficient, long-term growth that will create jobs or do we \ngo for more Federal spending and a short-term approach, as the majority \nleader suggested?\n  To make things worse, September 11 compounded our problems. It made \nconsumers more nervous and investors more anxious. It pushed a number \nof vital industries--airlines and transportation, investment companies, \nand tourism--to the edge of the cliff, and some over the edge.\n  Congress has already acted quickly to help the airlines and to shore \nup parts of our economy that were badly wounded by September 11. Now we \nneed to figure out what we can do to set consumers' and investors' \nminds at ease and to help convince them that even though we are at war, \nit is time to get going with our lives and our business.\n  I believe that we must act quickly, but we must act correctly. The \nwrong economic package could make things worse.\n  The best way I know to create jobs is to provide incentives to \nbusiness to grow and to expand. And the best way I know to convince \nbusiness to get moving is taking in the language they understand: \ndollars and cents. The dollars and cents that every businessman and \nbusinesswoman in America knows best is taxes.\n  We need to cut taxes on business now, and not just nickel and dime \nstuff. We need real tax reductions that will have a broad impact across \nthe economy and send a signal to the entire business community that \nWashington understands their problems and is going to do everything \npossible to help.\n  It is not time to pick or choose with help for just a few industries. \nOur whole economy is hurting, and we need general relief across the \nboard.\n  I know that every time we have this debate the opponents of tax cuts, \nlike our majority leader, shake their fists and point their fingers and \ncry out that tax cuts only benefit the rich. After awhile, they start \nto sound like a broken record. What the opponents of tax cuts in an \neconomic jobs package need to understand is that these tax cuts are for \nbusinesses--and not corporate executives. No one seriously thinks and \ntalks about helping rich people and hurting poor people.\n  The question is how we can best act to spur business right now to \ncreate real, long-term, permanent jobs. We have all heard from our \npeople back home--the experts who are out there everyday trying to brow \ntheir businesses and to expand their companies--about the real, broad-\nbased tax cuts that can make a difference.\n  We need to cut corporate AMT taxes, the punitive tax goes out of its \nway to punish enterprising employers, particularly those who are losing \ntheir shirt in this economy. Companies need better expensing rules and \naccelerated depreciation schedules so they can write off costs faster \nand free up their capital for investment and more job creation. And we \nneed to slash capital gains taxes so that money can flow more quickly \nto businesses that are ready to invest and spend now.\n  I don't think anyone in this body really believes that by trying to \ncut business taxes and create jobs we are really helping rich people. \nThe American people don't buy those class warfare arguments, and they \nare a lot smarter than many in Congress give them credit. There is a \nworld of business between cutting taxes on rich individuals and cutting \ntaxes on business that create jobs and help families put food on their \ntable. There is nothing better than giving a job to somebody who really \nwants to work.\n  As our economy grew over the past decade, as middle-class Americans \ninvested in the market and watched their savings grow, more and more we \ncame to understand that what is good for business in America is good \nfor the American people and the American worker. In the past, when the \neconomy took a turn for the worse, Congress too often took the easy way \nout. Instead of pushing for tax reductions and promoting growth, we \nwent for the public checkbook and tried to buy our way out of recession \nwith more Government spending. But considering how quickly our budget \nsurplus is shrinking. It doesn't make any sense to write checks that \nthe Treasury might not be able to pay without going into debt once \nagain.\n  More than anything else, we must not return to the bad old days of \nFederal deficits and stagnant growth. It may feel good for Congress to \npass more spending as a gesture to show ``we care,'' but everyone knows \nthat in the long-run the Government doesn't create jobs--business \ndoes--and caring means we have a job for anyone who wants to work.\n  More spending might help for a little bit, but I worry that it would \njust be a band-aid approach when our economy needs serious, long-term \ntreatment. Extra spending on public works is sometimes necessary, but \nit is not a long-term solution to our economic problem. It is only a \ntemporary fix.\n  And no one has ever accused Government spending, and money for \nprojects funded through Government programs, of getting into the \neconomy faster than tax cuts that would right now put money into the \nhands of private entrepreneurs.\n  In short, Mr. President, the best way to get our economy back on \ntrack is to cut taxes.\n  Reducing taxes frees capital. It lets business react swiftly to \nmarket conditions and to make crucial decisions quickly. And it affects \nthe bottom line right now.\n  I do not think I am plowing any new ground here.\n  We have heard a lot of these arguments before. But I can't remember a \ntime when the debate was as important as it is now.\n  We are at war. Our economy needs help. It is time to act now and to \nact swiftly.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass an economic jobs bill now, one that \nreally\n\n[[Page S11742]]\n\ndoes what it's meant to do--create jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I understand that later in the day a point \nof order will be made against the bill under section 205 of the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2001. The essence \nof the point of order will be to challenge the emergency designation \ncontained in section 908 of the bill.\n  I am not sure whether that is the correct ruling. It is debatable. \nBut my expectation is the Parliamentarian will rule that the bill is \nsubject to the Budget Act for that reason.\n  My view, however, is that the point of order should be waived. Why? \nBecause the bill clearly responds to an emergency. Indeed, my good \nfriend from Kentucky just said: We are at war. He said: Let's get \nmoving now. Let's pass a good stimulus bill.\n  I don't want to put words in the mouth of my friend from Kentucky, \nbut certainly he believes--and the rest of the Members of this body \nbelieve--that there is a very great need for us to act extremely \nquickly. We also know that many people are in very difficult straits, \nnot to mention the huge tragedy of the thousands of people who were \nkilled in the trade towers which were destroyed, the Pentagon \ndestruction, the anthrax scares, other terrorism scares in the country. \nWe need to move quickly. If that is not an emergency, I am hard pressed \nto say what is. There may be other emergencies that are even greater. I \nwill not dispute that point. But this clearly is an emergency, too. \nThese are not ordinary times. We are in a different era. It is very \ndifficult.\n  Let me provide a bit of information. When legislation is considered \nin the Senate, there are very strict rules to enforce budgetary \ndiscipline, as there should be. The embodiment of these rules is the \nannual budget resolution which is debated every spring. We have updates \nand so forth, but essentially we have a long debate on the budget \nresolution. The debate allows the Congress to look at all of its \nneeds--taxes and spending--and construct a budget blueprint for the \ncoming year. It is a guess, an anticipation, an estimate of what we \nwill need for the coming year.\n  The budget resolution sets a floor for revenues and ceilings for \nspending. And there are points of order that can be made against any \nlegislation which reduces the revenues below the floor or increases \nspending above one of the ceilings.\n  These points of order can only be waived with 60 votes. That is how \nthe budget resolution is enforced. But, wisely, there is a safety \nvalve. We cannot with certainty predict the future. Thank goodness. If \nCongress and the President agree that there is an unforeseen emergency \nthat requires legislation that cuts taxes or raises spending, then \nthere is a safety valve for getting the legislation enacted.\n  The safety valve is simple. Congress must include language in the \nlegislation which designates that the legislation is being enacted to \ncope with an emergency. Then the points of order enforcing the revenue \nfloor and spending ceilings become inoperative.\n  That makes sense. In an emergency, for the good of the country, we \nmay need to respond in a way that was not contemplated when we wrote \nthe budget resolution. But there is one final hurdle to face. In the \nSenate, the language in the bill that designates the legislation as an \nemergency is itself subject to a point of order. If the point of order \nis raised and there are not 60 votes to waive it, then the language \ndesignating the legislation as an emergency is deleted from the bill.\n  This is very serious because without the emergency designation in the \nbill, the entire bill would be subject to a point of order that can \nonly be waived by 60 votes. In that case, the entire bill can be killed \nwith the votes of only 41 Senators. So it is important to keep the \nemergency designation in the legislation.\n  Having presented the background, let me explain how the budget \nprocess unfolded this year. The budget resolution for this year, fiscal \nyear 2002, was considered in the spring, many months ago. It was passed \nin early May. We voted on it in this body. At that time the economy was \nnot too strong, but it did not appear to be facing an emergency. The \neconomy had grown at a rate of 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter of the \nprevious year, calendar year 2000. It grew at a slower rate, 1.2 \npercent, in the first quarter of 2001. These are somewhat weak growth \nrates, but they are not terrible ones.\n  Manufacturing was hurting. May was the 10th consecutive month of job \nloss in manufacturing, but the national unemployment rate was still \nonly 4.2 percent. American consumers were not in a downturn. Retail \nsales had grown at a 5.2-percent rate in the first quarter of this year \nand were continuing to grow at the same rate, 5.2 percent, in the \nsecond quarter this year.\n  So the view at the time, at the time the budget resolution was \npassed, was that the economy needed a boost in fiscal year 2001, which \nended on October 1, but the economy should be doing nicely as we \nprogressed through the first two quarters of fiscal year 2002. It \nneeded a short-term boost. But most of us thought--the economists \nthought, most people who spend their lives thinking about these things \nthought--that in the first two quarters of next year, January through \nthe end of June, we would be doing a little better.\n  The budget resolution that we passed last May made room for an $85 \nbillion tax cut during the remainder of fiscal year 2001. This meant \nthere were no 60-vote points of order that could be raised against a \nbill containing an $85 billion tax cut in that fiscal year.\n  In contrast, the budget resolution made room for a smaller stimulus \nin fiscal year 2002 because there was an expectation that we would not \nneed as much. It allowed approximately $50 billion for tax cuts in \nfiscal year 2002 as part of the President's 10-year tax cut plan. That \nwas part of the deal, part of the understanding. That is what the \nexpectations were.\n  It allowed an additional stimulative tax cut of $15 billion in fiscal \nyear 2002, but the $65 billion total was smaller than the $85 billion \nallowed for fiscal year 2001 because it was judged that more than that \nwas not needed, and that was because no one expected the economy to be \nreally weak in fiscal year 2002.\n  That was then. This is now. Unfortunately, as we moved through the \nsummer into September, there was a surprise. The economy became much \nweaker than anyone had predicted. Manufacturing continued to lose jobs. \nBy the end of August, manufacturing had lost jobs for 13 consecutive \nmonths.\n  Real GDP growth was almost zero in the second calendar quarter of \nthis year. Many taxpayers were saving part or all of their tax rebates \nthat went out last summer rather than spending them. They are starting \nto tighten up, getting more nervous, fearful, not spending, and that \nclearly means a weaker economy.\n  The Federal Reserve was still cutting interest rates, but that seemed \nlike it might not be enough to turn the economy around. And then \ndisaster struck. It is not necessary to recount the horrors of \nSeptember 11, but it is important to talk about what the events of \nSeptember 11 did to the economy. Here are some of the main results:\n  Airline travel declined precipitously. Airlines laid off thousands of \nemployees post-September 11. Industries that depend on air travel--such \nas hotels and car rentals--also declined precipitously. They dropped \noff. Business confidence was shaken. Businesses cut back on investments \neven more than they had been doing. Consumer confidence began to drop \nprecipitously, threatening consumer spending, which had been one bright \nspot in the economy.\n  The results of all those blows to the economy became very clear when \nthe unemployment figures for October were released early this month. \nUnemployment jumped from 4.9 percent to 5.4 percent. That is the \nlargest jump in more than 20 years. Manufacturing fell to levels last \nseen in 1965.\n  Now, non-manufacturing also took a hit. The slowdown in non-\nmanufacturing industries was the most dramatic since the inception of a \nkey report by the National Association of Purchase Managers in 1997.\n  Agriculture producers are hurting too. Net farm business income was \nat the year low in 1999 and 2000. Unless Government assistance is \ncontinued, net farm income in 2001 is projected to\n\n[[Page S11743]]\n\nbe even lower. The most acute problems are faced by farmers whose \noperations have been hit by floods, drought, tornadoes, and other \nnatural disasters.\n  So that is why we are here today. Clearly, our economy is in an \nemergency situation. It needs emergency help. Both parties agree that \nwe need some combination of tax cuts and spending increases right now \nto try to invigorate the economy. This is an important point. We are \nelected to serve our people, to make judgments--the best judgments on \nthe best information that we have, given all the facts we can lay our \nhands on. We have to do it responsibly, with integrity, and we have to \ndo it with due consideration and thoughtfulness.\n  Remember, budget projections are merely estimates as to what the \nfuture will hold for us, even though we have virtually no idea of what, \nin fact, is going to be happening 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now. These \nbudget estimates, prepared by the CBO and OMB, swing dramatically over \nvery short periods of time--just little changes in projected inflation, \ngrowth, and unemployment have huge effects on the 10-year estimates. It \nis the best we can do given the information we have.\n  Given all of that, I urge my colleagues not to be too hung up on \ntechnicalities, on provisions that are in the Budget Act. They are very \ngood. Those provisions should be there, but we have to exercise our \njudgment as to whether those provisions should be enforced now or not.\n  The world is watching us to see what we do in this situation--those \nbusinesspeople in the markets overseas. If we do too little, they are \ngoing to say America is not standing up.\n  I think there is a fair expectation that our economy will continue to \nsink, or that it will not be picked up as much as it could. That is a \npoint made by all the people I have talked to--economists and CEOs \nacross the country--about what is the proper stimulus package. I urge \nus to exercise our independent judgment as the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, my time has about expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I came over this morning to urge \nbipartisanship on the stimulus package--something we have not had in \nthe Senate. I have to say that, while I have deep affection for the \nmajority leader, I was somewhat taken aback by the tone of his speech. \nI don't think we are going to benefit ourselves here today by getting \ninto a lengthy debate about the stimulus packages that are before us. I \nsimply wish to make the following points:\n  First of all, I do believe the American people have been proud of the \nfact that, since September 11, we have had a level of bipartisanship in \nCongress that we have not had in a very long time. I think it is a \nnatural thing. I think the American people should expect us to come \ntogether in a period of crisis, and I think they have a right to be \ndisappointed when we don't.\n  Most of the legislation we have done to this point has been \nbipartisan. We have had a few sticking points along the way. We are in \nconference today on airport security. The President would like to have \nthe flexibility to use Government employees where it makes sense, to \nset Federal standards and use private contractors where it makes sense. \nSome people have said if you are going to do it, you have to use 100-\npercent Government employees. They say Government employees are more \nreliable. Critics say that, with Government employees, you can't fire \nthem; you can't provide incentive pay; you can't reward excellence. It \nis a lengthy debate.\n  My own opinion is that when in doubt in a period of crisis, you ought \nto give the President the benefit of the doubt. I hope we will adopt \nthat bill and give him the flexibility to use Government employees \nwhere he thinks they will work best, and to use private contractors \nunder Federal standards where they would work best. It is easy to \nimpugn partisan motives to people in that debate, but I do not think it \nis very helpful.\n\n  I have to say the majority leader gave a lengthy discussion about the \ntax cuts for the rich in the House plan. It is a funny thing; I guess \nif you went all over the world today and listened to legislative bodies \ndebate, we would probably be the only great legislative body in the \nworld, and maybe the only body in the world, that is still engaged in \nclass conflict. It was rejected in the Soviet Union. It has been \nrejected in the Third World.\n  Our whole history is living proof that in America you give ordinary \npeople extraordinary opportunities and they do extraordinary things and \nthey get rich as a result of it, and is anybody any worse off because \nof it? I do not think so.\n  I have been blessed, as I am sure many of my colleagues have been \nblessed, to have many different jobs. I would guess if I went back to \nwhen I first got a job throwing a newspaper or working for Krogers or \nworking for Sam Houston Peanut Company, I may have had 30 jobs in my \nlife. But nobody poorer than I ever hired me, and I never felt hostile \nto people who had been successful, who had money, who were able to \ninvest it and create opportunities for people like me.\n  I do not understand this effort to try to breed hate based on \npeople's income. One of the reasons it is so utterly unfair is that it \nis not as if in America the only people who have income or wealth are \npeople who are born with it. In fact, everywhere, every day, in every \ncity and town in America, we see ordinary people who become \nextraordinarily successful. Why that ought to be a point of conflict I \ndo not understand.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about the elements of the Senate \nbill. Great sport has been made about provisions of turning chicken \nmanure into energy. I thought that was a bad idea when it was first \ndebated, and I still don't think it is a very good idea.\n  We are trying to pass a farm bill to pay farmers $5 billion of \nadditional money not to grow because of overproduction, and in the \nstimulus bill before us we are paying people $150 million not to \nconvert agricultural land to other uses. On the one hand, we pay them \nnot to produce, and then on the other hand, we pay them to keep land in \nproduction. None of that seems to make any sense to me.\n  Rather than getting into all the details, I will talk about what a \nstimulus package is, and I am not going to try to appeal to authority, \nI am going to try to appeal to logic.\n  When I was a boy studying economics, economists believed in a set of \nprinciples. They reached those conclusions based on the study of \nhistory and, by and large, economists would normally agree on certain \nthings. Today economists are like lawyers: You just hire one, and they \ngive you the opinion you want, and they give you the best justification \nthey can to do it, just as a good lawyer who is appointed by the court \nto defend a killer makes the best defense he can make for the guy \nbecause it is his job, even though he knows the man is guilty.\n  Today you can hire economists to say whatever you want them to say \nand make the most outrageous argument imaginable. You can find somebody \nwho will do it, either because they have a political agenda or because \nthey have their own economic agenda.\n  Let me talk about stimulus from the point of view of logic, and just \nsee if what I have to say makes any sense.\n  First of all, if you want to stimulate the economy and you have a \nrelatively small amount of money, you have options. We have sort of \ntalked about $75 billion or $80 billion here. One option would be just \nto put it in small bills and fly it over cities and dump it out. People \ncould find it and spend it. Is that a stimulus? In a sense, one could \nsay it is. People pick up these $20 bills, they take them and spend \nthem. The only problem is we took the $20 bills from taxpayers. Are we \nreally any better off as a result of having dropped the money out of \nairplanes? I think the plain truth is, no.\n\n  The same thing is true about giving tax cuts to people who did not \npay any taxes. Quite frankly, I know it is going to be in the final \npackage and the President signed on to it in a compromise--negotiating \nbefore the negotiations started in a good will gesture,\n\n[[Page S11744]]\n\nwhich is one of the reasons I love the President, even though I do not \nalways agree with what he is agreeing to.\n  In trying to get this moving, he agreed we were going to give tax \ncuts to people who did not pay any taxes. That is like dropping money \nout of airplanes. I do not think it stimulates the economy because we \ntook the money from taxpayers and are giving it to people who did not \npay taxes.\n  If we want to stimulate the economy, we have to find a way with the \n$75 billion to get people to spend not only it but other things. We get \nthat done by finding ways of spending the money that encourage other \npeople to spend their money. Unfortunately, the other people who are \nspending their money are people who have money and, hence, almost any \nstimulus package that is worth anything could be criticized that \nsomebody who is wealthy is going to be stimulated to invest their money \nand they at least think they are going to benefit.\n  The point is, America cannot be saved except at a profit. The fact \nthat somebody will make money based on a stimulus package is the end \nobjective.\n  There are two ways we can go about a stimulus package. If I could \nwrite the stimulus package, I would write it as follows: First, I would \nhave cut the capital gains tax rate. It does not cost us anything for 2 \nyears. Our experience with it, beginning at the end of the Second World \nWar, has been almost uniformly positive. I have argued for it \nincessantly. The President decided not to propose it because he saw it \nas polarizing.\n  I also believe that making the tax cut permanent would stimulate the \neconomy and bring stability to the economy. It is very destabilizing to \nhave a tax cut that is going to dramatically change and, in fact, go \naway in 9 years. All over America today, people who could be investing \nare taking $20,000 per child and locking it up in IRAs and in gifts to \ntheir children and grandchildren to try to avoid the death tax, even \nthough we claim we repealed it. It is coming back in 9 years. So people \nwho expect to live 9 years are using up their resources planning for \nit.\n  A decision was made that making the tax cut permanent would be too \nprovocative in a partisan sense, and so that was not enough.\n  Senator Grassley put together a good package given what we had \nalready agreed to take off the table. I want to make the point--and I \nmake it because Senator Byrd is here. Senator Byrd is going to propose \nsome infrastructure spending. It has a disadvantage and an advantage, \nbut it is one of the few proposals that is being made other than those \nthat are targeted in the sense of targeting investment, tax cuts.\n  There is no doubt about the fact that accelerated depreciation--\nallowing people to spend so if they buy new capital equipment to create \njobs or open a factory they can write off more of it quicker--there is \nno question about the fact that a little bit of money there produces a \nsubstantial economic response.\n  I think we should be doing more of that. When people ask what cutting \ntax rates and accelerating the tax cut has to do with incentives to \ninvest, do they not realize that 80 percent of the income tax paid by \nthe top 1 percent of taxpayers is paid by small businesses filing under \nsubchapter S as individuals? The top tax rate is really a small \nbusiness tax rate. When people are saying the average person in that \ntax bracket will earn $600,000 or $700,000 a year, that average person \nis really Joe Brown and Son hardware store in Texas or West Virginia \nsomewhere, and it is really their rate about which we are talking.\n  I see that as a very important incentive. I have to say when I look \nat the list of things we are doing, such as giving movie producers and \nrecording artists and authors tax breaks, I would much prefer lowering \nthe tax that affects investment or spending money on highways as \ncompared to that kind of expenditure.\n  Let me turn to the whole question of infrastructure, and then I want \nto sum up before I run out of time.\n  In fact, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 27 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The advantage of infrastructure is that by improving \ninfrastructure, private investment can be induced. We get the impact \nnot only of building a north/south interstate highway system in Texas, \nwhich is what we need--I do not know what they need in West Virginia, \nbut I know we are way behind on highway construction, despite the \nsuccess we have had recently in which the Senator has been a leader. \nBut we can get a multiplier effect by the private sector investing as \ninfrastructure is improved.\n  If we are going to use infrastructure as part of a stimulus package, \nwe have to find a way to speed it up because in the postwar period not \nmuch infrastructure spending ever really got going until the recession \nwas over.\n  I will sum up by saying what I think we need to do. First of all, I \nam going to make a point of order against the pending amendment, not \nthe underlying bill. The point of order is that the pending amendment \nviolates the budget rules. We decided in the 2001 budget that emergency \ndesignations for non-defense matters were being abused, and we \neliminated them; they violate the Budget Act. But they are being used \nin violation of the Budget Act, and therefore there is a 60-vote point \nof order.\n  Everyone knows the bill before us is not going to become law. So why \nnot make it clear that is the case, so we can end these partisan \ndebates that I know discourage people back home, and sit down around a \ntable and work up a compromise. Compromise means some people get some \nthings they want and other people get things they want.\n  It seems to me we agree on providing incentives for investment \nthrough expensing and through accelerated depreciation. It is in both \nbills. There has to be a compromise level. We differ greatly as to what \nwe really believe will stimulate the economy. The logical thing to do, \nit seems to me, is to take half of the funds and do it through \nstimulation by lowering marginal tax rates to encourage investment, \nwhich is what I believe works, and then taking the other half as the \nDemocrats want to use it and spend it, whether they spend it on \ninfrastructure or whether they spend it in terms of health benefits.\n  In terms of health benefits, it is one thing to help people with \nhealth insurance, but it is another thing to set up a bureaucracy that \nprobably would not even be in place until the recession was over. So in \nterms of spending money on health, I think there could be a compromise.\n  In terms of setting up this bureaucracy, I do not think the President \nwould agree with that and I do not think that could happen. We have to \nsit down and work out a compromise. I think the Nation wants us to do \nit. The sooner we can get on with it, the better off we will be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/14/senate-section/article/S11744-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I remove my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the reading of the \namendment is dispensed with.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I say to my good friend from West \nVirginia, I intend to speak for only 2 or 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator may take whatever time he wants.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered makes several \nchanges to the bill reported by the Finance Committee. It deletes the \nrural development provisions in sections 811 and 815 of the bill. These \nprovisions generated considerable controversy, with some Senators \nquestioning whether they provided economic stimulus. I support the \nprovisions, and I think they are very important to the rural economy, \nbut a similar set of provisions is being developed as part of a farm \nbill, and I think it is appropriate to defer to that debate at that \ntime.\n  I note that I have not deleted provisions providing agriculture \ndisaster assistance to farmers and ranchers because I think they are \ncritical provisions of the bill.\n  My amendment also incorporates three Medicaid provisions which were \nfiled in the committee but we did not have time to consider. One \nproposed amendment by Senator Bingaman temporarily increases the caps \nfor States with extremely low disproportionate share hospitals. That is \nthe so-called DSH cap.\n  The second proposed amendment by Senator Lincoln establishes a 6-\nmonth moratorium on changes to the Medicare upper payment limit rules.\n  The third proposed amendment by Senator Breaux revises and simplifies \nthe transitional medical assistance program.\n  I also have provisions relating to the taxation of life insurance \ncompanies. Senator Kerry proposed a committee amendment addressing \nsection 809 of the code to maintain balance. The amendment I am \noffering also addresses section 815.\n  There are also a few other corrections contained in the amendment. \nThat is essentially a brief explanation of the amendment I am offering.\n  At this point, we are on the bill. I might say neither side has \nenough votes to pass the bill. The Senator from Texas correctly said we \nmight as well get to negotiations and get to the heart of the matter \nbecause the current bill probably does not have the sufficient 60 votes \nto get it passed and enacted.\n  The same is true for the alternative bill proposed by the President \nand/or the minority party. There are not 60 votes for that either. So I \nagree very much with the main import of the point made by the Senator \nfrom Texas; namely, let us get on with it. Let us sit down. Let us \nstart negotiating.\n  We are doing the country a disservice by continuing a partisan, \nrhetorical harangue, one side against the other. It is something I do \nnot like. It is something I know most Senators do not like. I hope the \nleadership of both bodies, both the House and the Senate, on both sides \nof the aisle, find a way for us to put together negotiations where the \nleadership of the Finance Committee and of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, in conjunction with the White House, can sit down and put \ntogether a good, solid economic stimulus package quickly so Americans \nare served in the way they deserve to be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Many times my colleagues have seen me reach into my shirt pocket and \npull out the Constitution of the United States. The distinguished whip, \nthe majority whip, also carries a copy of that Constitution, as do \nseveral other Senators on both sides of the aisle. I have supplied them \nwith this shirt pocket copy. I will refer to it as the ``shirt pocket \ncopy.''\n  Alexander the Great put foremost, among all books, among all \nhistories and among all literature, ``The Iliad.'' Alexander the \nGreat's copy of ``The Iliad'' was referred to as the ``casket copy.'' \nHe slept with ``The Iliad'' under his pillow.\n  I do not sleep with the Constitution under my pillow, but I carry it \nnext to my heart, the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  Now, let's read for a moment the preamble of the Constitution. Those \nwho have shirt pocket copies, take out your Constitutions; and those of \nyou who don't happen to have a shirt pocket copy, take the Constitution \noff the desk or the shelf, if it is nearby.\n  The Preamble reads as follows:\n\n       WE THE PEOPLE of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union--\n\n  Now, the President of the United States has said he wants to set a \nnew tone in Washington: Do away with partisanship; do away with all the \nquibbling, the argumentation, as it were, to form a more perfect union. \nThat is the way I would interpret what he said.\n  I continue to read from the Preamble of the Constitution:\n\n       . . . establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, \n     provide for the common defence--\n\n  Let me read that again: ``provide for the common defence.'' It \ndoesn't say anything about defending ourselves in Afghanistan. It says \n``provide for the common defence.'' It means to provide for the defense \nof our homeland, as well. ``Provide for the common defence.'' \n``Common'' means common. It is everywhere. It is common to all. It \ndoesn't single out any particular person, place, territory, or city. It \nprovides for the common defence.\n  I continue to read:\n\n       . . . promote the general Welfare--\n\n  That doesn't say promote the welfare of the rich; it doesn't say \npromote the welfare of Sophia, WV, my little hometown which you can \nhardly see on a map. ``Provide for the common defence, promote the \ngeneral Welfare.'' The Preamble isn't talking about those people who \nare on welfare rolls. It says ``promote''--that means to push forward, \nto lift up, to advocate. To ``promote the general Welfare and secure \nthe Blessings of Liberty.''\n  Aha, that word liberty!--``and secure the Blessings of Liberty''--to \nwhom? ``. . . to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish \nthis CONSTITUTION for the United States of America.''\n  Who said this? It says ``do ordain and establish this CONSTITUTION. . \n. .''\n  In speaking of liberty to ourselves, who is doing the talking? Who is \ndoing the talking? Let me tell you who is doing the talking. I will \nstart with New Hampshire, Nicholas Gilman and John Langdon were the \nsignatories for New Hampshire.\n  Next we will take Massachusetts. Who were the signatories? Rufus King \nand Nathaniel Gorham.\n  Then what is the next State? Connecticut. William Samuel Johnson \nand--who is that fellow who signed all those great documents from \nConnecticut? Who was he? Roger Sherman, Connecticut.\n  What is the next State? New York. New York, Alexander Hamilton. Only \nhad one signator, the great State of New York.\n  And on down. Those were the men who signed this document. Immortal? \nThis Constitution will live as long as the Earth stands. Immortal \ndocument, this is, indeed. These are the 39 signers.\n  I have just read the preamble to the Constitution. I have done so \nbecause it adequately and perfectly fits as the preamble to what I am \ngoing to say and what I am going to advocate. I am going to talk about \nthe homeland defense piece of this measure before the Senate. Defense; \nhomeland defense. The preamble of the Constitution introduces the \npreamble, as it were, to that portion of the package which my staff and \nI, at the request of the distinguished majority leader, developed for \nthis amendment. ``Homeland defense,'' that is the title of this \namendment. ``Homeland'' defense. Not homeland infrastructure. Not \nhomeland pork. But ``homeland defense.''\n  Mr. President, hear me now! Fear has gripped the American people. It \nthreatens the U.S. economy. I don't call my portion of this package a \nstimulus\n\n[[Page S11746]]\n\npackage. I am not calling it a ``stimulus'' although it does help to \nstimulate the economy. Anything that puts confidence back into the \nhearts and minds and pocketbooks and bookkeeping ledgers of the \nAmerican people is a stimulus to the economy. But to those who thought \nthey would see Robert Byrd bring out a package with a lot of \ninfrastructure in it are sorely dismayed and disappointed. It ``ain't'' \nhere.\n  Infrastructure is needed in this country to be sure. If you want \nsomething that is true stimulus, put $1 billion into highways and you \nwill employ 43,000 people. Or put $1 billion into school construction \nand you will employ 24,000 people.\n  But I am not doing that. I was asked at first by the majority leader \nto develop some options that would help to stimulate the economy. So my \nstaff and I--I have excellent staff; they are not excelled by anybody \nanywhere in the world. That is what I think of them. My excellent staff \nand I were asked to prepare some options. We did that. We did a $10 \nbillion option, a $5 billion option, a $20 billion option, a $30 \nbillion option. So we have options all over the place. And in more than \none of them I had infrastructure, something that would provide jobs.\n\n  But then something happened. We know, because we have read chapter \nand verse of the recent history in which we saw the awesome, terrible, \nhorrific picture of two airplanes sailing into the Twin Towers in New \nYork City. We saw the showers of bricks and mortar falling upon people, \nupon firefighters, upon policemen, upon men and women and children. And \nthen there came anthrax, a weapon that has been spread among us.\n  I haven't been in my office in the Hart Building in weeks. The office \nis closed. My staff people are not in there. I haven't read the mail \nthat has been sent to my office in the Hart Building in weeks. There \nare other Senators here who can say the same, on both sides of the \naisle.\n  Fear has gripped the American people, and it threatens the U.S. \neconomy. You can see it. You can see it in the vacant streets of our \nmajor cities on the weekends. Walk the streets of Washington on the \nweekends. You can see it in the half-full airplanes taking off from our \nairports--half full. Some of them not half full. You can see it in the \nempty shopping malls less than 2 weeks before the start of the holiday \nshopping season--less than 2 weeks. Go to the shopping malls. Go to the \nnational parks.\n  Here is a headline: ``National Park Entrance Fees to be Waived.'' \nAha, you can go for free.\n\n       National Park entrance fees to be waived over Veterans Day \n     weekend to inspire national unity, hope, and healing.\n\n  So we see a repetition of the free passes, for example, that Metro \nissued here in the city, and in Northern Virginia, free passes that \nwere issued by Metro so that people would ride, hopefully, into \nWashington, DC, and shop, spend money to stimulate the economy. There \nwere the restaurants in Washington, DC, that offered a free glass of \nwine to the people who would come to those restaurants.\n  Now I have just read that the national park entrance fees were to be \nwaived over Veterans Day weekend, which has just passed--for what \nreason? To inspire national unity, national hope, and national healing.\n  You can see it on Wall Street. Just watch Lou Dobbs. Watch him on \ntelevision every day. You can see this fear spreading like oil, slowly, \nslowly--fear. You can see it on Wall Street. At one point, on Monday, \nNovember 12, the day after Armistice Day, Veterans Day, the Dow Jones \nIndustrial Average dropped 198 points following the news of a possible \nterrorist attack on American Airlines flight 587. We saw the drop in \nthe Dow Jones after the plane crashed in the streets of Queens, New \nYork. Wall Street was already trying to recover from the troubling \neconomic news of recent weeks. The Commerce Department reported on \nOctober 31 that the economy contracted by .4 percent between July and \nSeptember of this year, the first quarter of negative growth since \n1991--10 years.\n  The Labor Department reported on November 2 that the economy shed \n415,000 jobs in October, increasing the unemployment rate to 5.4 \npercent from 4.9 percent in September, the largest jump since 1980.\n  Wall Street has been able to shrug off negative economic news in \nrecent months, but traders seem less able to do so recently. The \nlingering anthrax scare has spread to victims beyond the news media and \nthe Federal Government. The Attorney General has issued vague yet \nsobering warnings to the American people about anticipated terrorist \nattacks. National Guard troops can be seen patrolling the Golden Gate \nBridge.\n  The American people, facing the fears of a new era, are looking to \ntheir elected leaders--you, Mr. President, the Presiding Officer and \nyou, Mr. President, at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue--and me and \nother Members of this body and members of other legislative bodies, \nlooking to their Government for reassurance. Parents want to hear that \ntheir children will be safe in their own neighborhoods. Families want \nassurances that it is safe to take that vacation they had planned \nearlier this year. The American people want assurances that they can \nopen letters free from worries about biological weapons. They are \nlooking to their elected leaders for security.\n  If a son asks his father for bread, will the father give the son a \nstone? If the son asks for a fish, will the father give him a serpent? \nIf the son asks for an egg, will the father give the son a scorpion? Go \nback to the Gospel of Luke. The people are asking for ``bread,'' in the \nform of Security. What do we, as elected representatives, give to our \npeople when they ask for bread? Do we give them a stone when they ask \nfor safety? What do we give them? A tax cut?\n  The people are looking to their elected leaders for security. What do \nwe give them?\n  Do we reject this package which I shall explain momentarily? Do we \nreject it when the people ask for security against anthrax, when they \nask for security against possible smallpox epidemics? What do we give \nthem? Do we give them a stone?\n  When the people ask that the loopholes be closed along the northern \nborder and the southern border, when they ask for security from \nterrorists who would come across those borders when they are not \npatrolled; when the people ask for security against terrorists who \nwould slink across the borders, do we give them a stone? Do we give \nthem a scorpion? Do we give them a serpent? Do we respond to their \ncries when they want safety? What do we give them?\n  We can start to alleviate the concerns of the American people right \nhere--today--by addressing those vulnerabilities the terrorists are \nseeking to exploit.\n  My staff and I have crafted a $15 billion package which would be a \nfirst step in giving back to the American people a small part of the \nsense of security that was blasted away on September 11.\n  A point of order will be made against the package that contains this \n``bread.'' Our people ask for bread. That is a good metaphor when one \nthinks of the security for which people are asking us.\n  A point of order will be made claiming that there is no emergency. \nThe point of order will be made based on the claim that this $15 \nbillion package is not an ``emergency.''\n  Hear me now! Keep in mind that a point of order is being lodged \nagainst this homeland defense measure. And, keep in mind the preamble \nof the Constitution of the United States--that phrase which says \n``provide for the common defense''.\n  The first bit of this graph that I point to is that section--that \npiece of the overall pie chart--which reads ``Bioterrorism Prevention \nand Response.'' See it? ``Bioterrorism Prevention and Response--Food \nSafety, $4 billion.''\n  Ask the one physician in this body, the one surgeon. Ask Dr. Frist, \nSenator Frist from Tennessee, if he thinks that we need $4 billion for \nbioterrorism prevention and response and food safety. Ask him. He is a \nrenowned physician. I know he is a politician, too. So was Jesus a \ngreat physician. He was a politician also. Ask Senator Frist if this is \n``pork.'' Ask him if it is ``pork'' to provide $4 billion for \nbioterrorism prevention and response and food safety.\n  We must reassure the American people whether their elected leaders \nare doing all they can to prepare against a\n\n[[Page S11747]]\n\nbiological or chemical attack. Anthrax, smallpox, and the plague are no \nlonger the stuff of fiction but are deadly realities.\n  My proposal includes $4 billion for bioterrorism prevention and \nresponse and food safety. This is money that would primarily be used \nfor upgrading State and local lab capacities--get this now--State and \nlocal health departments, for example, in Raleigh County in southern \nWest Virginia, and Sophia, WVA, my little town of 1,180 souls.\n  Ask the Governors of the States, Republicans and Democrats, whether \nthey need that money to upgrade State and local Lab capacities. Ask the \nmayors throughout the country if they need this. These funds would help \nlocal health departments to train emergency health responders in \nrecognizing the symptoms of an incidence of bioterrorism, and would \nenhance the ability to diagnose and to treat such illnesses as anthrax \nand smallpox.\n  My proposal will also allow State and local governments to plan for a \nvariety of emergencies and to upgrade State and local information \nsharing systems.\n  Preparation and prevention are critical to waging the war against \nterrorism that is currently being fought. Where? On our home soil. That \nis getting pretty close to home, isn't it, on our own soil. We would do \nwell to remember that it was a doctor in Florida who had just received \ntraining from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, who \nthought to test for anthrax when treating the first victims of that \nunusual disease. It is an unusual disease. But it is an old disease.\n  Read about it. Read about the 10 plagues of Egypt. Read about the \nmurrain on the cattle, and the boils on human beings. Go to a \ndictionary and look up the word ``murrain.'' It means, for example, \nanthrax among the cattle, the camels, and other livestock. Look at how \nold it is. It has been around a long time--thousands of years.\n  Here is a headline in today's paper. I will read it.\n\n       State Department Fears--\n\n  There is that word ``fear'' again\n\n       State Department Fears Another Anthrax-Tainted Letter.\n\n  What does this say?\n  Well, Cassius was nearsighted. I am not nearsighted, but I do need \nglasses to read. So here we go. I quote from this. The title of the \narticle in today's paper of Wednesday, November 14, 2001, is: ``State \nDepartment fears another anthrax-tainted letter.'' I will just read a \nfew excerpts from this news story in the Washington Times.\n\n       The State Department said yesterday it is searching \n     worldwide for another anthrax-tainted letter.\n  At least one letter like the one sent to Senate Majority Leader Tom \nDaschle is packed in with State Department mail that was halted last \nmonth, said the department's top spokesman, Richard Boucher.\n  Meanwhile, the last of the Washington-area survivors of inhalation \nanthrax left the hospital yesterday after a 25-day stay.\n       The high concentration of spores on a single sorter \n     indicates ``that there is a letter like the one sent to Sen. \n     Daschle that has moved through our mail system,'' Mr. Boucher \n     said. ``We are now proceeding to go look at all the mail that \n     we have held up, frozen, sealed off, in mailrooms in this \n     building, annexes and around the world.''\n\n  There it is. So these funds--$4 billion--would also be used to expand \nthe Federal pharmaceutical stockpile by contracting for the development \nof 300 million doses of smallpox vaccine to be delivered by the end of \n2002 to prepare for a potential outbreak of that dreaded disease.\n  No American has been vaccinated for smallpox since 1972, and the \nmedical community is debating whether those who were vaccinated may \nstill possess any degree of immunity.\n  Now, I was one of those children in the public schools of West \nVirginia many decades ago who were vaccinated for smallpox. That is \nwhere I received my vaccination. The scar is still there on my left \narm.\n  Let's see what this headline says in the Washington Post of \nWednesday, November 7, 2001. Here it is: ``HHS''--that is Health and \nHuman Services--``Set to Order Smallpox Vaccine for All Americans.'' \nAnd it ain't free. It is not free. Let me just read excerpts from this \nstory:\n\n       Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said \n     yesterday that he expects to sign a contract this weekend to \n     purchase enough smallpox vaccine for every American but that \n     he has warned the White House--\n\n  Hear him. Hear Tommy Thompson down there at the White House. Hear \nhim.\n\n       . . .he has warned the White House the cost could be \n     quadruple the $509 million he originally estimated--or \n     equivalent to the department's entire $1.9 billion \n     bioterrorism budget. . . .\n       The previously announced administration effort to vaccinate \n     all Americans against smallpox, a deadly disease that was \n     eradicated in the 1970s, took on a renewed sense of urgency \n     as one of the leading smallpox authorities warned it was \n     conceivable that former Soviet scientists were helping to \n     ``weaponize'' the smallpox virus for nations such as Iran, \n     Iraq, Libya, and North Korea.\n\n  These are referred to as ``rogue states.''\n\n       ``Many [Russian] scientists are really quite desperate for \n     money''--\n  Cicero said: ``There is no fortress that money cannot buy.''\n  And here we read a warning by Donald A. Henderson, director of the \nnew Office of Public Health Preparedness.\n\n       U.S. intelligence indicates that several have been \n     recruited by ``rogue states'' and were in a position to \n     smuggle out a vial of the virus . . . .'' That's a very great \n     worry.''\n\n  He said: ``Many [Russian] scientists are really quite desperate for \nmoney.''\n\n       In addition, Henderson said, there is evidence that the \n     former Soviet Union succeeded in weaponizing the virus and \n     manufacturing up to 100 tons annually at a plant outside \n     Moscow.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have both of these \nnewspaper articles printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BYRD. If anthrax can make the public jittery--and we have seen \nthat it can and has made the public jittery--the prospect of smallpox, \na contagious and vicious disease, could incite panic--panic! Funds in \nthis bill, in my amendment, will be used to upgrade lab security at the \nNational Institutes of Health and at the CDC, and to improve security \nat the U.S. Department of Agriculture labs, by hiring additional \ninspectors for import inspections, food supply monitoring, and lab \nequipment. There you are.\n  Now, the next section of the chart I wish to point out is the section \ndenominated ``Federal, State, and Local Antiterrorism Law Enforcement, \n$3 billion.''\n  Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials have been working \naround the clock since September 11. When it comes to law enforcement \nand homeland defense--remember what the preamble said, ``provide for \nthe common defense''--this is where the rubber meets the road.\n  My package includes $3 billion for Federal, State, and local \nantiterrorism law enforcement.\n  Of that $3 billion, this package includes $1 billion for Federal law \nenforcement antiterrorism investments. This money would be used to \nimprove communications among Federal agencies, for the Coast Guard to \nincrease surveillance and improve communications with the Defense \nDepartment and other civilian terrorist/disaster response agencies, for \nthe FAA to increase the number of safety inspectors and research on new \nsafety technologies, and for the Drug Enforcement Agency, the U.S. \nAttorneys, the Judiciary, and the U.S. Marshals Service to improve \nsecurity in courtrooms, for example, camera, x-ray machines and mylar \non windows, and provide better facilities for police.\n  The remaining $2 billion would be allocated for State and local law \nenforcement--again, State and local. Senators talk with your local \nmayors. Talk with your mayors in your home States. Talk with the police \ndepartments. See what they have to say.\n  The remaining $2 billion would be allocated for State and local \nantiterrorism investments to improve the capacity of State and local \npolice departments across the Nation to prevent and respond to \nterrorist attacks.\n  Municipal officials need billions of dollars--call them on the phone; \nhear what they say--municipal officials need billions of dollars for \ntheir cities' hazardous materials response teams to fully equip their \nsearch and rescue\n\n[[Page S11748]]\n\nteams and to outfit the law enforcement officials who likely will be \nfirst at the scene of a chemical or biological attack.\n  Remember the day before yesterday? Who were the first people to go \nout to the scene of the plane crash? That wasn't a chemical or \nbiological attack, but it was a sudden and terrible emergency. Who were \nthe first? The policemen, the firemen, the paramedics.\n  Here is a letter addressed to me by the National Governors \nAssociation, addressed to me and my counterpart on the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Ted Stevens. In writing to us about an economic \nstimulus package, this letter from the National Governors Association \nsays:\n\n       Our recommendations also reflect the further deterioration \n     of states' fiscal positions as detailed in the \n     ``economy.com'' report sent to you earlier this week. With \n     respect to our fiscal position,--\n\n  This is the National Governors Association talking now--\n\n     most states have made a series of spending cuts. Many are now \n     implementing a second round, and in some cases a third. A \n     number of states now have revenue shortfalls in excess of $1 \n     billion and many are scheduling special legislative sessions \n     to address mounting fiscal problems.\n\n  And a Senator will soon make a point of order against this to say it \nis not an emergency, that this situation that prevails over this \ncountry and about which the National Governors Association is writing \nis not an emergency. Tell that to the National Governors Association!\n  I read further from the letter:\n\n       The cumulative states' current revenue shortfall is $10 \n     billion and growing. Moreover, new and unprecedented state \n     responsibilities for homeland security are exacerbating \n     serious fiscal conditions.\n\n  Let me read that sentence again for those who would say that this is \nnot an emergency. Here is what the Governors say: New and \nunprecedented--what is an emergency? Something that is new, \nunanticipated?\n\n       Moreover, new and unprecedented state responsibilities for \n     homeland security are exacerbating serious fiscal conditions.\n\n  Tell the Governors, tell the mayors, tell the chiefs of police of the \ndepartments throughout the land that this is not an emergency that we \nare dealing with and that a point of order should lie against this \namendment because it is not an emergency?\n  Mr. REID. May I ask the Senator a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator from West Virginia is a parliamentary \nexpert on what goes on in the Senate. Did I hear the Senator right; he \nhas heard, as I have, that they are going to raise a point of order \nthat the homeland defense part of the bill is not an emergency?\n  Mr. BYRD. Not an emergency.\n  Mr. REID. Am I hearing the Senator right, that there is going to be a \npoint of order raised that that which he has laid out dealing with our \nsecurity is not an emergency?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, that is exactly what they are going to say.\n  I say to all Senators, a point of order is going to be made against \nthis package because those who offer the point of order say it is not \nan emergency and, therefore, it should be stricken from the bill. Not \nan emergency? Let them tell that to the Governors of the country.\n\n  I continue to read the letter from the National Governors \nAssociation:\n\n       Similarly, absent any changes in the Health Insurance \n     Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or new federal \n     funding for HIPAA implementation in state-administered \n     programs, states will have little choice but to divert scarce \n     funds to comply with this federal mandate. This means that \n     significantly less state funds will be available for \n     education, critical state services, capital investment, \n     infrastructure improvement, and additional efforts to respond \n     to bioterrorism and other threats to homeland security.\n\n  Luke said, if the son asks his father for bread, will the father give \nhim a stone? Here are the cities of this land asking their elected \nofficials for ``bread'' as it were. Those who make the point of order \nwill say: Give them a stone. Let them eat stones. Let them have a stone \nfor security. Let them have a stone to protect them against a smallpox \nepidemic; give them a stone!\n  I hope that Senators, when they vote on this point of order, will \nunderstand that the people back home are going to remember all of us, \nhow we vote when the people, when the mayors, when the Governors, when \nthe law enforcement officers of this country ask for ``bread,'' when \nthey ask for security, when they ask for money to provide security to \nthose little towns and hamlets and cities all across this land, I hope \nthat those who vote for this iniquitous point of order, will be \nremembered by the people of this country come the next election.\n  Let's talk now about the FEMA firefighters program. This package \ncontains $600 million in grants to State and local communities to \nexpand and improve firefighting programs through FEMA firefighting \ngrants. Over 50 percent of that funding goes to volunteer fire \ndepartments in rural communities in the countryside, and the volunteer \nfire department is the first and only entity available to deal with the \ncrisis.\n  Last year Congress took action to begin to address this serious \ndeficiency by creating a Federal program to provide direct assistance \nto fire departments. Administered by the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, FEMA, the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program received an \ninitial appropriation of $100 million. This funding was quickly \ndepleted by tremendous demand. The Agency received more than 31,000 \napplications, totaling nearly $3 billion in requested funds, almost 30 \ntimes the amount appropriated.\n  To those who would say that this package is wasteful spending, to \nthose who would say it is porkbarrel spending, I say that one-half, a \nfull 50 percent, would be allocated for bioterrorism prevention and \nantiterrorism law enforcement; Federal, State, and local antiterrorism \nlaw enforcement, $3 billion.\n  Now as to transportation vulnerabilities, much has been done in the \nweeks following the September 11 attacks to improve our transportation \nsecurity. I am not talking about building highways at the moment--to \nanyone whose skin might quiver at my use of the word \n``transportation.'' This is transportation security. But each step we \nhave taken to plug the holes in our transportation security has \nrevealed another hole that must be filled. This package includes $2.2 \nbillion to address simultaneously these vulnerabilities. Municipal \nofficials need funds to protect their mass transit system. Of that $2.2 \nbillion, this package provides $1.2 billion for enhanced surveillance \nof transit stations and improved emergency response systems.\n  Amtrak requires funding to address the critical safety \nvulnerabilities of its facilities, including tunnels. Have you ever \ngone through a tunnel on a train? Go to West Virginia. You will travel \nthrough several tunnels on Amtrak. But this money that we are talking \nabout includes tunnels in and around New York City. It must improve its \nstation surveillance. Out of that $2.2 billion, this package provides \n$760 million for that purpose. The purpose is this: Amtrak requires \nfunding to address the critical safety vulnerabilities of its \nfacilities, including tunnels in and around New York.\n  Another $150 million would be used to improve the security at our \nNation's ports, ferries, and freight rail. This is a recommendation by \nSenator Fritz Hollings. I have been surprised to find that only 2 \npercent of the cargo that comes by sea to our Nation's ports is \ninspected and only one-third of the cargo that crosses over the \nboundaries by truck is inspected. This package finds moneys for \naddressing these border and these port security needs.\n  Airport security. Airports have to respond to the substantial costs \nof the FAA's new, rigorous security directives issued since September \n11. Airports need funds to increase the visibility of law enforcement \npersonnel for deterring, identifying, and responding to potential \nsecurity threats. Additional staff is needed to conduct security and \nemployee identification checks throughout airports. Airports with \ntighter budgets, particularly smaller airports in rural areas, are \nunable to absorb these new costs. This package provides $1.2 billion to \nhire law enforcement personnel to improve protection of secure areas at \nairports.\n  We have read recently a great deal about postal security. The \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, just a few days \nago--last week, as a matter of fact--as chairman of the Treasury Postal \nappropriations\n\n[[Page S11749]]\n\nsubcommittee, conducted hearings and had the Postal Service people up \nbefore the subcommittee to testify. It was a great hearing. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota rendered a tremendous service to the American people \nin holding this hearing.\n  Today, the American public and Postal Service employees find \nthemselves the victims of terrorism by mail. The people are afraid to \nopen letters. I used to reach into the mailbox when I was hardly tall \nenough to reach it; I would reach into the mailbox with glee and pull \nout a letter. I remember the first letter that was written to me when I \nwas elected to the House. After I was sworn in as a Member of the House \nof Representatives in 1953, the first letter that was written to me--\nand I would have been 35 years old, so that was quite a long time \nback--came from my two daughters, and it carried on it three 1-cent \nstamps. We didn't have any fear of anthrax in those days. We used to \nopen the mail with our hearts beating in our chests, with thankfulness, \nwith expectation--but not expectation concerning a death-dealing \nletter.\n\n  People today are afraid to open letters from distant kin. Suddenly \npostal workers are confronting attacks from something much more \nfrightening than the vicious dogs that have long haunted the mail \nroutes. A letter from an unknown source today is reason to call 911. \nAmerica cannot function like this. America cannot go on functioning \nlike this. Remember that phrase in the preamble of the Constitution \nabout the ``general welfare''? America should not have to function like \nthis. This package contains $1.1 billion for this.\n  How much did the administration request? The Administration requested \n$175 million. That is a drop in the bucket. This package contains $1.1 \nbillion to begin to make the security changes necessary to keep the \nmail moving and allow the Postal Service to respond to this and future \nterrorist attacks.\n  Now, about the security of our borders, to which I alluded a little \nwhile ago, for border security there is allotted $1.1 billion. Our \nborder security is dangerously underfunded. We want America to remain \nalways the land of the free, but we want it also to be protected. Our \nborders must be secure. Our borders leak like a sieve. Try holding \nwater in a sieve. Our borders leak like a sieve, and the leaking should \ncause us severe alarm.\n  The Immigration and Naturalization Service conducts some 500 million \ninspections at our ports of entry each year--500 million inspections. \nHundreds of millions of visitors enter the country without visas \nthrough the visa waiver program, or other legal exemptions. Yet how \nmany inspectors are there to process these hundreds of millions of \nvisitors? There are only 4,775 INS inspectors. Yes, you heard me. There \nare only 4,775 INS inspectors to process these hundreds of millions of \nvisitors. That is 1 inspector--just 1--for every 104,712 foreign \nnationals who cross our borders.\n  Just to make it easy, call it 100,000, rounding it. So you have one \ninspector--just one--for every 100,000 foreign nationals who cross our \nborders. And, some Senators would make a point of order against this \npackage to say that it is not an emergency? When our borders leak like \na sieve, they say that this is not an emergency?\n  The U.S. Customs Service currently has the resources to inspect only \n2 percent of the cargo arriving by sea. It inspects only about one-\nthird of the truck cargo crossing the southern border. Almost nothing \nis more urgent than to quickly move to close these hideous gaps in our \nability to monitor the goods and people who move across our borders.\n  This package provides $1.1 billion for additional Border Patrol \nagents and screening facilities, primarily on the northern border, and \nto fully implement database improvement projects.\n  It is not enough that we authorize these additional expenditures in \nthe antiterrorism bill. It is an empty promise if we fail to provide \nthe resources to back up that authorization. We must provide the funds, \nand we must do so quickly.\n  The next item on my chart is designated as Federal computer \nmodernization, $1 billion. There are more than 40 Federal agencies and \ntens of thousands of Federal workers who are working together to fight \nterrorism, but many of these agencies cannot pass along to each other \ninformation on suspected terrorists. They cannot pass that information \nalong. Their computer systems simply do not work together. Their \ncomputer systems do not talk to one another.\n  This package provides $1 billion for Federal computer system \nimprovements so that Federal agencies that participate in our \ncounterterrorism program can communicate with each other and provide \nmore comprehensive information about threats and those who would carry \nthem out. And, there are those who would say a point of order will lie \nagainst this because we do not have an emergency! Computer \ncompatibility is critical to our ability to rapidly assess threats and \nto respond to them throughout the Nation.\n  How about those nuclear powerplants? How about those electric power \nprojects? How about those national landmarks such as the Washington \nMonument, the Lincoln Memorial, the Statue of Liberty that beckons to \npeoples from across the sea? We need only to look across the Potomac to \ncomprehend the threat to our Federal facilities and national landmarks \nin this war on terror.\n  I will never forget that day standing in my Capitol office. I was one \nof those slow movers. I will not be slow the next time. The next time \nthose police tell me to get out of this building, I am going, and I \nwill get out of there ahead of the police.\n  But that day I was slow moving. ``Why should I go, I said?'' ``I will \nnot be any safer out there than I am in here,'' so I was slow to move. \nI looked out the window on the morning of September 11 and watched the \nsmoke rise from the direction of the Pentagon. Any Federal building or \nnational landmark in this country could be the next target. This \nCapitol could be the next target.\n  In October, the CIA received a warning from an intelligence service \nin Western Europe about the possibility of a terrorist attack on the \nThree Mile Island nuclear facility in Pennsylvania. While the threat \nlater proved not to be credible, it underscored the breadth of the \ndanger to our homeland--to our homeland, America the beautiful.\n  The State police and the National Guard have stepped up patrols of \nthese plants, and the Coast Guard is enforcing new rules barring boats \nfrom the waters near any nuclear plant. Likewise, utilities around the \ncountry have stepped up security at their plants since the September 11 \nterrorist attacks, but utility officials admit that the Nation's power \ngrid is just too large to be fully protected from wanton attacks.\n  My proposal includes $900 million to increase security at Federal \nfacilities throughout the country, at nuclear plants, at our national \ntreasures, such as the Washington Monument. Some of that funding would \nbe directed toward enhancing security at State Department facilities. \nThese security precautions are essential. These are investments that \nwill have to be made in the future if we are to cope with the \ncontinuing threat of terrorism.\n  Mr. President, over 6 weeks ago, on October 2, an agreement was \nreached with the administration so that the Congress could act \nexpeditiously on the fiscal year 2002 appropriations bill. That \nagreement to limit spending in the 13 appropriations bills to $686 \nbillion is being fully implemented.\n  The Senate has passed this fiscal year appropriations bills on a \nbipartisan basis by an average vote of 91 to 7. That is bipartisan, is \nit not, an average vote of 91 for and 7 against on all of the \nappropriations bills that have thus been passed? We lack only one of \nthe 13 bills, one that has not been passed by the Senate.\n  We have lived up to our agreement. The Senate has lived up to its \nagreement. Republicans and Democrats on both sides of the aisle have \nlived up to this agreement. However, there was no agreement to limit \nour response to the September 11 attacks in the $40 billion \nappropriations supplemental passed on September 14. Who could have \nforeseen those two planes plowing head on into the brick and mortar, \nthe cement, the steel of those Twin Towers? Is this an emergency? Who \ncould have foreseen that? Who could have foreseen how the world would \nchange? Who could have foreseen the emergency responses that would be \nrequired?\n\n[[Page S11750]]\n\n  In the weeks since, the reality of our post-September 11 world has \ntaken hold, has seized the American psyche. We are now faced with \nsecurity threats that were not foreseen last month, that were not \nforeseen the month before last, that were not foreseen and still seem \nunimaginable, the stuff of nightmares. Anthrax appeared like a vampire \nin the night, sapping us of our customary optimism. The threat of \nsmallpox may face us for the first time in more than 20 years.\n  Since October 2, the Attorney General has issued another warning \nabout an eminent terrorist attack.\n  That is since October 2. That is since the letter referring to the \nagreement concerning the top line of $686 billion. We have received \ninformation about a possible terrorist attack on the Three Mile Island \nnuclear facility in Pennsylvania since October 2, that letter of \nagreement among the executive and legislative branches that the top \nline would be $686 billion.\n  The National Guard troops have been dispatched to protect the Golden \nGate Bridge since October 2.\n  The President has given the American people a pep talk. God bless \nhim. He is a nice fellow. I like him. The President has given the \nAmerican people a pep talk telling them they are now living in a \ndifferent world and urging them to answer a call to war in our own \nland.\n  And yet, there are those who would say this is not an emergency? Yet, \nwe have war, not just in Afghanistan but also in our own land. Tell \nthat to the farmer sitting by that cold stove on the plains. Tell that \nto the coal miner as he emerges from the dark bowels of the earth after \na hard day's work. Tell that to the mother who has children she takes \nto school in her own automobile. Tell all of these that there is no \nemergency. Tell them that there is no war going on.\n  A few days ago, President Bush asked the House and Senate leadership \nand the Appropriations Committee chairmen and ranking members to come \nto the White House; let us reason together. He wanted us to come to the \nWhite House to discuss the completion of the appropriations bills. I \nwent.\n  While the meeting was intended to be a discussion as a need to \nprovide additional funding in response to the attacks of September 11, \nthe President used the meeting as an opportunity to tell us that he \nwould veto the Defense appropriations bill if Congress included \nadditional spending beyond the $686 billion top line for the 13 \nappropriations bills and the $40 billion level approved by Congress on \nSeptember 14 in response to the September 11 attacks.\n  I assure the Senate that we are not breaking the $686 billion top \nline agreement on spending in the fiscal year 2002 bill. We have worked \nhard in the Senate to produce bipartisan bills that conform to that \nOctober 2 agreement. We took a handshake, and it was an old-time \nhandshake. We are keeping our word. So far, the Senate has passed 12 of \nthe 13 bills by an average vote of 91 to 7. Each of those bills has \nbeen consistent with the $686 billion top line.\n  After the House takes up the defense bill, the Senate will take up a \n$317 billion defense bill that would also conform with the $686 billion \ndeal. However, $40 billion approved by Congress on September 14 is \nclearly not enough to respond to the September 11 attacks.\n  Why is $40 billion not enough? The President has proposed that $21 \nbillion of the $40 billion go to DOD, and that $1.5 billion go to \nforeign aid programs. The President has proposed less than $9 billion \nfor New York.\n  Hear me, Governor Pataki, hear me! The President has proposed less \nthan $9 billion for New York City despite our promise of $20 billion to \nNew York City. That leaves less than $9 billion for homeland defense, \nand that is simply not enough.\n  One cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. One cannot make a \nviolin out of a cigar box.\n  That leaves us with a choice of not meeting our commitment to New \nYork or not providing for a strong homeland defense. That is a choice I \ndo not want to make. That is a choice I will not make. That simply is \nnot acceptable. That is not living up to our word. That is not keeping \nour commitment. That is breaking our word.\n  The world has changed. The world has changed since Congress approved \nthe $40 billion supplemental on September 14. The threat of terrorism \nis no longer theoretical. It is real. When Congress approved the $40 \nbillion package, we were only beginning to learn of the extent of the \ndamage and the anthrax attacks that had occurred. The President's \nproposal does not provide sufficient resources for responding to the \nthreat of bioterrorism or threats to the American food supply. Nor does \nit include sufficient resources to protect our Nation's transportation \nsystem for our airports, mass transit, river ports, seaports, or \nAmtrak. Nor does it provide sufficient resources to improve security at \nour borders or to improve security at nuclear powerplants and labs, or \nat our Nation's dams and reservoirs. That is why I have included $15 \nbillion for homeland defense in this bill.\n  On November 7, several press reports indicated the White House is \nweary that any additional spending approved now will be built upon in \ncoming years, and I shall quote an AP story.\n  What it had to say is this: Possibly forces President Bush to \nconfront an endless stream of budget deficits just as he prepares for \nreelection in 2004.\n  Watch out now. In order to respond to the White House anxiety about \nthis spending, I intend to offer an amendment, if I have the \nopportunity to do so. Let me offer this amendment. I intend to offer an \namendment to direct the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of \nManagement and Budget to not include the funds contained in the \nhomeland defense title of this bill in any calculations of so-called \nbaseline spending for fiscal year 2003 and future years. So I say to \nthe White House, go to sleep, sleep quietly. Sleep soundly, White \nHouse. Let me offer this amendment. This amendment will wipe away those \nfears.\n\n  Under this amendment, these homeland defense funds would not be used \nto inflate the amount of spending necessary to maintain current \nservices in future years. I remind my colleagues, without this \namendment the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management \nand Budget would be expected to add over $177 billion--it would start \nwith $15 billion--to add over $177 billion over the next 10 years. That \nis not my intent. That is why I have an amendment ready.\n  Let me say to all Senators, this Senator has no hidden agenda in \noffering this package, no hidden agenda. I assure Senators and assure \nthe Senate that the $15 billion in spending contained in this bill is \nnot intended to result in a permanent increase in spending. This \nspending is intended to address the clear inadequacy of Federal, State, \nand local capabilities to respond to a clear and present danger to our \nhomeland defense.\n  I am not interested in playing the game of baseline bingo. The \namendment I offer would make it clear that it is a one-time $15 billion \nexpenditure. I hope a point of order will not be made.\n  We must have a recrudescence of confidence in the determination of \nour elected officials to recognize terrorist attacks before they happen \nand take every possible step to minimize them if they do. The \nadministration has responded to this by advocating additional money for \nbioterrorism prevention and additional National Guard troops at our \nNation's airports. That is necessary, but it is not enough. We cannot \nexpect the American people to take comfort in our efforts if we only \naddress the threat of the day, whether it be anthrax or airline \nsecurity. We cannot wait until there is an attack on a nuclear \nfacility. We cannot wait until there is an attack on our mass transit \nsystem. We cannot wait until there is an attack on our food supply \nbefore we react. We have to take preventive steps now before an attack \nkills more of our innocent citizens. We must anticipate our \nvulnerability, not wait for them to be shown to us on CNN.\n  The economy will continue to rise and fall, like the tides of the \nsea, but a sense of security for the American people is something that \nmust not be allowed to wax and wane. The Congress has the opportunity \nbefore it adjourns for the year to show the American people that their \nelected officials have made every effort to prevent future terrorist \nattacks. We can take preemptive steps to combat terrorism on the \nhomefront, with a health care system that can respond to bioterrorism, \na\n\n[[Page S11751]]\n\nsafer food supplier, more secure airports and railroads, stringent \nborder security, and State and local law enforcement that is trained \nand prepared to handle a terrorist attack.\n  It is not enough that we make improvements to airport security or \nbioterrorism prevention. We cannot protect ourselves if we only focus \non our vulnerabilities after they have been exploited by homicidal \nmaniacs. We must be more prepared than that. A focus on every aspect of \nour homeland defense is essential in order to reveal and repair every \nweakness that we may find.\n  These are basic safety precautions. These basic safety precautions \nmust be implemented before the Congress adjourns for the year. We \ncannot wait for another year and another Congress to convene before we \ncome to grips with the horrible reality of another disaster like the \nTwin Towers or the deadly attack on the Pentagon. Every man, woman, and \nchild in America expects our utmost now. Let us act before it is too \nlate.\n  Mr. President, this is an emergency.

It \n     also notified posts worldwide to seal and shut down pouch \n     mail.\n       Mr. Boucher said eight out of 55 samples taken from the \n     Sterling facility tested positive for anthrax. Two of the \n     samples came from two separate mail sorters and six were \n     found on a third sorter.\n       The high concentration of spores on a single sorter \n     indicates ``that there is a letter like the one sent to Sen. \n     Daschle that has moved through our mail system,'' Mr. Boucher \n     said. ``We are now proceeding to go look at all the mail that \n     we have held up, frozen, sealed off, in mailrooms in this \n     building, annexes and around the world.''\n       Officials have to assume that there is a contaminated \n     letter of some kind in the system, and that it will \n     eventually be found in a mailroom or pouch bag, he said. ``If \n     there had been a letter that had gone beyond that into our \n     system, we assume by now we would have seen it.''\n       As officials were looking for the real anthrax letter \n     yesterday, the U.S. Capitol police were dealing with reports \n     of a phony one found on the desk of one of their own \n     officers.\n       The officer has been suspended and accused of leaving a \n     note and a powdery substance at his post in the Cannon House \n     office building.\n       The substance was not hazardous but the department was \n     taking the situation very seriously, according to U.S. \n     Capitol Police Lt. Dan Nichols.\n       Federal officials during recent weeks have tried to get \n     across the message to anthrax hoaxers that their pranks will \n     be penalized harshly.\n       In a radio address last week, President Bush said ``sending \n     false alarms is a serious criminal offense.''\n       Lt. Nichols said a criminal investigation into the incident \n     is under way and findings will be sent to the U.S. Attorney's \n     Office and the police department's internal affairs division.\n       The suspended officer was not identified. If convicted of a \n     hoax, he faces up to five years in prison and as much as $3 \n     million in fines.\n       ``He's been accused of this, and he's suspended without \n     pay, but he hasn't been charged with anything yet,'' said Jim \n     Forbes, a spokesman for U.S. Rep. Bob Ney, Ohio Republican, \n     who heads the committee that oversees U.S. Capitol Police.\n       Mr. Forbes said there is no reason this officer would be \n     exempt from charges similar to those faced by other anthrax \n     hoaxers.\n       ``He's not exempt from anything,'' Mr. Forbes said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 7, 2001]\n\n          HHS Set To Order Smallpox Vaccine for All Americans\n\n                           (By Ceci Connolly)\n\n       Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson said \n     yesterday that he expects to sign a contract his weekend to \n     purchase enough smallpox vaccine for every American but that \n     he has warned the White House the cost could be quadruple the \n     $509 million he originally estimated--or equivalent to the \n     department's entire $1.9 billion bioterrorism budget.\n       Thompson said that he was disappointed the bids from three \n     companies came in around $8 a dose but that he hopes to \n     settle on a lower price in final negotiations on Friday, as \n     he did in his recent talks on the antibiotic Cipro.\n       In addition to the 54 million doses already on order, \n     Thompson said he plans to stockpile 250 million doses of new \n     vaccine, or enough for ``every man, woman and child'' in the \n     country.\n       The previously announced administration effort to vaccinate \n     all Americans against smallpox, a deadly disease that was \n     eradicated in the 1970's, took on a renewed sense of urgency \n     as one of the leading smallpox authorities warned it was \n     conceivable that former Soviet scientists were helping to \n     ``weaponize'' the smallpox virus for nations such as Iran, \n     Iraq, Libya and North Korea.\n       Many [Russian] scientists are really quite desperate for \n     money,'' said Donald A. Henderson, director of the new Office \n     of Public Health Preparedness. U.S. intelligence indicates \n     that several have been recruited by ``rogue states'' and were \n     in a position to smuggle out a vial of the virus, he said. \n     ``That's a very great worry.''\n       In addition, Henderson said, there is evidence that the \n     former Soviet Union succeeded in weaponizing the virus and \n     manufactured up to 100 tons annually at a plant outside \n     Moscow. He described experiments in which the Soviets planned \n     to place smallpox warheads atop intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles. It is unclear whether any warheads were tested.\n       ``We do not have the confidence that the Russians are not \n     at this moment proceeding with research on biological \n     weapons,'' Henderson said, noting that as recently as the \n     early 1990s Russian scientists tried to combine the smallpox \n     and Ebola viruses in search of an even deadlier agent.\n       As the man who led the effort to eradicate smallpox in the \n     1970s, Henderson is familiar with the potential consequences \n     of a reemergence of the disease. Because it is contagious and \n     cannot be treated with existing drugs, its virus is widely \n     considered to be the most potent biological weapon.\n       ``The likelihood of a smallpox release is much smaller than \n     an anthrax release,'' he said. ``We're worried about it \n     because it could be far more serious.''\n       A person infected with smallpox often develops a fever and, \n     later, a rash. Smallpox vaccine administered within two or \n     three days of exposure has been effective in preventing the \n     illness from developing, he said. Historically, 30 percent of \n     people infected with the smallpox virus have died, he said, \n     estimating that the eradication of the disease two decades \n     ago has saved 60 million people and protected 240 million \n     others from illness.\n       Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the subsequent \n     anthrax attacks, Henderson has advocated an aggressive \n     smallpox strategy, including the stockpiling of vaccine. He \n     reiterated yesterday that he would not support widespread, \n     mandatory vaccination but that he wants to have the vaccine \n     on hand in the event of an attack.\n       ``A smallpox outbreak anywhere in the world is potentially \n     an international disaster,'' Henderson said at a bioterrorism \n     conference at the Johns Hopkins Paul H. Nitze School of \n     Advanced International Studies. For that reason, he said, \n     federal health officials have begun informal talks with \n     Japan, Brazil and several countries in Europe on the \n     stockpiling of smallpox vaccine.\n       If even a single case emerged, Henderson said, he would \n     assume that it was the work of terrorists and would rapidly \n     order quarantines and vaccinations to ``build a barrier of \n     immunity.''\n       The United States has about 15.4 million doses of the old \n     smallpox vaccine available, and government researchers say it \n     may be possible to dilute those doses to vaccinate 50 million \n     to 77 million people. Thompson recently expanded and \n     accelerated a contract with OraVex Inc. (subsequently bought \n     by British drugmaker Acambis PLC) for the delivery of 54 \n     million doses by the end of next year.\n       A task force appointed by Thompson is reviewing the three \n     bids and debating safety, efficacy and possible human \n     clinical trials. Already, hundreds of volunteers in the \n     United States are receiving the vaccine as part of a rushed \n     study on the efficacy of diluting the old vaccine.\n       Later this week, newly formed smallpox teams at the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention will take a crash course \n     on the virus with two former CDC experts. The class will \n     focus on identifying, isolating and treating the disease, \n     said spokesman Tom Skinner. More than 100 CDC epidemiologists \n     have also received the vaccine, he said.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 7, 2001]\n\n              Social Security Checks Late, Recipients Say\n\n                          (By Spencer S. Hsu)\n\n       The number of District residents who said the Social \n     Security pension or disability\n\n[[Page S11752]]\n\n     payments are missing doubled this month, with many of the \n     complaints coming from neighborhoods served by the now-closed \n     Brentwood mail distribution center.\n       Deborah Fowler, 35, said she and several other people who \n     live in the 20019 Zip code have not received checks that \n     normally arrive the first of each month. Her Northeast \n     neighborhood is across the Anacostia River from Robert F. \n     Kennedy Memorial Stadium.\n       Fowler said that employees at nearby post offices told her \n     the checks may be lost and that the Social Security \n     Administration said it would take seven to 10 days to issue a \n     replacement check.\n       ``We still have to pay rent. If the rent's not paid, there \n     are late fees on everything,'' Fowler said.\n       Since Brentwood closed Oct. 21 because of anthrax \n     contamination, the District's mail has been processed through \n     distribution centers in the suburbs. Deborah Yackley, a \n     spokeswoman for the Postal Service, acknowledged that some \n     mail, including some Social Security checks, may be delayed \n     because of the temporary arrangement.\n       Chris Williams, a Social Security Administration spokesman, \n     said people who have not received checks should sign up for \n     direct deposit of payments to a bank account, call the \n     agency's toll-free number (1-800-772-1213) to request a \n     replacement check and contact their local Social Security \n     office for immediate relief.\n       ``We don't have a hard and fast rule, it's basically up to \n     the discretion of the case manager,'' Williams said of the \n     later request. ``We can certainly give them payment very \n     quickly on the amount of money they're due.''\n       Williams said 245 D.C. recipients have reported missing \n     checks, compared to fewer than 100 in a typical month. About \n     93,000 residents receive monthly payments, 30,000 of them \n     through the mail.\n\n\n                      software technology industry\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment of the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Mr. Byrd. The chairman has put together this \nvery well conceived $15 billion package of appropriations to address \nthe Homeland security needs as quickly as humanly possible.\n  I call to the attention of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia the devastating impact that the tragic events of September 11, \n2001 had upon the software/information technology industry in and \naround New York City. Eighty-five percent of these software/information \ntechnology companies employ less than 100 persons. The survival of this \nindustry is vital to the recovery efforts of New York City and to the \nnational interest. Accordingly, it would be my hope that, in their \nadministration of the programs for which funding is provided herein, \nall agencies are strongly encouraged to develop proposals which, to the \nmaximum extent possible, take into account the dire circumstances faced \nby these companies.\n  Would the chairman agree?\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the junior Senator from New York for her support of \nmy amendment. Yes, I do agree with the Senator that the various \nagencies which receive funding under my amendment should take notice of \nthis colloquy and take all appropriate action to encourage applicants \nto work with the companies which the Senator from New York has \ndescribed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I know the Senator from Texas has been here for several \nhours and I will finish in one moment.\n  I say to the Senator from West Virginia, I was privileged to be able \nto listen to the speech, and I am better for having done it. I have so \nmuch respect and admiration for the Senator. One thing that always \namazes me is the great memory of Senator Byrd, reciting the signers of \nthe Constitution from memory, and of course ending the remarks with \nthis statement of Senator Hill. I appreciate very much having the \nprivilege of listening to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished whip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, first I thank Senator Byrd for his speech. \nI want to clarify exactly where we are, exactly what the rules of the \nSenate are, the issues I believe are involved, and then I will make a \npoint of order. I think I can do all that fairly briefly.\n  We have before the Senate a bill which is the House bill, H.R. 3090. \nThat bill has been brought to the floor of the Senate. Now there is an \namendment to that bill in the nature of a substitute, which is pending. \nPart of that substitute is Senator Byrd's $15 billion amendment, but \n$67 billion has to do with tax and spending provisions as diverse as \ngiving Federal funding for health insurance for the unemployed and an \ninnumerable list of large and small items to be given some form of \nsubsidy or tax treatment.\n  In the 2001 budget, we reached a conclusion about a provision we \nadded to the old Gramm-Rudman law in 1990, which gave emergency \ndesignations, where you wrote a budget, the budget was binding, but if \nthe Congress and the President agreed, there was not a point of order \nagainst a provision. It was decided in the 2001 budget that this \nprocess had been greatly abused and so it was changed. It was changed \nso there would still be an emergency provision for defense-related \nmatters, but there would not be an emergency provision to waive or get \nby the budget constraints that we had imposed on ourselves for non-\ndefense matters.\n\n  The point of order that I will make is not a point of order that \nSenator Byrd's provisions are not emergencies. They are not a point of \norder against provisions that would use poultry waste to create energy. \nIt is simply a point of order that says we do not have a procedure \nwhereby you can protect yourself in advance against a budget point of \norder except in strictly defined areas related to national defense, so \nthat the waiver that is written into the bill is basically a waiver \nwhich is banned under the budget process as it was amended by the 2001 \nbudget. That is the point of order that I will make.\n  Senator Byrd has given a list of concerns that we all share. I do not \nbelieve any Member of the Senate is less concerned about security of \nour homeland and our people than any other Member of the Senate. The \nPresident, whether he is right or whether he is wrong, said the $40 \nbillion that we have given him, which he is in the process of \nspending--$20 billion of which we will have an opportunity to set \npartial priorities on--is sufficient through the end of the year. At \nthe beginning of next year, if more funds are needed, he would like the \nopportunity as President to review the need, to involve the Cabinet \nofficers and members of the executive branch and potentially \nindependent agencies in doing a comprehensive review, and to send a \nrequest to the Congress for those funds.\n  The question proposed by the Byrd amendment, which is only a small \npart of the bill against which I make a point of order, is the basic \napproach that we should act now and that we should set these priorities \nas Congress. I believe it is a joint process involving the President \nand the Congress. The President has said that he would veto a bill that \nbreaks the budget caps, even with the best of objectives. I make this \npoint of order, not because it solves our problem by killing the \nunderlying substitute, but because I see it as an important step in the \nright direction.\n  The problem is we have our ideas as Republicans. Democrats have their \nideas as Democrats. In this case, for the first time since September \n11, we in the Senate have not successfully been able to come together \non a bipartisan basis. So rather than spending the rest of this week \nmaking partisan speeches where Democrats point out and vilify some part \nof the Republican stimulus proposal and we pick out some small \nprovision and burrow in on it--rather than waste the week in doing \nthat, my objective in making the point of order is to make it clear \nthat the provision before us cannot pass and begin the process whereby \nwe go into negotiations, hopefully involving the House and the Senate, \nDemocrats and Republicans and the White House, to try to come up with a \nstimulus package.\n  I think the American people want us to work together. Working \ntogether means I am not going to get everything I want. Our Democrat \ncolleagues are not going to get everything they want. But in the end, I \nbelieve we can produce something that will be worthy of being adopted.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that section 909 of amendment \nNo. 2125 to H.R. 3090 is in violation of section 205 of House \nConcurrent Resolution 290, the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution. \nSustaining this point of order will not bring down the bill itself. The \nHouse bill will still be there. It will then be subject to amendment if \nwe work out a bipartisan compromise. But it will pull down the \ncommittee substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S11753]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I move to waive section 205 of H. Con. \nRes. 290, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2001, \nfor the purposes of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nunderlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to this request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. Objection to what?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be ordered on the underlying committee substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to it being in order to \nrequest the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. REID. I want to be sure the record is clear it is the Baucus \nsubstitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. I object to the request. As I understand it, the Senator is \nasking the yeas and nays be ordered by unanimous consent. I am opposed \nto that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator please yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We had gotten the yeas and nays on the point of order \nbefore I had an opportunity. We had talked to the leadership on your \nside about ordering the yeas and nays on the amendment. And because we \nhad ordered the yeas and nays on the point of order, it was not in \norder for me to simply request it. So, therefore, I asked unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Texas yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I would say through you to my friend from West Virginia, \nthe Senator from Texas indicated to us he was going to ask for the yeas \nand nays on the Baucus amendment. We acknowledge he was going to do \nthat. From a parliamentary standpoint, he should have done that before \nhe raised the point of order. Now that he raised the point of order, he \ncan't ask for the yeas and nays unless it is by unanimous consent. As \nfar as we are concerned over here, at least me representing the \narrangement we had earlier in the day, we knew that is what you were \ngoing to do. I would say to my friend from West Virginia, if you have \nsome objection, that is the status of the parliamentary procedure. We \nknew he was going to do it. He didn't do it when he should have.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is the Senator asking unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be ordered?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I could ask it either way. I could ask unanimous consent \nit be in order to ask for the yeas and nays. Why don't I do that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to ask for the yeas and \nnays on the underlying Baucus amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nunderlying Baucus amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request for a \nquorum call?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I withdraw my suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was present for most of the presentation \nby my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. I will not repeat \nmuch of what he described as an emergency with respect to the \nprovisions that he has offered dealing with homeland defense.\n  But there is a time, it seems to me, for leadership. I recall reading \nin John Adams's book a letter he had written to his wife, Abigail, in \nwhich he described the difficult times in trying to form this new \ncountry and find leadership. He expressed great woe to his wife, \nAbigail, saying: Where are the leaders? Where are the people who will \nrise up and provide leadership at this urgent time in this country? \nThen he lamented: There is only us: Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, \nMadison.\n  Of course, over a couple of centuries we have discovered that the \n``only us'' represented some of the greatest leadership in human \nhistory.\n  But I think it is important to ask again, Where is the leadership \nwhen we need leadership?\n  We have an economy that is in very difficult trouble. The economy was \nvery weak prior to September 11. But on September 11, terrorist attacks \ncut a hole in the belly of this country's economy.\n  The question for us is, What do we do? Do we do nothing? Do we say \nthis is simply the normal movements of an economy, the expansion and \ncontraction of an economy, or do we recognize that something different \nand unusual has happened that requires an urgent response by the U.S. \nCongress? I believe the latter is the case.\n  We have an economy in which we have buyers and sellers, consumers and \nproducers, demand and supply, and we have an economy in which for two \ncenturies in a market system we have expansion and contraction. It is \ncalled the business cycle. No one has been able to interrupt the \nbusiness cycle very much. We can establish some stabilizers here in \nCongress to try to even out some of the movement of the economy, but \nthe business cycle is central. It is like the tide. But we are not here \nto talk about the business cycle. We are here to talk about an economy \nthat was on a down cycle in the contraction phase when on September 11 \nit was dealt an enormous blow.\n  As a result, we have had hundreds of thousands of people having to go \nhome at night and say to their family: I have lost my job. Last month \nalone, 415,000 people had to go home and tell their family: I have lost \nmy job. It wasn't my fault, I am sure they said, but I have lost my \njob.\n  This economy is in very deep trouble. This Congress has a very \nsubstantial responsibility at some point to come together with this \nPresident and find ways to respond to it.\n  There are a couple of proposals we have offered today. One is a set \nof proposals by Senator Baucus, and the other is a set of expenditures \ndealing with homeland defense offered by Senator Byrd. Both of them \nhave the capacity to provide a lift to this economy. Both of them \nrepresent a menu of items that will be helpful to an economy during \ntroubled times.\n  Some others say: Well, this economy works only when you pour \nsomething in the top and it filters down to the bottom. That is \ntrickle-down economics. Even during tough times, we see those who \nbelieve in the trickle-down theory at work to formulate a package to \ntry to deal with what is called ``economic recovery'' or ``stimulus''--\nkind of representing the trickle-down approach. Just pour something in \nthe top and somehow it all comes down to the bottom.\n\n  We have seen during tough times on other occasions where some had the \nresponsibility and said: Let's do nothing. Let's just sit for a while \nand see what happens. Let's just wait and see.\n  Herbert Hoover had that notion. He said: We will wait and see and let \neverything take its course. He felt there was no need for intervention. \nOf course, we sank deeper and deeper into a recession and then a \ndepression.\n  We know from those experiences that there are things we can do. We \nalso know from the experiences of the past century or so that this \neconomy rests on a mattress of hope and confidence. If people aren't \nconfident, they do things that express their concern about the future. \nThey defer decisions to make purchases of cars or homes or to take \nvacations and so on. If they are confident, they make exactly the \nopposite judgment. They feel secure about a job. They feel good about \nthe future.\n\n[[Page S11754]]\n\n They take that vacation, buy that car and invest in that home. This is \nall about confidence.\n  I have said before that some view this system of ours like the engine \nroom in a ship of state. If you just go to the engine room and take a \nlook at all the gauges, dials, nozzles, and letters, then adjust all of \nthem--M-1B over here, and investment tax credits over there, and \naccelerated depreciation--you just get all these knobs and letters and \ndials going just right and somehow the ship of state comes along. In \nfact, that is not the case at all.\n  There is a lot we don't know about the economy. What we do know, \nhowever, is that engine room in the ship of state runs almost \nexclusively on the American people's confidence about our country and \nits future. How do we at this point in time respond when we had a \ntroubled economy, then that economy took this horrible blow on \nSeptember 11, and as a result of that we see a contraction, hundreds of \nthousands of families losing their jobs? How do we then respond? What \ndo we do to offer confidence to the American people?\n  The September 11 tragedy was followed by the anthrax attacks in \nseveral places in this country. It has been very unsettling to the \nAmerican people--being attacked in this country through the mail and \nusing the Postal Service as a delivery mechanism for terror. It has \ncaused great concern to virtually everyone.\n  In fact, a county sheriff in North Dakota called my office about a \nweek or so ago and said someone in his county had called him. They had \ngotten a letter from me and wondered whether it was safe to open a \nletter from Senator Dorgan because they heard about all of this \nanthrax. All of a sudden, they get a letter from Washington, DC, in the \nmailbox. I was responding to their letter, perhaps. They wondered \nwhether it was safe.\n  In every part of the country people worry about these issues.\n  You have the September 11 terrorist attack--this act of mass murder \nby mad men. Then you have the anthrax attack. Then you have an economy \nthat is in very deep trouble. Last month's figures show 415,000 people \nare now newly unemployed. What do we do about that?\n  The interesting thing about the newly unemployed is in almost all \ncases they are the people at the bottom going up the economic ladder. \nThey are the people who know about secondhand, second shifts, second \nmortgages, and second jobs. They are the folks who deal with all of \nthose issues in their daily lives. Now they deal with the issue of \nbeing laid off. The question for Congress from them is, What can we do \nhere? What can we do to try to get them back on their feet?\n\n  That is a way of saying that part of this stimulus package must be to \naddress those issues. Addressing those issues, according to almost all \neconomists, is to provide stimulus to this economy.\n  Nearly one-half of the people who have been laid off don't have \nunemployment benefits at all. Providing unemployment benefits and \nextending it for those who do have it is a certain way to put some \nmoney into this economy. It is important to do so. These are folks who \nwere working and who were laid off through no fault of their own. They, \ntoo, are victims of terrorism.\n  When we debate these issues, we have some who do not think those \nfolks are very important. They say that is spending. Just spending on \nthose folks is not the right thing. During every economic downturn we \nhave had, our first responsibility was to help those who needed help--\nto provide a helping hand, to reach out and say they are not alone.\n  Will Rogers talked about the inclination of some with whom we serve. \nIt has been ageless, of course. He said:\n\n       The unemployed here ain't eating regular, but we will get \n     round to them as soon as we get everybody else fixed up OK.\n\n  It seems to me, part of a package to provide hope and encouragement \nto this country and to try to stimulate this economy is to take a look \nat those who have been victims of these terrorist attacks and victims \nof a downturn in this economy and say to them: We can give you some \nhelp.\n  Nearly every economist in this country says when you extend \nunemployment benefits to help to those people who have lost their jobs, \nthis is money that goes right into the economy.\n  Some have said--in fact, I have heard it in recent days--if you \nprovide unemployment benefits, it reduces the urge for those folks to \nlook for work. Look for work? They were working. They lost their jobs \nbecause of the economy. Does anybody think any one of these people \nwould have chosen not to work? Half of them do not have unemployment \nbenefits. Does anybody here think they would have chosen that \nunfortunate circumstance where they have to go home after work some \nnight and say, ``By the way, I want you to know, I have lost my job?'' \nI do not think that is something that someone would choose. We have a \nresponsibility to help.\n  So Will Rogers described the circumstances that still exist. \nFortunately, it exists only in a small pocket here in the Congress. \nMost people understand the responsibility to do this.\n  We need to extend unemployment benefits. We need to provide some \nshort-term help with the health insurance needs of those unemployed \nfolks called COBRA. We can do all of that.\n  Now let me turn, just for a moment, to the remarks of Senator Byrd, \nbecause what he said is very important. Part of economic recovery in \nthis country is, as I said, giving people confidence about this \ncountry, where we are headed, and what kind of security exists. So the \npackage that Senator Byrd offers today is one that deals with homeland \ndefense, bioterrorism prevention and response, and food safety. I went \nto a dock in Seattle, WA, one day just to see what happens at these \ndocks. I come from a State that does not have dock facilities. We are a \nlandlocked State right in the middle of our country, the State of North \nDakota. So I was at the Seattle docks, talking to people about what is \ncoming into our ports and how they deal with it. I saw these container \nships being unloaded with these large cranes. Then they took me over to \nan inspection site. They opened the back of one of these containers, \nwhich was now resting on an 18-wheel truck, because they just drive \nthese trucks underneath and drop the container, and then run the trucks \noff someplace to the rest of the country.\n\n  What they had opened was a container of frozen broccoli from Poland. \nIt was bagged in, I believe, 100-pound bags. They took a knife and \nopened a bag of this frozen broccoli from Poland.\n  I asked the people who were showing me all of this: Do you know where \nthis broccoli was produced in Poland? Do you have any idea?\n  They said: Oh, no, we wouldn't have any idea about that.\n  I asked: Do you have any idea what kind of chemicals were applied to \nthis frozen broccoli from Poland?\n  They said: No, we wouldn't have any notion of that.\n  I asked: How many of these containers with frozen broccoli or frozen \nasparagus or peas, or whatever else is coming in in our food supply, \nare actually opened? The one you open, you do not know much about. All \nyou can tell is it is green and frozen and it is a vegetable, but how \nmany of these containers actually get opened?\n  They said: Oh, probably just 2 or 3 percent. The rest of them just \nmove right on through.\n  It is a steel container with frozen vegetables, and it hits these \nshores. It is put on top of 18-wheelers, and off it goes someplace to a \ndistribution center and then someplace to a restaurant and then \nsomeplace to a dinner plate. And we do not have the foggiest idea how \nit was produced, what chemicals were used or whether someone deciding \nto introduce bioterrorism in America's food supply found a way into \nthat container. We do not have the foggiest notion about what the \ncircumstances are with that broccoli.\n  Senator Byrd, in his proposal, says that, too, is an issue of \nhomeland defense, protecting America's food supply. Should American \nconsumers, with the threat of bioterrorism, inspect more than 2 percent \nof the food coming into this country, of those commodities coming into \nthis country? I believe they should inspect more than that. So that is \nhomeland defense.\n  Senator Byrd's homeland defense proposal also invests in State and \nlocal antiterrorism law enforcement. Investing in that kind of law \nenforcement is\n\n[[Page S11755]]\n\nnot only necessary, it also improves confidence. It also will stimulate \nconfidence in this economy.\n  Remember, on September 11, while we all watched television, with \ngreat horror, others in this country were doing something quite \ndifferent. Men and women, making $40,000 and $50,000 a year, wearing \nthe badges of law enforcement and firefighters, were running up the \nstairs of the Trade Center. They were running up the stairs on the \n20th, 30th, 40th, and 50th floors. And as people evacuated those \nbuildings, they saw the first responders--the firefighters and law \nenforcement folks--going up. They did not do it because of their \nsalary. They do not make much money. They did it because they were the \nfirst responders required to protect this country and their city.\n\n  State and local antiterrorism law enforcement, Senator Byrd says in \nhis proposal. Do we need that kind of investment? You bet we do in \nvirtually every reach of this country.\n  FEMA firefighters grant program: Absolutely necessary.\n  The Federal antiterrorism law enforcement, border security, airport \nsecurity: I've been very concerned about the northern border. I am \nconcerned about all of our borders around this country. You cannot \nprovide security in America unless you have security of your borders. \nYou must know who is coming in, and make sure those who are associated \nwith terrorists or known terrorists are not allowed in.\n  On the northern border we have a wonderful, long 4,000-mile border \nwith a great neighbor, the country of Canada. We are so fortunate to be \nable to share that border with a good neighbor. But it is true, on \n4,000 miles of border, we have 128 ports of entry, and over 100 of them \nare part time. In most cases, at 10 o'clock at night, the security \nbetween the United States and Canada is an orange rubber cone that \nsomeone puts in the middle of the road as they shut the station down. \nThat orange rubber cone that cannot shoot, cannot think, cannot talk, \nand cannot tell a terrorist from a tow truck. It is supposed to be \nsecurity. Do we need to do something about that? The answer is, \nclearly, yes. And Senator Byrd, in his proposal of homeland defense, \ndoes that.\n  Airport security, mass transit security, Amtrak security, nuclear \npowerplants: I will not go through all of it, but I think Senator Byrd \ndid it in a very thorough way. I will only say this: Can anyone come to \nthis Senate and tell us this is not a set of emergency needs that are \nrequired at this point in this country? Does anybody really believe \nthese are not emergency needs? I do not believe that someone can make \nthe case that, A, this is not an emergency; and, B, these are not \nnecessary.\n  Let me turn for a moment to the proposals on taxation. One way to \nprovide economic stimulus and recovery and confidence is to get the \neconomy moving again through tax incentives. We have done that before. \nSome are more successful and some are less successful.\n  There are some common provisions in both the House and the Senate \nbills that makes sense. Additional expensing makes sense. Some bonus \ndepreciation makes sense. I happen to think a targeted investment tax \ncredit would make some sense.\n  I want to make a couple of points about some provisions that have \nbeen kicking around here that are in either the House or the Senate \nRepublican proposals that make no sense at all. What we have to do is \nget to the core of what works, to provide some help to this country's \neconomy. One of things that happened--this is in the House of \nRepresentatives stimulus bill--is they decided to give retroactive tax \ncuts in the form of payments to some of the largest corporations in the \ncountry, retroactively refunding the alternative minimum taxes that \nwere paid by the companies.\n  I was in the other body, and I was on the House Ways and Means \nCommittee when we wrote the 1986 Tax Reform Act. I was one of those who \nhelped write the alternative minimum tax. It has turned into something \nthat we did not intend back then, but, nonetheless, the reason we did \nit is we had all these stories. I recall one of them was General \nElectric making $1 billion and paying zero in taxes--zero. We decided \nthat was not fair and it was not something we wanted to see happen. So \nwe thought, if someone is able to zero out their tax liability with all \nkinds of other devices, let's have an alternative minimum tax, so those \nwho have earned substantial profits will at least pay some taxes. That \nis called the alternative minimum tax.\n  The stimulus package enacted by the House of Representatives says \nthat we are going to give back immediate tax refunds for all the \nalternative minimum taxes paid back to 1986. So we will send IBM a \ncheck for $1.4 billion, Ford Motor a check for $1 billion.\n  Can you imagine that? How is that going to stimulate the economy? Tom \nPaxton once wrote a song, when Chrysler got a bailout, saying: ``I'm \nchanging my name to Chrysler.'' Now maybe he would write a song saying: \n``I'm changing my name to Ford.''\n  Are we going to give refunds of billions of dollars to refund the \nalternative minimum tax that corporations pay? How does that help this \ncountry's economy?\n  In the Washington Post this past weekend, there was a fascinating op-\ned piece written by a Nobel Prize-winning economist, Joseph Stiglitz. \nHe wrote:\n\n       What worries me now is that the new proposals, particularly \n     the one passed by the Republican-controlled House, are also \n     likely to be ineffective. The House plan would rely heavily \n     on tax cuts for corporations and upper income individuals. \n     The bill would put zero--yes, zero--into the hands of a \n     typical family of four with an annual income of $50,000. \n     Giving tax relief to the corporations for past investments \n     may pad their balance sheets but will not lead to more \n     investments now when we need it.\n\n  Then he wrote:\n\n       The Senate Republican bill, which the administration backs, \n     in some ways would make things even worse by granting bigger \n     benefits to very high earners. For instance, the $50,000 \n     family would still get zero but this plan would give $500,000 \n     over four years to families making $5 million a year and much \n     of that after (one hopes) the economy has recovered. It \n     directs very little money to those who would spend it and \n     offers few incentives for investment now.\n\n  The point is, we are required to not only do something but to do the \nright thing. This economy is contracting. The economy declined by .4 \npercent in the third quarter. The new figures will likely show we are \nin a recession. Almost everyone in the field of economics believes \nthat. It could very well be a very deep recession.\n  Factory orders dropped 5.8 percent in September, the lowest level \nsince March of 1997. Corporate profits dropped 72 percent in the third \nquarter. Unemployment is 5.4 percent, up a percent and a half from last \nyear; 415,000 job cuts in the month of October alone.\n  Consumer confidence is way off. Consumer spending has plunged. We \nhave substantial excess capacity in our economy. That is why putting \nsubstantial money into the top in the form of a billion dollars here \nand a billion dollars there to one corporation is not going to do very \nmuch if you have substantial excess capacity.\n  The problem is that the economy is in deep trouble. The question is, \nWhat do we do? The answer is, What we do ought to be temporary, No. 1; \nNo. 2, it ought to be immediate. The legislation brought to us from the \nHouse fails on both counts. The proposal that is offered by Senator \nBaucus and Senator Byrd succeeds on both counts.\n  I mentioned a moment ago the alternative minimum tax retroactive \nrefund, $7.4 billion for 16 large companies. Senator Byrd talked about \nthe need for investment in this country, the need for helping people \nwho are out of work with extended unemployment benefits during tough \ntimes. That amount, $7.4 billion, could help State and local \ngovernments hire the first responders, fire and police protectors, and \ntraining. It could help deal with the U.S. Postal Service needs.\n  I did not mention but Senator Byrd talked about the need that is \nrequired now by the Postal Service to find the technology to irradiate \nthe mail, make sure the mails are safe. It is a whole series of things \ndealing with the use of money. Bioterrorism, if we are going to pass a \nbioterrorism bill, how do we pay for that? Law enforcement, \ninfrastructure, all of these are needs that we must address.\n  Some believe this is not an emergency. I very seriously disagree with \nthat. Clearly, this country is facing an emergency situation with an \neconomy that is in a very steep decline.\n\n  My hope is that we will decide in the coming week or so that there is \na way for the Republicans and Democrats, for\n\n[[Page S11756]]\n\nthe House and Senate and the President, to engage in the kind of \nnegotiations that will lead to an economic recovery or stimulus package \nthat, A, is immediate and, B, is temporary, one that recognizes the \nrequirement that we have to do this now.\n  I regret very much that a point of order was just raised. I \nunderstand why it was raised, but I regret it was raised because I \nbelieve a point of order also exists against the underlying Republican \nbill that is at the desk. The bill that came over from the House also \nhas a point of order against it. It substantially delays things here in \nthe Senate to begin battling points of order. Either we are going to do \na stimulus package or we are not. If we are going to do a stimulus \npackage or an economic recovery package, let's get serious about it.\n  What I see in some of these bills, especially the one at the desk \nfrom the House, reminds me of what my mother used to call supper. When \nasked, ``What is for supper?'' she often would say, ``Leftovers.'' We \nall knew what leftovers meant. It meant whatever else was left in the \nrefrigerator.\n  That is what we got from the House in their so-called stimulus \npackage--all the leftovers they hadn't gotten done in previous bills, \nhaving nothing to do with making something immediate or temporary, just \nleftovers, just the old things they always wanted to do. Give a refund \nof $1.4 billion to IBM because they paid an alternative minimum tax \nsince 1986. That doesn't make any sense. That is not going to stimulate \nthe country. It is just the same old nonsense.\n  I started talking about John Adams in his book lamenting to Abigail \nabout, where was the leadership? Where is the leadership? he said, \nduring the formative time of this country when they needed leadership. \nHe said: Regretfully, there is only us, Washington, Franklin, \nJefferson, Madison. Of course ``only us'' turned out to be quite \nsubstantial leadership, the greatest leadership certainly in this \ncountry's history, perhaps in the history of the world, the \norganization of free government.\n  The question is, Where is the leadership now? The leadership offered \nby Senator Baucus and Senator Byrd, assisted by Senator Daschle, in \ntrying to put together legislation that will give hope and confidence \nto the American people--I hope as well the leadership of the President \nand others who will join us in very serious negotiations in the coming \ndays--will allow us to pass legislation that will give us the \nopportunity to say, as Churchill asked the English to say, ``this was \nour finest hour.''\n  We need to do this in a serious way. This country faces a serious \nchallenge. My hope is we do it sooner rather than later. Again, I \nregret very much a point of order was raised because there is not only \na point of order against the legislation that has been offered today, \nthere exists a point of order against the underlying House bill; there \nis a point of order that lay against the Senate Republican bill; there \nis a point of order against all of this. The question is, Do we have an \nemergency in this country or don't we? Those who, like Herbert Hoover, \nwant to sit around and say, let's just wait and see what happens, will \ndo this country no service. Let's decide we will take action now. We \nwill do it on a bipartisan basis, with Republicans and Democrats in \ncooperation with the President, and do it in a way that will make this \ncountry proud of the service given by Congress and the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is very important that we debate and \nunderstand where we are going on the stimulus package. I agree with \nwhat many people have said: We do need an economic stimulus. We have \nbeen in a recession for 15, 16 months. September 11 has pushed us down \neven further. The economists may say we have to wait until we have two \nsuccessive quarters of negative growth, but everybody knows the economy \nhas been going downhill.\n  I also agree that what we need to do needs to be immediate, needs to \nbe stimulative, and should not be permanent; it should be temporary.\n  I have a great deal of problems with what has been produced by the \nHouse and what has been produced by the Finance Committee. A newspaper \nthat is common to the area the occupant of the chair and I serve--I \noften don't agree with it--had an editorial today referring to one part \nof the Senate Finance Committee bill and talked about chicken manure \nand applied that appellation to both bills, the one that came out of \nthe House and one that came out of the Finance Committee. I wouldn't go \nso far myself as to say that. I would say, as we say back home, I have \na minimum amount of high enthusiasm for either one of those bills.\n  Now, on either one of them, one can say these are needed things. Any \nbill that provides for research in science and building infrastructure, \nthings normally in the course of appropriations, I would support. We \nneed to build highways. We need to do research. There are a lot of \nproblems with which we need to pick up. Similarly, when you are talking \nabout tax relief and tax cuts, the long-term good of the economy \nrequires that we lower marginal tax rates and get rid of the craziness \nthat the alternative minimum tax imposes, particularly on individuals \nand small businesses. But I don't think this is the time to do it. I \nthink we need to take care of those people who are hurting. That is why \nI think we ought to provide something that has unemployment \ncompensation and grants to the States to help with health care.\n  I also believe we need to help small business. I have filed a couple \nof amendments that do several things for small business. Frankly, small \nbusiness was largely left out of the Senate Finance Committee and the \nHouse bills. Small business is the driving engine of our economy, and \nnobody seemed to care about small business. They are the ones taking it \nin the teeth in many areas. So I filed amendments that do several \nthings. First, my amendment provides for much more generous loan terms \nfor small businesses that have been directly or indirectly affected by \nthe September 11 terrorist attacks, by deferring and/or forgiving \ninterest on these loans and lowering fees. In other words, it says to \nsmall business that if you are willing to take the chance now to invest \nand grow your business as this economy starts to turn around, we are \ngoing to give you a break on the amount you have to pay up front. You \ncan defer paying interest until we come out of this. That makes a lot \nof sense.\n  I think, also, we need to encourage and ensure that small business \ngets a share of Government procurement as part of these stimulus \npackages. We pass small business bills that give all kinds of benefits \nto small business and then the bureaucrats find ways around them. We \nneed to tighten up and eliminate those loopholes so when the Federal \nGovernment spends money, a part of that money goes to small businesses \nfor the purchase of goods or services.\n  On the tax front, if there is one thing we can do to help small \nbusiness it is to raise the amount of new equipment that they can \nexpense. Today, if a small business owner buys a piece of equipment, he \ncan expense up to $24,000 of the purchase price. My proposal is to \nincrease that limit to $50,000 that can be written off immediately so \nthey can get an immediate tax break and don't have to depreciate it. We \nwould also raise the limit on vehicles. Right now, you can only \ndepreciate about $14,000 on vehicles. A lot of vehicles--particularly \nvans and trucks used by small business--cost well above that amount and \nthey can't depreciate the full cost of the vehicle. So it is a real \nburden on small business to buy them.\n\n  For restaurants, which are dominated by small businesses, we ought to \nrestore the full 100-percent business meal deduction. These are things \nwe can do on an immediate basis that will have an immediate impact on \nsmall businesses, their suppliers, equipment manufacturers, and our \neconomy as a whole.\n  I also happen to favor one of the simplest, most direct approaches to \nget money into the pockets of working men and women who can spend it \nright away. Senator Domenici has developed a concept of having a \nDecember tax holiday on FICA, the Social Security payments all working \nAmericans make each year. Under this proposal, any payments that are \nowed during December by employees or employers would not be sent in, \nleaving more in each worker's pay check and more for the business to \nprotect jobs. The General Treasury would reimburse the Social\n\n[[Page S11757]]\n\nSecurity fund so there would be no loss to Social Security Trust Fund \nwhile protecting retirees' benefits. This is one way we could get money \ninto the pockets of people who will spend it in December.\n  One of the things people are talking about is the expansion of the \ntax rebates that started in July. The rebate the President suggested is \nfine, but most people say it is unworkable because you can't get the \nrebate out until January and there's a good chance it will slow down \nthe processing of returns and mailing of refunds in the upcoming tax \nfiling season. I think everybody realizes that to get a strong economy \nwe need the money in the pockets of the working men and women in \nAmerica now, not tomorrow. So I would like to see a serious \nconsideration to the December FICA tax holiday that Senator Domenici \nhas constructed.\n  I have several more amendments at the desk. If we are going to be \nhere and have a vote-a-rama on a long list of amendments, you can count \nme in because I think these things ought to be considered. I believe \nthere is also discussion, on the other hand, by the leadership that if \nthe point of order is sustained, there will be serious negotiations so \nthat a final package will come to the floor. Obviously, that is not in \nmy hands. But I raise these points about small business and the need to \nstimulate the small business sector of our economy, which would be \nhelped by easier loans, greater expensing, more Government contracts, \nand which would be helped by the plan that Senator Domenici has \nconceived. I hope when he introduces it, he will add me as a cosponsor.\n  These things will help. I think they will give the kind of economic \nstimulus we need right away, and if there is to be a negotiated \nagreement--House-Senate, Republican-Democrat, and the White House--I \nhope they will take into account these vitally important provisions for \nsmall business, and perhaps avoid the paths that will be best addressed \nin other legislative action at other times.\n  I urge the managers of the bill to consider the impact this stimulus \npackage can and must have on small business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am glad to yield to my colleague from \nNew Mexico. He has a brief matter he wants to bring to the Senate's \nattention.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I didn't hear the Senator. Did he \nsay a time certain?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand that the Senator wanted 2, 3 minutes. I am \nglad to accommodate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Since I was part of the history of this, I wanted to \nrecall it and let everybody know what we are debating here. Again, this \npoint of order was established in the 2000 budget resolution, and then \nit was made permanent in the 2001 budget resolution. It was designed to \nspecifically address what was said over and over at that point to be a \nmisuse of the ``emergency'' designation that had become a popular \nmechanism for getting around the spending limits established in both \nlaw and in our budget resolution.\n  So in the 2001 budget resolution, we established a very clear set of \npriorities designating domestic spending as an ``emergency.'' All those \ncriteria had to be met to allow the spending or tax cuts to be placed \noutside the budget blueprint.\n  Again, let me read those criteria because that is what we are \ndebating. They were the following five criteria that had to be met: \none, the provision must be necessary, essential, and vital; two, the \nprovision must come about suddenly and quickly; three, the provision \nmust be urgent, pressing, and compelling; four, the provision must have \nbeen unforeseen, unanticipated, unpredictable; and five, the provision \nmust not be permanent.\n  Senator Phil Gramm raised an appropriate point. The Senate has the \nauthority to waive the issue before us and decide whether the \nunderlying bill and the amendment to the bill meet all of these \ncriteria. I haven't studied both bills, and I essentially looked only \nat the underlying tax bill that came out of the Finance Committee. I \nremind everybody that we have declared a huge amount of money as an \nemergency already. We are at $70 billion since the budget resolution \nthat we have declared to be emergency because of the disaster that \nbeset our people and the State of New York, Washington, DC, and \nobviously the crash in Pennsylvania.\n  I just read the criteria. With reference to the tax bill, I ask \nrhetorically: Does spending money to buy meat, blueberries, \nwatermelons, cucumbers, and other items, meet the emergency criteria of \nbeing urgent and necessary at this time? Do citrus canker tax credits \nrise to the level of a needed emergency tax cut today? Do payments to \nrum producers in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands qualify as \nemergency spending? I am just asking the question. Perhaps people think \nthey do. Senator Gramm was wondering about not only these but whatever \nother ones he might have had in mind.\n  Do we think expanding the work opportunity tax credit to provide \n$4,800 for every bond trader and stockbroker in Lower Manhattan meets \nthe criteria of essential and necessary? Do we think the $2 billion \npricetag for this provision is what we had in mind when we passed this \ntax credit for low-income, single-parent mothers?\n  I submit, if this point of order is not waived, then obviously we \nwill be back thinking about a bill that is bipartisan. I recommend that \nwe not grant the waiver, and then I recommend strongly that we get busy \non a bipartisan bill, showing the American people we can create a \nstimulus for our growth that includes tax measures and other items, \nthat it can be done in a bipartisan fashion, and we ought to get on \nwith it.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy for yielding, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I imagine our fellow Americans who have \nbeen watching the Senate this afternoon are wondering whether this \ninstitution can function effectively in dealing with the problems they \nare facing every single day, particularly those who have lost their \njobs in recent times through no fault of their own.\n  They are proud men and women who work hard, play by the rules, go to \ntheir jobs every day, and have found out in recent times, before and \nafter September 11, that their services are no longer needed. They are \n137,000 workers in the transportation industry; 136,000 in the \nhospitality, tourism, and entertainment industry; 57,000 in the \ncommunications and utilities industry; 226,000 in manufacturing; 14,000 \nin the retail industry; 44,000 more in the service sector industry; and \nin the finance, insurance, real estate industries, 24,000 more.\n  There it is in raw figures, but it does not reflect the challenges \nthose families are going through every single day when they are denied, \nin too many instances, unemployment compensation, even though they have \ncontributed to it, because of the change in the rules, or they find it \nvirtually impossible to find new employment because of the changed \neconomic conditions.\n  These are our fellow Americans, workers, proud men and women, who \nhave provided for their families and, now, every day go home and have \nto look into the eyes of their children, and look into the eyes of \ntheir loved ones, and say: I was not able to get any employment today, \nand our savings are going down further and further.\n  We know there is an emergency. It defies any possible understanding \nof the use of the word in the English language that there is not an \nemergency in the United States today. Tell that to the brave men and \nwomen behind the lines in Afghanistan. Tell it to their relatives at \nhome.\n  Tell that to the National Guard troops who have been called up in my \nState serving in the air wing. Tell it to the reservists who have been \ncalled up from Westover, Barnes Air Force Base, the MPs who have been \ncalled up, many from the private sector. Tell it to them, we do not \nhave an emergency.\n  Tell it to the families of the postal workers who died from anthrax \nthat we do not have an emergency.\n  Tell it to the Attorney General and the President of the United \nStates who said we have to be on a heightened state of alert. When did \nwe hear that in the last years? When did we last hear warnings from an \nAttorney General and from a President about how we have to have a \nheightened state of alert? All Americans have to be on a heightened \nstate of alert.\n\n[[Page S11758]]\n\n  This is defined as an emergency any way you look at it. We are facing \nan emergency, and we are facing an emergency in a most profound way in \nthe state of our economy. We have seen it in our States, and if we have \nnot seen it, we have not been paying attention to our constituents. \nMaybe it has not reached some areas of this country, but I would like \nthose Members to rise up and tell us about how their States have not \nbeen affected or impacted, because every indication is we are in an \nemergency.\n  We have had the first decline in the GDP in more than 8 years. We \nhave the largest increase in the unemployment rate in 21 years. I will \nnot take the time this afternoon to read into the Record when a number \nof our colleagues, many on the other side of the aisle, said: Use the \nemergency provisions for incidental factors. There are lists of them. I \nhave lists of them. We are not talking about that. We are talking about \nthe greatest increase in unemployment in 21 years. We are talking about \nthe three-quarters of a million newly unemployed and the plunge in \nconsumer confidence in our economy.\n\n  We have heard the words of some economists. We all saw the reports \nthis last weekend. The Nobel laureate, Joseph Stiglitz, talked about \nthis as well, and his statements have been mentioned in this Chamber:\n\n       The United States is in the midst of a recession that may \n     well turn out to be the worst in 20 years, and the \n     Republican-backed stimulus will do little to improve the \n     economy; indeed, it may make matters worse.\n\n  There it is, Mr. Republican. It is not just Democrats saying it. \nFamilies in America understand it is an emergency. Those who are \nserving in the Armed Forces and are being called up know it is an \nemergency. Economists understand it is an emergency. And people are \nasking: Are we in the Congress of the United States going to do \nsomething about it?\n  Evidently, we are going to be denied that opportunity by the use of \nprocedural actions of which the American people are sick and tired.\n  The American people understand. Why are you not doing what you did in \nthe 1970s or in the 1990s in the unemployment insurance program? We \nhave examples of the unemployment insurance program helping workers. \nWhy are you not doing what you did then? Why aren't Republicans and \nDemocrats working hand in hand to provide assistance to those who are \nunemployed?\n  We did it in 1991 by a 91-to-2 vote in the Senate. We provided a more \ngenerous package than is being proposed by the Democrats now. Then in \n1992, by a 94-to-2 vote, Republicans and Democrats provided extended \nunemployment compensation. Again in 1992, July of 1992, by a 93-to-3 \nvote, we provided an extension of unemployment compensation--each time \ntrying to provide additional protection for workers who were being \nexcluded and, we extended unemployment insurance again later on in 1993 \nby a vote of 79 to 20. That is the history of trying to provide help to \nthese families in a much more extensive way, with a generous kind of \ncommitment. People say, why can they not agree to that this afternoon? \nWhy are roadblocks being put in their way to deal with that this \nafternoon? Why can we not get about that which will help my friend or \nmy neighbor, somebody who has lost his job? But, no. Instead, we are \ngoing to have a procedural vote. We are going to have procedural votes \nin order to deny us the opportunity to do so.\n  We have a similar situation in health care. This is one of the most \nvaluable qualities of life for all of our fellow citizens. The central \nchallenge we face is trying to ensure we are going to have adequate \nhealth care. I enjoyed being in this Senate when we debated a patients' \nbill of rights. How often I listened during the course of the day to \nthose voices that said we cannot pass a patients' bill of rights \nbecause it is going to increase premiums by 1 percent and we are going \nto create all of these uninsured.\n  We have thousands of uninsured who have been losing their coverage, \nand I am waiting to hear those same voices say, ``let us do something \nabout them.'' I have not heard it yet. Back when we were on the floor \ndebating whether a patient was going to have the best health care based \non a decision of the doctor instead of the bottom line of the insurance \ncompany, my Republican colleagues gave long speeches saying that we \nshould be focused instead on covering the uninsured. That is what we \nwere battling for--to protect American families.\n  We are told we cannot go to that radical concept because we are going \nto see thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands more people \nwho will lose their health insurance.\n  We have it now. We are seeing it every single day in increasing \nnumbers. Where are those voices that say, ``Let us do something about \nit?'' I do not hear them. They refuse to make the recommendations or \nsuggestions to do it, and the one that they have made is completely \nindefensible.\n  I ask, where is their program for health insurance? We provide, under \nthe program that is before us now, assistance for those that have \nCOBRA. We provide assistance for those that are not eligible for COBRA. \nThe reasons for that are the size of the companies and other technical \nreasons such as whether the workers receive COBRA or they do not. We \nlook out for both.\n  If one looks at the Republican plan, the total Republican plan they \nsay is a pot of money that can be used for unemployment or it can be \nused for health insurance or they can use it for some other social \nservices such as child care. They mentioned all of this, but if you \njust applied it to the premiums of COBRA eligible workers, you get only \n2 weeks of coverage.\n  I hope our colleagues are not going to be saying we are for covering \nthose who have health insurance. I have heard some of those speeches, \nbut I have not heard them say or defend their particular program. Here \nit is.\n  We believe in the importance of making sure working families who have \nbeen separated from their jobs, through no fault of their own, have \nhealth care coverage because we know what happens to them. The average \npayment on unemployment insurance is $925, and to maintain their \npremiums now would take 65 percent of that $925. That is why about 15 \npercent of the total workers, without any kind of help, actually \nutilize COBRA.\n  I commend Senator Baucus and the Finance Committee for their \nproposals, both on unemployment and on this particular proposal, and \nSenator Byrd for the strong support he has given to our homeland \nsecurity proposal. Under the proposal that has been advanced by the \nFinance Committee, it is down to 16 percent. We have heard as recently \nas today from a very lovely lady who lost her job in Philadelphia. She \nhad worked in the service industry in Philadelphia for a number of \nyears, and she now finds herself unemployed. She says it is going to be \ndifficult to find the resources to do it, but, by God, she thought she \ncould get herself together because it is so necessary for her family.\n  We are not as interested in talking about what the other side is \nagainst, although we know they are against our proposal. We want the \nAmerican people to understand what we are for. This is what the \nDemocratic proposal will do. It will guarantee help in paying the COBRA \npremiums. That would help 7.2 million Americans. We do this. We provide \nhelp for displaced workers that are not eligible for the COBRA; 2.5 \nmillion fellow Americans, they will be eligible.\n  We provide State fiscal relief for improving the maximum Federal \nMedicaid payments, similar to what has been successful in the CHIP \nprogram which virtually every State accepted with the increasing match. \nWe do that. That helps maintain coverage for 4 million Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. All across the board we have had these evaluated by CBO \nand the others who maintain and support the conclusions I have stated. \nIn the Republican plan, there is no guarantee.\n  If one is interested in providing some assistance to workers, the \nprogram that Senator Baucus and others have proposed makes the most \nsense. It makes the most sense in terms of ensuring that workers and \nworkers' needs are going to be attended to, and it also provides \nsupport for health care. So I hope our colleagues will change their \nmind on this particular issue.\n\n  On September 11, America sustained an unprecedented terrorist attack. \nThe risk and the danger of future attacks is very real. The President \nand leading figures in the administration repeatedly warn the American \npeople of the\n\n[[Page S11759]]\n\nneed for unprecedented vigilance. So we are facing a true national \nemergency by any reasonable definition.\n  What the objectors seek to block is the appropriation, as well, of \n$15 billion for homeland defense. They object to the expenditure of $4 \nbillion that would enhance our ability to prevent bioterrorist attacks \nand protect our citizens should such an attack occur. They object to \nthe expenditure of $4 billion to strengthen the ability of Federal, \nState and local law enforcement to combat terrorism. They object to \nexpenses to improve border security, airport security, mass transit \nsecurity. They even object to funds needed to enhance security at the \nNation's nuclear powerplants. If providing the necessary funds so these \nhomeland defense initiatives can begin immediately is not an emergency, \nthen what is?\n  The point I want to conclude with is, it is ironic the same Members \nwho object so strenuously to spending $15 billion to strengthen the \nNation's capacity to defend ourselves from terrorist attacks are \nsupporting a bill which would retroactively repeal the corporate \nminimum tax and give the largest corporations $25 billion in direct \npayments from the U.S. Treasury.\n  We do not have the money to look out after the premiums for hard \nworkers. We do not have the money to provide help for unemployment \ninsurance. We do not have the resources to deal with helping the States \nmeet these crises, but we do evidently in that budget that clears OMB, \nclears Mr. Daniels, have the ability to get $25 billion in direct \npayments from the U.S. Treasury, payments to repeal the corporate \nminimum tax and to return taxes they have paid in past years.\n  Is giving major corporations hundreds of millions of dollars each \nbased on taxes they paid 10 or 15 years ago a higher priority for \nAmerica than strengthening homeland defense? Is retroactive repeal of \nthe corporate AMT an emergency? Could we not devote $15 billion to \ndefending America? It would still need $10 billion for corporate \nrefunds. Those same Members support accelerating upper income brackets, \nand if they believe we can afford such an expensive tax cut in the \nmidst of an unprecedented national crisis, how can they claim we cannot \nafford $15 billion to better protect America from terrorism?\n\n  Those who deny we are facing a national emergency today and would \njustify--in fact, demand--congressional action to strengthen homeland \ndefense are suffering from the worst case of political myopia I have \never seen. In all my years in the Senate I have never seen a clearer \nchoice for Senators.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend--Senator Byrd spoke earlier today, prior to \nthe point of order having been filed, and I asked: Did I hear, Senator \nByrd, they are going to file a point of order that this is not an \nemergency?\n  And he answered: Yes, they are. They have filed a point of order that \nthe plan now before the Senate, the Baucus plan, together with the Byrd \nplan, is not an emergency.\n  Can the Senator from Massachusetts give me any ideas, any reason, how \nthis could not be an emergency? Does the Senator have any idea how this \ncould not be an emergency? How could anyone in good conscience say this \nis not an emergency?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have great difficulty in understanding that. I think \nanyone watching this debate in Nevada or Massachusetts would come to \nthat same conclusion when they see the loss of jobs taking place in \nyour State and mine and all of the 50 States; when they see members of \ntheir family being called up for the National Guard, or when they have \nmembers of their family who have been activated and sent over the \nIndian Ocean on aircraft carriers and dropped behind the lines in \nAfghanistan; when they have listened to a President of the United \nStates call upon all members to be on a heightened sense of alert, and \nwe listened to the Attorney General of the United States say, once \nagain, it is time for us to be on heightened alert; when we have seen \nthe significant economic indicators over the period of these past \nseveral months, all going in an adverse direction after a long period \nof economic growth and price stability; and where we have heard the \nleading economists say, look, we are facing a challenging time.\n  It can get a lot worse if we do the Republican plan or no plan. I \nwonder why we ought to be gambling with the well-being of the people of \nNevada or Massachusetts. I wonder if the people of Massachusetts truly \nunderstand what is happening in the Senate. They are wondering why we \naren't acting. You will say because we are having a point of order. \nThey will ask what a point of order is. They will wonder in \nMassachusetts, perhaps, whether it is a restaurant in Chicopee. They \nwill be asking: There is a point of order and we are not taking action?\n  Why is one of the great institutions failing to deal with this \neconomic challenge when we have at our best days been willing to do it \nin a bipartisan way?\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the statement of the Senator. The people of \nNevada are wondering how possibly we are not doing anything, No. 1, on \nairline security. On airline security we are doing nothing.\n  People on the other side are not willing to talk about this is too \nmuch money or maybe they don't like the way we are spending the money. \nThey are saying: We don't want this because we don't believe there is \nan emergency in this country, and we are going to raise a point of \norder that this is not emergency spending because there is no \nemergency.\n  I have trouble following that reasoning. I wondered if the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts had any line of reasoning to amplify the reasoning \non the other side. It appears he does not.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think the Senator has made this very clear.\n  As to airport security, people back in Massachusetts are saying: You \nMembers of Congress have the Federal protection, don't you?\n  There will be families coming down here to visit who have to show \ntheir briefcases. That security isn't auctioned off to the lowest \nbidder. We have looked out after ourselves in this respect and at the \ncost of lives. We have had courageous policemen who lost their lives in \nthe line of duty, protecting Members of Congress.\n  On the other hand, we are told we cannot have that kind of protection \nfor the American people. I don't know whether the Senator saw a letter \nto the editor--perhaps this is too serious to joke about--that said \nmaybe we ought to have two kinds of security: those which are deemed \nprivate, and let the Republicans go through those; and the others who \nare Federal workers, let the Democrats go through those.\n  It is really too serious to be joking about and certainly in the wake \nof the extraordinary tragedy earlier this week where, to all \nindications, it appears to be a mechanical problem, but at least in \npeople's minds and in families' thoughts they wonder about the security \nand the fact we have not been able to work this out, to guarantee the \nbest in security.\n  As pointed out by other Members of the Senate, we don't auction off \nthe Secret Service. We don't auction off who will be out there in the \nFood and Drug Administration to make sure our drugs are going to be \nsafe and efficacious. We don't auction off the FBI. We don't auction \noff the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms employees. We don't auction those \noff to the private sector. We want to make sure Americans are \nprotected.\n  I find it extraordinary that the strong initiative which passed \nsuccessfully in the Senate that ensures that kind of protection still \nis unable to be completed through the two bodies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \ncomments. I think historians will record that he is probably one of the \nmost forceful advocates for working families in the history of the \nSenate.\n  I have a statement by Joseph Welcome, a mold maker who lost his job. \nHis wife, who was in the travel industry, lost her job.\n  He said yesterday: My wife and I have worked hard our entire lives. \nWe earned everything we got. Unfortunately, like many thousands of \nAmericans, we have run into hard times. We want to use the system as it \nwas intended to be used to get us back to work as fast as possible with \na marketable skill set. Unfortunately, that cannot be done in 6 months \nin today's economy. That is why we need your help now, not 6 months or \na year from now. We need it now or we may very well become a statistic \non the welfare\n\n[[Page S11760]]\n\nroles, putting even more of a tax burden on the American public.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will argue this is not \nan emergency. Last month saw the biggest 1-month increase in \nunemployment in 21 years. Nearly 7.5 million Americans are now out of \nwork. But, of course, those who are discouraged workers and are not \ncounted as unemployed are not included in the statistics. Those who can \nonly find part-time jobs and cannot really support their families on \nthose jobs are not included in the statistics.\n  And all of the working poor people who work almost 52 weeks a year, \n40 hours a week, and still do not make poverty wages, they are not \nincluded either. Analysts warn that another 1 or 2 million workers \ncould lose their jobs over the next 12 months. I think it could be \nworse than that. The unemployment rate is 5.4 percent, up .5 percent \nfrom the previous month, and it is going to continue to go up. Consumer \nconfidence is at the lowest level it has been in 7 years.\n  All of this combined with lagging consumer confidence can perpetuate \na downward spiral. Consumers, fearful about the future, will spend \nless, which will cause us to sink even deeper into recession.\n  These are difficult economic times. For many families in Minnesota \nand in the country, this is also a situation where time is not neutral; \ntime is not on their side. If they do not get an extension of \nunemployment benefits, if they do not have any health care coverage for \nthemselves and their loved ones, it will be broken dreams and broken \nlives and broken families. And my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle want to cast a vote saying this is not an emergency.\n  If you were out of work and you didn't know where your next dollar \nwas going to come from and you were going to run out of unemployment \nbenefits and you were terrified that you would not be able to support \nhealth care coverage for your wife or your husband or your loved ones, \nyou sure as heck would consider this to be an emergency. Sometimes we \nare all too generous with the suffering of others.\n  Most economists agree on certain things if we are going to have a \nsuccessful economic stimulus package. This is not just about justice \nand helping those people who are flat on their back. This is also about \nhow do we get this economy going again? What kind of investments do we \nneed to make? All economists I know say that for an economic stimulus \npackage to be successful, it must be immediate, have an immediate \neffect; it must be temporary; it must put resources in the hands of \nthose who will spend it to stimulate the economy; and that it will not \nbe harmful to our long-term economic interests.\n  The Republican proposals by the House and the Senate and supported by \nthis administration fail to meet all of these tests, and the Democratic \nplan meets all these criteria.\n  Taxes? The Republican plan provides tax relief for millionaires and \nprofitable corporations, even if those corporations cut jobs. The \nDemocratic plan provides tax cuts for working families and businesses \nthat invest and create jobs.\n  The Republican plan spends $121 billion to speed up the tax cut rates \nin the $2 trillion tax cut enacted earlier this year. Under the \nRepublican plan, every millionaire in America will receive over $50,000 \nin tax cuts over the next 4 years and, by contrast, the Republican plan \nwould put zero into a typical family of four with an annual income of \n$50,000 a year, precisely the kind of family, if given help, that is \nmore likely to consume and put resources back into our economy.\n  The Republican plan has numerous tax breaks for multinational \ncorporations. The most egregious is the repeal of the alternative \nminimum tax. Refunds go all the way back to 1986, 15 years ago; $22 \nbillion cost over 10 years. As Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz said:\n\n       The GOP plan would put zero, yes zero into the hands of a \n     typical family of 4 with an annual income of $50,000 a year. \n     Giving tax relief to corporations for past investments \n     and AMT repeal may pad their balance sheets but will not \n     lead to more investment now when we need it. Bailouts for \n     airlines did not stop them from laying off workers and \n     adding to the country's unemployment problem.\n\n  The Democratic plan, by contrast, provides immediate tax rebates to \n45 million Americans who did not receive rebates last summer, which \nwill spur consumer spending and immediate tax relief to businesses, \nwhich will spur investment.\n  Mr. President, 44 percent of the individual tax cuts in the \nRepublican plan go to the wealthiest 1 percent--it is Robin Hood in \nreverse--the people who are least likely to spend the savings, while \nonly 18 percent goes to low- and moderate-income families.\n  Colleagues, get the tax breaks or tax rebates or whatever you want to \ncall it--if you are going to do that--into the hands of people who will \ngo out and buy a washing machine because they need it, and they will \nspend, and that is what we need for the economy. Don't go forward with \nRobin-Hood-in-reverse tax cuts and corporation tax breaks for \nmultinational corporations which are already doing fine and are not \ngoing to necessarily even spend in the economy.\n  Even worse, most of the Republican tax cuts take effect after the \ncurrent economic crisis may very well have ended. By definition, they \nare not economic stimulus effects.\n  The last point I make on the tax cut is telling. The Republican plan \nis not an economic stimulus plan; it is a shamefaced effort to use our \ncurrent crisis; that is to say, the misery of hard-working men and \nwomen who have lost their jobs and health insurance in this economic \ndownturn, as an excuse for lining the pockets of wealthy individuals \nand multinational corporations. It is the antithesis of sound fiscal \npolicy. It is unfair, and it is ineffective.\n  Unemployment--my gosh, people are out of work. Our plan says let's \nadd 13 weeks to unemployment insurance. Our plan, under the work of \nSenator Baucus and many other Senators on our side, says let's reform \nunemployment insurance and let's cover part-time workers. Economists \ntell you every dollar of unemployment insurance paid to unemployed \nworkers expands the economy by $2.15. This is a win-win. Can't we help \npeople flat on their backs who, in turn, will consume with that \nadditional assistance?\n  What happened to people in New York, what happened to people at the \nPentagon, what happened to people in Pennsylvania, what has happened in \nour country has taught all of us that we need each other as never \nbefore. There is a great sense of community. People are trying to help \none another. I think we understand in a certain profound sense that we \nall do better when we all do better. Can't some of that community \nspirit apply to what we are doing in the Senate?\n  Don't tell all of the men and women who are out of work in Minnesota \nand all across the country, and their children, it is not an emergency. \nIt is an emergency for them. It is an emergency for their families. And \nit is an emergency for our country.\n  The Republican plan says that if you go beyond New York and you go \nbeyond Virginia and you go beyond Pennsylvania, you have to have had a \n30-percent increase in unemployment before any of what meager benefits \nthey have even kick in. Minnesota, as I look over past history, in some \nof the worst recessions did not have a 30-percent increase in \nunemployment. I am a Senator from Minnesota. I have to fight for the \npeople in Minnesota. I have to make sure that for people who are in \nsuch difficult times through no fault of their own, we are going to \nhave a safety net. The Republican plan will not help these people at \nall.\n\n  Health care coverage in the Republican plan is literally an asterisk. \nTheir plan does not guarantee one dime to laid-off workers to maintain \ncoverage. In fact, Treasury Secretary O'Neill says he would strongly \nencourage President Bush to veto any economic recovery plan that \nincludes health care coverage for laid-off workers. The administration \nsaid last week that if we had too much by way of unemployment insurance \nand health care coverage, then people would not have an incentive to go \nback to work. Do you know how insulting that is to hard-working people?\n  Our plan says we will cover 75 percent of COBRA coverage. Mr. Welcome \nsaid yesterday: My God, I can't afford 4, 5, or 6--I can't even \nremember--hundred dollars of a month. I can't afford that kind of \ncoverage. We help families like the Welcome family.\n\n[[Page S11761]]\n\n  Then, for those families who work for small businesses, so they are \nnot eligible for COBRA, we expand medical assistance coverage in the \nStates. In addition, we respond to the Governors of our States. And \nwhat were the Governors of our States saying? They were saying: Please \nadd on more to the Federal contribution to medical assistance because \nwe are in a recession; we have more people out of work; we no longer \nhave the surpluses. These are hard economic times, and we need some \nadditional help.\n  The Republican plan does not respond one bit to the economic pain \nthat we hear about from people in the country.\n  We are being told by this procedural move by my colleague from Texas \nthat this is not an emergency.\n  I met with some families in Minnesota 2 weeks ago. We were in one of \nthe workers' homes. There were some television cameras. I said: Are you \nsure you want to do this? They said they did. It was a seminar-type \ndiscussion. I hardly talked at all. Tell me what your concerns are. \nThese are people who have long work experience. They had been working \nmost of their adult lives. They are out of work through no fault of \ntheir own. I think more than anything else, they talked about health \ncare coverage. They certainly are hoping for unemployment benefits to \ntide them over. A number of them, interestingly enough, talked about \njob training.\n  If I had my way, we would add some provisions, including some money \nfor workforce development. But, most importantly, they talked about \ntheir fears that there would be no health care coverage at all for \ntheir families.\n  Senators, again I hate to put it this way, but if it were your \nfamily, if you were out of work, if you were worried that you wouldn't \nbe able to afford COBRA, and there wouldn't be enough to help you if \nyou were eligible for COBRA, and if there were not a specific benefit \nthat would enable you to still be able to provide health care coverage \nfor your families, I guarantee you would consider it an emergency.\n  It is an emergency for many families in our country. We must respond \nto this economic pain. In the words of Rabbi Hillel, if not now, when?\n  Then there is homeland defense, Senator Byrd's proposal on which many \nof us worked. I have said a lot of times, as I am sure every Senator \nhas--I guess we reached different conclusions--with fire chiefs, first \nresponders, they told me. I sure learned it back then. People are \nanxious and people are worried. Please get an infrastructure of public \nsafety and, yes, public health.\n\n  Dr. Michael Home is from Minnesota. Dr. Home has made their case in a \ncompelling way. Get the money to our communities because people will be \nsafe where they live, where they work, and where their children go to \nschool. We need the resources.\n  In the homeland defense part of this bill that we brought to the \nfloor, it is an obvious marriage. On the one hand, we get the money to \nfirst responders. I have been pushing for public safety, for \nfirefighters, and for public health money so that we have the \nantibiotics and the vaccines, so people are trained, so that emergency \ndoctors are trained, so that our public health nurses are trained; food \nsafety; border security; airport security. At the same time, Senators, \nyou create jobs.\n  I don't really know what is going on here. I think there are probably \ntwo things.\n  No. 1, I think too many of my colleagues on the other side, by \ndefinition, with their objection, don't quite get this as an emergency.\n  No. 2, given what they want to do with all of these tax cuts, and \nrepeal corporate taxes going back to 1986, let me assume they are doing \nthis in good faith, because they always do it in good faith, in which \ncase I have to believe they believe in the same trickle-down economics \nwe have been through before, which put us in such desperate shape. We \nhave been through this trickle-down economic strategy, or philosophy, \nor policy. It left us with double-digit inflation, double-digit \ninterest rates, and an economy in shatters.\n  Paul Krugman in today's New York Times has an op-ed piece that makes \nthis point. I ask unanimous consent that his full op-ed piece be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 14, 2001]\n\n                          Other People's Money\n\n                           (By Paul Krugman)\n\n       You may have seen the story about the businessman who \n     allegedly used the attack on the World Trade Center to make \n     off with other people's money. According to his accusers, \n     Andrei Koudachev stole $105 million that had been invested \n     with his firm, falsely asserting that the sum had been lost \n     in the collapse of the towers. It's not entirely clear \n     whether he is accused of stealing the money before Sept. 11, \n     then using the disaster to cover his tracks, or of taking the \n     money after the fact; maybe both.\n       It's too bad that so many of our leaders are trying to pull \n     the same trick.\n       Just before Sept. 11, political debate was dominated by the \n     growing evidence that last spring's tax cut was not, in fact, \n     consistent with George W. Bush's pledge not to raid the \n     projected $2.7 trillion Social Security surplus. After the \n     attack, everyone dropped the subject. At this point, it seems \n     that nobody will complain as long as the budget as a whole \n     doesn't go into persistent deficit.\n       But two months into the war on terrorism, we're starting to \n     get a sense of how little this war will actually cost. And \n     it's time to start asking some hard questions.\n       At the beginning of the week we learned that the war is \n     currently costing around $1 billion per month. Oddly, this \n     was reported as if it were a lot of money. But it's only \n     about half of 1 percent of the federal budget. In monetary \n     terms, not only doesn't this look like World War II, it looks \n     trivial compared with the gulf war. No mystery there; how \n     hard is it for a superpower to tip the balance in the civil \n     war of a small, poor nation? At this rate, even five years of \n     war on terrorism would cost only $60 billion.\n       True, the terrorist attack has also forced increased \n     spending at home. But Mr. Bush has threatened to veto any \n     spending on domestic security beyond the $40 billion already \n     agreed. And even that sum is in doubt. Half of the $40 \n     billion was money promised to New York; last week New York's \n     Congressional delegation, Republicans and Democrats alike, \n     demanded that Mr. Bush disburse the full sum, openly voicing \n     doubt about whether he would honor his promise.\n       So the budgetary cost of the war on terrorism, abroad and \n     at home, looks like fairly small change. Even counting the \n     measures that are likely to pass despite Mr. Bush's threat, I \n     have a hard time coming up with a total cost that exceeds \n     $200 billion. Compare that with the $2.7 trillion Social \n     Security surplus. What will happen to the remaining $2.5 \n     trillion?\n       Again, no mystery: much of the money was actually gone \n     before Sept. 11, swallowed by last spring's tax cut, which \n     will in the end reduce revenue by around $1 trillion more \n     than the numbers you usually hear. And the administration's \n     allies in Congress are striving energetically to give away \n     the rest in tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy \n     individuals.\n       The new round of tax cuts is supposedly intended as post-\n     terror economic stimulus. But recent remarks by Dick Armey \n     give the game away. Defending the bill he and Tom DeLay \n     rammed through the House--the one that gives hug retroactive \n     tax cuts to big corporations--he asserted that it would \n     create 170,000 jobs next year. That would add a whopping 0.13 \n     percent to employment in this country. So thanks to Mr. \n     Armey's efforts next year's unemployment rate night be 6.4 \n     percent instead of 6.5. Aren't you thrilled?\n       Let's do the math here. This bill has a $100 billion price \n     tag in its first year, more than $200 billion over three \n     years. So even on Mr. Armey's self-justifying estimate, we're \n     talking about giving at least $600,000 inn corporate tax \n     breaks for every job created. That's trickle-down economics \n     without the trickle-down.\n       Ten weeks ago this bill, or the equally bad bill proposed \n     by Senate Republicans, wouldn't have stood a chance. But now \n     people who want to give the Social Security surplus to \n     campaign donors think they can get away with it, because they \n     can blame Osama bin Laden for future budget shortfalls.\n       They say every cloud has a silver lining. The dust cloud \n     that rose when the towers fell has certainly helped \n     politicians who don't want you to see what they're up to.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as he said:\n\n       The new round of tax cuts is supposedly intended as post-\n     terror economic stimulus. But recent remarks by Dick Armey \n     give the game away. Defending the bill he and Tom DeLay \n     rammed through the House--the one that gives huge retroactive \n     tax cuts to big corporations--he asserted that it would \n     create 170,000 jobs next year. That would add a whopping 0.13 \n     percent to employment in this country. So thanks to Mr. \n     Armey's efforts next year's unemployment rate might be 6.4 \n     percent instead of 6.5. Aren't you thrilled?\n       Let's do the math here. This bill has a $100 billion price \n     tag in its first year, more than $200 billion over three \n     years. So even on Mr. Armey's self-justifying estimate, we're \n     talking about giving at least $600,000 in corporate tax \n     breaks for every job created. That's trickle-down economics \n     without the trickle-down.\n\n  That is what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nproposing, trickle-down economics without the trickle down. At the same \ntime, they\n\n[[Page S11762]]\n\nare now trying to make the case that we don't have an emergency, so we \ncan't get an extension of unemployment benefits to people who are flat \non their backs, we can't make sure they have health care coverage for \ntheir families or for their children and their loved ones. They are \nprofoundly mistaken.\n  If these are the differences between Democrats and Republicans, then \nthese are differences that make a difference. I could not be prouder \nthan to stand out here on the floor and get a chance to be 1 of 100 \nMembers who get to speak for what we have proposed as an economic \nrecovery plan. It is not all that I would want--my colleagues know me; \nI always push for more and more and more--but I think it would make a \ndifference.\n  I am so profoundly disappointed that we have out here a procedural \nobjection.\n  My gosh, go to town and talk in the Cafe Wilmer or any number of \nother coffee shops in Minnesota. People say: Say what? There was a \nprocedural objection that this wasn't an emergency? Say what? But you \nknow that I don't have to explain that. Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle and those who support the Senator from Texas will have to \nexplain that.\n  I would like to finish with one other point. This is a small point. I \nsee my colleague from Iowa out here on the floor, and a Senator whom I \nlike so much that I will have to get into this with him as well.\n  I note that today there is a meeting of the ``bankruptcy reform'' \nconference committee. Colleagues and Senator Grassley, a good friend, \nbeing out of work is the No. 1 reason that people file for bankruptcy. \nMedical bills are the No. 2 reason. This is no time to be pushing \nthrough this bankruptcy bill, which is too punitive and too harsh and \nwhich will make it hard for people to rebuild their lives.\n  I always thought the credit card companies got way more than they \ndeserved. I never thought it was balanced. But this is no time, \ncolleagues, to push through a harsh bankruptcy bill in these economic \ntimes.\n  There are too many colleagues out here who want to speak. If I \ncontinue to go on, it could be for another 3 hours. So I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \ngiving me an opportunity to talk about bankruptcy. I haven't had a \nchance.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I want the floor back.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I haven't had that opportunity for a long time. By the \nway, I am supposed to be in the conference in 2 minutes. I am not going \nto be there because I want to respond to the Senator about not only \nbankruptcy but also about these tax provisions. That is to remind the \nSenate--particularly the 17 Members of the Senate, or maybe it was only \n15 Members of the Senate, including the Senator from Minnesota, who \nvoted against the bankruptcy bill. I hope a vote of 84 to 15, or \nsomething like that, tells you what a good piece of legislation we had.\n  But in regard to bankruptcy, to allay anybody's fears about what \nbankruptcy legislation does, even at a time when we are in the midst of \na war on terrorism, and we have had an economic downturn because of \nthat terrorist activity, anybody who cannot pay their debt will still \nbe able to go into bankruptcy.\n  What we are trying to do through this bankruptcy reform legislation \nthat is now in conference between the House and the Senate is for those \nwho have the ability to repay--who under present law can go into \nchapter 7 and get off scot-free--will have to pay.\n  We are talking about people with the ability to repay their debts and \nwho are gaming the system to get away with financial murder. They are \nnot going to be able to do that anymore.\n\n  In regard to the comments of the Senator from Minnesota and other \nSenators who have talked about the nonconcern people on this side of \nthe aisle might have about people who are unemployed because of the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, the whole purpose of this \nlegislation is to address economic problems that exist because of the \nterrorist attacks of September 11.\n  Where we have separation from people in the other political party is \nthe fact that a lot of people on the other side of the aisle are taking \nadvantage of the September 11 terrorist attacks, and also the economic \nproblems resulting therefrom, to put a lot of legislation on the agenda \nthat would not otherwise be on the agenda.\n  What we are trying to do is what Chairman Greenspan advises us to \ndo--to do those things that are stimulative and related to the downturn \nin the economy, directly related to the proposition of September 11.\n  First of all, I do not think the Senator from Minnesota gives the \nPresident any credit for being concerned about low-income people who \nare hurt as a result of this because in a way of addressing, in a \nbipartisan way, the stimulus needs of our Nation, the President has \nalready provided for tax payments, rebates, whatever you want to call \nthem, to low-income people to help the demand and consumer side of the \nledger. And, obviously, that proposal by our President that is in the \nRepublican proposal as well has somehow not come to the attention of \nthe Senator from Minnesota. So I bring that to his attention, that the \nPresident of the United States has already addressed that.\n  Second, we have followed the advice of Chairman Greenspan, who said \nthere ought to be incentives for investment in manufacturing. As the \nchart I showed you yesterday--that is not in this Chamber today--\nindicates, there has been a very steady increase in consumer spending \nover the last 10 years. Until recently, there was a very steady \nincrease in manufacturing investment. But in the last three or four \nquarters, there has been a tremendous downturn in investment in \nmanufacturing. Chairman Greenspan believes that by accelerating \ndepreciation, we will be able to create jobs, stimulate the \nmanufacturing economy, and get that segment of the economy back on the \nroad to recovery and create a lot of jobs in the process.\n  So, again, I do not think Republicans can be accused of not being \nsympathetic when we are following the advice of Chairman Greenspan on \nfiscal and tax policies. His point of view ought to be respected in \nthat area the same way a large share of the country respects his view \non monetary policy, as now 10 times he has reduced the rate of \ninflation to help the economy.\n  The Senator from Minnesota must also not be aware of the fact that \nour proposal has in it help for those who are going to lose health \ninsurance because of being unemployed. In fact, if you look at the \nDemocrat proposal, again, as I said yesterday, by the time they get \ntheir program implemented, we will be out of a recession. And, we have \na plan that will get help to the people who do not have health \ninsurance within 30 days after the bill is signed by the President of \nthe United States.\n  Their plan creates Federal bureaucracy, a new Federal program, \nFederal rules and regulations. Just think of the months it is going to \ntake to get all that in place. Plus, there is an unfunded mandate on \nthe States to put a parallel bureaucracy and program in place for the \npurpose of dispensing help to people who are unemployed but probably 9 \nto 12 months down the road.\n\n  We already have a program in place where we can get help to those \npeople within 1 month after the President signs the bill.\n  To say that we have no concern about the unemployed, then let me ask \nthe Senator from Minnesota, how come we have provisions in our bill to \nextend unemployment compensation by 13 weeks, which is not exactly, but \nis along the same lines of what their party suggests?\n  So all along there is a division that is being drawn between \nRepublicans and Democrats that is not the tradition of this Senate, \nsurely not the tradition of the Senate Finance Committee that writes \ntax legislation and unemployment and health-insurance-type legislation. \nThere is no point in having it because this Senate will get nothing \ndone unless it is done in a bipartisan way.\n  I hope we have set the stage for some votes this afternoon that will \nshow that this Senate is only going to address the stimulative needs of \nthis economy in a bipartisan way. The sooner we get that bipartisan \nprocess underway, the better. I think that will happen.\n\n[[Page S11763]]\n\n  (Mr. JOHNSON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. But I also want to address some remarks that were made \nyesterday by Senator Boxer regarding the Republican caucus stimulative \nproposal. Under normal circumstances, I would just let these types of \nremarks go unanswered as typical political rhetoric, tinged with \ninflammatory untruths. But these days are hardly normal circumstances \nbecause the Senate is not working in its usual bipartisan way. So I \nwant to respond to those remarks.\n  The American people have called upon us to act, both in the defense \nof our country and to restore our economy. Everyone in this Chamber \nrecognizes the impact of the horrific events of September 11 and their \nimpact on the economy.\n  Republicans and Democrats have different ideas on the best way to \nstimulate the economy. There is nothing new about this. They merely \nrepresent different approaches to the same problem.\n  For the past month and a half, I have been pleading with Democrats to \nfind the common ground in our differing approaches. The American people \nexpect us to work together to find common ground for our Nation's \ncommon good. Stimulating the economy and winning the war on terrorism \nis the most immediate. This can and must be done, and it will be done \nbefore we adjourn for this year.\n  But just when we hope that constructive bipartisanship can begin, it \nis slapped down by the type of accusations that were made yesterday by \nthe Senator from California. I would like to state what has been stated \nby Senator Boxer.\n  Senator Boxer said the Republican approach for stimulating the \neconomy was using the events of September 11 to--and I quote--``pay \nback'' its ``biggest contributors.''\n  She called the Republican approach ``nothing less than unpatriotic.''\n  As I said, normally I would dismiss such reckless remarks as typical \npolitics, designed to pit American against American to gain a political \nedge. But these are not normal times. These are times when Americans \nexpect us to work together.\n  What is truly shocking, and offensive for that matter, in the \nSenator's comments is that many items in the Republican Senate caucus \nproposal are items that were recommended by Chairman Greenspan, former \nTreasury Secretary Robert Rubin, or are included in Senator Baucus's \nDemocratic proposal.\n  Bonus depreciation, small business expensing, net operating loss \ncarrybacks, cash payments to taxpayers--tax rebates, if you want to \ncall them that--enhanced unemployment benefits, additional health \ninsurance coverage, are all areas that are contained in both a \nRepublican proposal and a Democrat proposal. These are areas of common \nground. So to call the Republican approach ``unpatriotic'' is \ndestructive. It is a distortion.\n  Most disturbing is the Senator's own admission that her accusations \nare baseless. When stating that the House economic stimulus bill was a \n``reward to their biggest contributors,'' Senator Boxer said--and I \nquote--``It is how I feel. It is my opinion. It's not a fact.''\n  This type of inflammatory rhetoric is useless. It does nothing to \nfurther America's economic recovery, and it does nothing to further a \nbipartisan solution, a solution that is absolutely necessary for the \nSenate to get to a final product.\n  I hope, for the sake of the American people, this sort of nonsense \nwill stop. It is time to put dignity back into the debates of the \nSenate Chamber.\n  Senator Boxer did have two specific objections to the House bill. It \nwas the House bill she objected to, not the Senate bill. The House bill \nis not the Republican Senate caucus proposal. They differ \nsignificantly, including with regard to two issues to which Senator \nBoxer objects. Nonetheless, when a Senator expresses concern about a \nlegislative proposal, the Senator's concerns should be addressed in a \nresponsible and dignified manner. That is what I would like to do.\n  Senator Boxer objected to accelerating the income tax cuts scheduled \nto occur in 2004 and 2006. She also objected to alternative minimum tax \nrelief for American businesses. I will explain why the Republican \ncaucus believes those issues are important to economic recovery.\n  One of the greatest weaknesses of Senator Baucus' stimulus package \nnow before the Senate is that not one dime, not one red cent, goes to \nprovide relief for people who go to work every day, pay their bills, \nand may be clinging to their jobs with their fingertips during this \neconomic downturn. We believe that reducing the Government's take from \nthese people's paychecks will give them more resources to ride out the \ncurrent economic downturn and will spur increased consumer demand over \nthe next year.\n  Besides, money spent by individuals in the private sector turns over \nmany times more in the economy and does more economic good than if \nspent here through the Federal budget. It is really just a matter of \ncommon sense, then. People need more of their money during tight \neconomic times. If they have more money available, they feel more \nfinancially secure and are more likely to spend.\n  We only are talking about speeding up a decision that Congress made \nearlier this year, a bill signed by the President June 7, a product of \nthe bipartisanship of the Senate Finance Committee. Last summer this \nSenate debated and decided the issue of individual income tax cuts. The \nRepublican caucus proposal would simply accelerate into next year the \nindividual income tax cuts that are currently scheduled to go into \neffect in the years 2004 and 2006.\n  If we make them effective next year, they will immediately stimulate \nthe economy. If we wait until 2004 and 2006, the economy does not \nbenefit from those reductions at a time when it must. That time is \nright now because of the terrorist attacks of September 11 and the \ndownturn in the economy.\n  We will talk more about individual income tax cuts later. I turn to \nSenator Boxer's primary objection--alternative minimum tax relief for \nAmerican businesses.\n  I would like to propose a terrible idea. Why don't we enact a \nprovision that increases taxes when companies are struggling to stay \nafloat and then reduces their taxes when the companies are profitable? \nI think my colleagues would agree that sounds like a dumb idea. I would \noffer an amendment on this, but the problem is, we have already enacted \nit. It is what we call the alternative minimum tax.\n  Republicans have been vilified by Democrats for including AMT repeal \nin an economic stimulus package. Let's ask the question: Why do we \ninclude corporate AMT in an economic stimulus package? Because \ncorporate AMT worsens an economic downturn when it increases taxes as \ncorporate profits decline.\n\n  Explain that again. If that doesn't sound reasonable, it isn't \nreasonable. But that is what the law is, because AMT, the alternative \nminimum tax, is imposed only when the AMT tax exceeds the amount of \nregular corporate income tax. AMT is calculated by starting with \nregular taxable income and then adding back certain deductions that \nwere taken in computing the regular taxable income. One of the most \nsignificant deduction add-backs is depreciation.\n  Consider this very simple example. If regular taxable income falls to \nzero, then a depreciation add-back will create alternative minimum tax \ntaxable income which will be taxed at the AMT rate of 20 percent, even \nthough the company owes no regular income tax.\n  Regular income tax does not have to fall to zero for this to occur. \nWhen investment costs and other expenses increase in proportion to a \ncompany's taxable income, which occurs during an economic downturn, the \ncompany may still owe alternative minimum tax.\n  Companies that have these higher fixed costs include manufacturing, \nconstruction, mining, energy, utilities, wholesale/retail, \ntransportation, agriculture, and other capital intensive industries.\n  In 1997, a study for the Brookings Institution concluded that \nmanufacturing firms could be subjected to alternative minimum tax when \ntheir sales decline by just a mere 5 percent. This was largely because \nof higher fixed costs. So one can see the profound effect that a small \neconomic downturn has on increasing corporate AMT.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has recommended that the corporate \nalternative minimum tax be repealed because it is ineffective and \ninefficient.\n  With the Joint Committee on Taxation are professional people who work\n\n[[Page S11764]]\n\nfor both Republicans and Democrats. They don't work for the majority. \nThey don't work for the minority. They work for the Congress as a \nwhole. This is their recommendation.\n  So now you may ask: How would repealing the AMT have a stimulative \neffect? The answer is simple: The alternative minimum tax is a job \nkiller. The alternative minimum tax creates a strong disincentive for \ncompanies to undertake new investments or to keep employees on the \npayroll. Any activity that reduces a company's regular taxable income, \nsuch as keeping employees during an economic downturn, increases the \nlikelihood of it becoming subject to the alternative minimum tax.\n  This is because as regular income decreases, the AMT add-backs become \nlarger as a percentage of regular income. As I said, when investment \ncosts and other expenses are large relative to a company's taxable \nincome, the company may end up owing alternative minimum tax. This is \nparticularly true for capital investments, which may throw off \ndepreciation deductions. In fact, increased investment expenditures by \na company during periods of low profitability can cause a company to \nswitch from the regular tax to the alternative minimum tax. Therefore, \ncompanies that try to maintain a constant level of investment and \ncontinued employment during an economic downturn are more likely to pay \nlarger amounts of AMT. That is why the alternative minimum tax is a job \nkiller.\n  We want to create jobs. Particularly we want to create jobs and we \nhave a Government incentive for increasing jobs at a time of economic \ndownturn.\n  More importantly, the alternative minimum tax increases the tax \nburden during an economic downturn which may result in deeper and more \nprolonged economic weakness by reducing business activity.\n  So here we have a tax policy already in place that is making the \neconomic downturn worse. According to a recent Treasury study, during \nthe economic slowdowns between 1989 and 1991, nearly 50 percent of \nAmerica's largest corporations were subjected to the alternative \nminimum tax. We can't afford to repeat that pattern again.\n  As Chairman Greenspan said: Enhance investment in manufacturing.\n  That is what accelerated depreciation is about. So that is why we \nhave to do something with a tax policy that is already on the books and \nalready is there exacerbating an already bad situation. So please keep \nin mind that some alternative minimum tax add-back items, such as \ndepreciation, relate to fixed investment decisions that were made years \nago during profitable periods. They didn't anticipate what they might \nbe in right now. But they are going to be penalized for it and \npenalized in a way that hurts the economy.\n  It is inconsistent, then, to consider including bonus depreciation \nprovisions in our stimulus packages, which we do, at the same time we \npunish prior investments through the AMT. I notice that the Democrats' \nbill exempts bonus depreciation from the alternative minimum tax. So I \ndon't know why a Democrat Senator would blast away at the alternative \nminimum tax, when even their proposal makes it quite obvious that there \nis something that doesn't add up here, doesn't meet the test of common \nsense.\n  So Democrats recognize the counterproductive effect that the \nalternative minimum tax has on investment. I also said that the \nalternative minimum tax increases taxes when companies are struggling \nto stay afloat, and then it reduces taxes when companies are \nprofitable. This is because any alternative minimum tax paid to the \nGovernment today may offset regular taxes owed in a later year. In \neffect, the AMT is a prepayment of a taxpayer's future income tax \nliability--and it operates as a no-interest loan from companies to the \nFederal Government.\n  As of today, companies in America have made about $25 billion in \nloans to the Federal Government by prepaying their real tax liability \nthrough the alternative minimum tax. This is where the controversy \nkicked up concerning the House bill, and it is the thing to which \nSenator Boxer most objected.\n  The House bill--not the Senate Republican bill--paid back in the year \n2002 all of the alternative minimum tax prepayments that I just talked \nabout, these interest-free loans that have been extracted from American \ncompanies over the years.\n  The reason for this is to provide instant cash liquidity for \ncompanies that are facing the present economic crunch. We would propose \nsomething different. Senate Republicans would allow the alternative \nminimum tax to offset only a percentage of the regular tax as it is \nincurred. That way a corporation can never completely zero out their \ntax liability with AMT credits. So I hope she will consider this and \nthat this will address Senator Boxer's concerns.\n  In addition, we would not accelerate the AMT tax credits or refund \nthem next year. This should address another one of Senator Boxer's \nconcerns. Yes, we would also repeal the alternative minimum tax, and I \nknow that doesn't satisfy some Senators. I hope these other two \nprovisions of our bill would do.\n  If Senators will stop the shouting and stop talking past each other \nand stop making false accusations, we can find common ground to address \nat least part of each other's concerns. It is possible to reach \nconsensus on a bipartisan bill that will stimulate the economy. We must \ndo it soon.\n  I urge the Senate to do its job and come up with a bipartisan \nstimulus package--one that can be passed by this Chamber, sent to \nconference, and signed by the President. The American people are \nwaiting and they are watching.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I agree with our esteemed colleague who \njust spoke that, in fact, the American people are watching us very \nclosely today to determine whether or not we understand the emergency \nthat so many workers and small businesses and others in our economy are \nexperiencing at this moment. All we have to do is ask the people who \nhave lost their jobs in the airlines alone. We had an emergency in \nwhich we had to act immediately to help the airline industry a few days \nafter September 11. We rallied to do that, with the understanding--at \nleast it was my understanding--that we would come back quickly and make \nsure that not only the companies were helped to the tune of $15 \nbillion, but that the workers with the airlines and the airports would \nbe helped.\n  So all you have to do is ask the people who have been unemployed as a \nresult of September 11, or other economic circumstances, who work for \nthe airlines, the travel agents, the airport venders, the restaurants, \nand the travel destination cities that have been hurt. All we have to \ndo in Michigan is ask our auto workers, who have found that because of \nthe slowdown they are facing layoffs, or have been laid off--and also \nthe small businessowners in Michigan, as well as Michigan farmers.\n  I congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee for his \nleadership and work in putting together, with Senator Baucus and \nSenator Byrd, a package that makes sense for Americans, for American \nbusiness, for American workers, for our communities. But we know that, \nfrankly, there are two different views of the world at work. We have, \nfirst of all, one world that brings us all together behind the \nPresident to face the current challenges and threats to our country. We \nare together on that. I support the President and want him to succeed, \nas we all need to succeed together. But on the economic front, on the \nhomefront, we have two different views of the world that have been \nexpressed, both in this Chamber and between those of us who support the \nlegislation in front of us and the House Republicans on the other side.\n  Frankly, they are very different kinds of economics. One is supply \nside economics; give the dollars to those at the top, the largest \nbusinesses, the wealthy individuals in the country, and it will trickle \ndown. We say we don't have time for trickle down. We don't even know if \nit is going to trickle down. I have folks in Michigan still waiting for \nthe 1980s money to trickle down to them. We say put money directly into \npeople's pockets, small businesses, the farmers, the unemployed \nworkers, and the moderate and low-income taxpayers' pockets.\n  We are backed up by those who say this is the right thing to do \neconomically. I think we have the best of all\n\n[[Page S11765]]\n\nworlds in this proposal. It is the best thing to do economically and it \nis the right thing to do for people. Joseph Stiglitz, the cowinner of \nthe 2001 Nobel Prize in economics, stated:\n\n       We should extend the duration and magnitude of the benefits \n     we provide to our unemployed. This is not only the fairest \n     proposal, but it is also the most effective. People who \n     become unemployed cut back on their expenditures. Giving them \n     more money will directly increase their expenditures.\n\n  Common sense. What is more likely to happen? To give the billions of \ndollars to the major corporations, which the House does through the \nalternative minimum tax--and I have a different view of what the \nalternative minimum tax is about. My understanding is that it was put \nin place to guarantee that everybody, regardless of how wealthy they \nare or how many tax credits or deductions they can take, pays some form \nof contribution--contributions to national defense, to public health \nand safety, to education, to public services. The alternative minimum \ntax says that everybody in America ought to make a contribution.\n  The House Republicans say that not only should some folks not have to \nmake a contribution to our current national defense cost, or \nbioterrorism cost, or efforts to clean up from terrorist attacks, or \neducation, or roads, or health care, and all of the other public \nservices that we have; we should retroactively pay them for 15 years. \nThere is over $45 billion involved in the proposal on the House side, \nand it goes to two major tax cuts, one of which, the AMT, says not only \nare we going to take away your tax liability in the future, but we do \nnot think you should have paid anything in the past either, and we are \ngoing to retroactively, to the tune of billions of dollars, give you \nback your contributions.\n\n  I have a lot of small businesses, a lot of farmers, a lot of auto \nworkers, retailers, service industry folks, waiters, waitresses, all \nkinds of hard-working folks in Michigan who would love to have someone \ntell them: We are going to give you back the taxes you paid for the \nlast 15 years.\n  Nationwide, nearly 7 million people are now unemployed. Unemployment \nin my State of Michigan now totals over 268,000 people, and those are \nnot even the most current numbers as of November. That is a jump of \n74,000 people in the last year and a jump of nearly 30,000 people just \nsince July.\n  This is an emergency for them. This is an emergency for 268,000 \npeople, many of whom have children for whom they are caring. They want \nto make sure their children have what they need and that their families \ncan put food on the table, have the health care they need and that \ntheir children have the resources to go to school, possibly pay for mom \nand dad who need some help in their older years. These are people who \nhave worked hard and believe in the American dream and are now counting \non us to believe in them and act in a way that shows they are a \npriority.\n  Our plan is the best economically, and it is the right thing to do. \nWe help these families by extending unemployment benefits so they can \nbuy groceries and pay their bills. It will provide health insurance, \nwhich has been talked about today, by helping pay for COBRA to continue \nhealth insurance, and we expand assistance to States through the \nMedicaid Program.\n  Consumer spending represents two-thirds of our gross domestic \nproduct. Any stimulus package that ignores this crucial section of our \neconomy is doomed to fail. Every economist about whom I have been \nreading and talking to has said the same thing: It is consumer \nspending, stupid. That means we have to put money in people's pockets \nso they can turn around and spend that on behalf of their daily needs.\n  It is consumers who are going to buy airline tickets, computers, \ncars, clothes, and, I might say, coming from the great State of \nMichigan, we hope they buy a lot of cars. It is consumers who are going \nto go out to dinner, see a movie, and help get things back to normal, \nas the President has asked us to do.\n  Unfortunately, the bill passed by the House and endorsed by the \nPresident does little to stimulate the economy or to help the \nunemployed. It does little to energize the consumer sector of our \neconomy. It does little to help our small businesses that are too often \noverlooked as tax policy is made and as other policies are determined.\n  The House-passed bill overwhelmingly and unfairly gives tax cuts to \nthose, frankly, who are not hurting under this economy: the wealthiest \nAmericans who do not have an economic emergency, and tax cuts to the \nlargest multinational companies that we want to be successful but not \nat the expense of our small businesses or our working men and women.\n  I congratulate Senator Byrd and my colleagues who have been working \nto increase our public investments in our homeland security efforts. We \nall know we have to focus investments on bioterrorism. We have to \nstrengthen our public health system. We need to focus on those areas \nthat will keep us safe at home, as well as supporting our national \ndefense abroad.\n\n  I encourage and urge all Senators to come together to look at the \nfacts, to look at what works, look at what the economists are saying as \nto how best to provide an economic stimulus and recovery, to put the \npeople of our country first as we move forward, and to do so quickly.\n  This is an emergency. This is an emergency for American families. \nThis is an emergency for Americans, and we need to act quickly to \ndemonstrate that we understand and that we support them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, we are \nworking to have a vote around 5:15 p.m. or 5:30 p.m. If Senators want \nto speak, they should come to the Chamber. That is the general \nintention at this time. If anyone objects, they should let us know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is interesting to listen to our friends \non the other side of the aisle. It is amazing the message we get. The \nmessage is: Let's get a bill; we need to do it right away. Everyone \nagrees with that. We know what needs to be done to get a bill. I happen \nto be on the committee that is involved, and we know how the bill got \nto this point. It passed entirely with a partisan vote, all Democrats, \nno Republicans. Republicans did not have participation in the bill. So \nthis is a bill that is totally partisan. That bill is not going to \npass.\n  We need to work on a bill together. There is willingness to do that. \nTalking about passing a bill without recognizing what needs to be done \nis amazing to me. It is clear what has to be done.\n  Senators from both sides of the aisle need to join with the \nadministration and, indeed, with the Members of the House to put \ntogether a bill which we can pass. This business of continuing to talk \nabout the need and then denying the opportunity to get together is hard \nto understand.\n  Everybody here wants to pass a bill. There is no question about that. \nThe question is, How do we do it? And that becomes increasingly clear. \nThere are not going to be enough votes to do it without working \ntogether. This constant conversation about we need to do this right \naway is silly. We all want to do something to help the unemployed. We \nall want to do something for those who need help with health care.\n  We all want to provide more incentives to develop jobs.\n  Talk about an emergency. How much have we spent in the last 2 months? \nAbout $55 billion. The President has said: You do not need to spend \nmore money now. When we need more money for terrorism overseas or \nterrorism in this country, I will ask for it. And we responded when he \nasked for the money. Colleagues are now beginning to use that technique \nfor passing all kinds of projects they always wanted. They are very \nquestionable as far as being an emergency.\n  We need to come together and bring before the Senate a bill that \nrepresents the interests of all participating parties and pass it. We \ncan do that. Until that time comes, the chances are we are not going to \nbe successful in moving a bill along.\n  The substitute, of course, spends about $67 billion in the year 2002: \nAbout $21 billion on temporary business tax relief and $46 billion on \nspending proposals, including Federal payments of individual tax \ninsurance premiums\n\n[[Page S11766]]\n\nunder COBRA, extended unemployment insurance for displaced workers, \nexpanded Federal support for Amtrak, numerous agricultural products, \nand other unrelated provisions.\n  Secretary O'Neill recently said the proposal is heavy on spending but \nwill have little stimulative effect on the economy.\n  Moreover, some of its provisions would have an adverse effect on \nemployment. An editorial yesterday in the Washington Post made the \nfollowing observation: The stimulus package that passed through the \ncommittee last week includes money for citrus growers and buffalo \nfarmers producing electricity from chicken waste. It includes a tax \nbreak in aviation fuel for crop dusters; a wage credit designed to \nencourage firms to hire welfare recipients was extended to businesses \nin Lower Manhattan.\n  So we all want to get this bill passed, and I think we have a \ntechnique before us where we can do that. We can come together and we \ncan configure a package that does what all of us want, and that is to \nassist those people who now need assistance and provide stimulus for \nthe economy so we can get jobs and growth back before us and to do it \nquickly. Those options are available to us as soon as we are willing to \nrecognize what needs to be done to cause that to happen.\n  The President has called upon the Congress, specifically the Senate, \nto adopt an economic package, including these kinds of things in the \noutline.\n  Timing: We need to pass it and get it to his desk, the President \nsaid, before the end of November. We can do that.\n  Tax cuts: We make sure our tax relief encourages investment, \nencourages the flow of capital.\n  We need to reform the alternative minimum tax in corporate America so \ncorporate America does not have to get penalized during times of \ndeclining earnings.\n  Create jobs: So often I do not think we really look down the road as \nto what we want to be the outcome. If we can help people, we should, \nbut the real purpose is to create jobs and to create a stronger \neconomy.\n  Worker assistance: The President said we need to spend money on \nhelping workers who lost their jobs as a result of the attacks on \nSeptember 11. We need to extend and expand unemployment benefits to \nthose workers, said the President. I know we need to expand what they \ncall national emergency grants which will give the Governors the \nlatitude to take Federal monies and apply the money to special worker \nneeds.\n  We need an energy plan that encourages conservation, exploration, and \nproduction. That probably brings about a kick to the economy more \nquickly than most anything else we can do.\n  So these are the issues that have already been talked about, and they \nare common. We have a bill that is passed by one party without \nconsultation with the other. And we expect to get that passed? It is \nnot going to happen.\n  We can do something, and we can do something with the House if we can \ncome together and put together a plan where there is some involvement, \nbring it to the Senate to pass it and pass it quickly so we can move \nforward to accomplish that which all of us want to accomplish.\n  I see the minority leader in the Chamber, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, who has control of the time on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not under a time control situation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I do want to comment on a couple of issues. First of all, I want to \ntalk about the job security stimulus package. Before I do that, I want \nto talk about the aviation security package that is being considered \nnow in conference.\n  My point has been all along there is plenty of room for disagreement, \nbut there is also plenty of room for agreement. We need to get this \ndone. We knew we had to get this done before this past Monday when we \nhad the crash, very unfortunately, in New York again. We cannot help \nbut have such sympathy and concern and feeling for the people of New \nYork who have been hit hard again. There are no indications as to \nexactly what caused that accident, but it did once again cause people \nto be sensitive and nervous about the safety of flying.\n  We in the Congress need to put aside our ideological or even regional \ndisagreements because some of it is a little bit regional. In some \nparts of the country our airports are all small, regional airports, not \nthe super big ones. We have a little different view of the world than \nthey might have in Chicago or New York or Los Angeles. We ought to put \nthat aside and get this job done. I believe I see movement now, that \nboth sides are beginning to say there is a way we can get this package \nagreed to.\n  First of all, there is a misperception. We are going to federalize \naviation security, period. There is a matter of degrees perhaps, but we \nare going to require perimeter protection. We are going to require \nthere be a safe and a good screening provision at all of our airports. \nWe are going to require there be an additional check at the gate. We \nare going to require cockpit safety. We are going to have sky marshals, \nand the Federal Government is going to require it and provide the money \nthrough a fee system that will be paid for by tickets. We are going to \nsay this is what our requirements are, these are the guidelines, this \nis the management. We are going to make this happen.\n  The House added several provisions that were good, and we had some \ngood ones in the Senate, by the way, that are not in the House \nprovisions. We ought to take the good ones from both of those bills. \nThe House added some provisions we did not have only because they acted \n3 weeks after we did and they found some additional problems and some \nadditional things that could be done which they included in their \npackage. Let's take those. I believe Senator Hollings, as well as \nSenator McCain and Senator Hutchison, are prepared to do that.\n  Then it boils down to this question of how do you deal with the \nscreeners themselves. I believe from discussions I have had today with \nthose who are involved, they are beginning to come up with a way that \nwould allow us to move immediately to some changes but give some \noptions, some flexibility, to the administration and to the individual \nairports. What they want in Billings may be different from what we want \nin Biloxi and Gulfport, MS. What they want at LaGuardia may surely be \ndifferent than what they want in Rapid City, SD. Give some options.\n  In some places, they may want and have the ability to do local law \nenforcement. The next place maybe a private company has been doing a \ngood job or they have the capability to do a good job. In other areas \nthey may need to go to a federalized system.\n\n  I do not know all the parameters of what is being discussed, but in \nmy conversations today with Senator Hollings and Congressman Young, the \nchairman in the House, Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison, I believe \nthey have narrowed it down to where we can get this done. So I would \nurge our conferees and the leadership of those conferees, in a \nbipartisan way, in a nonpartisan way, to get an agreement. It is doable \ntoday and the Senate could vote tomorrow.\n  That would be such a tremendous indication to the American people we \nare serious, that we are continuing our efforts as we have over the \npast 2 months to get the job done for America. Forget the philosophy, \nthe party, the region, any of that other stuff we quite often get \ntangled up with. It would be so important to send this bill to the \nPresident's desk the weekend before the Thanksgiving holidays.\n  Will it guarantee there will be immediate safety within the limits of \nhuman endeavor? No. But it would be a positive sign that would be well \nreceived, and it is the right thing to do.\n  I think that kind of attitude also applies to this job security or \nstimulus bill, as it is quite often referred to. On this bill we have \nkind of fallen back to our old ways. We have the House position. We \nhave the Senate position. We have the Republican position. We have the \nDemocrat position. We have the spending position. We have lots of \nwonderful ideas. We have the tax cut provisions.\n  What we have is such a hodgepodge and such a weighted bill now that \nit is not going to happen. What we need to do is go back to the \nbeginning. We all agreed there should be a package to stimulate \neconomic growth and job security. The President, Republicans,\n\n[[Page S11767]]\n\nDemocrats, the House, the Senate, we all said, yes, we need to get this \ndone.\n  Will it be a magic wave of the wand to make sure we have that growth? \nNo. But it could be helpful.\n  We agreed we wanted it to be a targeted bill, one that would have \nsome immediate positive effect on growth, not 6 months from now, not a \nyear from now, but right now. When we started off, I thought everybody \nagreed on that provision.\n  We also said we do not want to do something that is going to be \nnegative in the long term. We do not want to do something that gobbles \nup a big swath of money, taking us deeper into deficit spending after 3 \nyears of having balanced budgets and surpluses, and cause interest \nrates in the long term to go back up. We all agreed we did not want to \ndo that, and we all agreed we wanted to do it in a way that would have \nan immediate stimulative effect. We kind of lost sight of that.\n  I do not want to be too critical of the House bill, but a lot of what \nthey would do would take effect over a period of years. I like that, \npersonally, but that is not quite exactly what we had talked about when \nwe started.\n\n  In the Finance Committee we got carried away with a lot of spending. \nThere are not many people going to be able to convince anybody that it \nis going to have an immediate stimulative effect. It may be \njustifiable. It may be something I would be for in the normal course of \nevents. But it does not meet the criteria we started out talking about.\n  I have never heard so many good ideas in my life. Oh, my goodness, \nyes, let's do this, let's do that. Every House Member has a different \nidea of what we could do to help this sector or that sector of the \neconomy. It wouldn't cost too much, it would only be a billion here and \na billion there and, as Everett Dirksen would say, soon it adds up to \nreal money. That is what we have come to.\n  We need to go back to the beginning and do specifically what we said \nwe would do. We have to do the human need things. We have to provide \nmore unemployment compensation. We are going to do that. The Democrats \nneed to understand we understand that. We are going to do that. We can \nargue over exactly how you do it, but it is going to be 13 weeks \nadditional unemployment compensation. The conferees, I am sure, will \nargue about how that would apply to the States and what criteria have \nto be met before that happens, and they will work it out. It is a 15-\nminute discussion, truthfully.\n  We are going to make sure people who lost their jobs are going to \nhave health insurance coverage. There are about three different good \nplans out there to be considered. We do not like creating a new \nmandatory health program in COBRA. We don't like that because we think, \nwhile it might start off well intentioned and small, it will explode to \na massive program. But there are some other options suggested by the \ncentrist group, suggested by the President, suggested by Chuck \nGrassley, the ranking member of the committee. We can work through \nthat. But the important point is we are going to get that done. We have \nto get that done.\n  We are going to have rebates for the low-income workers who did not \nget the rebate in the earlier round this year. I personally think that \nis not a good idea. I didn't like it earlier, to tell you the truth, \nbecause I doubt the positive impact that it really has in terms of a \nstimulus in the economy. I think a lot of people will save it, pay down \ntheir credit cards. The argument is, maybe the lower income people will \nneed it and spend it at Christmastime and all that. Maybe it will work. \nBut there is no use debating that because that is agreed to. We are \ngoing to do that. The President has agreed to that. Democrats want it, \nRepublicans agree to it, so why are we fussing around about it? It is a \ndone deal.\n  Those are the three things the Democrats say they care about the \nmost. Republicans say we understand and we are going to have to do \nthose three things. We are going to have to allow the tax committee \nworkers to work out the details. But I trust them. Senator Daschle and \nI have talked about this. I have talked to the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus from Montana, and Chuck Grassley. I have \nfaith they are going to work this out.\n  On our side of the aisle, we would argue that while that is the right \nthing to do, it is the human thing to do, it is not really that \nstimulative in terms of getting more than a dollar back for a dollar \ninvested. So we need to do that which will have an immediate and \ndramatic impact on the economy. Yes, we do talk about tax relief. We \ntalk about individual tax rate cuts. We talk about the importance of \nthe accelerated depreciation for companies to write off the cost of \ntheir equipment faster.\n\n  By the way, I think Democrats agree to that, too. The difference is \nthe Democrats say we want to do it at 10 percent over 2 years. \nRepublicans say we want a 30-percent bonus over 3 years. Is there a \nmiddle ground in there anywhere? Does anybody see it? Of course. So if \nwe agree on the basic principle, then we have to work through the \npercentages and number of years. We can do that.\n  I do think--I have always thought--the alternative minimum tax is \ncounterproductive, counterstimulative, and does undermine the capital \nformation we need to have invested in the economy.\n  It may not be the perfect answer. Maybe there is another good idea \nout there. I think Senator Domenici has an interesting idea with regard \nto the December holiday on the payroll tax. I am not saying that should \nbe in there. It is not one that was considered, I don't think, by the \ncommittee, but maybe there is another brilliant idea out there \nsomewhere. I think we ought to go for those basics, though, and get \nthis job done and try not to do any damage, try to have some positive \neffect, and get it done.\n  Others have suggested we need additional spending, homeland security. \nA lot of what is in that bill we may eventually do. We may need to do \nit at some point. It hasn't been requested by the administration and \nhasn't even been analyzed by the committees of jurisdiction, \nauthorization or appropriations. To come in here and attach that to the \nstimulus and say this is going to stimulate growth in the economy \nbecause it would spend money somewhere down the line doesn't meet the \nbasic principles with which we started. Some of the features to which I \nwas most attracted I understand have even been taken out.\n  So I think we need to do it.\n  There has been discussion that Senator Daschle legitimately does not \nwant to have to negotiate a package on the floor of the Senate and then \ngo do another one in conference and then maybe do a third one with the \nadministration. Let's skip all that. We are not going to get a result \nhere in the Senate as we are now set up. This is partisan, political. \nIt is not bipartisan. It is not in the spirit in which we have been \nworking in the last 2 months. We need to take a timeout and say, all \nright, let's skip all these hurdles and let's go right to the end game. \nLet's get the right people in the room and say: Get this job done.\n  I trust the people who would be involved. I trust Charlie Rangel. I \ntrust Bill Thompson and Max Baucus and Chuck Grassley. They are the \nexperts. They have done it before. Last year I negotiated on a bill \ninvolving the CBI enhancement and the African free trade bill with \nCharlie Rangel and Bill Archer, and we got it done. A lot of people \nsaid it would never happen: You will never make that happen; it is \nimpossible. Max Baucus was involved in that effort, and others. We got \nit done.\n  So I think the idea we would go ahead and go to this, the conference \neffort after these two votes this afternoon, is the right thing to do. \nThe American people, would they be hearing the Senate is deadlocked? \nNo, that is not what they would hear. What they would see and what they \nwould hear is the Congress once again is going to the bottom line to \ncome together on the right thing for America. Yes, they stated their \npartisan political positions and they were beginning to drift back to \ntheir old ways, but then they said no, we pulled back from the brink \nand brinkmanship and said we are going to go to negotiations that will \nget us a package.\n\n  As we are headed right now, none of this is going to pass. We are \nstalled out here. We could have 20 or 25 votes by Friday and have \nnothing but blood all over the place and partisanship to the\n\n[[Page S11768]]\n\nmaximum degree. Is that what the American people want? No.\n  Do they want us to find a way to come together and get a result? Yes. \nIs it going to immediately provide this great boost to the economy? I \ndon't know. It may not. But psychologically it would help and \nsubstantively I believe it could help.\n  So when we have these two votes, I hope, and I call on my colleagues, \nlet's not make this an emergency designation. This is a stimulus \npackage. Let's not waive the points of order. Let's go to negotiation. \nLet's get it started. Let's get it started tonight.\n  I want to say--and I don't want to get him in trouble--Senator \nDaschle has been very reasonable and I think willing to pursue this \ntype of approach. So have all the other players. That is what we have \nto have. It is a bold move. It does take leadership.\n  But why are we here? To stake out positions? To prevail in partisan \nbattle? There will be another day for that. I hope it is a long time \noff. Let's continue to do business the way we have done in the past, \nthe way we have dealt with each other, the way we have met with each \nother, the way we have tried to bridge the partisan and the political \ngap because of the tragedies with which we have had to deal. We have \nthat opportunity here once again. Let's keep it going. I think we can \nbe successful if we use that approach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:15 \np.m. today the Senate proceed to vote on the Baucus motion to waive the \nrelevant sections of the Budget Act with respect to the emergency \ndesignation, without intervening action or debate; provided further \nthat at 4:55 p.m., the following each receive 5 minutes of closing \ndebate, and in the order listed: Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Lott, and Senator Daschle, or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to address this legislation \nof great importance to my State, to my city, and of great importance to \nAmerica. Before the substance of my remarks, I would particularly like \nto thank Senator Baucus, chairman of the committee, Senator Byrd, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Reid--all of the leadership and all our \ncolleagues who have stood up for New York and for America in our hour \nof need.\n  I would like to speak to the part of the legislation that affects New \nYork. Then I would like to talk generally about the bill as well.\n  Before I do, I would like to address the specific vote that we face \nimmediately; that is, the point of order as to whether we are in an \nemergency or not.\n  Am I dreaming? Are we debating whether America is in an emergency \nsituation? Are we wondering whether our troops are overseas fighting \nfor what could be if we did nothing the survival of this Nation?\n  No emergency? Tell that to the people of my city who are recovering \nfrom the most devastating attack America has ever faced.\n  No emergency? Tell that to anyone who goes to an airport and sees the \nairport mostly empty and to the millions of others who will not fly.\n  No emergency? Tell that to the people who live near our nuclear \npowerplants and are worried about what might happen there.\n  No emergency? It is almost as if we came together after Pearl Harbor \nand said there is no emergency.\n  America has been attacked. We are in a brand new situation where \nevery one of us is on the front lines because terrorists can use \ntechnology to attack every one of us.\n  I remember Secretary Rumsfeld saying that in this war more civilians \nwill die than military personnel because of terrorism.\n  No emergency? Good morning. Am I dreaming? Am I dreaming that we are \ndebating whether there is an emergency and that many will vote for the \nfact that we are not in an emergency in America? If this is not an \nemergency, what is?\n  We have been attacked. Our whole nation is changing. People are \nafraid. The economy is tied in a knot because people do not want to go \nout and do the things they took for granted before September 11. I hope \nwe are not going to fiddle while Rome burns.\n  That seems to be what the other side is saying. They can make a whole \nlot of arguments about the proposal with which Senator Baucus has led \nthe Finance Committee. I will disagree with many of them. I might agree \nwith some of them. But I don't know who on God's Earth thinks we are \nnot in the middle of an emergency. It is just utterly amazing.\n  I would like each person who votes at 5 o'clock that we are not in an \nemergency situation to go home and explain it. I would like them to \nexplain it to my constituents in New York City and Rockaway. I would \nlike them to explain it to the millions of Americans who are afraid to \nwalk into tall buildings or go over a bridge or take an airplane ride.\n  No emergency? Who are we kidding?\n  If there were ever a time when people in the rest of the country were \ngoing to scratch their heads and say there must be something in the \nwater in Washington because if we ask for this vote, it might seem as \nif the only 100 people, or 51 people in the country who do not think \nthis is an emergency are in this great Senate of the United States.\n  We are certainly in an emergency. It is a far greater emergency than \nall the rest of the emergency spending bills that I have voted for in \nmy 21 years in this Congress. When we have a flood, there is emergency \nspending. When we have a hurricane, there is emergency spending. When \nwe have earthquakes, there is emergency spending. And when terrorists \nand cowardly people take two airplanes and plunge them into the World \nTrade Center, and another and plunge it into the Pentagon, and a fourth \nthat we didn't know where it was, and then for weeks there is anthrax \nand we can't go back to our office buildings and in every corner of \nAmerica people are afraid to open up the mail, we do not have an \nemergency?\n\n  Good morning. Go talk to your constituents. Go look at the numbers. \nThere is certainly an emergency.\n  I think it is an ultimate act of political trickery almost--certainly \nconvolution--to say there is not an emergency. Is there a Member of \nthis body who has not voted for emergency spending when there was an \nemergency?\n  Sometimes you just stop and think and say: What is happening? Why is \nthere a disconnect between Washington and the rest of America? It is \nbecause sometimes perhaps too many get carried away with their own \nwords and their own ideological beliefs, and they end up with the \nconclusion that is patently ridiculous. It is patently ridiculous to \nvote on a bill that has been designed to help our country in one of its \nmost troubled times and say there is not an emergency.\n  Let me talk about two other parts of the bill.\n  Again, I thank Senator Baucus and all the members of the Finance \nCommittee. I thank Senator Daschle and Senator Reid. I thank all of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who understand that New York is \ncertainly in an emergency.\n  Despite our confidence that this nightmare will soon be over, New \nYorkers are uncertain about the future. Very few Americans believe our \ncity is off the terrorist list, and this belief is beginning to take a \nsevere toll on our economy. Yesterday, tragedy--whether it was accident \nor not--rekindled that anxiety.\n  With Chairman Byrd and Senator Daschle at the helm, and with the \nbroad support from our Senate colleagues and the great job being done \nby our colleagues in the House, Republicans and Democrats, I am \nconfident that we will ultimately get the disaster aid needed to begin \nto rebuild our damaged and destroyed infrastructure. I thank all of \nthem for that support. But that is for a later discussion.\n  What I am here to talk about today is the need for the tax provisions \nfor New York that Chairman Baucus has included in his economic stimulus \npackage. These provisions are designed to counter the uncertainty and \nfear that we believe may lead companies to walk away from us.\n  Mayor Giuliani, the architect of New York's renaissance in the 1990s, \nand now the hero in the eyes of so many in this Nation, will tell \nanyone who will\n\n[[Page S11769]]\n\nask that the key to the city's economic revival begins and ends with \nthe safety and the people's confidence that the city is a safe place to \nlive and work.\n  His great city is now threatened not by petty criminals but by mad \nmen half a world away hiding in caves while murdering innocent men, \nwomen, and children. This uncertainty and the fear coupled with the \nsheer magnitude of logistical problems created by the attack threaten \nthe entire economy of this city, the State of New York, and, I believe, \nthe Nation as well.\n  Working or living in New York City, or Manhattan right now is not a \npretty picture.\n  Our streets are littered with 37 miles of high-voltage electricity \nlines that are but one prankster away from shutting off power to our \nNation's financial center.\n  Over 40 percent of Lower Manhattan's subway infrastructure has been \ndestroyed, adding hours to the daily commute of over 375,000 people who \nwork in the city.\n  All major river crossings--the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, and \nQueensboro Bridges, and the Midtown, Lincoln, and Holland Tunnels--into \nand out of Manhattan are subject to nightmarish traffic jams because of \nsecurity requirements. Yesterday, for instance, they were all shut down \nbecause of the flight 587 crash.\n  Nearly 25 million square feet of commercial office space is destroyed \nor heavily damaged. The amount destroyed--nearly 20 million square \nfeet--surpasses the entire office space inventory of cities such as \nMiami and Atlanta.\n  Over 125,000 jobs have at least temporarily vanished from the area, \nand the city estimates that at least 30,000 are gone for good.\n  Noxious fumes continue to emanate from the hole at the World Trade \nCenter site creating great concern among workers and residents for \ntheir personal health.\n  There is a possibility that the Hudson River will bust through a \nretaining wall and flood the area as the debris is removed.\n  Insurance companies are demanding 100 percent increases from \ncompanies doing business in New York--simply because they are located \nin a confirmed terrorist target zone. Some insurance companies refuse \nto provide insurance at any cost.\n  Mayor Giuliani had to cut $1 billion from the city budget just to \nprevent an immediate fiscal meltdown at a time when the need for city \nservices is at an all-time high.\n  The city of New York is staring at a $3 billion deficit next year as \na direct result of this crisis. The State's revenue loss is projected \nto be $9 to $12 billion.\n  The Comptroller of New York City places the economic loss to the city \nof New York and its businesses at $105 billion in the next 2 years.\n  The incident has caused the first decline in city gross product in \nover 9 years.\n  In short, we have taken a hit for the Nation. When the terrorists \nattacked New York, they were attacking our financial center, they were \nattacking America, and they were attacking the free world. None of the \nproblems I described above was of our making. None of these problems \nwas the result of a single thing we had or had not done. And none of \nthe assistance that we have requested on either the appropriations or \ntax side exceeds what we need to simply stay afloat as we begin this \ndaunting rebuilding effort.\n  The assistance that Senator Baucus included for New York in the \nstimulus package is designed to send a message that the Federal \nGovernment will not walk away and allow terrorists to destroy New York \nCity's economy. I believe people from all over America believe that. It \nboils down to specifically three complementary provisions, where \nSenator Clinton and I, working with the business community, the labor \ncommunity, the small business community, nonprofits, and Mayor Giuliani \nand Governor Pataki could come to the conclusion they are our highest \npriorities. Frankly, we submitted a larger list. The Finance Committee \npared it down. But this is about our bare needs:\n  A $4,800 per employee tax credit to companies that retain jobs--and \ndo not abandon New York--in the area immediately around ground zero; \nthe creation of a special kind of private activity bond to lower the \ncost of rebuilding New York; and finally, a provision that would permit \ncompanies that replace equipment destroyed in the World Trade Center \nbombing to take a special deduction if they replace that property in \nNew York.\n  Not a single aspect of these proposals is designed to take businesses \nfrom another part of the country or to accomplish job creation goals we \ncould not obtain before September 11, 2001. We have been fully \nsupported by our colleague on the Senate Finance Committee, Senator \nTorricelli of New Jersey, as well as Senator Corzine of New Jersey and \nSenators Dodd and Lieberman of Connecticut, all of whom have stood by \nand understand that New York's problem is a metropolitan area problem.\n  These provisions are simply designed to help us overcome some of the \nenormous obstacles that Osama bin Laden placed in New York City's way.\n  So I, once again, thank Chairman Baucus and the members of the \nFinance Committee. I see my colleague from New Jersey has come into the \nChamber. I thank him for his steadfast dedication and his treating our \narea as one.\n  You have all done the right thing, not only by the people of New \nYork, who are suffering right now, but by the people of America. I \nbelieve the Nation, with this stimulus bill, will be much the better.\n  I thank all of you on the Finance Committee who have supported us for \nyour hard work. And I pledge my complete and total support for this \npackage.\n  On another point--and that is about this package--we have put \ntogether a package that is designed to put money in the hands of \npeople, A, who need it most, and, B, who will spend it the quickest.\n  When I looked at the House bill, I was amazed; such a high percentage \nof the benefits do not even come into effect in 2003, 2004, 2005. \nWithout debating the merits of those provisions, it was obvious someone \nput their ideological wishes ahead of a need to stimulate the economy.\n  When I even look at the alternative Senate bill, we all know that \nmany of the larger companies that will get these benefits, especially \nthe ones in the bill of my good friend from Iowa, will not spend them \nimmediately. Many of these companies have enough capital to spend on \ntheir own. When they see a business investment, they will spend it. \nThey will when they see an opportunity. Right now they do not see an \nopportunity because average people do not have the money to buy the \nproducts that they might create.\n  I have talked to large numbers of businesspeople in finance and \nmanufacturing and services. Most of them are afraid to state this \npublicly, but when they talk to you privately, they say they don't \nunderstand the House bill, they don't really even understand the Senate \nbill that came from the other side, even though it might benefit their \ncompanies. Their greatest worry is that the economy is hurdling south, \nand that recession becomes deep recession, and deep recession becomes \ndeeper recession, and God knows what after that.\n  To sit here and say that we do not have an emergency, and to sit here \nand say we are going to give money to people who are not going to spend \nit immediately, when this is supposed to be a stimulus bill, makes no \nsense.\n  So I fully support the Finance Committee package put forward by \nSenator Baucus, not only because it helps New York, which is extremely \nimportant to me and is sine qua non, but because if you want to \nstimulate the economy and you can ask 100 objective people, non-\nDemocrat, non-Republican, not coming from a business or labor \nperspective, eliminate the ideologues from the left or the right, \nalmost every one of them would choose the package of the Democratic \nFinance Committee.\n  In conclusion, Madam President, No. 1, we have an emergency, if we \never had one, and we ought to move this bill forward.\n  No. 2, New York needs help, not just to benefit New York but to help \nAmerica get an important part of our economy on its feet, and this bill \ndoes it.\n  And No. 3, if there was ever a question about the need to stimulate \nthe economy now, by giving average folks the money they need to buy the \nthings that will get the economy going again, this is the time and this \nbill does it.\n\n[[Page S11770]]\n\n  Madam President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, before the tragic events of September \n11, one of most pressing issues facing this Nation was what to do about \nthe economy. From the spring of 2000 until September 10 of this year, \nall the indicators pointed to an economic slowdown, if not a mild \nrecession, for fiscal year 2002.\n  Since September 11, the economy has far worsened. Hundreds of \nthousands of people have been laid off. Businesses and industry are in \ndire financial shape, and consumer confidence has plummeted. Several \nfriends of mine in the retail industry have predicted a nuclear winter \nfor the retail industry this holiday season, and many Ohio \nmanufacturers I have talked to have told me they have never seen things \nas bad.\n  Given the challenges these turbulent times present, I say to my \ncolleagues in the Senate--and to the American people as well--we need \nto focus on those measures that will stabilize and grow the U.S. \neconomy. The need for fiscal discipline is more important today than \never before.\n  I am worried that Congress, in its haste to enact measures to \neliminate the scourge of terrorism at home and abroad and counter our \nrecession, is overlooking the Nation's long-term fiscal integrity. \nEarlier in this calendar year, the Congressional Budget Office \nindicated that the United States would have a fiscal year 2002 on-\nbudget surplus of $125 billion and a Social Security surplus of $156 \nbillion. However, given the worsening economic condition of our Nation \nover the past year, the most recent calculations of the Senate Budget \nCommittee show that the Federal Government is on track to have a \nunified or combined surplus of $52 billion in the current fiscal year.\n  In essence, the Budget Committee is saying that the on-budget surplus \nCBO estimated for fiscal year 2002 has been totally wiped out, gone. \nTwo-thirds of the $156 billion in Social Security surplus no longer \nexists.\n  What is more, the stimulus package the Senate is considering will \ncost approximately $75 to $100 billion. To pay for that package, the \n$52 billion in Social Security surplus will be gobbled up, and the \nFederal Government is going to have to issue somewhere between $23 and \n$50 billion of new debt this fiscal year.\n  In addition, the Federal Government likely will end up a lot further \nin the financial hole because Congress will pass additional \nsupplemental spending measures as the fiscal year progresses and \ndisasters and other emergency issues inevitably arise. The President \nsaid he may be coming back to Congress later this fiscal year for more \nmoney as he finds the need to respond to some of the issues that some \nof my colleagues have been talking about.\n  My point in going through these numbers is to highlight the fact that \neach and every additional dollar this Congress appropriates in fiscal \nyear 2002 is going to require the U.S. Treasury to issue new debt. We \nare right back to where we were in 1997, the last year the Federal \nGovernment had to issue new debt. As we debate the economic stimulus \npackage, efforts to fight terrorism or anything else to do for that \nmatter, we must constantly ask ourselves a vital question: Do these new \nspending initiatives or tax cuts warrant issuing new debt to pay for \nthem? The question I am asking the various constituencies who visit me \nasking for more money from the Government is whether or not their \nrequest is worthy enough to borrow money from our fellow Americans to \npay for it? That is the question. Again, the circumstances warrant \nborrowing money to fight terrorism and to boost the economy. I \nsupported the $40 billion emergency supplemental that we passed \nfollowing the September 11th attacks, and much of that supplemental is \ngoing to respond to the needs we have heard about this afternoon.\n\n  Extraordinary times require Congress to take extraordinary actions. \nWe will spend what it takes to defend this Nation from our enemies and \nto respond to the needs of our country. The fact that the Federal \nGovernment will, once again, have to issue new debt to fund any new \nspending highlights how critical it is that we appropriate these funds \nwisely.\n  Earlier this year I supported the budget resolution and the tax cut. \nI saw a plan whereby increased spending increases would be limited and \nwe would use the Social Security surplus to pay down debt. It wasn't \ntoo many weeks ago we were talking about this in the Senate. \nUnfortunately, this is not what has happened. Even before the events of \nSeptember 11, Congress was on track to increase overall discretionary \nspending by 8 percent. That follows a 14.5-percent increase in non-\ndefense discretionary spending the year before and another 8.6-percent \nincrease in spending the year before that.\n  This pace of spending increases is just unsustainable. I support the \nneed for a stimulus package. I have been working with members of the \nCentrist Coalition to craft a balanced bill that will help spark our \neconomy by getting businesses to boost investment and which helps raise \nconsumer confidence and gets the American people spending again and \nresponds to the financial and health care needs of the unemployed.\n  Sadly, though, the bill reported out of the Finance Committee last \nweek appears as if Christmas has come a month early. In fact, some of \nthe provisions of the majority stimulus measure as well as the measure \nthat was passed by the House, are nothing more than handouts for any \nnumber of special interest groups.\n  For example, under the majority stimulus bill, Amtrak would receive \n$4.4 billion in tax breaks and $3.5 billion to subsidize farm products, \nincluding up to $10 million for bison farmers for the Midwest.\n  For each employee they have, Wall Street investment bankers would \nreceive a $4,800 tax credit, a credit originally designed for use in \ntraining individuals moving from welfare to work.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Ohio yield?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The Senator cited $4.4 billion worth of tax breaks \nfor Amtrak. What provision would that be? I am the author of the Amtrak \nprovisions. I am unaware of any tax breaks for Amtrak. Amtrak, being a \npublic corporation, doesn't pay taxes. So it would be hard to give them \na break. Nevertheless, the Senator made a statement about a provision \nof which I don't know. For purposes of the institution, my colleagues \nwould like to know what tax breaks Amtrak has as a special interest?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. According to the information I have, under the \nmajority stimulus package, they would end up getting a $4.4 billion \nbenefit. And if I stand corrected, I am more than happy to check that.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The Senator is very kind to yield. For that, I am \nvery grateful. I would like the record to be correct. Amtrak doesn't \npay taxes so it can't get a tax break. The provision is that the States \ncan issue bonds to build high-speed rail lines, and the Federal \nGovernment will pay the interest on it. So the Federal Government, in \nfact, is helping the States. The tax breaks go to the States that we \nrepresent, not Amtrak, not any projects, not any special interests, the \nStates of the Union. I include in that the State of Ohio. I thank the \nSenator for yielding to me.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Senator for refreshing my memory.\n  The fact is, tax breaks would be given to individuals who purchase \nState issued bonds. However, in effect, the U.S. Treasury ends up \npaying $4.4 billion in interest for Amtrak on those bonds by giving up \ntax revenue from individuals who purchase such bonds. That is the point \nI was making.\n  The movie industry would receive expedited depreciation for their \ncapital assets. Chicken farmers would get a tax credit extension for \nconverting chicken waste to energy. The list goes on and on.\n  Over in the House, one of the biggest items in their stimulus package \nwould repeal the corporate minimum tax and repay more than $20 billion \nretroactive to 1986 and give some of the major corporations in this \ncountry a big tax bonus.\n  As reported in the November 11 edition of the Washington Post, 16 \ncompanies in particular, many in the energy field, would receive more \nthan $7 billion in immediate tax refunds. While a number of the \nspecific proposals in either package might give a boost to certain \nareas of the economy, we need a\n\n[[Page S11771]]\n\nbill that will give us what truly are the best stimulus proposals, the \nones that will give us the biggest bang for the buck for both the \neconomy and our unemployed workers.\n  Another important factor we should consider is whether these \nprovisions stimulate the economy in the short run without causing a \nfiscal hangover that lasts many years. In brief, they need to be \ntemporary.\n  One such provision I support as part of the stimulus package is a \ntemporary extension of unemployment benefits for up to 13 additional \nweeks for those who have been hit hardest by the recession. In \naddition, I believe families who through no fault of their own find \nthemselves relying on unemployment benefits should not have these \nbenefits reduced further through taxation. Therefore, I propose, as \npart of the package, an interim suspension of the taxation of \nunemployment benefits. We should do that.\n  Several weeks ago I met with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \nto discuss the state of the economy and the need for a stimulus \npackage. Perhaps the most important point he made to me was that the \nCongress should consider the net effect of any stimulus package, not \njust the gross amount of the dollars involved. In other words, don't \njust focus on the size of the tax cuts or the dollars spent but look at \nthe net effect on the economy when all is said and done.\n  If the stimulus package that Congress adopts leads to chronic budget \ndeficits, either through increased spending or revenue reductions, it \nis going to drive up interest rates. Make no mistake about it, the \nfinancial markets are watching us.\n  The Senate lays claim to the title ``world's most deliberative \nbody.'' As George Washington said, ``We pour legislation into the \nsenatorial saucer to cool it.''\n  At this time in our history, it is critical that the Senate takes on \nits role and thinks carefully about the long-term fiscal consequences \nof its actions. Intellectually, this means Congress must hold the line \non spending and that any increased spending should be limited to \nmeasures that truly raise domestic and international security and \nefforts that truly stimulate our economy.\n  I also remind my colleagues that the events of the past couple of \nmonths, momentous as they have been, do not change the fact that the \nbaby boomers are aging and approaching retirement. When 2011 rolls \naround, the baby boomers will start to retire by the tens of millions.\n  Unavoidably, the cost of a host of Federal social programs also will \nincrease significantly. Chiefly, I am talking about Medicare. A few \nyears latter, the Social Security Program will begin to pay out more \nmoney in benefits than it will collect in payroll taxes. The difference \nbetween those inflows and outflows is going to have to come out of \ngeneral revenues, or more borrowing. What we are doing today will have \na large impact down the road.\n  In order for this Nation to deal with these looming responsibilities, \nit is critical that we have our fiscal house in order and have a robust \neconomy. The first obvious step to ensuring that we can meet these \nobligations is to get spending under control and return to reducing the \nnational debt, as we did the last 3 years.\n  I am heartened that our President said he will veto an emergency \nsupplemental spending measure being developed by some of my colleagues. \nI stand squarely behind the President, and so do 36 signatories of a \nletter Senator Bunning and I circulated several months ago. This letter \nreinforced the fact that we would uphold a Presidential veto of \nexcessive spending.\n  The fact that the Treasury will once again be issuing new debt to \nfinance the operations of the Federal Government makes it that much \nmore important that Congress work together--work together--on a \nbipartisan basis to make the hard choices and prioritize our spending.\n  As I have traveled across my State over the past 2 months, I have \nseen the anxiety on the faces of my constituents. The thing that is \ngiving them a great deal of comfort is the fact that they believe the \nPresident is doing a good job, that he is 100 percent focused on \nprotecting the Nation's interests and he has put those interests ahead \nof partisan politics.\n  The American people also believe Congress is doing the same thing, \nand we must not let them down. One of the things we need to do is \nunderstand that we are facing a much different ball game than we have \never faced before. This is not 5 years ago, 10 years ago, 15 years ago; \nthis is a new ball game for all of us. The people have anxiety; they \nare fearful and angry. They are looking at us, and they are wondering: \nAre you going to work together for our interests, or are you going to \ngo back to partisan politics again and put your particular party's \ninterests above those of the people?\n  Madam President, we can work together, and we must if we expect to \nget a bill to the President by the end of the month. The eyes of \nAmerica are upon us to see if we have learned that this Nation's \ninterests are bigger than our own partisan interests.\n  I pray that the Holy Spirit enlightens this body to understand the \nenormous impact our decision will have on the future of our Nation and \non the quality of life of its citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Senators Baucus and \nByrd for crafting a reasonable and appropriate economic stimulus bill. \nThe package they have brought forward balances tax relief, assistance \nfor unemployed workers, and spending for homeland security and economic \nrecovery. With the United States economy in recession for the first \ntime in over a decade, now is the time for Congress to act to help hard \nworking Americans. The Baucus-Byrd legislation will strengthen consumer \nconfidence as well as public safety.\n  An already struggling economy was dealt a crippling blow by the \nSeptember 11th terrorist attacks. In order to best jumpstart the \neconomy, each part in the stimulus package has a substantial effect in \nthe short-term, the greatest impact for the money spent, and no great \ncost in later years. I believe that the Baucus-Byrd stimulus package is \ndirected toward boosting business and consumer confidence in the \nfuture.\n  America's workers need assistance now. Today, with more than 7 \nmillion Americans out of work, the Nation is suffering through its \nhighest level of unemployment in 20 years. More than half of unemployed \npeople do not qualify for unemployment, and the vast majority cannot \nafford health coverage under our current system. As of mid-September, \nthere were 10,888 unemployed people in Vermont, a seasonally-adjusted \nunemployment rate of 3.2 percent. Approximately 27,200 Vermonters will \nclaim unemployment insurance in the next year, according to estimates \nfrom the Department of Labor's National Employment Law Project. Of \nthose, 3,536 will exhaust their unemployment benefits during that time.\n  The Senate's economic recovery plan addresses these problems by \nproviding unemployment insurance and health coverage for laid-off \nworkers, tax rebates for middle and low-income people who need \nimmediate relief, and tax incentives for small businesses to encourage \nimmediate investment in new plants and equipment.\n  One of my primary goals in the wake of the September 11th attacks has \nbeen to increase the security of our border with Canada. Over the past \ndecade or more, the northern border has continually been shortchanged. \nWhile the number of Border Patrol agents along the southern border has \nincreased over the last few years to over 8,000, the number at the \nnorthern border has remained the same as a decade ago at 300. Even as \nthe northern border was increasingly discussed as an attractive route \nof entry into the United States for terrorists, Congress failed to \nrectify this imbalance.\n  We began to make up for this pattern of neglect with passage of the \nUSA PATRIOT Act last month. That law authorized a tripling of the \nnumber of Border Patrol officers, INS Inspectors, and Customs agents in \nthe States that share a border with Canada. It also authorized $50 \nmillion each to the INS and Customs to improve the technology used in \nmonitoring the border and to purchase additional equipment. This law \nprovides the basis for improving our security, but we must now ensure \nthat these proposals are funded. This stimulus bill provides the first \nstep.\n\n[[Page S11772]]\n\n  Senator Byrd proposes an additional $327 million for U.S. Customs--\n$31 million to be used for new staffing which could result in as many \nas 350 new agents. Coupled with the 285 new agents for the northern \nborder funded in the Treasury Postal Appropriations bill earlier this \nyear, we are on the way to addressing the shortfalls felt by the \nCustoms Service in the north.\n  This bill also appropriates over $700 million for INS to improve INS \nfacilities and border infrastructure to help better secure our country. \nWhile I had hoped more money and attention would have been dedicated to \nthe staffing shortfalls, I am confident we can expand these initiatives \nin the supplemental appropriations bill scheduled to move after the \nThanksgiving holiday. We will need to show continued vigilance on this \nissue. For too long, we have ignored the needs of the northern border \nand been complacent about our security. We no longer can afford such \ncomplacency.\n  The proposal would also include $600 million for additional FEMA \nfirefighting grants. This money would allow state and local communities \nto expand and improve their firefighting programs. Over 50 percent of \nthe funding would go to volunteer fire departments in rural \ncommunities.\n  Again, I thank the Chairman of the Finance Committee and the Chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, for bringing forward this important \nlegislation. America's national security must not be left behind as \nCongress considers an economic stimulus package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, in the legislation before the Senate \non economic recovery, we are, of course, focused on those who have lost \ntheir jobs, those businesses and unions that are in distress, and our \nvarious communities.\n  But there are some American families for whom September 11 is not a \nmemory; it is a crisis in their lives that they wake up with every \nmorning. I am speaking about the families of those who perished--the \n5,000 husbands and wives and thousands of children for whom September \n11 will be a day they will live with for the rest of their lives.\n  Nearly 600 of the dead were from my State of New Jersey. Senator \nCorzine and I have begun meeting with the husbands and wives of those \ndeceased. It is an experience I wish every Senator could share. It \nbecomes so common to speculate on whether September 11 has changed \nAmerica forever. I don't know. But I know that when I meet with these \nwidows and widowers, America has forever changed for them.\n  We debate the economic consequences for our country. I want you to \nconsider the economic consequences for them, what the morning was like, \nnot of September 11 but of September 12, when a husband or a wife was \ngone. It could have been a young family in a new home, with a new baby. \nFamilies wanted to mourn, but there wasn't a lot of time because in 2 \nweeks a mortgage payment was due, in 3 months a tuition payment was \ndue, that weekend there were groceries to buy, and there were no more \npaychecks. For them, it is a crisis that never goes away.\n  In the legislation before the Senate, there may be things Senators \nlike and there may be things they do not like. There may be points of \ncontroversy. I trust there is one thing upon which we can all agree. I \nam very grateful that, on a unanimous and bipartisan basis, Members of \nthe Senate accepted, under Senator Baucus's leadership, an amendment I \noffered that will change the tax status of families who lost a family \nmember on September 11 at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, or \nthrough the anthrax attacks in recent weeks.\n  The amendment I offered is based on an aspect of current American \nlaw. If, under the statutes of our country, a member of the military is \nlost in an engagement abroad, or a civilian employee is killed by a \nterrorist act abroad, they will incur no tax liability to the U.S. \nGovernment for that year. When that provision was written, I have no \ndoubt it did not occur to Members of the Congress that victims would \nnot be people in the service abroad but would be civilians at home; \nthat the front lines would not be in Latin America, Africa, or Asia but \nin New York, New Jersey, or Virginia. But that is the world in which we \nlive. The laws must be changed accordingly.\n  The Finance Committee, therefore, has put before the Senate a \nprovision that changes the tax laws to relieve the liability of these \ntragic families.\n  First, income tax liability for this year and last year is waived. No \nfurther payments will be paid and refunds will be received when \nappropriate.\n  Second, we recognize that many of those who worked at the World Trade \nCenter or even in the Pentagon were not salaried employees of \nconsiderable means but may have been performing janitorial services or \nwere service employees or worked in the restaurant at the World Trade \nCenter. With modest means, their families face great obligations to \nplan their futures. They may not have paid Federal income tax. \nTherefore, the second provision waives FICA taxes or payroll taxes that \nwere paid and may be owing for these families.\n  Third, many of the families of the deceased are now in the process of \nexamining the wills of the dead that say what is available for \nchildren, wives, or husbands. Under the Finance Committee legislation, \nthere is estate tax relief for the first $3 million in assets from \nFederal and State estate taxes. There is $8.5 million of Federal estate \ntax relief.\n  It is generous, but it is appropriate. Whatever money is to be left \nfor many of these families is all the income they will know for the \nrest of their lives. It is theirs. That is what the deceased husbands \nor wives would have wanted. It is for their children and for their \nfutures, not the Government.\n  Fourth, the bill provides help for those who were fortunate enough to \nsurvive the attacks, but for those thousands who had injuries current \nlaw excludes disability benefits from income if a U.S. employee is \ninjured in a terrorist attack outside the United States. This \nlegislation will extend the same benefit to those citizens of the \nUnited States injured in a terrorist attack and receiving disability \nbenefits.\n  Fifth, there is no better statement about America than the hundreds \nof millions of dollars donated to private charities since September 11, \nbut there is the question of the tax liability of families who receive \nsome of this assistance from employers, friends, family, or charities. \nUnder the provision of the bill, we have made it far easier for \ncharitable organizations to make payments to victims and their families \nand for companies to establish private foundations to help the \nsurvivors with short- and long-term needs.\n  Indeed, any payment from an employer to a victim or family for \npersonal, living, family, or funeral expenses will be tax exempt.\n  It clarifies that payments made by airlines, as well as Federal, \nState, and local governments as a result of the attacks are also not to \nbe taxed.\n  The Senate may debate much of this legislation. As one Senator who \nrepresents hundreds of these victims and their families, much may be \nnegotiable. Some things may be excluded, but one thing must stand. When \nthis year is concluded, no American who found a member of their family \non the front line of the war against terrorism should be held liable \nfor taxation of the U.S. Government for charitable, governmental, \nfamily, or other assistance. What last dollars these family members may \nhave earned for their wives or husbands or children surely by justice \nmust be their own. On this provision, we should all insist.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I inquire of the time remaining. I \nunderstand there are several of us who want to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12 minutes remaining before \ncontrolled time begins.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if I may speak for 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I inquire, under the agreement, how \nmuch time was I allocated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no allocation of time for the Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Alaska \nhave 3 minutes, that I have 7 minutes of the remaining time, and I see \nthe\n\n[[Page S11773]]\n\nSenator from Delaware. How about 5, 5, and 5?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will exceed available time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I correct the Senator from Louisiana; I asked for 3\\1/\n2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent for 3\\1/2\\ minutes for the \nSenator from Alaska, 4\\1/2\\ minutes for myself, and the remaining time \nfor the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I thank my colleague for her \ncooperation. I will be brief. We are talking about a stimulus package, \nand I want to address a specific stimulus package that I think is most \nappropriate relative to the business at hand before this body.\n  As we all know, the question of stimulus means different things to \ndifferent people. Senator Craig of Idaho offered an amendment, H.R. 4, \non the stimulus bill today. I intend to pursue that and bring that \nmatter up.\n  It is important to understand just what H.R. 4 does. It is the \nlegislative portion of the President's comprehensive energy program \nthat aims to secure America's energy future with new national energy \nstrategies that reduce energy demand, increase energy supply, and \nenhance our energy infrastructure and our energy security. It is truly \na stimulus bill.\n  It is supported by an extraordinary group of Americans: the veterans \ngroups, the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Vietnam \nVeterans. I could go on and on. It is supported by the Hispanic groups. \nIt is supported by those over 60, America's labor community, senior \ncitizens, small business, on and on.\n  Why is it so significant inasmuch as it is and should be a part of \nthis bill? I challenge each Member of this body to identify a greater \nstimulus associated with the House bill, H.R. 4, which is now part of \nthe stimulus package, in stimulating the economy with at least 250,000 \ndirect jobs associated with the building and opening of ANWR. \nFurthermore, the revenue of about $3.6 billion going into the Federal \nTreasury from lease sales would go directly to offset some of the cost \nof our war on terrorism.\n  What would it cost the taxpayers? Not one red cent. As we look at the \nstimulus package objectively, let us recognize what it is. It is a \nspending package, but this portion is not. This would be funded by the \nprivate sector. The oil industry would bid on these leases in my State \nof Alaska, the revenue would flow to the Federal Government, and the \nemployment would stimulate the economy and jobs.\n  There would be at least six new tankers built in U.S. shipyards that \nwould be operated by U.S. crews, and it would fly under the American \nflag. This is hundreds of millions of dollars of expenditures that \nwould be stimulated by opening up this area. Can we do it safely? \nCertainly.\n  The arguments against opening ANWR are the same that prevailed 27 \nyears ago against opening Prudhoe Bay. We have the technology to do it. \nThe American labor community supports it. It is the right thing to do \nto stimulate the economy, and we should not wait any longer. It is \ntruly a stimulus. It belongs as part of this bill.\n  I hope my colleagues will reflect on a better stimulus they can \nidentify that meets that criteria: It does not cost the taxpayer one \nred cent; 250,000 direct jobs; generation of about $3.6 billion \ndirectly into the revenue stream of this Nation.\n  My time is up. I thank my colleagues. I ask for their consideration. \nWe will have a vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I am proud to support the Baucus-Byrd \nstimulus and economic recovery package and believe that it is exactly \nthe right package at this time to defend, protect, and make our Nation \nstronger.\n  The preamble to our Constitution states that the purpose of our \nFederal Government is ``in Order. . .to provide for the common defence, \npromote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \nourselves and our Posterity.''\n  The Framers of our Constitution, Madam President, as you know, were \nvery deliberate; they were very exact; they were very careful in the \nwording of these documents that helped to create and sustain our \nNation. For that reason, it strikes me as very important that the first \npriority of our Government is to provide for the common defense. I \nbelieve the Baucus-Byrd stimulus economic recovery package does exactly \nthat. Let me explain.\n  We fund a military operation whose sole purpose is to protect \nAmerican lives, our property, and our well-being. Our lives, our \nproperty, and our well-being are at risk because of the attack we are \nunder.\n  This is a two-pronged war in which we are engaged: We are engaged in \nAfghanistan on the ground trying to find the people and groups \nresponsible for the attack on the United States and our allies, and we \non the homefront are trying to keep our Nation standing up under this \nattack.\n  I ask my colleagues: What would it matter or what difference would it \nmake to a businessperson if his or her business were destroyed by a \nterrorist in a direct attack or if his or her business were destroyed \ndue to the impact of a terrorist attack?\n  The business is lost just the same. We can come to this Chamber in a \nbipartisan spirit and support our military, and I do. The military is \nto protect our interest, our lives and our livelihood. There are \nthousands of families who have been directly hit by a terrorist on our \nshores. There have been thousands of businesses and millions of people \nin jeopardy because of that attack.\n  This Government, under the Constitution, and all that we know about \nour Government, has a responsibility to those individuals to help \nprovide economic recovery. That simply is what this package does. This \nis not an entitlement. This is not a special interest. Our country \nexists to help us protect and defend ourselves, and that is what \nworkers and businesses are trying to do. They have been attacked, and \nGovernment has a right to respond and respond in this way.\n  The package before us provides some very important help to keep these \nbusinesses open, to help people continue to receive a paycheck so they \ncan pay down their mortgages. Think about this: Our Army, our Navy, our \nAir Force and Marines are assembled all over the world to keep \nAmericans or keep foreign armies from taking homes away. Whether they \ncome on to our shore and take our homes away by confiscating the \nbuilding or whether homes are taken away because the homeowners inside \ncannot pay their mortgage, what difference does it make? The home is \ngone.\n  Senator Baucus has been working morning, noon, and night to come up \nwith a package to help Americans pay their mortgage. We can ask \nAmericans who live in Louisiana or Montana, what difference does it \nmake if they do not have their house? So let us craft a stimulus \npackage that helps businesses stay open, workers pay their mortgage, \npeople be able to use their benefits.\n  This package that has been put together by Senator Baucus, Senator \nDaschle, Senator Reid, and the Democrats recognizes the responsibility \nfor common defense. It also recognizes it does not really make a \ndifference how a person loses their home. The loss is the same, and let \nus fashion a package that helps them.\n  Give 75 percent of COBRA premiums for displaced workers. In \nLouisiana, these premiums cost $7,000. That represents 75 percent of \nthe unemployment check. So if we do not provide health care, it is as \nif a foreign army came and took over a hospital and stood at the door \nwith a machine gun and said, no, we know that you are dying and need \nsurgery, but you are not going to have access to this hospital. If we \ndo not give COBRA payments, it is the exact same. People cannot use the \nhospital. It is the same thing for unemployment.\n  So I want to strongly urge this package for Louisiana, for our \nNation, and to say that for the nonproliferation issues it is a direct \nrisk to our Nation if we do not invest in ridding this world of weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n[[Page S11774]]\n\n  Mr. CARPER. My colleagues have heard me say a number of times, \nreflecting back on the last 8 years when I served as Governor of \nDelaware, that we always had in place a litmus test that we applied \nwhen we considered proposed tax cuts. The litmus test was that those \nproposed tax cuts should be fair. They should stimulate the economy and \ncreate jobs. They should simplify the Tax Code. And they should be \nconsistent with a balanced budget. We need a similar set of guiding \nprinciples as we debate the stimulus package that is before us, and as \nit turns out there is such a set of guiding principles.\n  The process of working out a bipartisan economic stimulus package \nbegan shortly after the attacks of September 11. The White House and \ncongressional leaders from both parties met jointly and, in \nconsultation with Chairman Greesnspan and former Treasury Secretary \nRobert Rubin, they agreed upon a bipartisan set of principles for an \naffective and responsible package. Those principles were agreed to \njointly by the bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate budget \ncommittees, as well as by the Centrist Coalition here in the Senate.\n  I stated at the outset of this process that I would use these \nbipartisan principles as my guide as we considered economic stimulus \nlegislation here in the Senate. I have conveyed that message to all of \nmy constituents who have written me on this subject or who have talked \nto me about the issue at town hall meetings. I also conveyed the same \nmessage very early on to Chairman Baucus and both leaders.\n  Since this debate has, unfortunately, become much more partisan of \nlate than it was in the beginning, it's helpful to look back at those \nbipartisan principles that we started with. Chairman Baucus deserves \ngreat credit for sticking to the spirit as well as the letter of those \nprinciples from beginning to end, even as he has come under great \npressure from all sides.\n  First, the bipartisan principles stated that a stimulus package \nshould accomplish three objectives: restore consumer demand; increase \nbusiness investment; and help those most vulnerable in an economic \ndownturn.\n  On the consumer side, the Baucus package provides, as the President \nhas requested, rebate checks to the 45 million taxpayers who either did \nnot get checks this fall or only got partial checks this fall.\n  On the business side, the Baucus package provides specific tax \nincentives to encourage businesses to invest again in America and to do \nso immediately. In particular, the Baucus package includes a provision \nthe President requested to allow businesses, large and small, to \nrecover immediately a greater portion of their investment costs.\n  In terms of assistance to those most affected by the current \ndownturn, the Baucus plan provides help to those workers who have been \nlaid off since September 11, in the way of an extension of unemployment \ninsurance and an added hand in maintaining health coverage for \nthemselves and their families. Additionally, the Baucus package \nprovides assistance to the City of New York to help with that city's \nheroic efforts to recover and rebuild from the devastating events of \nSeptember 11.\n  Second, the bipartisan budget committee principles stated that a \nstimulus package should equal approximately one percent of GDP, \nincluding the fiscal impact of all of the various actions taken by \nCongress since September 11. The size of the Baucus package, at $70 \nbillion over the next 12 months, is slightly less than the $75 billion \nrequested by the President. On the other hand, when combined with the \nother measures passed since September 11, it is slightly more than the \none percent of GDP proposed by Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Rubin \nand agreed to by the bipartisan leadership of the budget committees.\n  Third, the bipartisan budget committee principles stated that \nmeasures included in a stimulus package should be limited in time, so \nas not to push up long-term interest rates and so as not to make \npermanent our recent reliance on the Social Security trust fund to make \nup for renewed on-budget deficits. The recommendation of the bipartisan \nleadership of the two budget committees was that all measures should \nsunset within one year. The sunsets in the Baucus package conform with \nthat recommendation.\n  Fourth and finally, the bipartisan budget committee principles stated \nthat to keep the nation on track to pay off the national debt over the \nnext decade, outyear offsets should make up over time for the cost of \nnear-term economic stimulus. And this is really where Chairman Baucus \ndeserves great credit. The cost of his plan over the next decade--the \neffect it will have on long-term interest rates and on our ability to \nfinance the retirement of the baby boom generation--is one-third less \nthan the stimulative impact of his plan over the next 12 months.\n  This combination of significant short-term stimulus with relatively \nlittle long-term cost is precisely what the bipartisan leadership of \nthe budget committees called for at the outset of this process, but it \nis easier said than done. Just consider that the package passed by our \ncounterparts in the House is 60 percent more costly over the next \ndecade than it is stimulative over the next 12 months, or that the \nalternative our friends on the other side of the aisle are offering \nhere in the Senate is nearly 50 percent more costly over the next \ndecade than it is stimulative over the next 12 months.\n  I regret that this process has become as partisan as it has. I have \nbeen very heartened since September 11 to see the President and Members \nof Congress from both parties working together in a bipartisan, \nbicameral fashion to craft commonsense solutions to the uncommon \nchallenges facing our country. I believe deeply that the very best \nthing we could do right now to restore the confidence of consumers, \ninvestors, and business leaders alike would be to work together to pass \na bipartisan economic stimulus package.\n  I believe there is still an opportunity to come together across party \nlines and between the two chambers to achieve a reasonable compromise \nthat will serve the best interests of the country and extend the spirit \nof bipartisan cooperation here in the Congress. The only way we can \nhope to reach agreement on the fine details at the end of the day, \nhowever, is if we remain true throughout the process to the broad \nprinciples that we agreed to at the outset.\n  I believe that Chairman Baucus has kept faith with the bipartisan \nprinciples that were proposed by Chairman Greenspan and Secretary Rubin \nand were agreed to by the bipartisan leadership of the budget \ncommittees and by the Centrist Coalition. I believe that he has \nnegotiated in good faith. For that reason, Chairman Baucus has my \nsupport. I hope he will have the support of all centrists here in the \nSenate, whether Democrat, Republican, or Independent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I believe I am recognized for 5 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Our leader also would have 5 minutes. I have talked to \nSenator Lott, and he said since he spoke this afternoon perhaps Senator \nNickles would like to speak. So I hope Senator Nickles or somebody else \nfrom our leadership can come and speak. If they do not, I will be glad \nto do it for them, but right now I will take 5 minutes.\n  Madam President, over the last several days, we have heard about how \nthis process of getting to a stimulus package started with a set of \nprinciples that presumably both Republicans and Democrats on the budget \nprocess, as well as the finance process, have agreed to.\n  Democratic Senators have particularly been reminding us of this \nprocess of having a stimulus package agreed to with a whole set of \nprinciples. They have been reminding us of this, and they have \nparticularly been reminding us as they criticize the House bill on the \nstimulus. They also used it to criticize a proposal I released a few \nweeks ago that represented the thinking of the Republican caucus.\n  As is often the case, not every principle fits everything they want \nto talk about, and so what one of the principal proponents of the bill \nthat is before the Senate--and that is the Democratic caucus bill--has \nfailed to mention is that none of the stimulus provisions should be \nindustry specific.\n\n[[Page S11775]]\n\n  It seems that adhering to principle is in the eye of the beholder \nbecause the bill that came out of the Finance Committee and is before \nus now as modified is laden with industry-specific provisions, contrary \nto one of the principles that has been talked about in the stimulus \npackage that is agreed to.\n  We have specific measures in this bill before us targeted to Amtrak, \nto broad band, as well as specific agricultural crops and even bison, \nif one can believe it. We have an incredible expansion of the work \nopportunity tax credit. I have supported this tax credit which was \nmeant to help welfare recipients find work, but in the Finance \nCommittee bill before us this credit has been grotesquely distorted to \ngive this tax credit to companies in New York investment firms and \nbanks who hire millionaire stockbrokers and lawyers.\n  Can you believe that? Tax credits for millionaires; that is what the \nDemocrat bill stands for.\n  Another principle Democrats have emphasized is these measures should \nbe temporary, and they insist any tax measures cannot be more than 1 \nyear long, but we have all kinds of spending measures in this mix that \nwill have long-term impact. We also have a bond provision in the \nDemocrat plan that the taxpayers will be paying for not 1 year but over \n30 years. If that does not establish a double standard, I do not know \nwhat does.\n  We have a Washington Post editorial that is on a chart behind me. I \nam not going to go into detail about reading the whole article, but the \nheadline is ``Meet Patriotic Pork.'' The editorial argues that Members \nare cloaking their underlying agenda under the name of patriotism and \nin the fight against terrorism. The editorial criticizes the House \nbill, which I also agree goes too far, but the editorial goes on to say \nthat ``the Senators who larded this bill in committee ought to be \nashamed of themselves.''\n  Madam President, that kind of says it in a nutshell. My objective is \nto work to make this bill a product of which we will not be ashamed; we \nwill have a product of which neither Democrats nor Republicans will be \nashamed. I know we will have a product of which the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Baucus, will not be ashamed. And I will be for it.\n  We need to get that process going. We need to do whatever it takes to \nmake sure this bill will accomplish our goals, then, of helping the \neconomy and the American people. Right now, it is obvious it does \nneither and our country deserves better. So this partisan, pork-ridden, \nlobbyist-written bill needs to be stopped, and we will stop it. Once \nthis happens, then as things go in the Senate, reasonable heads will \nprevail, and we can sit down and work out a bipartisan compromise that \nmeets the greatest needs of the Senators and we can vote for it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement of \nposition of administration policy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Executive Office of the President,\n\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 14, 2001.\n     Statement of Administration Policy\n     H.R. 3090--Economic Recovery and Assistance for American \n         Workers Act of 2001\n       The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 3090 as reported \n     by the Senate Finance Committee. The Administration believes \n     that it is crucial for Congress to quickly pass a stimulus \n     bill that will help get the economy going again following the \n     terrorist attacks of September 11th. This bill in its present \n     form will not accomplish this goal.\n       Instead of providing broad-based tax relief to restore \n     economic growth, this bill is an assembly of provisions that \n     do not provide immediate economic stimulus and are not \n     appropriate to this bill. For instance, $5 billion is set \n     aside for agricultural programs, including payments for bison \n     meat, and more than $4 billion is directed to tax credit \n     bonds for Amtrak.\n       Furthermore, some of the proposals in H.R. 3090 as reported \n     by the Senate Finance Committee would require at least six \n     months to one year to take effect due to their unprecedented \n     nature, the need for new Federal regulations, and the \n     requirement for new health insurance authorizations from \n     State legislatures. Proposals that effectively start next \n     summer and purportedly end next winter will neither provide \n     immediate assistance for displaced workers nor rapid stimulus \n     for the economy. Indeed, economic growth could suffer \n     substantially as a result of these provisions. In contrast to \n     the President's proposal to give prompt aid to displaced \n     workers and provide broad-based tax relief that will speed \n     their reemployment, this bill's unprecedented expansion of \n     unemployment insurance and the new health care entitlements \n     would likely increase unemployment by hundreds of thousands \n     of workers next year.\n       These provisions have one feature in common however: each \n     is likely to permanently expand the size and scope of the \n     Federal government and its control over programs, such as \n     unemployment insurance, that have always been under State \n     purview.\n       The Administration also notes that the proposed expansion \n     of the work opportunity tax credit is duplicative since the \n     Administration has decided it will direct $700 million in \n     Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds to New York to \n     aid businesses affected by the terrorist attacks. The \n     Administration's decision was the result of consultations \n     with both New York State and city officials.\n       The Administration is opposed to efforts to attach \n     additional discretionary spending to the bill. The \n     Administration and Congress agreed to limit discretionary \n     spending to $686 billion and to provide $40 billion for the \n     emergency response to the terrorist attacks. These funds are \n     more than adequate to meet foreseeable needs. This agreement \n     should be upheld.\n       The Administration urges the Senate to work together across \n     party lines to pass a responsible economic stimulus package \n     that will provide an immediate boost to the economy. The \n     President believes that the best way to retain and create \n     jobs is through tax relief that improves incentives to work \n     and invest while restoring consumer and business confidence. \n     The President has set out the following four principles for \n     achieving these goals:\n       Accelerating marginal income tax rate reductions to provide \n     more money for consumers to spend and for entrepreneurs and \n     small businesses to retain and create more jobs;\n       Giving relief to low and moderate income workers to put \n     more money back in their pickets;\n       Providing partial expensing to encourage businesses to \n     invest and make new purchases; and\n       Eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax, which, \n     if unchecked, imposes job-killing higher taxes during an \n     economic downturn.\n       The President has also called for swift action to help \n     dislocated workers, through extensions of unemployment \n     benefits and health care assistance programs that can be \n     implemented without delay.\n       Unlike the version of H.R. 3090 reported by the Senate \n     Finance Committee, the President's framework would boost the \n     economy, help displaced workers get back to work quickly, and \n     create several hundred thousand more jobs. Accordingly, the \n     Administration urges the Senate to reject the Finance \n     Committee approach and instead to work in a bipartisan manner \n     to craft an economic stimulus package that reflects the \n     President's principles and encompasses provisions that will \n     provide an immediate and effective stimulus to the Nation's \n     economy.\n\n\n                         pay-as-you-go scoring\n\n       Any law that would reduce receipts or increase direct \n     spending is subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. \n     Accordingly, H.R. 3090, or any substitute amendment in lieu \n     thereof that would reduce revenues or increase direct \n     spending, will be subject to the pay-as-you-go requirements. \n     OMB's scoring estimates are under development. The \n     Administration will work with Congress to ensure that any \n     unintended sequester of spending does not occur under current \n     law or the enactment of any other proposals that meet the \n     President's objectives.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, this so called stimulus package \nincludes a lot of money for agriculture. Since I am the only working \nfamily farmer in the Senate, I think it's important that I point out \nthe biggest problems with the agriculture spending we are considering.\n  The first problem that I see involves the section on commodity \npurchases. This section has been described by the chairman as a list of \nagriculture commodities which have experienced low prices in the 2000 \nor 2001 crop year. Due to what has been described as an ``economic \nshortfall'' experienced by these commodities the chairman would like to \ninstitute a short-term purchase program.\n  In the past, when I sat on the Agriculture Committee, we did provide \nshort-term relief for specific commodities. But before we provided that \nrelief and spent tax dollars we justified that spending by reviewing \neconomic data which defined the problems specific commodities were \nexperiencing.\n  I know that the Agriculture Subcommittee on Appropriations has also \nworked on similar assistance packages, and I would bet my farm on the \nfact that they also justify the cost by reviewing the loss.\n  My point is that if we are going to spend hundreds of millions of \ndollars on these commodities, doesn't the\n\n[[Page S11776]]\n\nother side need to at least show us the data that led them to include \nthese commodities? I am the ranking member on the committee, and I have \nnot heard from one farmer in America that this is needed. Let us start \nthis discussion as any committee with jurisdiction over this issue \nwould. Show us the average price of these commodities and what \npercentage of loss they have experienced. At least show us when and \nwhere the loss occurred.\n  While we are talking about where, where are these commodities \nlocated? Specifically, which regions of the country benefit from this \nsection. We would have asked this question in the Agriculture \nCommittee, why is no one asking it now? Where are these commodities \nbeing produced?\n  For instance, where is the majority of bison slaughtered? I did a \nlittle research and found that one cooperative in North Dakota \nprocesses over 60 percent of America's bison meat. In fact, this \nfacility, is the world's first processing plant devoted exclusively to \nbison meat.\n  I am not trying to tell everyone that there might not be a need for \nus to purchase bison meat. Who knows, maybe the Senators from North \nDakota can show us that there is a real need for bison to receive some \nsort of assistance. But, under this bill, even billionaires who dabble \nin bison ranching will get taxpayer assistance.\n  What I am trying to demonstrate is that this isn't the committee of \njurisdiction for USDA programs and if the Democrats want to give the \nFinance Committee jurisdiction over USDA because the Agriculture \nCommittee cannot handle its own workload, we should review this as the \nAgriculture Committee should, or as any committee should review an \nissue before spending American tax dollars.\n  The second problem I see is the re-establishment of the Natural \nDisaster Program. Under this program, producers are compensated if \ntheir crop losses are more than 35 percent of historic yields. We \nenacted this program last year to help farmers deal while we were \ngetting the Agriculture Risk Protection Act up to speed. For those of \nyou who do not remember, the Agriculture Risk Protection Act was the \ncrop insurance bill we spent $8 billion taxpayer dollars on to avoid \nthis specific scenario.\n  Congress allocated $8 billion dedicated to getting the government out \nof the disaster business by making crop insurance more affordable. The \nchairman would lilke to reinstitute a program that compensates \nproducers if their yields fall off. Sounds a lot like crop insurance to \nme.\n  Why are we tyring to provide payments to producers who have chosen \nnot to buy insurance? I can see why we did this in the past, but now \nthat the law is in place the U.S. government is subsiding the cost of \ninsurance on wheat at about 55 percent for the family farmer.\n  The message we will be sending is, ``there is no need to take care of \nyour own risk, Uncle Sam will help you cover your losses. And in turn \nyou punish the family farmers who bought insurance to manage their own \nrisk.\n  I know that under this program there is a small premium for producers \nwho carry insurance, but this program does not allow more than the \nworth of the crop. So, if the farmer has insurance that covers his \nloss, he does not get much out of this program.\n  It looks like to me we are questioning the policy established in the \ncrop insurance law that the majority of us supported. Isn't this really \na question that should be debated at length? Shouldn't the long-term \nramifications of this decision at least be considered?\n  How do we tell farmers to follow the direction established in the \ncrop insurance law and manage their own risk by purchasing affordable \ninsurance tools while we are rewarding those that have chosen to save \ntheir money and take on more risk by not purchasing crop insurance?\n  If the Finance Committee is now the committee of jurisdiction for \ncrop insurance, I think these questions should be addressed.\n  The third point I want to bring up is the $3 billion to clear the \n``backlog'' of Rural Development loan and grant applications at USDA. I \nrealize that this is now being deleted from the chairman's bill, but \nthe Senate was subjected to this awful policy during the markup and up \nuntil today, so I think it is worth mentioning.\n  When I read that provision for the first time my first though was, \n``How important is it to clear the backlog at Rural Development \nquickly?''\n  The reason I ask this question is due to the fact that the \nlegislation required funds be made available only after the next fiscal \nyear 2002 Ag. Appropriation funds had been exhausted.\n  Don't we usually provide enough funds based on the need and ability \nof USDA to process the applications during the next fiscal year?\n  Under the chairman's proposal, we would have had to first spend the \nfiscal year 2002 allocation before we used this new money. How many new \njobs would this money have created in six months? Not many if we didn't \nrun out of fiscal year 2002 funds until August or September.\n  It is sad that the press had to inform the other side how poor this \nidea was instead of the Republicans and Democrats working together \nbecause I guarantee you, if anyone on the Democratic side of the aisle \nhad asked me I would have pointed this out immediately. This was \nterrible policy.\n  Just to let everyone know, I contacted USDA about the provision the \nDemocrats pulled and they told me that if those funds had been made \navailable USDA would have needed an extra $100 million in salaries and \nexpenses to get all of the possible loans and grants out the door \nwithin a year.\n  My final point is that if this amendment had been successful we would \nhave been asking a mission area of USDA to engage in the single largest \nexpansion of any mission in years, and to do so without an \nundersecretary.\n  In summary, the Senate Agriculture Committee seems to be unable to \nmanage its own business so I guess it is trying to ``pass the buck'' to \nthe Finance Committee. These are not light-hearted issues and the \nimpact of these provisions will affect both short and long term policy \nconsiderations and precedents.\n  Madam President, I'd like to take a few minutes to respond to remarks \nmade earlier today by our distinguished majority leader. The majority \nleader criticized three of the four proposals in the Senate Republican \nCaucus' stimulus proposal.\n  The three proposals the majority leader criticized are: one, the \nacceleration of the marginal tax rate cuts from the bipartisan tax \nrelief package enacted earlier this year; two, the repeal of the \ncorporate alternative minimum tax; and three, the 30 percent bonus \ndepreciation.\n  I would like to address his general criticisms of the proposals. \nSenator Daschle made the following points: one, the proposals were the \nsame old ``leftover'' tax cut proposals; two, that Senate Republicans \nwere using the September 11 events to push ``ideological'' measures; \nand three, that these proposals had been ``unanimously'' rejected by \neconomists, editors, governors, and others.\n  I will respond to these general criticisms one by one.\n  On the first one, the ``leftover'' argument, I would like to point \nout that, with the exception of the marginal rate acceleration, none of \nthese proposals were included in any tax cut bill considered by the \nHouse or Senate for this year or last year for that matter. As a matter \nof fact, bonus depreciation has not been on the table for nearly a \ndecade. These proposals arose subsequent to September 11 as a response \nto the major economic problem of declining business investment. So let \nus not characterize these proposals as leftovers.\n  Let us go to the ``ideological'' point. Again, with the exception of \nthe marginal rate acceleration, these proposals were not Republican \nagenda items. I ask: Does anyone recall signs at the Republican \nConvention with ``bonus depreciation'' or corporate AMT relief?\n  This charge was coupled with an allegation that Republican Senators \nwere using the events of September 11 to advance these so-called \nideological proposals. Of course, these proposals were specifically \ndesigned to respond to the economic downturn. Indeed, in a gesture of \nbipartisanship that has not been reciprocated, Republicans, led by the \nPresident, put on the table a proposal that certainly cannot be called \na Republican priority, a supplemental rebate. In another gesture of \nbipartisanship, again with no reciprocation by\n\n[[Page S11777]]\n\nthe Democratic Leadership, Republicans, led by President Bush, took off \nthe table, an arguably stimulative proposal, capital gains tax cuts.\n  Actions speak louder than words.\n  I agree with one part of the majority leader's statement. That is, \nneither side should use the events of September 11 to advance \nideological objectives.\n  I have pointed out two significant examples of Republicans acting in \nanti-ideological manner. Where in the Democratic caucus proposal, or \nDemocratic leadership's actions, have we seen similar anti-ideological \nbehavior?\n  Indeed, it appears that the events of September 11 are being used as \nanother ``salami slice'' tactic to get to a Democratic ideological \nobjective. That objective is a Government-run universal health care \nsystem. Just take a look at the new COBRA entitlement, labeled as \ntemporary here.\n  Now, I would like to address the majority leader's third general \ncriticism. That criticism is that economists and editors have \nunanimously rejected the Senate Republican caucus stimulus proposal.\n  I guess if you only include some economists that have served in \nDemocratic administrations or some editors that identify themselves \nwith the Democratic agenda, then I would agree with the majority \nleader. For instance, much is made of Joseph Stiglitz's criticisms. \nThere is a lot of talk about his Nobel Prize, but you do not hear that \nhe chaired the Council of Economic Advisors in the Clinton \nAdministration. I guarantee there are Nobel Prize winners who worked in \nRepublican administrations who would not agree with Joseph Stiglitz. In \nfact, they would have problems with the Democratic package.\n  As an example of the diversity of opinion, you only have to review \nthe statements of Glen Hubbard, the current chair of the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisors.\n  The charge that economists have ``unanimously'' rejected the Senate \nRepublican caucus stimulus package is not borne out by the facts.\n  With respect to the charge that editors and opinion writers have \n`'unanimously'' rejected, I would like to print in the Record a couple \nof articles. One is an article by Kevin Hassett, who was a witness \nbefore the Senate Budget Committee. Another is an article from National \nReview. These are only two of many articles that show that there is \nsupport for elements of the Republican causus position. In addition, \neven the Governors' letter cited by the majority leader does not reject \nthe Senate Republican caucus stimulus package. I also ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record an editorial from the Washington Post, \nthat is highly critical of the Finance Committee's stimulus bill, by \npointing out that high-priced lobbyists help put the Democratic bill \ntogether.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Asian Wall Street Journal, Nov. 7, 2001]\n\n                            A Silver Lining\n\n                         (By Kevin A. Hassett)\n\n       The U.S. Federal Reserve's 50-basis-point rate cut Tuesday \n     came in response to a flurry of extremely negative economic \n     reports and increasingly widespread pessimism about the \n     American economy. As the federal funds rate nears zero, many \n     observers believe that there is little room for further \n     significant interest rate reductions. With the economy still \n     declining and the Fed out of ammunition, additional \n     government stimulus must now be of the fiscal variety.\n       Corporate tax cuts are a natural fiscal stimulus candidate. \n     The corporate sector has dropped the sharpest this year, and \n     business investment has historically responded impressively \n     to tax cuts. Yet U.S. Senate Democrats have staunchly opposed \n     Republican efforts to provide corporate tax relief. ``I'm not \n     even enamored any longer with the word stimulus,'' said \n     Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle last week, preferring \n     instead to launch a giant government spending spree. Such \n     measures reflect the emerging Democratic view that the ``Bush \n     economy'' is nearing depression, and only a New Deal can save \n     it.\n       But if you look closely, things aren't that bad. Marginal \n     tax-rate cuts might well have difficulty stimulating business \n     activity if there is significant excess capacity. But the \n     data don't support such a negative view. Indeed, despite \n     rumors to the contrary, the American economy was most likely \n     not in a recession on Sept. 10. The monetary and fiscal \n     stimulus adopted earlier in the year appears to have done its \n     job quite well.\n       That positive news emerged last week when the U.S. Commerce \n     Department reported that the gross domestic product declined \n     0.4 percent in the third quarter. Negative GDP growth is a \n     strong sign of a recession, but analysis of the background \n     data suggests that the number would have been comfortably \n     positive absent the attack. First, before the attack, chain-\n     store sales indicated that consumer spending in September was \n     at about the same healthy level posted in August. Second, \n     border closings created turmoil in the auto sector, where \n     just-in-time inventory techniques led to significant \n     production interruptions.\n       It is a simple adding-up exercise to correct for these two \n     factors, and doing so leads to a surprising conclusion. If \n     September consumption had continued at the pace registered at \n     the start of the month and auto production had not jammed up, \n     the economy would have dodged recession in the third quarter. \n     GDP would have been more than a percentage point higher--\n     safely nestled in positive territory.\n       Although that did not happen, it does put to rest the view \n     that the terrorist attacks pushed an already devastated Bush \n     economy into a steep downward spiral. The economy was doing \n     better than expected, and this was likely because of well-\n     timed economic policy. Consumer spending has been \n     particularly strong in interest-sensitive sectors.\n       Another bit of positive news lurking in the third-quarter \n     data confirms the view that business tax cuts in particular \n     could be effective now. The government data available do not \n     explicitly report third-quarter productivity, but it is \n     possible to figure this out by using techniques that are also \n     relied upon by Fed economists (and undoubtedly reported to \n     board members Tuesday).\n       These calculations are striking. Even with the sharp \n     declines in output that occurred at the end of the third \n     quarter, productivity increased by more than two percentage \n     points. As economic data watching goes, that remarkable \n     observation is as good as it gets.\n       Historically, productivity has almost always declined \n     sharply just before a recession and softened further during a \n     recession. This ``procyclical productivity'' pattern is so \n     reliable that an entire literature exists exploring its \n     cause. The current consensus appears to be that productivity \n     drops near recessions because firms are reluctant to lay off \n     idle workers when demand shrinks, and the proportion of \n     workers that are not productive increases sharply. Perhaps \n     that describes the past, but it has not happened this time. \n     High-tech investments have allowed firms to adjust on the fly \n     and continue to squeeze more output out of fewer inputs.\n       In February, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan marveled at the \n     strong productivity numbers posted in late 2000 when the \n     economy was softening. The increase was, he remarked in a \n     Senate Banking Committee hearing, ``at a pace sufficiently \n     impressive to provide strong support for the view that the \n     rate of growth of structural productivity remains well above \n     its pace of a decade ago.'' It's important to note that this \n     high rate of productivity has continued over the past few \n     quarters, even as the economy has softened.\n       Why is this so important? If productivity were declining, \n     then firms would be faced with many more painful decisions in \n     coming months. Capital investments that were intended to \n     improve the bottom line would have failed. Should plants then \n     be closed? As it is, it looks like the inventory and \n     investment corrections that occurred in the 12 months before \n     Sept. 11 had achieved their desired effects. The \n     ``overhangs'' that presage sharp economic disruptions were \n     not apparent in the data, and a healthy response to marginal \n     tax-rate reductions is quite plausible.\n       But, of course, other factors are present. And they help to \n     explain why, despite the good news, economic activity has \n     dropped so sharply.\n       After years of highly mathematical research in dusty \n     journals, many economists now believe that the root cause \n     lies in the distinction between risk and ambiguity that was \n     first described by University of Chicago economist Frank \n     Knight in the 1920s. Knight argued that there is a difference \n     between a circumstance with known probabilities--like a coin \n     flip--and a situation with high ambiguity, where the \n     probabilities of different outcomes are not known. \n     Subsequently, researchers have confirmed Knight's observation \n     both in theory and with observation.\n       There are profound differences in behavior when people face \n     the two different types of uncertainty. Most important, when \n     ambiguity is high, consumers and firms often act as if the \n     worst possible outcome will occur for sure. Thus, after the \n     terrorists attacked, the U.S. entered an ambiguous world with \n     many horrible possibilities and no probabilities. \n     Predictably, businesses and consumers assumed that a deep \n     recession would occur with certainty. Their extremely \n     cautious response to the assumption helped make the recession \n     more likely.\n       So the core fundamentals of the economy remain surprisingly \n     strong. If there is a recession, it will have been caused by \n     the terrorist attacks. Therein lies both the hope and the \n     challenge to policy makers. Absent a rapid and clearly \n     visible victory in the war on terrorism, consumers and firms \n     will only gradually return to normal, and a long and deep \n     recession is possible. Yet the underlying strengths suggest \n     that there is ample opportunity, and that corporate tax cuts \n     could ignite further productivity enhancing investments. The \n     stimulus bill that passed the U.S.\n\n[[Page S11778]]\n\n     House of Representatives took a step in that direction. It's \n     time that the Senate stop bickering and do the House one \n     better.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the NRO Financial, Nov. 8, 2001]\n\n                     The New Dance of the Crackpots\n\n                             (By John Hood)\n\n       In this indispensable guide to the New Deal, The Roosevelt \n     Myth, journalist John T. Flynn wrote about the pivotal couple \n     of years leading up to the 1936 presidential election. \n     Roosevelt's early efforts had failed to bring the country out \n     of depression, and so a bewildering array of left-wing \n     politicians and journalists offered their own strategies for \n     getting the economy moving again. It was, in Flynn's \n     picturesque words, ``The Dance of the Crackpots.''\n       Its main result was to shove FDR further to the left. His \n     administration created new credit and spending programs to \n     steal the thunder of Huey Long and other radicals, and to \n     induce an artificial inflationary spurt in activity just \n     before the election--a winning political strategy that \n     nonetheless resulted in another painful recession in 1937-\n     '38.\n       As American battles international terrorism and a slowing \n     economy, we are now witnessing a new Dance of the Crackpots. \n     Denigrating President Bush's $1.3 trillion tax cut enacted by \n     Congress earlier this year, critics are coming out of the \n     woodwork to offer increasingly silly and outdated proposals \n     to ``stimulate demand'' and ``escape the liquidity trap.'' \n     While draped in New Economy language, these ideas are \n     basically the same old Keynesian claptrap that the crackpots \n     of the 1930s indulged in--although, unlike present-day \n     advocates, the 1930s crackpots had the excuse that most of \n     their pet ideas had yet to be proven false through \n     experience.\n       On prominent exponent of the new (old) philosophy is Robert \n     Rubin, Clinton's former Treasury Secretary. Advising the \n     Congress on how to fashion a ``bipartisan'' stimulus package, \n     Rubin recommended a focus on spending programs and tax \n     credits directed to poor Americans. ``People at the bottom of \n     the income scale spend all the money they earn,'' he \n     reportedly told congressional leaders. ``If you give it to \n     them, they're going to spend it. If you give it to me, it's \n     not going to affect my spending patterns.''\n       Newsweek columnist Jonathan Alter made a similar point in a \n     column criticizing supply-side tax cuts suggested by House \n     Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas. Armey ``claims to be an \n     economist,'' Alter sneered. ``But he obviously never learned \n     about a little concept familiar to every college freshmen \n     called `supply and demand.' Our supply--or capacity--is just \n     fine right now; in fact, we've got too much of it. The \n     problem is consumer demand. It's dangerously flat.''\n       According to Rubin and his journalistic echo chamber, \n     government stimulus is needed because Americans aren't \n     spending enough. This statement is absurd. To say that \n     Americans aren't spending ``enough'' is to presuppose that \n     there is some level of spending that is correct, and that \n     government officials can know such a level. Furthermore, such \n     a singular focus on broad abstractions like ``supply'' and \n     ``demand'' leaves these hapless pump-primers without a \n     connection to the real economy of individual goods and \n     services exchanged by individual human beings.\n       It is simply nonsensical to talk about the economy in only \n     aggregate terms. For example, there was a great deal of \n     excess capacity in America's buggy-whip manufacturing sector \n     in the early 20th century. Was that a sign of inadequate \n     consumer spending? Of course not. It was a sign that \n     Americans were changing their consumer patterns in response \n     to changes in technology. When households reduce their \n     spending on consumer goods, opting instead to pay down debt \n     or accumulate savings, they aren't failing to buy ``enough'' \n     stuff to keep the economy afloat. They are simply changing \n     their preferences in favor of future consumption (perhaps of \n     more expensive, more capital-intensive durable goods) and \n     away from some goods currently being produced.\n       Contrary to the crackpot theories of Rubin, Alter, New York \n     Times columnist Paul Krugman, and other neo-Keynesians, \n     recessions don't signify ``too much supply and not enough \n     demand.'' Recessions aren't creatures of human irrationality. \n     They signify a mismatch between what companies are making and \n     what their customer actually want at the time. Moreover, they \n     often signify a mismatch of time preferences, as consumers \n     signal (through more savings) that they are willing to \n     finance new investment today in order to buy something they \n     value more in the future. As long as capital markets are free \n     to coordinate the interests of producers and consumers, the \n     latter's increased savings will increase the pool of loanable \n     funds and thus encourage entrepreneurs (with lower interest \n     rates) to pursue new investments to satisfy consumer demands.\n       In other words, it is perfectly rational in a time of \n     recession for the government to focus its fiscal policy on \n     removing barriers to investment. These barriers include large \n     inflationary or deflationary changes in money (because these \n     destroy the ability of interest rates to communicate time \n     preferences accurately to entrepreneurs) and excessive taxes \n     on investment activities. The U.S. tax code retains a strong \n     and counterproductive bias against savings and investment, so \n     proposals to accelerate depreciation, reduce marginal tax \n     rates on capital gains, and reduce double-taxation of \n     corporate dividends are exactly the right medicine if the \n     goal is to speed the recovery of the American economy.\n       The answer to ``excess capacity'' in buggy-whip \n     manufacturing was not for the government to stimulate demand \n     for buggy whips. It was to allow industry to make needed \n     investments in automobile production. Similarly, American \n     consumers are signaling that the current mix of investment is \n     not generating what they want. So financial, physical, and \n     human capital must be redirected to new uses. This necessary \n     adjustment will happen more rapidly, and more successfully, \n     if Washington will ignore the new Dance of the Crackpots and \n     gets its fiscal act together.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Nov. 13, 2001]\n\n                          Meet Patriotic Pork\n\n       In normal times, pork-barrel spending is offensive. When \n     the nation is at war, it's considerably worse. But the \n     patriotism felt by most citizens since the terrorist attacks \n     has done nothing to restrain lobbyists' habit of putting \n     special interests ahead of national interests. Indeed, some \n     apparently can't tell the difference. Kenneth Kies of \n     PricewaterhouseCoopers, who has been pushing tax breaks that \n     would profit clients such as GE and IBM Corp., told The Post \n     it would have been ``irresponsible'' and even unpatriotic for \n     him to behave otherwise.\n       The provision that Mr. Kies advances would reduce taxes on \n     corporations' overseas investment income. It's hard to see \n     how this measure, which would encourage firms to keep money \n     outside the country, would do anything to stimulate the \n     American economy. Yet, Mr. Kies has sought to include it in \n     the stimulus package being prepared in the Senate. Meanwhile, \n     other lobbyists have pressed for equally egregious giveaways. \n     The stimulus bill that passed through committee last week \n     includes money for citrus growers and buffalo farmers and \n     producing electricity from chicken waste. It includes a tax \n     break on aviation fuel for crop-dusters. A wage credit \n     designed to encourage firms to hire welfare recipients has \n     been extended to businesses in lower Manhattan that hire \n     anyone.\n       As it fights a war on terrorism, the United States also \n     faces the threat of a global recession that could be the \n     worst in years. Thousands of ordinary workers have already \n     lost their jobs, and many thousands more may do so. The \n     economic stimulus will succeed only if it pumps money into \n     the bits of the economy where it will stimulate demand \n     effectively. That means targeting it at business investment \n     and at less well-off consumers, not tossing cash at random \n     supplicants.\n       The senators who larded the bill in committee ought to feel \n     ashamed of themselves, but they're not the only ones. It \n     seems to us that lobbyists such as Mr. Kies and clients such \n     as General Electric and IBM also bear some responsibility. \n     Normally in Washington we assume that such corporations will \n     grasp for whatever they can get; it's up to those in Congress \n     to resist their more egregious graspings. But do the chairmen \n     of GE and IBM really want to pursue their narrow self-\n     interest at a time when everyone else is being asked to think \n     of the common good--at a time of war? Imagine the stir it \n     would cause, and the impact it could have, if just one of \n     them said, ``Better spend the money on the troops. We'll be \n     back when the war is over.'' It's not too late for them to \n     show what patriotism might really mean.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, let us be accurate when we describe \neach side's proposals. Upon careful consideration, it is clear:\n  First, the Senate Republican Caucus stimulus proposal is not made up \nof ``leftover'' tax cuts;\n  Second, the Senate Republicans are not using September 11 as a device \nto advance ``ideological'' proposals; and\n  Third, the proposals in the Senate Republican Caucus stimulus package \nhave not been ``unanimously'' rejected by economists, editors, and \nopinion makers.\n  Madam President, I wish to discuss what I consider to be a crucial \ncomponent of this economic stimulus package: health insurance \nassistance for dislocated workers.\n  We all know about the high cost of health insurance. For dislocated \nworkers, its even higher. That's because worker continuation or \n``COBRA'' coverage is extremely expensive: coverage for a family can \ncost as much as $500 or $600 per month.\n  And workers who do not qualify for COBRA coverage--because they \nworked for State or local governments or in small businesses that are \nexempt--also face high health care costs.\n  So when it comes to providing health insurance assistance to \ndislocated workers, both sides in this debate are in agreement: People \nneed help, and they need it now.\n  Where we disagree is on how we get there. I have endorsed a program \nthat is already up and running, that has been tried and tested and \ntailored for\n\n[[Page S11779]]\n\nthe very purpose of providing ready help--not red tape--in emergencies \nlike this.\n  The Democrats, on the other hand, have endorsed the creation of a new \nFederal bureaucracy, consumed by red tape, that would take many months \nto get up and running.\n  First, let's talk about structure. For any program to work \nefficiently, it needs a backbone. The National Emergency Grant program \nhas been in place since 1998. The Labor Department has been getting \nfunds to States quickly and seamlessly for several years.\n  In fact, since September 11th, 3 States have already received funds \ntotaling $37 million, 3 more States are on the verge of approval, and \n13 additional State applications are expected. Clearly these numbers \nindicate the success the National Emergency Grant program has already \nachieved.\n  By comparison, the new COBRA subsidy program that the Democrats favor \nhas no backbone at all. There is no structure currently in place at the \nLabor Department or any other Federal agency to administer this new \nbenefit.\n  Next, let's take a look at process.\n  At the Federal level, the National Emergency Grant program requires \nnothing more than a new set of grant criteria allowing States to use \nfunds for health insurance. The criteria is being drafted under the \nLabor Department's existing authority, and can be made effective \nimmediately.\n  In contrast, the new COBRA subsidy program proposed by the Democrats \nrequires the deployment of an entirely new Federal program, requiring \nCongressional authorization and a formal regulatory process under the \nAdministrative Procedures Act before any benefits could be delivered.\n  Moreover, communications and oversight mechanisms would have to be \nestablished, and agencies would have to redirect resources to meet \nprogram goals.\n  At the State level, the National Emergency Grant program is familiar \nto governors and other State officials. The program relies on an \nexisting, streamlined process that has been in place since 1998. All \nStates have mechanisms in place to apply for grants and deliver \nbenefits.\n  By comparison, the Democrat-endorsed new Federal subsidy program \nwould impose new and costly mandates on States, which would have to \nauthorize and set-up new systems and departments to comply with the \nprogram's rules before workers could start receiving benefits. In many \ninstances, action at the State level would be frozen until State \nlegislatures acted to authorize and fund the new mandates.\n  Finally, let's address the most important question, the one that this \nwhole debate should turn on.\n  How long will this all take? How do the two approaches compare when \nit comes to getting workers health care assistance quickly?\n  The National Emergency Grant program can guarantee payments to States \nwithin 15 days of an application's approval. That speed is simply \nunsurpassed, and it's the chief reason I support using the grant \nprogram today.\n  The new Federal subsidy program, by contrast, would tie up funds in \nred tape until next summer. Under almost any scenario, financial \nassistance would not be available until federal regulations are issued, \nfinalized and made effective, a process that could take 6 months, at a \nminimum.\n  The bottom line is the Democrats' proposal would not be able to get \nbenefits to workers until it's too late. In addition to a lengthy \nprocess at the Federal level, States are faced with undue burdens of \nsetting up new systems to coordinate with the Federal Government and \nfinding new resources to do so.\n  The Democratic approach, while well-intentioned, reinvents the wheel. \nThe National Emergency Grant program, by comparison, needs no re-\ninvention. It is ready to go.\n  And so I urge my colleagues to opt for a system that's ready to go \nand to support the speedy delivery of funds to our dislocated workers \nthrough the National Emergency Grant program.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I also wish to discuss a Medicaid \nprovision in the Democrats' economic stimulus package that would \nprovide for an expansion of the Medicaid program to a new group of \nindividuals.\n  In order to fully evaluate the potential effectiveness of this \nproposal, it is important to take a look at State fiscal health.\n  The economic slow-down coupled with increased demands on health care \nsafety net programs is creating major strains on State budgets.\n  Just this year, 44 States have revenues below original forecasts; 28 \nStates have implemented or considered Medicaid cuts; 7 States have \nconvened special legislative sessions to address budget shortfalls; and \n11 States have determined a need for supplemental appropriations for \nMedicaid.\n  Today, Medicaid expenditures are 7.5 percent higher than they were in \n1999, and on average account for 19.5 percent of State spending. \nTherefore, Medicaid is a primary target for State budget cutbacks \nduring economic downturns.\n  States have reported a current cumulative revenue shortfall of $10 \nbillion, and predict this number to continue to grow. Moreover, new and \nunprecedented State responsibilities for homeland security are \nexacerbating serious fiscal conditions.\n  Therefore, any new State Medicaid option, no matter how generous the \nFederal match, is not an attractive proposal to States.\n  States simply do not have the resources to take up a new option under \nthe Medicaid program because States cannot absorb the State share of \nnew Medicaid enrollees.\n  In fact, a spokesperson for the National Governor's Association \nrecently stated that any proposal, including a Medicaid expansion, that \nrequires State funding would have ``zero take-up.''\n  Aside from the budget constraints that prevent a Medicaid expansion \nfrom being a viable health care proposal for dislocated workers, \nMedicaid expansions are not a timely response to addressing \nemergencies.\n  In order to develop a new Medicaid eligibility category, States would \nhave to develop a State plan amendment. This entails a planning period \nthat includes: setting income levels and time frames; creating outreach \nmaterials and caseworker training; and obtaining approval from the \nlegislature--assuming the legislature is still in session and many \naren't--and finally, getting approval from CMS.\n  By the time this process runs its course, the 12 month window would \nlikely be over. Even if the 12 month period isn't over, it wouldn't be \nan immediate benefit either to health coverage or as a fiscal stimulus.\n  A more immediate and expeditious approach to making health care \ncoverage available to displaced workers would be through the National \nEmergency Grant program.\n  This program should be expanded to allow States the opportunity to \ncover health care premiums, including COBRA premiums, for displaced \nworkers and their dependents.\n  The National Conference of State Legislatures agrees that flexible \nFederal funds would be the best approach to empowering States to \neffectively address State-specific needs of dislocated workers.\n  There are a number of ways that States could use National Emergency \nGrant funds to provide immediate health care access to dislocated \nworkers and their families including using State employee health \nsystems to unemployed individuals, utilizing community health centers, \nor contracting with insurers.\n  The National Emergency Grant program requires nothing more than a new \nset of grant criteria allowing States to use funds for health \ninsurance. The NEG proposal is an expedient means of making health \ncoverage available to dislocated workers and their families.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise in support of the economic \nstimulus package reported by the Committee on Finance.\n  Following the terrorist attacks on September 11, the slowdown in our \nNation's economy has been a matter of increasing concern. The ripple \neffect of the tragic events on September 11 has affected millions of \nAmericans who are dealing with the economic repercussions. Hundreds of \nthousands of workers have lost their jobs, and consumer and business \nconfidence has eroded during this time of uncertainty. The decrease in \neconomic activity is affecting companies ranging from small businesses \nto corporations, not to mention entire industries such as the airline \nand tourism industries.\n\n[[Page S11780]]\n\n  There is no doubt that an economic stimulus package would help to \nboost our Nation's weak economy. While the prospects for long-term \ngrowth remain strong, the terrorist attacks exacerbated weaknesses in \nmany business sectors and diminished hopes for a quick revival of an \nalready faltering economy and it now appears that the country will \nexperience a period of economic weakness and rising unemployment before \nreturning to a period of strong growth. A stimulus package that is \nwell-defined and specifically targeted for maximum effectiveness can \nplay an important role in promoting a rapid economic recovery.\n  As we all know, there are contrasting views among the members of \nCongress as to what components should be included in a stimulus package \nto maximize the stimulative effect on the economy. I believe that the \neconomic stimulus package should encourage increased spending as soon \nas possible to rejuvenate the economy, assist people who are most \nvulnerable during the economic slowdown, and restore business and \nconsumer confidence. However, it is important that fiscal discipline \nover the long-term be maintained in order to ensure economic growth in \nthe future. As such, legislation to stimulate the economy should only \nbe on a short-term basis so that the budget can return to surplus as \nthe economy recovers.\n  Given the importance of taking prompt action to stimulate the economy \nwhich is on the brink of a recession, I commend the Senator from \nMontana for his efforts in reporting an economic stimulus package out \nof the Finance Committee that can be considered on the Senate floor. I \nsupport components of the legislation, including provisions aimed at \naddressing the needs of America's newly-unemployed workers. In addition \nto losing their health benefits, the unemployed have no income to pay \nout-of-pocket for their health care needs. Under the Consolidated \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, COBRA, employers with 20 or \nmore employees must offer continued health insurance coverage to \nqualified employees and their families who lose health coverage when \nthey lose their jobs. Unemployed workers are required to pay up to 102 \npercent of the full premium, which averages about $220 per month for an \nindividual and $558 per month for a family. Only about 20 percent of \neligible workers use their COBRA option because premiums are so \nexpensive. The bill drafted by the distinguished Chairman of the \nFinance Committee will assist workers who are COBRA-eligible by \nproviding a 75 percent COBRA subsidy for up to twelve months. This \nsubsidy will help to ensure that many of the workers and their families \nwho could not previously afford COBRA coverage will be able to retain \ntheir health insurance. States would be allowed to cover the remaining \n25 percent of the COBRA premium for low-income COBRA-eligible \nindividuals and their families.\n  While the subsidy for COBRA will help a number of Americans, many of \nthe workers who will lose their jobs in the coming year will not be \neligible for COBRA coverage. These workers face an even greater barrier \nto health care access and include individuals who worked for small \nbusinesses, were in the individual health insurance market, worked in \ncompanies that have gone bankrupt, and those who could not afford \nhealth insurance before they were laid off. The bill by the Senator \nfrom Montana would help these workers who are not COBRA-eligible by \ngiving states the option to add a new eligibility category to Medicaid. \nThis new category would allow states to cover laid-off workers who are \nnot COBRA-eligible for up to 12 months.\n  Another critical component of the stimulus legislation is the \ntemporary increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, FMAP, \nrate for States. The Federal Government currently pays between 50 \npercent and 83 percent of the cost of Medicaid in each state, depending \non the state's per capita income in the three calendar years that are \nmost recently available. On average, the Federal Government pays 57 \npercent. Medicaid matching rates for fiscal year 2002 are based on \nstate per capita income data from 1997, 1998, and 1999--years in which \nthe national economy was strong. Consequently, matching rates are \nslated to be reduced for 29 states in 2002. The reduction in FMAP rates \nhas worsened an already bleak fiscal outlook for many states. In \nAugust, the Congressional Budget Office projected that Medicaid \nexpenditures in 2002 would be nine percent higher in 2002 than in 2001, \nwhile states projected that their revenues would rise just 2.4 percent. \nRising Medicaid expenditures have long been a serious concern to \nstates. The repercussions of the terrorist attacks on September 11 are \nleading most analysts to expect even higher state Medicaid costs \nbecause the economic downturn will make more people eligible for \nMedicaid and lower state revenues. It is during difficult financial \ntimes that the Medicaid program becomes a primary target of State \nbudget cuts. Yet, people need Medicaid during these times more than \never.\n\n  The FMAP increase proposed by the Finance Committee has three main \ncomponents. First, States that would have received a lower FMAP rate \nwould be ``held harmless'' and retain their fiscal year 2001 matching \nrate. Second, all States would receive a rate increase of 1.5 percent. \nFinally, States with higher than average unemployment rates over the \nprevious three months would receive an additional 1.5 percent rate \nincrease. To receive these FMAP increases, States would be required to \nmaintain current eligibility levels. The temporary increase in the FMAP \nis an important component of our Nation's economic stimulus policy. \nMedicaid is the largest Federal grant-in-aid to states. Temporarily \nincreasing the Federal matching rate could have broad positive \nramifications for State budgets, the impact of which would be rapid and \nwould not require additional Federal or State bureaucracy. These \nchanges would provide much needed health care to people in need by \nproviding states the resources to do so.\n  While Congress has taken certain actions to address the aftershocks \nof the terrorist attacks, we must also restore consumer confidence \nwhich has steadily declined since the attacks. In Hawaii, where we were \njust beginning to recover from our economic recession of 9 years, we \nfind ourselves once again facing an economic downturn. The State \nDepartment of Labor is currently working on the unemployment rates for \nOctober 2001 and has indicated that the number of people filing \nunemployment claims will be substantially higher than those filing in \nSeptember. This is disconcerting to me because in September 2001, \ntourism was down by 40 percent and more than 11,000 people who work in \nthe industry were unemployed. More specifically, 8,803 people in Hawaii \nfiled claims for partial or full unemployment benefits in the 15-day \nperiod from September 17, the Monday following the attacks, to Monday, \nOctober 1. On that Monday, the State Department of Labor estimated that \n1,012 workers filed claims statewide for unemployment. Before the \nattacks, the state of Hawaii received on the average 1,400 claims a \nweek. These statistics do not show what the cost has been to families \nin Hawaii where both parents are, or in many cases were, working in the \ntravel or tourism-related industries. These families are finding that \nthey do not have the money to pay for their mortgage, health insurance \nfor themselves and their children, and basic necessities.\n  The economic stimulus legislation reported by the Finance Committee \nwill help the people of Hawaii and the nation pay their mortgages, \nprovide healthcare to their children, and put food on the table. It \nwill provide 13 additional weeks of benefits to workers whose regular \nunemployment compensation has expired, require states to use the most \nrecent earnings data to determine eligibility and benefits, provide \ncoverage to part-time workers, and supplement the amount of benefits.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that extending unemployment \nbenefits and providing a health care subsidy will not stimulate the \neconomy, I must strongly disagree. I believe, as many of my colleagues \nhave stated during this debate, that this is exactly what our economy \nand the American people need to revitalize consumer confidence. As \nrecent research has shown, the Unemployment Insurance system is eight \ntimes as effective as the entire tax system in mitigating the impact of \na recession. In addition, the Unemployment Insurance system is able to \ntarget the very sector of society that needs the most economic \nstimulus. I\n\n[[Page S11781]]\n\nremind everyone that in every recession during the past 30 years, \nincluding the 1990-1991 recession under President George Bush, \nunemployment insurance benefits were extended.\n  It is clear that an economic stimulus package is needed to support \nour economy during these uncertain times and to promote a rapid \nrecovery. We have seen the Federal Reserve Board cut interest rates ten \ntimes this year with limited economic effect. Congress has also taken \nactions to provide some of that stimulus through emergency spending for \nrecovery efforts and to assist the airline industry. It is critical \nthat Congress promptly pass an economic stimulus package that will \nrejuvenate our faltering economy while assisting households who have \nbeen especially hard hit by the downturn in the economy. An economic \nstimulus package that promotes economic activity and includes \ncomponents to extend unemployment insurance benefits and health care \nsubsidies will greatly assist in getting our country's economy moving \nagain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley, for his help on this bill.\n  The choice in the vote before us, about to occur in 15 minutes, is \nvery simple. Do we want to proceed to help provide the stimulus to the \nAmerican economy? Do we want to help provide health insurance benefits \nto people who have lost their health insurance because of their lost \njobs? Do we want to provide an extension of unemployment benefits? Do \nwe want to help New York City, which has been wrecked and devastated by \nthe tragedy of September 11? Do we want to give disaster assistance to \nfarmers and ranchers whose incomes are lower year by year.\n  Do we want to do these things or not? That is the sole question \nbefore us. That is all it comes down to.\n  I am astounded that we hear these arguments that this is not an \nemergency. I have been in this body for 20-some years, and we have \nvoted for many items designated as emergencies that were far less of an \nemergency than what has happened to our country since September 11.\n  What were they? Let me tell you. First of all, the stand-alone bills \nwe have passed in this body: Unemployment insurance, in 1993, $5.7 \nbillion. That was designated an emergency, so we passed it.\n  IRS reform, if you can believe, $130 million--emergency. I don't know \nwhat the emergency was, but that is what Congress decided.\n  The airline bill this year, $17 billion over 10 years.\n  What were some other emergencies? We have had Hurricane Andrew. We \nhad floods in various States, and we have designated those all as \nemergencies, this Senate did, and they were emergencies.\n  And there have been more emergency designations. The Los Angeles \nriots in 1992 was designated an emergency. We provided additional \ndollars to help Los Angeles recover from the riots in 1992. The \nterrorist bombing in Oklahoma City--we designated that as an emergency \nto help Oklahoma City, as we should have.\n  Peacekeeping in Bosnia--we designated additional dollars for our \nmilitary, our Defense Department, because that was an emergency, \nfighting in Bosnia. That was designated an emergency, as well it should \nhave been.\n  Other natural disasters, hurricanes and floods.\n  I, for the life of me, cannot understand this argument that we hear \nfrom the other side that what has happened to this country since \nSeptember 11 is not an emergency, particularly in comparison to past \nevents that were designated emergencies. There is a provision in the \nBudget Act which says if we go over the technical spending limits, it \nhas to be an emergency to avoid a budget point of order. That is \nentirely up to the discretion of the Senate. In fact, the Congressional \nBudget Office, in this document, says:\n\n       Emergency spending is generally whatever the Congress and \n     the President deem it to be.\n\n  It is up to us to decide whether this is an emergency or not. We all \nknow what has happened to New York City, what has happened to our \neconomy--900,000 people out of work since this spring. That is the \nentire population of my State of Montana--900,000 people out of work. \nMost people who lose their health insurance do so because they have \nlost their jobs.\n  This is a super-emergency compared with the other events that this \nbody has designated emergencies. Why is this not an emergency, too? \nWhere are we? What are we thinking of? Hello? Wake up, Senate. Wake up \nand see what is happening to the country. Wake up and see what is \nhappening in New York City.\n\n  If all of us in the Senate were to go to Ground Zero, we would know \nthat is an emergency. Some have and some have not. All should.\n  The same occurs all across the country. Homes lost, people tossed out \nof work, farms and ranches going down the tubes because either they \ndon't have crops, it is a disaster, a drought or a flood, or they are \nnot getting their income. What is going on here? Of course it is an \nemergency.\n  Meanwhile, we have heard, and I am disappointed to have to say this, \ncharacterizations and mischaracterizations, representations and \nmisrepresentations, of what is in the Senate bill. Senators, some of \nthem, have taken easy shots, not getting to the heart of the matter. \nThat is regrettable.\n  I will sum up in 10 seconds. This is clearly an emergency, and I urge \nSenators to vote to waive the point of order, stop the roadblock. Let's \nroll. Let's help America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The assistant Republican leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, it is with regret I urge my colleagues to \nnot support our friends and colleagues on the other side. I will just \ntake issue with a few things that have been stated.\n  First, I compliment Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus because they \nworked together earlier this year in a bipartisan way and we passed tax \nrelief. It was done by a bipartisan vote in the Finance Committee, done \nby a bipartisan vote in the Senate, and by and large that bill became \nlaw. Senator Baucus and others alluded to the fact that we have already \npassed emergency legislation providing $40 billion to assist in the \naftermath of the September 11 events. That was done in a bipartisan \nfashion.\n  When we provided airline relief, that was done in a bipartisan \nfashion. Unfortunately, the bill we have before us, the so-called \nstimulus bill, has not been done in a bipartisan fashion. The makeup of \nthe Senate is so balanced that it cannot happen. Democrats cannot pass \na Democrat-only bill. The Republicans cannot pass a Republican-only \nbill. So we are going to have to work together.\n  Regrettably, that has not yet happened. The result is in the bill \nthat passed out of the Finance Committee, now modified by Senator \nByrd's amendment, and modified by additional amendments made by the \nchairman or the Democratic leader, we have a bill that not only will \nnot stimulate I think but may depress the economy. We have a bill that \nis not supported by both sides. We have a bill that obviously will not \nbecome law.\n  We have a statement by the administration that says:\n\n       The administration opposes passage of H.R. 3990 as reported \n     by the Senate Finance Committee.\n\n  The President said he doesn't like it. It is strongly opposed for \nlots of reasons. That is in direct contrast to the bipartisan work that \nmany of us as leaders did, meeting with the President several times \nafter the September 11 events to say let's work together. President \nBush agreed to the $40 billion. We haven't even spent the $40 billion. \nI am looking at the list that has $15 billion of new spending. That is \nin direct contradiction of the agreement we made with the President, \nthat we have in writing from the President, the agreement that said \n$686 billion and, oh, yes, we will do $40 billion of the emergency \nspending. We have not spent that $40 billion. Then they say we want \nanother $15 billion.\n  I do not doubt many of those provisions requested in the $15 billion \nwill be in the second $20 billion that is yet to be appropriated, yet \nto be allocated, in some cases yet to be requested.\n  The administration hasn't requested those. They are receiving input \nand requests from a lot of different agencies.\n\n[[Page S11782]]\n\n But they haven't requested it yet. Yet we are trying to say that is \nthe deal from last month. Now we are coming up with a new deal. Last \nyear's spending grew by over 14 percent. This year, we are going to \nspend about 8 percent. Now we have added $40 billion. Some people say, \nlet us add $15 billion on top of it. We may well support those \nattempts.\n  But I wouldn't be a bit surprised if we could not put those in the \n$20 billion additional upon which we have already agreed.\n  Looking at the substance of this legislation, there is nothing in \nthis legislation to really stimulate the economy. I was a businessman \nprior to coming to the Senate. I guess spending $35,000, which might be \n1 percent of this bill, or maybe a smaller amount, might be useful; or \n10 percent to appreciate for 1 year might move spending up a little \nbit. That is almost nothing.\n  Looking at all the other provisions in here, I was kind of shocked. \nSome of this is similar.\n  What is it about having a new sugar beet program? Sugar beet disaster \nprogram? What does that have to do with anything? What is stimulative \nabout having the Federal Government buying apples, apricots, asparagus, \nbell peppers, bison meat, cranberries, dried plums, lemons, peaches, \nand onions? What is stimulative about that? Are we going to spend up to \n$3 billion doing that?\n  Then I look and I see other items. I see the Amtrak program that the \nCongressional Budget Office says is a crummy way to do it. We are going \nto do it through allowing a tax credit, and so on.\n  The Congressional Budget Office did an analysis in September of this \nyear and said, in other words, that the tax credit funding mechanism \nwould essentially be a new and more expensive way for the Federal \nGovernment to assist Amtrak. They say it would be a lot more expensive. \nWe could just write them a check or allow them to use tax-exempt bonds. \nNo. We came in with a whole new game that is a lot more expensive.\n  This bill is not stimulative. It won't help the economy. It is not \nbipartisan. We need to defeat this package and go back to work--\nDemocrats and Republicans together--and pass a package that can be \nsupported by Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority leader \nis recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me just pick up where my colleagues \nfrom Oklahoma left off.\n  We have been ready for weeks to work in a bipartisan fashion. No one \nhas worked harder at reaching out to our Republican colleagues than the \nman sitting at my right, Senator Baucus, the manager of this bill. He \nhas tried on several occasions not only with the Republican colleagues \nin the Senate but with those in the House, and every time he was told, \nno, we can't do that because we have to offer our own package.\n  Don't talk to us about bipartisan until you are ready to do it.\n  I must say this is a facade--this notion that somehow the only way to \ndeal with whatever concerns the Senator from Oklahoma may have with \nregard to this bill is to raise a point of order on this bill. If they \ndo like a particular provision, let them do what we do in the Senate. \nLet them offer an amendment. If you do not like a particular provision, \noffer an amendment.\n  Let there be no doubt that the vote we are about to take on this \npoint of order which refuses to allow an emergency designation is a \nvote to kill homeland security for the remainder of this year. It is a \nvote to say no to our effort to protect our country from bioterrorism. \nIt is a vote to say no to important security for airports, ports, \nhighways, and tunnels. It is a vote to say no to additional help for \nlaw enforcement as we consider the vast array of issues we have to \nconfront. It is a vote to say no adequate unemployment compensation for \n7\\1/2\\ million unemployed workers. It is a vote to say no to helping \nthese families keep their health insurance. It is a vote to say no to \nthose 34 million workers out there who didn't get a nickel in a rebate \nlast summer.\n  There is a lot riding on this bill. This isn't just a point of order \nand some parliamentary vote you can hide behind, this is a real vote. \nThis is all we have to protect, for the remainder of this year, our \nopportunities to ensure that a meaningful economic recovery and \nhomeland security package can be passed. That is it--this vote. I hope \neverybody understands that there isn't a second or a third chance here.\n  I don't know what will happen if we fail a pass this particular test. \nBut I know this: it delays for a long period of time the help we can \nprovide for all of those who are saying we don't have time any longer. \nWe have to get on with protecting this country and the vast array of \nnew challenges we face as a country. We have to provide this \nunemployment insurance for people whose benefits are running out and \nfor those part-time workers are receiving no benefits at all.\n  I hope our Republican colleagues will understand that. I hope they \nwill join all 51 members of this caucus who are prepared to say, yes, \nthis is an emergency; yes, we need to move on; yes. We need to work \ntogether in a bipartisan way; yes, let's do it tonight.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the motion to waive section 205 of House Concurrent \nResolution 290.

Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the purposes of the pending amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, very briefly, for the information of my \ncolleagues, this second point of order challenges the amendment for \ngoing below the revenue floor and for going above the spending ceilings \nof the budget resolution.\n  The amendment does, in fact, violate the revenue floor and spending \nceiling.\n\n[[Page S11783]]\n\n That is true. It is also true that the House bill, which will then \ncome up, also violates the Budget Act for the same reasons, as does the \nbill offered by my good friend from Iowa, as does the White House \nproposal.

On this vote, the yeas are 51, the nays are \n47.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I supported a motion to waive the Budget \nAct with respect to a point of order raised against the substitute \namendment to H.R. 3090, even though there are a number of provisions in \nthat amendment that are troubling.\n  Just a few weeks ago, this body voted to provide emergency funding to \nthe nation's airlines. We recognize the special situation caused by the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, and understood that if we failed to \nact, the consequences for those firms, and for the economy as a whole, \ncould well have been devastating.\n  At the time of that vote, I noted that we also needed to address the \nproblems facing the workers in those firms. This legislation will do \nthat, in part, and it will also provide assistance to other families \nwho have been thrown out of work by the economic slowdown, and should \nprovide the weakened economy with a boost.\n  Unfortunately, a number of special interests have taken advantage of \nthis human and economic adversity to advance their own agenda. The \nmeasure that passed the other body is teeming with special interest tax \nbreaks that do little or nothing for the economy as a whole in the \nshort term, and seriously jeopardize our long term budget position. The \nsubstitute amendment before us is vastly superior in this respect. It \nprovides far more benefit for our economy in the short term, while \nminimizing the long term impact.\n  Nevertheless, there are a number of special interest spending and tax \nprovisions in the amendment that raise serious questions, such as \nprovisions that provide money for citrus growers and buffalo farmers \nand tax breaks for electricity produced from chicken waste and aviation \nfuel for crop-dusters. A provision common to both the substitute \namendment and the House-passed bill would reduce taxes on corporations' \noverseas investment income. As the Washington Post noted in a recent \neditorial: ``It's hard to see how this measure, which would encourage \nfirms to keep money outside the country, would do anything to stimulate \nthe American economy.''\n  The substitute amendment before us, even with its flaws, is far more \nfiscally responsible than the House bill, but as this legislation \nproceeds there is a real risk that it will continue to pick up still \nmore special interest provisions. Indeed, the House version is largely \na lobbyist's wish list. Unless this body is able to restrain itself, \nand resist efforts to advance special interest spending and tax breaks, \nthe costs of a fiscal stimulus measure will outweigh any benefit it \nprovides to our economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/14/senate-section/article/S11783-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I joined my colleague from Arkansas, \nSenator Hutchinson, to introduce a bill of the utmost importance to our \nfarmers.\n  Since the passage of the Freedom to Farm bill in 1996, our farmers \nhave toiled under clouds of uncertainty. Quite simply stated, our \nNation needs a farm policy that works for working farmers.\n  That is why I and Senator Hutchinson, along with Senator Helms of \nNorth Carolina, Senator Miller of Georgia, and Senators Breaux and \nLandrieu of Louisiana, are proud to offer a new alternative.\n  We offer a farm bill that will ensure a strong safety net for \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers.\n  We offer a farm bill that will increase investment in conservation \nprograms by 80 percent.\n  We offer a farm bill that provides more effective support for \ndisadvantaged working families through nutrition programs.\n  We offer a farm bill that will increase and improve our Nation's \nagricultural trade programs, such as the Food Aid program that sends \nfood to the neediest nations.\n  We offer a farm bill that will preserve and protect our Nation's \nforests and environment while investing in rural America.\n  For too many years, while the American economy at large was posting \nastonishing and unprecedented gains, our agricultural producers have \nnot benefited from our prosperity.\n  It is not only our farmers who are suffering as a result of failed \ngovernment policy. The institutions of small-town and rural America \nlocal banks and merchants, feed and supply stores, equipment dealers, \neven corner groceries and family-owned hardware stores are all caught \nin the web of financial collapse.\n  Here is a letter I received from a young farmer in northeast Arkansas \njust a few months ago. He says that his family's farm is nearing ``a \npoint of no return,'' and that if the crisis continues, he will have to \nleave the land that his grandfather worked.\n  Here is a letter from a bank president in southeast Arkansas, who \nnotes that when he moved to his community in 1969, a new John Deere \ncombine sold for about $15,000. Today, a comparable model sells for \n$220,000. Fuel for that combine cost 15 cents per gallon in 1969, he \nwrites; today, a gallon of diesel fuel costs $1.05. He goes on to note \nthat while a farmer could expect to receive $3 for a bushel of rice 32 \nyears ago, today he only gets $2.7 for the same bushel. The costs \nskyrocket, but the returns on these investments continue to fall.\n  Here is a letter from a young woman in east Arkansas who works a 600-\nacre rice and soybean farm with her husband and child. Her husband is \nso depressed that he needs counseling and\n\n[[Page S11784]]\n\nmedication. She can't let her child participate in after-school sports \nbecause of the additional costs entailed. She writes that where she and \nher family once felt pride in their sense of independence and self-\nsufficiency, today they feel only shame at having to rely on loans and \nsupplemental income payments to get by.\n  These stories are not unusual. In many rural areas, they are becoming \nthe norm. We cannot afford to let our farmers continue suffering like \nthis. They can't wait another year for us to pass a farm bill. Their \nproblems are here today.\n  Our bill will address their problems. Our bill will restore to them a \nbetter economic future. Our bill will restore to them their hope, so \nthat they can build a better future for their children.\n  I am proud to be a coauthor of this bill, and I am proud to say that \nI will take my stand to fight for its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/14/senate-section/article/S11784-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred March 29, \n1997 in Huntington Beach, CA. Michael Reign Caywood, 21, allegedly beat \nand robbed a gay man in his home. The assailant, who allegedly has ties \nto white supremacist groups, was charged with assault and residential \nrobbery in connection with a hate crime.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/14/senate-section/article/S11784-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        NOVARTIS PHARMACEUTICALS\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, more than at any other time in \nmy career we are a nation that is unified. We are a nation that, \nrecognizing a common goal, is rallying with a knowledge that we will \nachieve a remarkdable thing. It is extraordinary to witness.\n  One of the things that has always made this nation great, is that \nwhen we witness that which is extraordinary, we try to emulate it. You \nsee it one thousand times a day, from the magnitude of contributions \nthat have flooded to relieve every heroic firefighter's family, to the \nfull sized flags flying from the back of Topeka pickup trucks, to the \nonce rare act offering a smile and a bid of good morning to a stranger \non the street.\n  And these acts of unity have not been the lot of individuals alone, \nnor have they been reserved to a response to the tragedy of September \n11. It is one of these acts of unity--one of these recognitions of a \ncommon goal--that brings me to the floor today.\n  Last week the Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation announced their \nnew CareCard drug discount program to aid the needy elderly who lack \nprescription drug coverage. This new program will translate to a \nsavings of 30 to 40 percent off of retail pharmaceutical prices for the \nseniors with the greatest need. For this remarkable thing, Novartis \ndeserves our thanks.\n  Over the past several years, the issue of the increasing cost of \nprescription drugs for seniors has remained a dominant story. Nearly \nevery American has read of seniors forced to chose between the food to \nsustain them, the rent to shelter them or the medicine to keep them \nwell. Because our antiquated Medicare system includes only very limited \nprescription drug coverage, the neediest senior have to figure out a \nway to pay for their medication.\n  In the absence of Congressional action to fundamentally reform and \nmodernized the Medicare system in a way that would include prescription \ndrug coverage, companies, like Novartis, have acted. In the case of the \nCareCard program. Novartis is offering seniors age 65 or older, with an \nannual income of less than 300 percent of the Federal Poverty Level who \ndo not currently have prescription drug coverage substantial discounts \non their products. This program could translate to $10 million \nAmericans who may now be able to afford the medicine they need.\n  All of this said, Mr. President, that we congratulate Novartis for \nstepping up and making these discounts available to seniors, should not \nserve as an excuse for Congress to continue not to act. That Novartis \nhas done the right thing, is not reason for us to do nothing. Medicare \nis a 36 year old program that has not kept up with our health care \neconomy. We must modernize Medicare. We must reform Medicare. We must \nmake prescription drug coverage available for all seniors; and we must \nact soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/14/senate-section/article/S11784-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11784-S11785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:57 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 2330) making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural Development, \nFood and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies programs for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for other purposes.\n                                  ____\n\n  At 2:17 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 400.

A bill to designate buildings 315, 318, and 319 located at \nthe William J. Hughes Technical Center of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration in Atlantic City, New Jersey, as the ``Frank R. \nLautenberg Aviation Security Complex''; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nhonor one of the finest Senators to represent my State of New Jersey, \nFrank R. Lautenberg. My bill would designate specific buildings located \nat the Federal Aviation Administration's William J. Hughes Technical \nCenter in Atlantic City, New Jersey as the ``Frank R. Lautenberg \nAviation Security Complex.''\n  Designating these buildings as the Frank R. Lautenberg Aviation \nSecurity Complex would be an appropriate tribute to Senator Lautenberg. \nNo one has been a greater champion for transportation interests in the \nUnited States Senate. Senator Lautenberg consistently made \ntransportation a top priority and served for many years as Chairman of \nthe Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, as well as serving on \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. Over the years, he \naccumulated a long list of related accomplishments.\n  For example, he authored legislation to ban smoking on all flights \nwithin the United States, which provides relief from secondhand smoke \nto thousands of air travelers annually. He was a staunch defender of \nAmtrak, successfully led efforts to protect its funding in the face of \nthose who oppose our national passenger rail system, and developed \nlandmark legislation to authorize the issuance of bonds to support high \nspeed rail. He also wrote the law that increases the legal drinking age \nfrom 18 to 21, which has been credited with saving countless lives on \nour nation's highways.\n  I also would note that Senator Lautenberg played an important role in \nsupporting the Technical Center in Atlantic City, so it is especially \nappropriate that he be honored at the Center.\n  Senator Lautenberg always worked hard to steer Federal funds to New \nJersey for both road and rail projects, and had considerable success. \nThese projects have been immensely important in easing traffic \ncongestion in New Jersey, our Nation's most densely populated State. As \na member of the committees that will reauthorize the transportation \nbill, the Environment and Public Works and Banking Committees, I hope \nto continue Senator Lautenberg's legacy in this area. In particular, I \nam hoping to work for funding of a new commuter rail tunnel across the \nHudson River that would link New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan.\n  Beyond his many successes in the area of transportation, Frank \nLautenberg had many other accomplishments during his 18-year career in \nthe Senate. He authored legislation barring people convicted of \ndomestic violence from owning a gun. He wrote the Right-to-Know Act, \nwhich requires companies to disclose the chemicals they produce and \nstore. He wrote the Public and Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Act, \nwhich has made a huge difference in improving the lives of residents of \npublic housing. Also, as the Ranking Member of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, he played a major role in debates over fiscal policy, and in \nthe development of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which helped lead \nto our first budget surpluses after a long history of deficits.\n  Designating these buildings as the Frank R. Lautenberg Aviation \nSecurity Complex is a small but important way we can pay tribute to a \nman who has contributed so much to our State and our Nation. I \npersonally am honored to serve as his successor in the Senate, and I \nhope that the Congress will act quickly on this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1682\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF FRANK R. LAUTENBERG AVIATION \n                   SECURITY COMPLEX.\n\n       Buildings 315, 318, and 319 located at the William J. \n     Hughes Technical Center of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration in Atlantic City, New Jersey, shall be known \n     and designated as the ``Frank R. Lautenberg Aviation Security \n     Complex''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the buildings \n     referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to \n     the Frank R. Lautenberg Aviation Security Complex.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1683. A bill to amend the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983 to \npermit States to use administrative funds to pay costs relating to the \nprocessing, transporting, and distributing to eligible recipient \nagencies of donated wild game; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, since September 11 we have all seen the \ngenerous spirit of volunteerism in our communities. Americans have \ngiven blood, donated to soup kitchens and clothing drives, all in \nrecord numbers. Although this tragedy has heightened the levels of \ngiving, Americans were helping each other through the tough times long \nbefore September 11. I rise today to recognize one type of program that \nis helping to feed families caught up in the economic downturn.\n  Take Tim Powers. Tim lives in Lisbon, IA. During the week, he works \nhard at Whitetails Unlimited. but on the weekends, Tim runs a game \ndonation program. First, Tim negotiates with local butchers for reduced \nrates on the meat processing. Then, he\n\n[[Page S11791]]\n\nreaches out to local hunting groups and lets them know they can donate \ntheir extra game to Iowa's soup kitchens. It is a great way to help \nthose in need, it's all volunteer, and it makes sense. Similar programs \nhave popped up across America, like Hunters for the Hungry, Farmers and \nHunters Feeding the Hungry, and Sportsmen Against Hunger.\n  Tim Powers and these organizations remind us all that hunting isn't \nsimply a sport. It takes me back to my childhood in Cumming, IA. I was \none of six kids and my father was a coal miner, so there were some hard \ntimes. Often, hunting helped to decide how well my family would eat. \nBelieve me, that will motivate you to become a good shot. And we hunted \njust about anything that moved, not just deer but ducks, pheasants, and \nrabbits.\n  But when we did have more than enough to feed the family, we shared \nit with the neighbors. It was the right thing to do. And today, Tim \nPowers and others are keeping that type of community spirit alive.\n  These efforts are desperately needed. Buying meat is expensive and \nfood banks are already stretched too thin. In 1997 alone, more than 26 \nmillion Americans sought emergency food assistance. And the Department \nof Agriculture reports that during between 1996 and 1998 approximately \n10 million U.S. households did not have access to enough food to meet \ntheir basic needs.\n  Game donation programs can make a difference in the fight against \nhunger. One of the only problems, however, is the cost of the meat \nprocessing. Tim Powers convinced his employer, Whitetails Unlimited, \nthat this program needs their support. Once a year they sponsor a \ndinner to fundraise for him, last year he raised enough money to \nprocess about 50 deer. That is a miracle for the soup kitchens in Linn \nCounty and it can happen in other places as well. There are thousands \nof hunters who would like to do so much more, but the funds for \nprocessing always fall short.\n  Time and again, hunters have shown that we enjoy the activity and \nwe're happy to go out of our way if that activity also serves to \nprovide meat for those who are less fortunate. The only catch is the \ncost of processing. I hear it again and again, local programs spring up \nbut can't raise enough funds to sustain the cost of processing. With \ngame donation programs in a community everybody wins. The meat goes \nfrom hunters in the area to needy families within the State, there is \nnothing more basic than a community taking care of its own. We need to \ndo whatever we can to help sustain these local programs.\n  That is why I am introducing the Hunters Help the Hungry Act. This \nlegislation would authorize states to use administrative funds from the \nEmergency Food Assistance Program, TEFAP, to pay for the processing \ncosts of donated wild game. TEFAP is a USDA food distribution program \nthrough which commodity foods are made available to the States. Food is \nthen provided to food banks, soup kitchens, and food pantries for \ndistribution to the public.\n  In addition, my legislation would increase the authorization of TEFAP \nadministrative funds from $50 million to $70 million. This increase is \nintended to cover the potential cost of game donation programs in every \nState, however, the legislation gives States the flexibility to use \nthose funds for their current TEFAP programs, if they so choose.\n  I want to stress this point: States would not be required to use any \nof the additional funds for the hunting-donation programs. My bill \nwould simply provide them with the option and the flexibility to use a \nportion of their TEFAP administrative funds to process donated game. \nThe remainder of the funds would cover traditionally allowable expenses \nlike transportation and storage costs, and gleaning and other \nactivities.\n  In addition, the USDA Secretary would have the ability to place a cap \non the percentage of administrative funds that could be used to process \ngame meat. As always, the TEFAP program will continue to be primarily \nfocused on commodities. My legislation would simply give States the \nflexibility to support local game donation programs as a part of their \nanti-hunger efforts.\n  This legislation is rooted in basic common sense and traditional \nAmerican values, values that America's hunters understand. Too often \nour hunters are only mentioned on the Senate floor when it comes time \nto debate a crime bill. Instead, my legislation thanks America's \nhunters and supports the good they do in our communities. I think it \njust makes sense, and I hope that my colleagues will support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. DeWine, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1685. A bill to meet the needs of children when preparing for and \nresponding to acts of terrorism; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from \nOhio, Senator DeWine, and my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, in \nintroducing legislation today to strengthen our Nation's ability to \nprotect children during times of terrorism and bioterrorism.\n  It's a terrible thing that we have to be here to talk about how to \nprotect children from terrorism. But, as all of us know only too well, \nthe terrorist incidents of September 11 have changed the world for all \nof us. In order to ensure that the needs of children are not overlooked \nas a national terrorism response package is drafted, we are introducing \nthis legislation today specifically geared toward the needs of \nchildren. Our bill would: strengthen emergency and rescue services for \nchildren; ensure that all needed medicines in the case of bioterrorist \nattack can be safely used for children; ensure that the mental health \nneeds of children directly affected by terrorist and bioterrorist \nattacks are addressed; and, enable the Secretary of HHS to determine \nand respond to other unique needs that children may have related to \nterrorism.\n  Shockingly, not all ambulances, hospitals and emergency personnel are \nprepared to handle children's emergencies, let alone emergencies \nrelated to terrorism. In fact, fewer than half of all hospitals with \nemergency departments have the equipment necessary to stabilize \nseriously injured children.\n  Our bill will expand the Emergency Medical Services for Children \nGrant Program administered by the Department of Health and Human \nServices. Those first on the ground need to be prepared to deal with \nthe specific needs of children in any type of terrorist or bioterrorist \nattack.\n  Children are especially vulnerable to the chemical and biological \nagents that could be deployed in a terrorist attack. Nerve gas agents, \nsuch as Sarin gas for example, are denser than water and concentrate \nlower to the ground, in the breathing zone of children. And the more \npermeable skin of newborns and children puts them at risk of greater \nexposure to toxins that may be absorbed.\n  It is crucial to secure information on dosage, possible side effects \nand the effectiveness of various agents in our children. Just a few \nweeks ago, the Senate unanimously passed the reauthorization of a law I \nauthored with Senator DeWine to address the appalling lack of pediatric \ninformation about the drugs we used for our kids. The law, which has \nbeen an unparalleled success, provides a market incentive for drug \ncompanies to test their products for use in kids and to create kid-\nfriendly drug formulations.\n  Our re-authorization of this law will ensure that all approved drugs \nthat are identified as important for children will get studied, either \nby the manufacturer or by a third party with pediatric clinical \nexpertise. These third party studies will be paid for using private \ndollars from an NIH Foundation or using the $20 million authorized in \nthe bill for this purpose.\n  Today, we are asking the Secretary to do the same for medicines that \ncan be used to protect our kids in a bioterrorist attack. Our proposal \nauthorizes funding to ensure that the products that are important for \nchildren will get studied by manufacturers and by qualified third \nparties to determine how a child's body breaks down and absorbs the \nmedicine, potential risks, and effectiveness.\n  Without adequate information about how a drug works in kids of \ndifferent ages and sizes, children are more likely to be under- or \nover-dosed or to experience dangerous side effects. By instructing the \nSecretary to contract our\n\n[[Page S11792]]\n\nneeded studies, we can ensure that we get vital information on the \nmedicines needed most for our kids.\n  Since September 11 our children have been faced with images and \nemotions that are difficult for them to understand and deal with. They \nhave seen airplanes crashing into places where people work, they have \nseen people fleeing from collapsing buildings, they have family members \nsearching and grieving for missing loved ones, they have heard about \npeople being poisoned and dying from the mail. All of this is beyond \nbelief. These are very complicated and stressful times for all of us, \nbut especially for children.\n  Children sense the anxiety and tension in adults around them. And, \nlike adults, children experience the same feelings of helplessness and \nlack of control that disaster-related stress can bring about. Unlike \nadults, however, children have little experience to help them place \ntheir current situation into perspective.\n  Our proposal authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nprovide immediate emergency mental health and substance abuse \nprevention and treatment services to those children residing in \ncommunities directly affected by terrorism. This new authority will \ndouble the amount of emergency funding for mental health services and \nensure that children's mental health needs are specifically addressed. \nThis new initiative will provide approximately $17.5 million in \nemergency funds for children's mental health services.\n  To deal with other unique needs of children, we provide the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services with broad authority to allocate emergency \ncrisis response grants. Such grants could be made at the Secretary's \ndiscretion to schools, child care centers, Head Start centers, or other \nentities dealing with children to assist in developing evacuation \nplans, in training personnel to understand children's needs related to \nterrorism, and how to communicate effectively with children and parents \nabout terrorism. Millions of children spend more than half their waking \nhours with teachers and other caregivers. These professionals must be \nable to understand what children are going through and be prepared to \nhelp them get through it. As we've seen over the last few weeks, in \npractice, this is not always as easy to do as it sounds.\n  The President has asked that all Americans get back to normal.

For example, they must be \n     trained in emergency response and evacuation plans developed \n     by local authorities to protect children during times of \n     terrorist threats or incidents. Children must have \n     appropriate medicines in the appropriate dosages to help \n     protect them from chemical and biological agents that might \n     be deployed in a terrorist attack. They must also have access \n     to mental health services to address the emotional trauma \n     that can accompany acts of terrorism.\n\n\n           emergency medical and rescue services for children\n\n       Increases federal support for EMS training to ensure that \n     first responders (i.e., firefighters, police, paramedics, \n     etc.) are trained and equipped to address the specific \n     medical needs of children.\n       More than doubles the resources available through the \n     Department of Health and Human Services Emergency Medical \n     Services for Children program from $18.9 million per year to \n     $45 million.\n\n\n     appropriate medicines for children in the face of bioterrorism\n\n       Authorizes funds to enable the Secretary of HHS, in \n     consultation with the FDA, NIH, and the pharmaceutical, \n     biotech, and device industries, to ensure that every medicine \n     identified for potential use for kids in responding to \n     bioterrorism can be studied to determine proper pediatric \n     dosing and effectiveness. This is critical because children \n     are simply not smaller versions of adults--their bodies react \n     to drugs differently. Without adequate information about how \n     a drug\n\n[[Page S11793]]\n\n     works in kids of different ages and sizes, they are more \n     likely to be under- or over-dosed or to experience dangerous \n     side effects.\n\n\n                        children's mental health\n\n       Establishes grants for Emergency Mental Health Services for \n     Children that would ensure that children directly affected by \n     terrorist acts would be able to receive a comprehensive array \n     of community-based mental health services. With these grants, \n     communities could develop integrated systems of care that \n     coordinate services among multiple child-serving agencies in \n     incorporating parental involvement at every stage of service \n     delivery. These grants would be administered by the Center \n     for Mental Health Services (CMHS), housed within the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \n     (SAMHSA). The Emergency Mental Health Services for Children \n     grants would be funded at about $17.5 million per year--up to \n     2.5 percent of total SAMHSA appropriations.\n\n\n           crisis response grants addressing children's needs\n\n       The Secretary may provide grants to eligible entities to \n     increase the coordination and the development of bioterrorism \n     preparedness efforts relating to the needs of children. Such \n     grants would be provided at the discretion of the Secretary \n     using information the Secretary identifies as being critical \n     to meeting the physical and health-related needs of children. \n     The Secretary may use funds from emergency appropriations \n     made available earlier this year.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friends and \ncolleagues, Senator Dodd and Senator Collins, to introduce the ``Kids \nand Terrorism Preparedness Act.'' I want to thank Senators Dodd and \nCollins, for their commitment and dedication to protecting America's \nchildren. They are two of this Nation's strongest advocates on behalf \nof kids, and I have enjoyed working together with them on a variety of \nchildren's health and safety issues.\n  Most recently, just a few short weeks ago, Senator Dodd and I were \nable to pass our Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which is going \nto help make sure that children get the right kinds of medicines when \nthey are sick and in the proper dosages.\n  As the father of eight and grandfather of six, I can tell you from \nfirst-hand experience that we can not treat children the same way we \ntreat adults. This is true for prescribing medicines to protect \nchildren when they are sick. And, it is also true in implementing \nmeasures to protect our nation against terrorism, especially chemical \nand biological terrorism.\n  This is why it is so important that as we begin to re-assess how we \nrespond to terrorist attacks, we think long and hard about the \ndifferences between adults and children. The bill we are introducing \ntoday goes a long way toward ensuring that the needs of kids are taken \ninto consideration. It goes a long way toward making sure that those \nwho respond to terrorist attacks are prepared to treat and deal with \nchildren and their unique needs.\n  We have to realize that children simply are not small adults. For \nexample, children breathe faster than adults, which means they will \ninhale poisons and chemicals more quickly than adults.\n  Children lose body heat faster than adults and so if a child needed a \ndecontamination shower as a result of a chemical attack, firefighters \nand emergency crews will need to take special precautions for children, \nlike setting up heat lamps to keep them warm so they do not go into \nshock. It also means providing those kids with a safe, comfortable \nenvironment to ease their fears.\n  Children often can not swallow pills. We need to make sure that we \nhave antibiotics or other medicines that are in forms, like liquids, \nthat children can take.\n  And obviously, children are physically smaller than adults, they are \nlower to the ground, which can put them in the direct path of some \nagents, like chlorine or sarin gas, both of which are heavier than air \nand settle lower to the ground where children would be breathing.\n  I have talked to firefighters and pediatricians in Ohio, who have \ntold me that they simply are under-prepared right now to treat \nchildren's needs. The reality is that today fewer than half of our \nNation's hospitals with emergency departments have the necessary \nequipment to treat sick and injured kids. We need to change that, and \nsoon.\n  The bill we are introducing today will help change things. First, our \nbill would increase the funding of the Emergency Medical Services for \nChildren block grant from $17 million to $45 million. By doing so, we \nare helping the first responders, those at the local level, get the \ntraining they need to meet the special needs of children.\n  Furthermore, our bill gives the Secretary of the Department of Health \nand Human Services, HHS, the flexibility to provide $17.5 million in \ngrants to eligible entities to address children's mental health needs \nand provide substance abuse prevention and treatment options for \nchildren in the event of a terrorist emergency.\n  The bill also allows the Secretary of HHS to provide grants to \neligible entities to enable such entities to increase the coordination \nand the development of bio-terrorism preparedness efforts relating to \nthe needs of special populations, including children. Such grants are \nprovided at the discretion of the secretary using information the \nsecretary identifies as being critical to meeting the physical and \nhealth-related needs of children.\n  In conclusion, children represent a huge portion, 30 percent, almost \none-third, of our Nation's population. We have an obligation to protect \nthem. And, our bill today, is a step toward doing just that. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in support of this legislative effort. It is a \ngood bill and one that can make very real, very positive differences in \nthe lives of America's children.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, \nSenator Dodd and Senator DeWine in introducing the Kids and Terrorism \nPreparedness Act to strengthen our ability to protect our children as \nour Nation prepares for and responds to acts of terrorism.\n  Every generation has a defining event. Our parents will never forget \nthe attack on Pearl Harbor, and the baby boomers will never forget the \nday President Kennedy was shot. This generation will always remember \nSeptember 11 and the horrific images of the two airliners slamming into \nthe twin towers of the World Trade Center.\n  These terrorist attacks have evolved into an ongoing crisis that has \ncreated some particularly difficult challenges for our Nation's \nchildren. Thousands of children lost a family member or loved one on \nSeptember 11. Tens of thousands more are close to another child who \nsuffered an immediate loss. Millions of other children across the \ncountry watched the repeated broadcasts of the fiery crashes, workers \nfalling to their deaths, the terrible building collapses and the panic \nthat followed. These images have enacted an emotional and psychological \ntoll on all Americans, but children are particularly vulnerable. \nMoreover, the current anthrax scare has only added to the anxiety of \nchildren who now fear that their own houses may not be a sanctuary \nagainst a bioterrorist attack delivered through the mail.\n  As our Nation takes steps to plan and prepare for future attacks, it \nis critical that we consider the unique needs of children who are more \nsusceptible to biological and chemical attacks. Since they are smaller \nthan adults, they may get sick from smaller amounts of harmful \nsubstances. They have a higher respiratory rate than adults, which \nmeans that they would get relatively larger doses of an inhaled \nsubstance in the same period of time. Moreover, some dense chemical \nagents, like chlorine and sarin, accumulate close to the ground, right \nin the breathing zone of children.\n  The problem is compounded because our current tools to combat \nterrorism are now always sensitive to children's needs. For example, \nCipro, which is being widely prescribed for people who have been \nexposed to anthrax, is generally not recommended for use by children \nbecause of concerns that it can impair bone and joint growth. It is \nclear that immediate steps must be taken to develop drugs and vaccines \nappropriate for children that can be used to respond to a bioterrorist \nthreat or attack.\n  Children also need different sized medical equipment from adults. I \nam therefore extremely troubled that, at present, many ambulances and \nemergency departments do not have child-sized equipment and supplies, \nsuch as oxygen masks, IV-tubes and neck braces. We must therefore do \nmore to support our Emergency Medical Services workers and ensure that \nthey are trained and equipped to meet the specific medical needs of \nchildren.\n\n[[Page S11794]]\n\n  The legislation we are introducing today will help us to meet these \nspecial needs of children as our nation prepares to defend itself \nagainst terrorist threats. For example, it more than doubles the \nresources available through the Department of Health and Human Services \nEmergency Medical Services for Children program to ensure that first \nresponders, our firefighters, our police, and our paramedics, are \ntrained and equipped to handle the special medical needs of children.\n  It also authorizes grants to enable the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, in consultation with the Food and Drug Administration, the \nNational Institutes of Health, and the pharmaceutical, biotech, and \ndevice industries, to formulate a plan for the development of new, and \nenhancement of existing, drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, and medical \ndevices that may be appropriate to prevent and treat children who are \nexposed to a bioterrorist attack. This is critical because children are \nnot simply smaller versions of adults, their bodies react to drugs \ndifferently.\n  To help meet the mental health needs of children in crisis, the \nlegislation authorizes grants to be administered by the Center for \nMental Health Services within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration for emergency mental health prevention and \ntreatment services for children who are directly affected by terrorist \nacts. To deal with other unique needs of children, our bill provides \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services with broad authority to \nallocate emergency crisis response grants. Such grants could be made at \nthe Secretary's discretion to State and local governments or public or \nprivate non-profit organizations serving children to increase the \ncoordination and the development of bioterrorism preparedness efforts \nrelating to the needs of children.\n  These are difficult and dangerous times, but all is not bleak. We can \ntake great comfort from the extraordinary resources with which America \nis blessed. Besides our spiritual muscle, we have a proof of economic, \nscientific, and material strength which we have only just begun to tap. \nThe legislation we are introducing today will help to strengthen our \nresponse to the terrorist threat by ensuring that the special needs of \nchildren are not overlooked, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us \nas cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reid, Mr. Wellstone, \n        and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1686. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for patient protection by limiting the number of mandatory \novertime hours a nurse may be required to work in certain providers of \nservices to which payments are made under the Medicare Program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues, \nSenator Kerry, Senator Reid, Senator Wellstone, and Senator Clinton, in \nintroducing the Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act.\n  Current Federal safety standards limit work hours for pilots, flight \nattendants, truck drivers, railroad engineers and other professionals, \nin order to protect the public safety. However, no similar limitation \ncurrently exists for the Nation's nurses, who care for many of our most \nvulnerable Americans.\n  The Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act will limit mandatory overtime \nfor nurses in order to protect patient safety and improve working \nconditions for nurses. Across the country, the widespread practice of \nmandatory overtime means that over-worked nurses are often required to \nprovide care in circumstances that are unacceptable. Restricting \nmandatory overtime will ensure that nurses are ready and able to \nprovide the highest quality of care to their patients.\n  As Linda McMahon, an emergency room nurse at Brockton Hospital in \nMassachusetts said, ``After no supper break, no time to go to the \nbathroom, you're on your feet for a solid 8\\1/2\\ hours, and then they \nlook at you and say you're going to work for another shift.''\n  Some hospitals are taking action to deal with this serious problem. \nBrockton Hospital in Brockton, MA, and St. Vincent Hospital in \nWorcester, MA both recently agreed to limit mandatory overtime as part \nof negotiations following successful strikes by nurses. These limits \nwill protect patients and improve working conditions for nurses, and \nthey will also have a significant role in the recruitment and retention \nof nurses in the future.\n  Job dissatisfaction and overtime hours are major factors in the \ncurrent shortage of nurses. Nationally, the shortfall is expected to \nrise to 20 percent in the coming years. The goal of the Safe Nursing \nand Patient Care Act will play an important role in improving the \nquality of life for nurses, so that more persons will enter the nursing \nprofession and remain in it.\n  The bill limits mandatory overtime to declared states of emergency. \nClearly, there are times when other options are exhausted and hospitals \nneed additional help, and the bill takes account of such needs. The \nbill requires health providers to inform nurses of these new rights, \nand nurses who report violations are guaranteed protection from \nworkplace discrimination. In addition, the bill requires the Agency for \nHealth Care Research and Quality to report to Congress on appropriate \nstandards for the maximum numbers of hours a nurse may work in a wide \nvariety of health settings without compromising patient care.\n  Improving working conditions for nurses is an essential part of our \nongoing effort to reduce medical errors, improve patient outcomes, and \nencourage more Americans to become and remain nurses. The power of \nproviders to force nurses to work beyond what is safe for themselves \nand their patients is one of the major disincentives to pursuing or \ncontinuing a career in nursing. The Safe Nursing and Patient Care Act \nis a significant step that Congress can take to support the Nation's \nnurses and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 1704. A bill to amend the Clayton Act to make the antitrust laws \napplicable to the elimination or relocation of major league baseball \nfranchises; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Dayton and \nHarkin, I am introducing the ``Fairness in Antitrust in National \nSports, FANS, Act of 2001.'' The goal of this important legislation is \nto limit major league baseball's antitrust exemption as it relates to \ndecisions to eliminate or relocate a major league baseball team.\n  This is an important piece of legislation, made necessary by major \nleague baseball owners' unfortunate decision last week to eliminate two \nteams, with the prospect of at least two more eliminations to come. I \nam pleased to say that Representative John Conyers, along with a number \nof other Members, including the entire Minnesota delegation, will be \nintroducing an identical measure in the House today as well.\n  I have said on other occasions that I think this so-called \n``contraction'' decision by major league baseball is a betrayal by \nowners who have put their own profits before loyalty to fans and their \ncommunities.\n  I know that there are a number of efforts to respond to this decision \nby the owners. The bill we are introducing today is but one of those. I \nexpect the bill to be referred to the Judiciary Committees in the House \nand Senate and our hope is that the Committees in both Houses will be \nable to organize prompt hearings.\n  Our country has tremendously urgent priorities. We have the war in \nAfghanistan, the war against terrorism, and our urgent need for \neconomic stimulus legislation to keep our nation from plummeting even \nfurther into recession. Unfortunately, however, major league baseball \nowners did not give us a choice on timing. They have picked a \nparticularly inauspicious time to announce their unilateral, short-\nsighted and self-serving decision, so we must respond. Because they \nhave further announced their intention to name in the near future the \nparticular teams they plan to eliminate, we have no choice but to urge \nquick consideration of this legislation.\n  As I noted, the bill would limit baseball's antitrust exemption as it \nrelates to decisions to eliminate or relocate a\n\n[[Page S11795]]\n\nmajor league baseball team. The legislation subjects the owners to the \nantitrust laws when they unilaterally decide to eliminate or relocate a \nteam.\n  In all other respects, the bill tracks the Curt Flood Act of 1997, \nwhich repealed the antitrust laws as they apply to the employment of \nmajor league baseball players. As with the Curt Flood Act, the bill is \ncarefully crafted to ensure that it does not limit any prerogatives of \nthe minor leagues.\n  We proceed from a pragmatic desire to achieve a broad base of support \nin Congress. With the help of the Administration, we could push this \nmeasure forward.\n  As Senator Dayton and I noted last week in a letter to the President, \nachieving Congressional action on this legislation will be exceedingly \ndifficult in view of other urgent legislative issues facing Congress \nand the Administration. We will need the President to weigh in on this \nand I once again call on him to do so.\n  Mr. President, we must act to hold major league baseball owners \naccountable for their decisions. I urge my colleagues to join us in co-\nsponsoring this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/14/senate-section/article/S11795-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2122.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Energy \n     Research and Technology Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2002. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Nation's prosperity and way of life are sustained \n     by energy use;\n       (2) the growing imbalance between domestic energy \n     production and consumption means that the Nation is becoming \n     increasingly reliant on imported energy, which has the \n     potential to undermine the Nation's economy, standard of \n     living, and national security;\n       (3) energy conservation and energy efficiency help maximize \n     the use of available energy resources, reduce energy \n     shortages, lower the Nation's reliance on energy imports, \n     mitigate the impacts of high energy prices, and help protect \n     the environment and public health;\n       (4) development of a balanced portfolio of domestic energy \n     supplies will ensure that future generations of Americans \n     will have access to the energy they need;\n       (5) energy efficiency technologies, renewable and \n     alternative energy technologies, and advanced energy systems \n     technologies will help diversify the Nation's energy \n     portfolio with few adverse environmental impacts and are \n     vital to delivering clean energy to fuel the Nation's \n     economic growth;\n       (6) development of reliable, affordable, and \n     environmentally sound energy efficiency technologies, \n     renewable and alternative energy technologies, and advanced \n     energy systems technologies will require maintenance of a \n     vibrant fundamental scientific knowledge base and continued \n     scientific and technological innovations that can be \n     accelerated by Federal funding, whereas commercial deployment \n     of such systems and technologies are the responsibility of \n     the private sector;\n       (7) Federal funding should focus on those programs, \n     projects, and activities that are long-term, high-risk, \n     noncommercial, and well-managed, and that provide the \n     potential for scientific and technological advances; and\n       (8) public-private partnerships should be encouraged to \n     leverage scarce taxpayer dollars.\n\n     SEC. 2003. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this division are to--\n       (1) protect and strengthen the Nation's economy, standard \n     of living, and national security by reducing dependence on \n     imported energy;\n       (2) meet future needs for energy services at the lowest \n     total cost to the Nation, including environmental costs, \n     giving balanced and comprehensive consideration to \n     technologies that improve the efficiency of energy end uses \n     and that enhance energy supply;\n       (3) reduce the air, water, and other environmental impacts \n     (including emissions of greenhouse gases) of energy \n     production, distribution, transportation, and use through the \n     development of environmentally sustainable energy systems;\n       (4) consider the comparative environmental impacts of the \n     energy saved or produced by specific programs, projects, or \n     activities;\n       (5) maintain the technological competitiveness of the \n     United States and stimulate economic growth through the \n     development of advanced energy systems and technologies;\n       (6) foster international cooperation by developing \n     international markets for domestically produced sustainable \n     energy technologies, and by transferring environmentally \n     sound, advanced energy systems and technologies to developing \n     countries to promote sustainable development;\n       (7) provide sufficient funding of programs, projects, and \n     activities that are performance-based and modeled as public-\n     private partnerships, as appropriate; and\n       (8) enhance the contribution of a given program, project, \n     or activity to fundamental scientific knowledge.\n\n     SEC. 2004. GOALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), in order to \n     achieve the purposes of this division under section 2003, the \n     Secretary should conduct a balanced energy research, \n     development, demonstration, and commercial application \n     portfolio of programs guided by the following goals to meet \n     the purposes of this division under section 2003.\n       (1) Energy conservation and energy efficiency--\n       (A) For the Building Technology, State and Community \n     Sector, the program should develop technologies, housing \n     components, designs, and production methods that will, by \n     2010--\n       (i) reduce the monthly energy cost of new housing by 20 \n     percent, compared to the cost as of the date of the enactment \n     of this Act;\n       (ii) cut the environmental impact and energy use of new \n     housing by 50 percent, compared to the impact and use as of \n     the date of the enactment of this Act; and\n\n[[Page S11809]]\n\n       (iii) improve durability and reduce maintenance costs by 50 \n     percent compared to the durability and costs as of the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       (B) For the Industry Sector, the program should, in \n     cooperation with the affected industries, improve the energy \n     intensity of the major energy-consuming industries by \n     at least 25 percent by 2010, compared to the energy \n     intensity as of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (C) For Power Technologies, the program should, in \n     cooperation with the affected industries--\n       (i) develop a microturbine (40 to 300 kilowatt) that is \n     more than 40 percent more efficient by 2006, and more than 50 \n     percent more efficient by 2010, compared to the efficiency as \n     of the date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) develop advanced materials for combustion systems that \n     reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides by 30 to 50 percent while \n     increasing efficiency 5 to 10 percent by 2007, compared to \n     such emissions as of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (D) For the Transportation Sector, the program should, in \n     cooperation with affected industries--\n       (i) develop a production prototype passenger automobile \n     that has fuel economy equivalent to 80 miles per gallon of \n     gasoline by 2004;\n       (ii) develop class 7 and 8 heavy duty trucks and buses with \n     ultra low emissions and the ability to use an alternative \n     fuel that has an average fuel economy equivalent to--\n       (I) 10 miles per gallon of gasoline by 2007; and\n       (II) 13 miles per gallon of gasoline by 2010;\n       (iii) develop a production prototype of a passenger \n     automobile with zero equivalent emissions that has an average \n     fuel economy of 100 miles per gallon of gasoline by 2010; and\n       (iv) improve, by 2010, the average fuel economy of trucks--\n       (I) in classes 1 and 2 by 300 percent; and\n       (II) in classes 3 through 6 by 200 percent, compared to the \n     fuel economy as of the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Renewable energy.--\n       (A) For Hydrogen Research, to carry out the Spark M. \n     Matsunaga Hydrogen Research, Development, and Demonstration \n     Act of 1990, as amended by subtitle A of title II of this \n     division.\n       (B) For bioenergy:\n       (i) The program should reduce the cost of bioenergy \n     relative to other energy sources to enable the United States \n     to triple bioenergy use by 2010.\n       (ii) For biopower systems, the program should reduce the \n     cost of such systems to enable commercialization of \n     integrated power-generating technologies that employ gas \n     turbines and fuel cells integrated with bioenergy gasifiers \n     within 5 years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (iii) For biofuels, the program should accelerate research, \n     development, and demonstration on advanced enzymatic \n     hydrolysis technology for making ethanol from cellulosic \n     feedstock, with the goal that between 2010 and 2015 ethanol \n     produced from energy crops would be fully competitive in \n     terms of price with gasoline as a neat fuel, in either \n     internal combustion engines or fuel cell vehicles.\n       (C) For Geothermal Technology Development, the program \n     should focus on advanced concepts for the long term. The \n     first priority should be high-grade enhanced geothermal \n     systems; the second priority should be lower grade, hot dry \n     rock, and geopressured systems; and the third priority should \n     be support of field demonstrations of enhanced geothermal \n     systems technology, including sites in lower grade areas to \n     demonstrate the benefits of reservoir concepts to different \n     conditions.\n       (D) For Hydropower, the program should provide a new \n     generation of turbine technologies that will increase \n     generating capacity and will be less damaging to fish and \n     aquatic ecosystems.\n       (E) For Concentrating Solar Power, the program should \n     strengthen ongoing research, development, and demonstration \n     combining high-efficiency and high-temperature receivers with \n     advanced thermal storage and power cycles, with the goal of \n     making solar-only power (including baseload solar power) \n     widely competitive with fossil fuel power by 2015. The \n     program should limit or halt its research and development \n     on power-tower and power-trough technologies because \n     further refinements to these concepts will not further \n     their deployment, and should assess the market prospects \n     for solar dish/engine technologies to determine whether \n     continued research and development is warranted.\n       (F) For Photovoltaic Energy Systems, the program should \n     pursue research, development, and demonstration that will, by \n     2005, increase the efficiency of thin film modules from the \n     current 7 percent to 11 percent in multi-million watt \n     production; reduce the direct manufacturing cost of \n     photovoltaic modules by 30 percent from the current $2.50 per \n     watt to $1.75 per watt by 2005; and establish greater than a \n     20-year lifetime of photovoltaic systems by improving the \n     reliability and lifetime of balance-of-system components and \n     reducing recurring cost by 40 percent. The program's top \n     priority should be the development of sound manufacturing \n     technologies for thin-film modules, and the program should \n     make a concerted effort to integrate fundamental research and \n     basic engineering research.\n       (G) For Solar Building Technology Research, the program \n     should complete research and development on new polymers and \n     manufacturing processes to reduce the cost of solar water \n     heating by 50 percent by 2004, compared to the cost as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (H) For Wind Energy Systems, the program should reduce the \n     cost of wind energy to three cents per kilowatt-hour at Class \n     6 (15 miles-per-hour annual average) wind sites by 2004, and \n     4 cents per kilowatt-hour in Class 4 (13 miles-per-hour \n     annual average) wind sites by 2015, and further if required \n     so that wind power can be widely competitive with fossil-\n     fuel-based electricity in a restructured electric industry. \n     Program research on advanced wind turbine technology should \n     focus on turbulent flow studies, durable materials to extend \n     turbine life, blade efficiency, and higher efficiency \n     operation in low quality wind regimes.\n       (I) For Electric Energy Systems and Storage, including High \n     Temperature Superconducting Research and Development, Energy \n     Storage Systems, and Transmission Reliability, the program \n     should develop high capacity superconducting transmission \n     lines and generators, highly reliable energy storage systems, \n     and distributed generating systems to accommodate multiple \n     types of energy sources under common interconnect standards.\n       (J) For the International Renewable Energy and Renewable \n     Energy Production Incentive programs, and Renewable Program \n     Support, the program should encourage the commercial \n     application of renewable energy technologies by developed and \n     developing countries, State and local governmental entities \n     and nonprofit electric cooperatives, and by the competitive \n     domestic market.\n       (3) Nuclear energy.--\n       (A) For university nuclear science and engineering, the \n     program should carry out the provisions of subtitle A of \n     title III of this division.\n       (B) For fuel cycle research, development, and \n     demonstration, the program should carry out the provisions of \n     subtitle B of title III of this division.\n       (C) For the Nuclear Energy Research Initiative, the program \n     should accomplish the objectives of section 2341(b) of this \n     Act.\n       (D) For the Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization Program, the \n     program should accomplish the objectives of section 2342(b) \n     of this Act.\n       (E) For Nuclear Energy Technologies, the program should \n     carry out the provisions of section 2343 of this Act.\n       (F) For Advanced Radioisotope Power Systems, the program \n     should ensure that the United States has adequate capability \n     to power future satellite and space missions.\n       (4) Fossil energy.--\n       (A) For core fossil energy research and development, the \n     program should achieve the goals outlined by the Department's \n     Vision 21 Program.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as ``Department of Energy \n     University Nuclear Science and Engineering Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2302. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) United States university nuclear science and \n     engineering programs are in a state of serious decline, with \n     nuclear engineering enrollment at a 35-year low. Since 1980, \n     the number of nuclear engineering university programs has \n     declined nearly 40 percent, and over two-thirds of the \n     faculty in these programs are 45 years of age or older. Also, \n     since 1980, the number of university research and training \n     reactors in the United States has declined by over 50 \n     percent.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Fusion Energy Sciences \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2502. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) economic prosperity is closely linked to an affordable \n     and ample energy supply;\n       (2) environmental quality is closely linked to energy \n     production and use;\n       (3) population, worldwide economic development, energy \n     consumption, and stress on the environment are all expected \n     to increase substantially in the coming decades;\n       (4) the few energy options with the potential to meet \n     economic and environmental needs for the long-term future \n     should be pursued as part of a balanced national energy plan;\n       (5) fusion energy is an attractive long-term energy source \n     because of the virtually inexhaustible supply of fuel, and \n     the promise of minimal adverse environmental impact and \n     inherent safety;\n       (6) the National Research Council, the President's \n     Committee of Advisers on Science and Technology, and the \n     Secretary of Energy Advisory Board have each recently \n     reviewed the Fusion Energy Sciences Program and each strongly \n     supports the fundamental science and creative innovation of \n     the program, and has confirmed that progress toward the goal \n     of producing practical fusion energy has been excellent, \n     although much scientific and engineering work remains to be \n     done;\n       (7) each of these reviews stressed the need for a magnetic \n     fusion burning plasma experiment to address key scientific \n     issues and as a necessary step in the development of fusion \n     energy;\n       (8) the National Research Council has also called for a \n     broadening of the Fusion Energy Sciences Program research \n     base as a means to more fully integrate the fusion science \n     community into the broader scientific community; and\n       (9) the Fusion Energy Sciences Program budget is inadequate \n     to support the necessary science and innovation for the \n     present generation of experiments, and cannot accommodate the \n     cost of a burning plasma experiment constructed by the United \n     States, or even the cost of key participation by the United \n     States in an international effort.\n\n     SEC. 2503. PLAN FOR FUSION EXPERIMENT.\n\n       (a) Plan for United States Fusion Experiment.--The \n     Secretary, on the basis of full consultation with the Fusion \n     Energy Sciences Advisory Committee and the Secretary of \n     Energy Advisory Board, as appropriate, shall develop a plan \n     for United States construction of a magnetic fusion burning \n     plasma experiment for the purpose of accelerating scientific \n     understanding of fusion plasmas. The Secretary shall request \n     a review of the plan by the National Academy of Sciences, and \n     shall transmit the plan and the review to the Congress by \n     July 1, 2004.\n       (b) Requirements of Plan.--The plan described in subsection \n     (a) shall--\n       (1) address key burning plasma physics issues; and\n       (2) include specific information on the scientific \n     capabilities of the proposed experiment, the relevance of \n     these capabilities to the goal of practical fusion energy, \n     and the overall design of the experiment including its \n     estimated cost and potential construction sites.\n       (c) United States Participation in an International \n     Experiment.--In addition to the plan described in subsection \n     (a), the Secretary, on the basis of full consultation with \n     the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee and the \n     Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, as appropriate, may also \n     develop a plan for United States participation in an \n     international burning plasma experiment for the same purpose, \n     whose construction is found by the Secretary to be highly \n     likely and where United States participation is cost \n     effective relative to the cost and scientific benefits of a \n     domestic experiment described in subsection (a). If the \n     Secretary elects to develop a plan under this subsection, he \n     shall include the information described in subsection (b), \n     and an estimate of the cost of United States participation in \n     such an international experiment. The Secretary shall request \n     a review by the National Academies of Sciences and \n     Engineering of a plan developed under this subsection, and \n     shall transmit the plan and the review to the Congress not \n     later than July 1, 2004.\n       (d) Authorization of Research and Development.--The \n     Secretary, through the Fusion Energy Sciences Program, may \n     conduct any research and development necessary to fully \n     develop the plans described in this section.\n\n     SEC. 2504.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Clean Coal Power \n     Initiative Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 5001. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity \n     will continue to power the growing United States economy;\n       (2) an increasing use of electro-technologies, the desire \n     for continuous environmental improvement, a more competitive \n     electricity market, and concerns about rising energy prices \n     add importance to the need for reliable, affordable, \n     increasingly clean electricity;\n       (3) coal, which, as of the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, accounts for more than \\1/2\\ of all electricity \n     generated in the United States, is the most abundant fossil \n     energy resource of the United States;\n       (4) coal comprises more than 85 percent of all fossil \n     resources in the United States and exists in quantities \n     sufficient to supply the United States for 250 years at \n     current usage rates;\n       (5) investments in electricity generating facility \n     emissions control technology over the past 30 years have \n     reduced the aggregate emissions of pollutants from coal-based \n     generating facilities by 21 percent, even as coal use for \n     electricity generation has nearly tripled;\n       (6) continuous improvement in efficiency and environmental \n     performance from electricity generating facilities would \n     allow continued use of coal and preserve less abundant energy \n     resources for other energy uses;\n       (7) new ways to convert coal into electricity can \n     effectively eliminate health-threatening emissions and \n     improve efficiency by as much as 50 percent, but initial \n     deployment of new coal generation methods and equipment \n     entails significant risk that generators may be unable to \n     accept in a newly competitive electricity market; and\n       (8) continued environmental improvement in coal-based \n     generation and increasing the production and supply of power \n     generation facilities with less air emissions, with the \n     ultimate goal of near-zero emissions, is important and \n     desirable.\n\n     SEC. 5002. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this division:\n       (1) Cost and performance goals.--The term ``cost and \n     performance goals'' means the cost and performance goals \n     established under section 5004.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Energy.\n\n     SEC. 5003.
