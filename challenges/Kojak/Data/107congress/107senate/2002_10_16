Mr. President, there are a number of issues I want to speak \nabout briefly this morning. First of all, there is a conference report \nthat has not yet been completed--there are many, but I will talk about \nthe defense authorization conference today. There is one issue holding \nthat up.\n  I have had the good fortune of having the acting chairman of the \nHouse Armed Services Committee come and speak to me on this issue. \nThere is an amendment I offered with a number of other Senators that \nwould allow our veterans who are disabled and who have retirement \nbenefits from the U.S. military to draw both of their benefits. Right \nnow, they cannot; they have to make a choice. I have explained this to \npeople at home, and they are dumbfounded that people who have been \ndeclared to have a disability in the military, and following the \ndeclaration and retirement, they cannot draw both pensions. That is \nholding up a $400 billion conference because the President of the \nUnited States--I used to say people around him, but that is clearly \ngone now; the President makes the decision--has said he will veto the \n$400 billion bill. He is going to veto it because of veterans who are \ndisabled and drawing unemployment. He has said it would be something \nthat is not good for the country. I don't think that is true.\n  I will talk about that more throughout the day. I see my friend from \nMinnesota. The conference is not closed. I dare the President to veto \nthe bill. The conference should get that report out here. We should \npass it and send it to the President and let him veto that. There isn't \na veteran in the United States who would not be dumbfounded that the \nCommander in Chief would veto a bill that gives benefits to somebody \nwho is disabled and retired from the military. It is unfair, \ninequitable, and wrong. I dare the President to veto that. If there \nwere ever an opportunity to override a veto, this is it. I think the \nPresident would make a mistake doing this.\n  The second thing I want to talk about is, I wrote a letter to Mitch \nDaniels. I said--generalizing--reading all the press accounts, the \nPresident is campaigning more than he is working on policy for this \ncountry. He is trying to show the trips he takes, where he makes \ncampaign stops, are really trips where he is doing something of a \npolicy nature, so that trip will be paid for by the taxpayers. I have \nasked Mitch Daniels, how do you justify that? No response.\n  Well, I think we have to do something to make the taxpayers free of \nthe obligation of paying for campaign expenses. When we campaign, we \nhave to pay those expenses out of our campaign funds. The President \nshould do that. The Republican National Committee should pay for those \ntrips, and taxpayers should not. I will have more to say about that \nlater in the day.\n  I see my friend from Minnesota. His plane was a little late, and this \nis his assigned time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10484-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10484-S10487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3009\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor for now the sixth time with a \npiece of legislation I have introduced. At other times, Senator Kennedy \nhas spoken about this, Senator Clinton has spoken about this, and \nSenator Durbin has spoken about this. Many have. I come to the floor to \nask that the Senate proceed--I will not make the unanimous consent \nrequest yet; I don't see colleagues from the other side of the aisle \nhere yet--that we pass calendar No. 619, S. 3009. This is a bill to \nextend unemployment benefits for an additional 13 weeks for workers in \nevery State, plus 7 weeks in additional benefits for workers in States \nwith the highest levels of unemployment. This extends the expiration \ndate of the temporary benefits program we passed last March, which \notherwise would terminate December 31.\n  Every time we have tried to do this, my colleagues on the other \nside--usually it has been the Senator from Oklahoma--have come out and \nobjected. What I have heard my Republican colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle say is that they need more time to look at this. It is \nseven pages long. We have been at this now for well over, I think, 2 \nweeks and, really, one page a day certainly can be read.\n  I have also heard from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nthat they want to work with us. We have been trying to sit down with \nstaff on the other side because we believe we should not leave until we \nget this done.\n  One of the points my colleague from Oklahoma has been making is that \nwe are talking about 26 weeks; in other words, if we take what we did \nin March--people then had 13 weeks of benefits--and they now get an \nadditional 13 weeks of benefits, that is 26 weeks.\n  I say to my colleague from Oklahoma and other Republicans that we \nhave about 900,000 men and women who have run out of unemployment \nbenefits in the country--20,000 in Minnesota; 50,000 in Minnesota in \nFebruary; close to 2 million in February of next year--and extending 13 \nweeks of benefits for people who have utilized the 13 weeks we gave \nthem earlier is exactly what we did in the early 1990s on a 97-to-3 \nvote, with my colleague from Oklahoma, among others, supporting it.\n  I do not understand what the problem is. Having been back home and \ntraveled the State a lot, I am not going to make an argument that I \nwould consider to be a false dichotomy; that is to say, people are just \nfocused on the economy and nothing else. I say people are worried about \na lot of issues. They are worried about Iraq and what is the right \nthing to do, they are worried about terrorism, and they are worried \nabout the economy. People want us to focus on the economy, and they \nwant us to put people first. They want us to focus on people, and there \nare a lot of actions we could take. We could raise the minimum wage. We \ncould invest in education and job training because a lot of workers are \ntrying to go from one job to another, and they need to have that \nopportunity.\n  At the very minimum, could we not at least have enough of a sense of \ncompassion and extend unemployment benefits to people who are out of \nwork, through no fault of their own, and have run out of these \nbenefits? This is the sixth time I have asked consent to move forward \nand pass this legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Has the Senator found at home what I found at home this \npast Monday? I had a group of veterans with whom I met at 8 o'clock in \nthe morning in Henderson, NV. For the first time I can remember, an \nelderly World War II veteran came up to me and said: Would you speak to \nmy grandson? His grandson was a graduate of the University of \nPittsburgh, had a grade point average of 3.7, and could not find a job. \nAt that meeting, I had two young men come up to me, both of whom are \ncollege graduates and could not find jobs.\n  Has the Senator found that not only those people seeking entry-level \njobs\n\n[[Page S10485]]\n\nare having trouble, but people who have been laid off at factories and \nother industries and recent college graduates cannot find work? Has the \nSenator found that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Nevada, in \nMinnesota and around the country there are about twice as many people \nlooking for jobs as are jobs available. This economy is flat and, \nhaving turned downward, cuts across a broad section of population, and \nthis does include college graduates.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, given his work with the Joint \nEconomic Committee, chairing that committee, it is also true that many \nof the people who are out of work right now actually come from skilled \nprofessions, skilled work, middle-income jobs.\n  I think this administration is sleepwalking through history. We ought \nto be paying more attention to the economy. We need to get this economy \ngoing again. We need to start putting people first again. We need to \nstart investing in people. All of that is true, but at the least what \nwe ought to do is what we did over and over in the early 1990s, which \nwas to pass this legislation I have introduced, which is very simple \nand straightforward. It will extend unemployment benefits for 13 weeks. \nWe ought to do that. We have done it before. It is the right thing to \ndo. We can help a lot of people, and, in addition--I have said it \nbefore--it also provides some economic stimulus because, believe me, \nwhether it is the 9,000 Oklahoma workers who have run out of the \nbenefits we extended in March or whether it is the 20,000 people in \nMinnesota, people will buy. Right now, they cannot meet their needs \nmonth by month.\n  This is a matter of compassion, of doing what is right. Frankly--I \nwill say it one more time, and then I will propound my unanimous \nconsent request--it is absolutely unforgivable that this is being \nblocked over and over when this is exactly what we did in the early \n1990s.\n  Before my colleague from Oklahoma came to the Chamber, I said I keep \nhearing about 26 weeks. This is what we did before. In March, we gave \n13 weeks of additional benefits, and they have run out, and now we are \ntalking about an additional 13 weeks. We have always helped people. We \nhave always provided this help to people. We have always moved forward \nwith this kind of legislation.\n  This is now the sixth time. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. \n619, S. 3009, a bill to provide economic security for America's \nworkers; that the bill be read the third time, passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table. This is the sixth time we have \npropounded this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. REID. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I came back today from Minnesota. There \nis a lot of work to be done. At the minimum, we ought to extend \nunemployment benefits. We have 20,000 people in Minnesota who have run \nout of unemployment benefits. It is going to be 50,000 in February. We \nhave 900,000 people in the country, 9,000 in Oklahoma. We are going to \nhave 2 million men and women in the country who will run out of \nbenefits by February of next year. We have two times as many people \nlooking for jobs as jobs available.\n  As my colleague from Nevada said, we have college graduates who \ncannot find work. We have people who were in middle-income jobs, \nprofessional jobs, highly trained, looking for work. They cannot find \njobs. At the very minimum, should we not extend unemployment benefits? \nThis is exactly what we did in the early 1990s. We extended an \nadditional 13 weeks of benefits in March of this year, and now people \nhave exhausted their benefits. We are trying to extend an additional 13 \nweeks of unemployment compensation, 20 weeks in States with high levels \nof unemployment.\n  This is exactly the same--I want everybody in the country to know \nthis--this is exactly the same legislation we passed with an \noverwhelming vote in the early 1990s. Why is this being blocked? Why do \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle, every time I come out \nhere or come out here with other Senators, say: We need more time to \nread it? My gosh, they have had plenty of time to read it. We need more \ntime to negotiate. Have we not been involved in negotiation? This is \nnothing but stall, stall, stall, block, block, block, put up \nroadblocks, put up roadblocks, put up roadblocks.\n  What is so tragic about this situation is it is people's lives.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend answer a question without \nlosing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to.\n  Mr. REID. I do not know if the Senator from Minnesota had an \nopportunity to hear me earlier today. The Senator was in the Chamber \nbut was communicating with his staff. The Defense authorization bill is \nin conference. There are about $400 billion in programs in that \nlegislation that affect the military men and women in this country. \nThere is only one provision holding up the conference committee from \nreporting that bill out, and that is what is called concurrent \nreceipts.\n  Can the Senator from Minnesota find any justification that a person, \nwho has a disability from the U.S. military and is retired from the \nmilitary, should not be able to draw both benefits? Is there a reason \nthe Senator can come up with that they should not be able to draw both \nbenefits?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Nevada I will talk about \nthis in the same way I talked about the State unemployment benefits. I \nwas proud to be an original cosponsor.\n  When I was home over this last week, veterans were talking to me \nabout the concurrent receipt, and they were saying they served their \ncountry and should get a disability payment when they served our \ncountry. And then dollar for dollar it is subtracted from their \nretirement pay? And they cannot believe there are Members of Congress, \nbe it House or Senate, and the administration, who are trying to block \nthis, keep it out of the Defense appropriations bill; nor can anybody \nin Minnesota believe there are Senators--and I gather it is the White \nHouse as well--who want to block the extension of unemployment \nbenefits. It is the same mentality. It is like they do not want to \ncount people. We are supposed to be helping people. Our work is \nsupposed to be connected to people's lives.\n  I say to the Senator from Nevada, the Senators and Representatives \nwho are trying to hold up concurrent receipt--and the White House, I \ngather, is threatening a veto--they better watch themselves because the \nveterans community is not going to accept this. The veterans community \nis going to say, in all due respect, this is no way to say thank you. \nIt is no way to say thank you to those who have served our country. It \nis no way to say thank you to tell them that they cannot get a \ndisability payment without having that money taken out of their \nretirement pay.\n  This is a huge issue in the veterans community, and if my colleague \ndoes not mind, I am going to speak a little while longer about this \nbecause I do not know what has happened. We are nearing the end of the \nsession. There are all these elections, but these two issues we are now \ntalking about--I want to join the two of them--should not have very \nmuch to do with politics. They really should not. We have always \nextended unemployment benefits to people who are flat on their backs \nthrough no fault of their own. That is exactly the same thing that is \nin my legislation that is being blocked over and again on the other \nside.\n  What are people who cannot find jobs, who are out of work, who are \nstruggling to put food on the table supposed to do?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. In one second. What are they supposed to do, wait \naround for Senators and the White House to continue to play this game \nof blocking? What is the problem? And what are veterans supposed to do? \nHow are veterans supposed to feel when\n\n[[Page S10486]]\n\nthey hear the White House is threatening a veto because concurrent \nreceipt is in?\n  Then the argument is, well, we cannot afford it, or this will cost \nmore money. Tell that to people who served our country. Tell them we \ncannot afford to live up to our commitment to them. Tell them we do not \nreally believe they have made a valid claim; that it is wrong to take \naway from retirement pay just because we are giving people a disability \npayment, a disability payment coming from a disability while serving \nour country. What in the world is going on? What has happened to our \nhumanity? Why are Senators blocking these initiatives?\n\n  I have the floor, but I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator also acknowledge that these unemployment \nbenefits help more than the unemployed in that this generates money \ninto the economy, helps small businesses, people can buy gasoline they \ncould not afford otherwise, they might be able to buy some additional \ngroceries? Would the Senator acknowledge that part of the reason \nextended unemployment benefits were originally passed was to help the \neconomy?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague for his question because he is \ntrying to help me. I view it first as an issue of compassion. Call me a \nsofty, but honest to God, when people have run out of unemployment \nbenefits and they are out of work through no fault of their own, it \nwould seem to me we could provide a helping hand.\n  My colleague from Nevada is absolutely right. There is not an \neconomist in the Nation who would not make the argument that this is \nalso economic stimulus, as opposed to these Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax \ncuts with 40 percent of the benefits going to the top 1 percent, and \nproposals on the part of my Republican colleagues to eliminate the \nalternative minimum tax so big corporations do not have to pay \nanything. This is real economic stimulus because the families in \nMinnesota that would get the additional benefits, much less in \nOklahoma, Nevada, and Rhode Island, will consume. They have to consume \nbecause right now they cannot make ends meet month by month. They will \nbuy food. They will go out and buy a washing machine if it is broken \ndown because they need it. They will consume. Therefore, it is a win/\nwin.\n  What puzzles me is that in the early 1990s, five times we passed \nalmost the identical legislation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield if I could make one final \npoint, and that is it is amazing the disconnect between what is going \non with this effort to block the extension of unemployment benefits and \nalso with this effort to block concurrent receipt and live up to our \ncontract for veterans. Senator Reid has taken the lead. I feel as \nstrongly about concurrent receipt as I do about unemployment benefits. \nIt has been a labor of love for me working with veterans.\n  There is a disconnect between what is going on, blocking this help \nfor people, blocking living up to our commitment to veterans, blocking \ngetting unemployment benefits to families that have run out and what \npeople in Minnesota are saying because what people in Minnesota and the \ncountry are saying is focus on the economy. How about unemployment \nbenefits? How about investing in job training and education for people \nwho are working and now trying to look for other jobs or work their way \nup to better jobs? How about raising the minimum wage? How about making \nsure that as opposed to a Harvey Pitt, there is somebody at SEC we can \ncount on so when there is an oversight board they are really going to \nbe a watchdog so us little investors can finally count on investing in \ncompanies and know that they have not cooked their books?\n  How about doing away with these egregious rip-offs where companies go \nto Bermuda, renounce their citizenship and do not pay their taxes? How \nabout not telling big corporations they do not have to pay anything? \nHow about more tax credits for higher education? How about refundable \ntax credits for tuition? How about applying tax credits to other costs \nstudents have like books and other living expenses? How about investing \nin people? How about helping us? How about thinking about the economy? \nEvery single time we come to the floor, we are not able to get this \ndone.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to do so.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I almost forgot the question, but I think it is coming \nback to me now. I am almost amused, but not quite, on the bill that the \nSenator is trying to pass by unanimous consent. Correct me if I am \nwrong, but did it go through the Finance Committee? Has it been \nreported out of any committee?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We have been down this road--let me answer the \nquestion. I say to my colleague from Oklahoma, in the last 2 weeks we \nhave had this conversation six or seven times. Every time, I say no, \nand then my colleague says he has not had time to read it, and I say it \nis seven pages and I know the Senator is a quick reader. That is one \npage a day. Then my colleague says, let's us work together. We are \nwaiting, and so far the only thing I have seen from the Senator is \nobstruction. That is my answer.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I admonish my colleague--that is a strong word--I inform \nmy colleague that a person could exhaust their benefits, find a job and \nstill would be counted as being unemployed.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The current law is a 13-week Federal program, which is \nwhat we have done most of the time. The Senator has gone back to 1990. \nAt one time there was a 26-week extension.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Minnesota has \nexpired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent to continue for 4 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I hesitate to interfere with \nmy colleagues from Oklahoma and Minnesota who are engaged in a very \nimportant discussion.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We will be done in 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent to revise your unanimous consent \nrequest to provide an additional 4 minutes for Senator Bond and myself \nto talk about the election. I know that is not as compelling to some, \nbut we think it is very important, and we want to say some things about \nit before the vote. After the 4 minutes is up, I will object to an \nextension of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just to inform my colleague from Minnesota, that current \nlaw is a 26-week State program and a 13-week Federal program, with some \nhigh unemployment States getting an additional 13 weeks. You are trying \nto modify the original 13 weeks and make it 26 weeks. That is very \nexpensive.\n  Just to inform my colleague, if you did not try to change the \ntrigger, or use the adjusted insured unemployment rate which costs a \nlot of money, and just looked at a clean, straight extension which \nwould cost about $7 billion instead of $17.1 billion, the probability \nof success would go up dramatically. I mention that. To draft a bill, \nput it directly on the calendar, and say we expect you to pass it \nwithout any modification, is not going to happen.\n  I wanted to make that point. I thank my colleague from Connecticut.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague from \nOklahoma in a sincere and emphatic way, he knows a straight extension \nis not enough. We need an additional 13 weeks. That is the whole point. \nIt is not a straight extension. It is adding 13 weeks for people who \nhave run out of unemployment benefits, 900,000 men and women in the \ncountry. The trigger is the exact same trigger we used in the early \n1990s. This is $10.6 billion over 10 years, all of which is in the \ntrust fund to provide the help to people who have run out of benefits.\n  My colleague has blocked the very legislation we passed in the 1990s \nto help people. For the people in Minnesota, and the people in the \ncountry, the straight extension is not what this is about. This is an \nadditional 13 weeks. That is what we did in the early 1990s, many times \nover, and what we should do today. It is simply wrong, after almost 2 \nweeks, that my colleague has been blocking this over and over and over \nagain.\n\n[[Page S10487]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I know the Senator wants to be factually correct. I \nbelieve the trigger is different from the one in the early 1990s. The \nfact is, if you want to help people, consider a straight extension of \nthe program we have in current law.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10487-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10487-S10488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE PROSECUTORIAL REMEDIES AND TOOLS AGAINST EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN \n                          TODAY (PROTECT) ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the Senate to pass S. \n2520, the Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of \nChildren Today, PROTECT, Act of 2002. This bill and the substitute I \noffer will protect our Nation's children from exploitation by those who \nproduce and distribute child pornography, within the parameters of the \nFirst Amendment. I was an original cosponsor of S. 2520 and joined \nSenator Hatch, the ranking Republican member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, on the Senate floor when the bill was introduced.\n  Since that time, I have been working with Senator Hatch both to \nimprove the bill that we introduced together and to build consensus for \nit. Unlike the Administration's bill, which has been widely criticized \nby constitutional and criminal law scholars and practitioners, we have \nbeen largely successful in that effort. The substitute I offer today is \nvirtually identical to the version circulated by Senator Hatch before \nthe October 8, 2002 meeting of the Judiciary Committee. I am glad to \nreport that this substitute has been approved by every single \nDemocratic Senator. Moreover, every Democratic Senator has agreed to \ndischarge S. 2520 from the Judiciary Committee for consideration and \npassage by the Senate, with a refining amendment.\n  I am now asking my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle to \nlift any holds and to allow this important legislation to pass the \nSenate. That way, the House may take up the bill and the PROTECT Act \nmay become law before we adjourn. I know that there are some who would \nrather play politics with this issue, but I hope that they reconsider. \nIt is more important that we unite to pass a bill that will both \nprotect our Nation's children and produce convictions rather than tying \nup prosecutorial resources litigating the constitutionality of the \ntools we give the Justice Department to use. This legislation will \naccomplish those goals.\n  Two weeks ago I convened a hearing on this issue to hear from the \nJustice Department, the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, CMEC, and constitutional scholars. The constitutional \nscholars testified that the provisions of S. 2520 were likely to \nwithstand the inevitable court challenges ahead. Unfortunately, they \ncould not say the same of the Administration's proposal and H.R. 4623. \nProfessor Frederick Schauer from Harvard, who served on the Meese \nCommission on pornography and authored its findings, as well as \nProfessor Anne Coughlin from the University of Virginia both agreed \nthat the Administration's bill and H.R. 4623 crossed over the First \nAmendment line after the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Free \nSpeech Coalition, 122 S. Ct. 1389. Even the ACLU has passed along views \nfrom its First Amendment expert that S. 2520 is ``well crafted and \nshould survive constitutional scrutiny.''\n  That point is crucially important, because it does no one any good to \npass a ``quick fix'' law that will land us right back where we started \nin five years, with no valid law on the books to protect our Nation's \nchildren from exploitation. We owe our children more than a press \nconference on this issue, we owe them a law that lasts.\n  I am not alone in that view. Testimony at the Judiciary Committee \nhearing made this point clearly. Professor Schauer testified in support \nof the basic provisions of the PROTECT Act, but warned us about the \nAdministration's proposal. Incidently, this same constitutional law \nscholar testified in favor of the Child Pornography Prevention Act, \nCPPA, in 1996, but he also correctly warned us then about the precise \nparts of that law that would be struck down. Here is what he said this \ntime around:\n\n       [W]hether it is open to academic or congressional \n     criticism, Justice Kennedy's opinion for a 7-2 Court still \n     represents the definitive and authoritative interpretation of \n     the First Amendment in the child pornography context, and \n     thus represents the law. Legislation inconsistent with Free \n     Speech Coalition would not only be inconsistent with current \n     constitutional law, therefore, but would also represent a \n     tactical mistake in an attempt to combat the horror of child \n     pornography. As the six year course of litigation under the \n     previous Act so well demonstrates, constitutionally suspect \n     legislation under existing Supreme Court interpretations of \n     the First Amendment, whatever we may think of the wisdom and \n     accuracy of those interpretations, puts the process of \n     prosecuting the creators of child pornography on hold while \n     the appellate courts proceed at their own slow pace. There is \n     room in our legislative world for legislation that is largely \n     symbolic, but for Congress to enact symbolic but likely \n     unconstitutional legislation would have the principal effect \n     of postponing for conceivably six more years the ability to \n     prosecute those creators of child pornography whose \n     prosecution is consistent with the Supreme Court's view of \n     the First Amendment.\n\n  After our Judiciary Committee hearing, Senator Hatch and I continued \nto work to improve our bill to address concerns that had been raised. \nWe worked to come up with a Hatch-Leahy substitute amendment for \nconsideration by the Judiciary Committee that included technical \ncorrections and improvements to the original text of S. 2520 that we \ncould both agree upon. These included addressing some issues raised by \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, CMEC, \nconcerning the scope of the victim shield provision to limit that \nprovision to ``non-physical'' information.\n  The changes in the proposed Hatch-Leahy substitute also included \nadopting the House bill's measures allowing the CMEC to share \ninformation from its tip line directly with State and local law \nenforcement officers, instead of always passing the information through \nthe FBI. Although the Administration did not originally ask for this \nchange, the CMEC has reported that the FBI is either unwilling or \nunable to share information from the child exploitation tip line in a \ntimely manner with state and local law enforcement. As the Chairman of \nthe Committee charged with overseeing the FBI, I was disappointed to \nhear this appraisal of the FBI. To remedy this situation, and in the \nspirit of compromise and reconciling this legislation with the House \npassed bill, the substitute to S. 2520 incorporates this change.\n\n  I note that Senator Hatch would not agree to accept my proposal that \nwe also include a provision that would ensure that tips to the child \nexploitation tip lines come from ``non governmental sources'' so that \ngovernment agents could not ``tickle'' the tip line to try to avoid the \nlegal requirements of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. I did \nnot insist on this important provision because, with time running out \nin this Congress, we must all compromise if we want to pass a bill, and \nI want to pass this bill.\n  In any event, I placed S. 2520 on the Judiciary Committee agenda for \nits meeting on October 8, 2002. Unfortunately, due to procedural \nissues, including the two hour rule that was invoked because of the \ndebate on Iraq, and procedural maneuvering that centered around \njudicial nominations, members from the other side of the aisle objected \nto the consideration of this and all other legislative proposals before \nthe Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee was, consequently, \nunable to consider the bipartisan substitute circulated by Senator \nHatch, and to which I agreed.\n  The substitute for which I now seek unanimous consent is identical to \nthe proposed Committee substitute that Senator Hatch circulated with \ntwo exceptions. First, the substitute removes three lines that were not \nin the original language of S. 2520 as introduced by Senator Hatch and \nthat were inadvertently included in the version of the substitute \ncirculated by Senator Hatch. Indeed, I am advised that Senator Hatch \nwas prepared to strike these 3 lines had the Judiciary Committee \nconsidered the substitute. The Leahy amendment simply corrects this \ninadvertent error, which was totally understandable in the rush of \nbusiness.\n  The second change the substitute makes in order to assure swift \npassage of this measure is to render the new affirmative defense \ncreated in S. 2520 available to defendants who can prove\n\n[[Page S10488]]\n\nthat actual adults, and no children, were used to create the visual \nimages involved. This change would provide no help to defendants \nseeking to assert a ``virtual porn'' defense, which would still be \nblocked both for the new category of material created by the statute \nand any obscene child pornography. But in the case of a defendant who \ncan, for instance, actually produce in court the 25-year old that is \nshown in the allegedly obscene material and prove that it is not, in \nfact, child pornography, or even virtual child pornography, the defense \nwould be available. Indeed, Justice O'Connor in her concurring opinion \nin the Free Speech case specifically concluded that the prior law's \nprohibition on such ``youthful adult'' pornography was overbroad. As \nthe testimony at our Committee hearing made clear, we should be careful \nnot to repeat this mistake.\n  Other than that, this substitute is the exactly same as the \nsubstitute circulated by Senator Hatch before the Judiciary Committee's \nmeeting on October 8, 2002. The definitions of child pornography are \nthe same; the new tools for prosecutors to catch and punish those who \nexploit children are the same; the new tools given to the Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children are the same. This is, for all intent \nand purposes, the same as the Hatch-Leahy substitute.\n  This is a bipartisan compromise that will protect our children and \nhonor the Constitution. I urge members from the other side of the aisle \nto join us. Do not hold this bill hostage as part of some effort at \npolitical payback or a ``tit for tat'' strategy. Let this bill pass the \nSenate and give law enforcement the tools they need to protect our \nchildren in the internet age.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10488-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 20 minutes of debate on \nthe conference report.\n  Mr. DODD. I presume that time is equally divided between Senator \nMcConnell and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. We spoke at some length yesterday, and my colleague from \nMissouri was very involved. I am prepared to reserve my time until \nSenator Bond and Senator McConnell have time to talk about this report.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today with a sense of relief and \nsatisfaction that we have come to the end of this marathon to do \nsomething I believe everybody in this body and in the other body \nbelieve is vitally important. We need to change the system to make it \neasier to vote and tougher to cheat. I begin by offering my sincere \nthanks and congratulations to Senator Dodd, to Senator McConnell on our \nside, for their great work, to our good friends on the House side, \nChairman Ney and Congressman Hoyer. We have gotten to know them much \nbetter over the last months as we have worked together. This has been \ntruly an heroic effort.\n  The 2000 election opened the eyes of many Americans to the flaws and \nfailures of our election machinery, our voting systems, and even how we \ndetermine what a vote is.\n  We learned of hanging chads and inactive lists. We discovered our \nmilitary's votes were mishandled and lost. We learned of legal voters \nturned away, while dead voters cast ballots. We discovered that many \npeople voted twice, while too many weren't even counted once.\n  This final compromise bill--and it is a compromise in the truest \nsense of the word--tries to address each of the fundamental problems we \nhave discovered.\n  For starters, this bill provides $3.9 billion in funding over the \nnext 5 years to help States and localities improve and update their \nvoting systems. In addition to providing this financial help, we also \nprovide specific minimum requirements for the voting systems so that we \ncan be assured that the machinery meets minimum error rates and that \nvoters are given the opportunity to correct any errors that they have \nmade prior to their vote being cast.\n  This bill also provides funding to help ensure the disabled have \naccess to the polling place and that the voting system is fully \naccessible to those with disabilities. A very special thanks to the \nSenator from Connecticut for this unwavering commitment to those goals.\n  We also create a new Election Administration Commission to be a \nclearinghouse for the latest technologies and improvements, as well as \nthe agency who will be responsible for funneling the federal funds to \nStates and localities. This reflects a great deal of effort by the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky.\n  Then the bill attempts to address one of my key concerns, and that of \ncourse is the issue of vote fraud.\n  Now, I like dogs and I have respect for the dearly departed, but I do \nnot think we should allow them to vote. Protecting the integrity of the \nballot box is important to all Americans, but especially to Missouri \nbecause of our State's sad history of widespread vote fraud. This \nlegislation recognizes that illegal votes dilute the value of legally \ncast votes--a kind of disenfranchisement no less serious than not being \nable to cast a ballot.\n  If your vote is canceled by the vote of a dog or a dead person, it is \nas if you did not have a right to vote. Much has been said about this. \nWe have even heard from some colleagues in groups that vote fraud does \nnot really exist. We have been told by professors and other learned \nfolks in ivory towers that vote fraud really only exists in movies. \nWell, gang, come down out of your ivory towers. We can explain it to \nyou. We know better.\n  In just the past month we learned of voter scams in Pennsylvania, and \nnow we are learning of an ongoing FBI investigation in South Dakota \nwhere the media reports:\n\n       Every vote counts--unless ballots are being cast by people \n     who don't exist, are dead, or who don't even live in South \n     Dakota. A major case involving those voter fraud issues has \n     been under investigation by the FBI for the past month.\n\n  If vote fraud is happening in South Dakota, it could be happening \neverywhere. In fact, in a report just released, which reviewed voter \nfile information across State lines, nearly 700,000 people were \nregistered in more than one State and over 3,000 double-voted in the \n2000 election. That is 3,000 vote fraud penalties, felonies, waiting to \nbe prosecuted. I hope local, State, and Federal officials involved will \naggressively pursue these crimes.\n  But, as I have said numerous times since I began this quest with \nSenators Dodd and McConnell many months ago, I believe that an election \nreform bill must have two goals--make it easier to vote but tougher to \ncheat.\n  Lets discuss for a moment a few of our registered voters: Barnabas \nMiller of California, Parker Carroll of North Carolina, Packie Lamont \nof Washington, D.C., Cocoa Fernandez of Florida, Holly Briscoe of \nMaryland, Maria Princess Salas of Texas and Ritzy Mekler of Missouri.\n  They are a new breed of American voter. Barnabas and Cocoa are \npoodles. Parker is a Labrador. Maria Princess is a Chihuahua, Holly is \na Jack Russell Terrier, and Ritzy is a Springer-Spaniel.\n  So has our voting system really gone to the dogs? And what can we do \nabout it? This final bill takes this issue\n\n[[Page S10489]]\n\nsquare on, and I am very pleased that this final agreement retains and \nstrengthens the anti-vote fraud provisions we spend so much time \nfighting to include:\n  New voters who choose to register by mail must provide proof of \nidentity at some point in the process, whether at initial registration, \nwhen they vote in person or by mail. Among the kinds of acceptable \nforms of identification: utility bill, government check, bank \nstatement, or drivers license--no dog licenses, please. In lieu of the \nindividual providing proof of identity, States may also electronically \nverify an individual's identity against existing State databases. This \nshould go a long way toward solving the fraud occuring in South Dakota.\n  States will be required to maintain a statewide voter registration \nlist.\n  Mail-in registration cards will now require applicants specifically \nto affirm their American citizenship.\n  The bill makes it a Federal crime to conspire to commit voter fraud. \nThose behind illegal vote fraud activities will be subject to \npenalties, not just the poor operatives who signed the fraudulent \napplications.\n  Voters who do not appear on a registration list must be allowed to \ncast a provisional ballot. Voters without proper identification are \nalso allowed to vote provisionally, but no provisional ballot will be \ncounted until it is properly verified as a legal vote under state law.\n  If a poll is held open beyond the time provided by State law, votes \ncast after that time would be provisional and held separately.\n  Finally, voters will be required to include either their driver's \nlicense number or the last four digits of their social security number \non their voter registration form. Again, this reform will also help in \nuncovering the fraud that is occuring in South Dakota.\n  I believe that these meaningful reforms will go a long way to helping \nstates clean up voter rolls, and thus clean-up elections.\n  Will Rogers once said, ``I love a dog. He does nothing for political \nreasons.'' Our election laws should keep it that way.\n  Mr. President, the Help America Vote Act contains many important \nprovisions that will improve the equipment voters use to cast ballots \nat the polls. It also will take major steps to prevent fraud, which \ndisenfranchises voters by cancelling the votes of legal voters with \nillegal votes. This bill follows in the path of the Voting Rights Act, \nthe National Voter Registration Act and other Federal voting statutes \nthe enhance the voting rights of all Americans and protect the exercise \nof their franchise. These important provisions deserve further review \nso their meaning and the intent of Congress in including the provisions \nin the bill is clearly understood.\n  By passage of this legislation, Congress has made a statement that \nvote fraud exists in this country. The many reported cases and \nincidents of registration and vote fraud revealed in testimony before \nCongress, in our debates and in the press make it imperative that we \nimplement such standards that are clearly within the Constitutional \npower and prerogatives of Congress.\n  A principle concern of Congress addressed in this bill is the abuse \nof mail registration cards, created by Congress as part of the National \nVoter Registration Act, for the purpose of committing vote fraud. The \ncreation by Congress of the mail registration cards opened an new \navenue for vote fraud in many States. NVRA requires States and \nlocalities to accept registration cards through the mail while limiting \nthe ability of states and localities to authenticate or verify the \nregistrations. Accordingly, the mail-in registration cards have become \na means of unscrupulous individuals to register the names of deceased, \nineligible or simply non-existent people to vote.\n  In my home State of Missouri, there is abundant evidence of these \ncards being used for the purpose of getting phony names, the names of \nthe deceased and even the names of pets on voter rolls. Someone even \nregistered the deceased mother of the prosecuting attorney of the City \nof St. Louis. Names have been registered to drop-houses, businesses, \nunion halls, Mail-box Etc. and vacant lots. From there the people \nbehind the fraud can request an absentee ballot in the name of the \nvoter or attempt to go to the polls and cast a vote under the assumed \nname.\n  Congress agreed that while the mail-in cards have made registration \nmore accessible, the policy has also created increased opportunities \nfor fraud. To address this, we created an identification requirement \nfor first-time voters who register by mail. The security of the \nregistration and voting process is of paramount concern to Congress and \nthe identification provision and the fraud provisions in this bill are \nnecessary to guarantee the integrity of our public elections and to \nprotect the vote of individual citizens from being devalued by fraud. \nEvery false registration and every fraudulent ballot cast harms the \nsystem by cancelling votes cast by legitimate voters. It undermines the \nconfidence of the public that their vote counts and therefore \nundermines public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process.\n  Under this new Federal requirement, those who choose to register by \nmail will have to show identification before the first time they vote \nin that jurisdiction. If the voter is registering to vote in a State \nthat has a statewide voter registration system complying with the \nrequirements of this bill, the voter will have to show identification \nbefore the first time they vote in that state. The voter has to show \nidentification at some point between the time they register and the \ntime they vote. To comply with the identification requirement, the \nvoter can include a copy of the identification with their registration \ncard, a copy of the identification can be included with an absentee \nballot or it can be shown when the voter goes to the polling place. The \noption of the voter to vote absentee or to vote at the polls is not \nlimited but the objective of Congress is fulfilled by voters who \nregister by mail verifying the identify of the voter at some point \nbefore they cast their first vote.\n  It must be noted, that in drafting the bill, the authors of the \nSenate bill conducted extensive research. It was the conclusion of the \nauthors based on the research that it is in the capacity of the chief \nstate election official and the overwhelming majority of election \njurisdictions to track the names of those who register by mail. With \nthat information, the election jurisdictions will have accurate and \nample information to determine which voters will be required under the \nterms of this statute to present identification at the polls. It has \nbeen argued that there is likely to be confusion at the polls because \nstates will not have the information as to first time voters. This \nconcern was carefully weighed by the bill's authors and the conferees \nand it was agreed that the evidence does not support the assertion.\n  Regarding the numerous criticisms of this section: this provision \nwill not result in voters being denied the right to vote. Voters who do \nnot have the identification required will be given the opportunity to \ncast a fail safe ballot. Voters who are at the polls will cast a \nprovisional ballot and those who vote by mail will have their ballots \nsubject to additional review to determine validity of the registration.\n  This provision does not single out those who register by mail in an \nimproper manner, rather it builds on the existing structure Congress \ncreated in the National Voter Registration Act. When creating mail \nregistration, Congress recognized the potential for fraud and \nauthorized states to require mail registrants to vote in person the \nfirst time they vote. The approach proved to be inadequate so in this \nbill we took additional steps. The approach we took, however, was \nalready paved in the passage of the National Voter Registration Act.\n  This provision is not discriminatory; the documents required for \nidentification are widely available. The Department of Transportation \nstatistics report that more than 90 percent of Americans of voting age \nhave a drivers license. But to be certain no one will be negatively \nimpacted, the conferees included carefully crafted and balanced \nidentification requirements. The required pieces of identification \ninclude items widely available to all citizens, including the disabled, \nthe poor, new citizens, students and minorities.\n  For example, positive identification is required to apply and receive \nfood stamps. When applying for food stamps, the required identification \nis\n\n[[Page S10490]]\n\nvery similar to that required in this bill, including a driver's \nlicense or some other identification that allows the state to verify \nthe identify of the applicant for the purpose of preventing fraud. \nProvision and verification of an existing social security number is \nrequired before a person can qualify for Federal temporary assistance. \nThe steps taken in this bill are in line with the steps taken by the \nFederal Government to prevent fraud in welfare assistance. Surely clean \nelections, accurate results and faith in the election process is as an \nimportant of an objective as preventing welfare fraud. The conferees \nalso agree that the provision is something that can be readily complied \nwith by the disabled. As we know, many of the disabled are in the work \nenvironment, therefore will be in possession of a paycheck or tax \nreturn or other government document bearing the name and address of the \nvoter. As stated, Federal benefits require an identification. For those \nwho use state or federal services, they again will have identification \nor another government document related to the provision of the service. \nAgain, great steps have been taken to ensure that all Americans can \ncomply with this provision.\n\n  The aged, disabled, the poor and members of minority groups are most \noften the target of fraudulent registration and absentee ballot fraud \nschemes that take advantage of the lack of security in the system, \ntheir ability to register to vote and cast a ballot will be enhanced \nmost by this legislation.\n  The identification requirements do not run afoul of the Voting Rights \nAct. In fact, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Ralph Boyd in \na letter to the Senate stated that the identification provision does \nnot violate the Voting Rights Act. The identification requirement gives \nthe voter choices as to where and at what point in the process to \nproduce identification. The ability of the states to apply this \nprovision in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner is limited by giving \nthe choice to the voter. Furthermore, Congress explicitly provided that \nthe identification requirements are to be administered in a uniform and \nnondiscriminatory manner. Election officials must ask all people for \nidentification when the legislation calls for it.\n  The first time voter ID requirements for those who register by mail \nare obviously not discriminatory since they apply to all voters \nregardless of race, color or ethnic origin and must be applied in a \nuniform and nondiscriminatory manner.\n  It must be noted that one form of identification required is a \ncurrent valid photo identification. It is the intent of the conferees \nthat this identification be issued by a government entity or a \nlegitimate recognized employer. The conferees agree that the \nidentification should not be that of a party organization, a political \norganization, a club or a retail establishment. The conferees intend \nthat the photo identification be something that is extremely difficult \nto falsify or procure under false pretenses.\n  Congress intends the Help America Vote Act to work along side the \nNational Voter Registration Act. However, the identification provision, \nsection 303(b) Requirements for Voters Who Register By Mail, may be \nread by some courts or other parties to require action or conduct \nprohibited by NVRA.\n  It is the intent of Congress that voters who register by mail show \nidentification. If a court reads this obligation to conflict with any \nother statute, it is the intent of Congress that section 303(b) of the \nHelp America Vote Act control in such a situation. Congressional intent \nis reflected by the presence of section 906, which clearly states that \nthis section will be controlling.\n  The conferees recognize that many States have taken steps to address \nfraud. A number of those steps may go beyond that set in this bill. It \nis the agreement of the conferees that this bill in no way limits the \nability of the states from taking steps beyond those required in this \nbill. For instance, several States require those who register by mail \nto vote in person the first time they vote. This bill does not limit a \nState from taking this additional step to address fraud. Each of the \nsteps taken in this bill to address fraud shall be considered to be a \nminimum standard.\n  This legislation sets an additional Federal mandate. All people \nregistering to vote for a Federal election will be required to provide \na driver's license number or the last four digits of their social \nsecurity number on the registration card when they register to vote. If \nan applicant has neither, the registrant should indicate so and the \nState will provide a number at the time the application is processed. \nNo registration can be processed unless this information is included.\n  The authors of this bill found that voter rolls across the country \nare inaccurate or in very poor order, the condition in many \njurisdictions, particularly the large jurisdictions, are in a state of \ncrisis. Voter lists are swollen with the names of people who are no \nlonger eligible to vote in that jurisdiction, are deceased or are \ndisqualified from voting for another reason. It has been found that \n650,000 in this country are registered in more than one State. As of \nOctober of 2002, 60,000 people were registered in Florida and at least \none other state. In St. Louis County, some 30,000 people were \nregistered to vote in the county and at least one other county in the \nState.\n  The conferees agree that a unique identification number attributed to \neach registered voter will be an extremely useful tool for State and \nlocal election officials in managing and maintaining clean and accurate \nvoter lists. It is the agreement of the conferees that election \nofficials must have such a tool. The conferees want the number to be \ntruly unique and something election officials can use to determine on a \nperiodic basis if a voter is still eligible to vote in that \njurisdiction. The social security number and driver's license number \nare issued by government entities and are truly unique to the voter. \nThey are the most unique numbers available, that is why the conferees \nrequire the voter to give the number.\n  Again, it is the intent of the conferees to impose a new Federal \nmandate for voter registration.\n  Under this bill, the use of the full social security number is not \nrequired, a partial social security number is required. That \nrequirement does not conflict with the terms of the Federal privacy \nact. The privacy act states that people cannot be required to give \ntheir social security number except for limited purposes. Registering \nto vote is not one of the exceptions. But the privacy act protection is \nlimited to the full social security number, there.\n\n  The conferees do not want this requirement to conflict with the \nprivacy act, therefore, language was included in the bill to clarify \nthe privacy act with regard to the partial social security number. The \nbill clarifies that the partial social security number is not covered \nby the privacy act, so asking for four digits will not conflict in any \nway.\n  Finally, It is important to note that states that utilize full social \nsecurity numbers for voter registration applicants can continue to do \nso after passage of this legislation. This new registration requirement \nis a minimum standard. If a state requires applicants to provide more \ninformation--such as their entire nine-digit social security number--\nthis legislation will not override that state requirement.\n  Section three of the legislation is known as the minimum standards \nsection. It includes minimum standards for federal election to be \nadopted by the states. The first of the mandates concerns the voting \nsystem, which includes the type of voting machine or method used by a \njurisdiction. This section will require the voting system to meet \nminimum standards. However, the legislation does not seek to ban the \nuse of a particular type of system and it does not instruct a \njurisdiction as to what type of system to use. The intent of the bill \nis to improve the system used; it is not the intent of the legislation \nto prohibit a jurisdiction from using any type of system or to ban a \nvoting system.\n  Under this minimum standard, the voting system in every jurisdiction \nwill have three requirements. First, the voter has to be permitted to \nverify the votes they cast. This requirement gives the voter the \nopportunity to review the ballot after it is filled out and before it \nis cast so that the voter himself can determine if he made a mistake in \nfilling out the ballot. The second requirement\n\n[[Page S10491]]\n\ngives the voter the right to a replacement ballot. The intent of this \nprovision follows on the verification provisions; if a voter finds that \nhe has made a mistake he can ask a poll worker for a replacement ballot \nfor the voter to fill out and cast. The first ballot, of course, will \nbe invalidated by the poll workers. This provision also applies to \nmail-in voting and absentee voting. It does not require a state or \njurisdiction to do anything other than provide a voter the opportunity \nto get a replacement ballot. It is incumbent upon the voter to do so \nbefore any deadline for submitting the absentee or mail ballot.\n  The next voting machine related requirement has to do with over \nvotes, voters who cast more than one vote in a single race and spoil \ntheir ballot. Certain voting technologies, such as the DRE, precinct-\nbased opti-scan and lever machines, notify the voter that they have \nvoted more than once in a single race. If the technology can notify the \nvoter, this section requires that it is employed and voters be \nnotified. There are certain technologies that do not notify the voters \nof overvoters, such as paper ballots, central count systems, punch-card \nsystems and absentee ballots. To satisfy the requirement, jurisdictions \nthat use this system will be required to have in place a voter \neducation system to inform the voter of the consequences of overvoting \nand the remedies that are available should they overvote. This is a \ncompromise and it is consistent with the clear intent of the authors of \nthis bill not to eliminate any type of voting system and allow \njurisdictions to choose the system that is best for that jurisdiction.\n  The legislation also requires every jurisdiction in every State to \noffer voters who claim to be registered in a jurisdiction but do not \nappear on the voter rolls for that jurisdiction the right to cast a \nprovisional ballot. If the voter provides the required information and \nattests to their belief of being properly registered, the voter will be \ngiven a provisional ballot. No voter will be turned away from the polls \nbecause of a mistake or oversight at the administrative level.\n  There are several points I want to make as to how the provisional \nvote is to operate. I also want to clarify the intent of the authors as \nto the extent and limit of the right conferred on the voter by this \nsection.\n  The provisional ballot will be extended to those who arrive at the \npolls to find that their name does not appear on the register of \nvoters. The statute states that the poll worker shall inform the voter \nof the right to vote by provisional ballot. That right, however, is \nextended to those who believe that they are registered to vote and are \nregistered to vote in that particular jurisdiction.\n  It is not the intent of the authors of this bill to extend the right \nto vote by provisional ballot to everyone who shows up at the polls and \nis not registered or for those who are not eligible to vote in the \nelection. The intent is to provide protection to those who in fact \nregistered but do not appear on the register because of an \nadministrative mistake or oversight.\n  Before one can get a provisional ballot, the voter must sign an \naffidavit attesting to the fact that he believes he registered to vote \nin that jurisdiction and that he is eligible to vote in that election. \nSo in addition to the registration question, the voter must also state \nthat he is not disqualified from voting in the election, such a reason \nmay include felony status or the voter has already cast an absentee \nvote in the race.\n  Once the voter turns over his ballot, it will not be tabulated until \nthe information provided by the voter as to his registration status is \nverified. In verifying the information about the voter, the language of \nthe statute states that the information provided shall be transmitted \nto a state or local election official for verification of the \ninformation. This language reflects the intent of the authors of the \nbill that the registration and eligibility of the voter be verified by \nan election official before the ballot is counted. It is also the \nintent of the authors that the verification be done by someone other \nthan the poll workers and that the ballot be segregated from other \nballots until that information is verified. The authors went to lengths \nto ensure that the ballot is not simply counted once cast, rather a \nreview of the information is to be conducted on the status of the \nvoter.\n  Furthermore, ballots will be counted according to state law. If it is \ndetermined that the voter is registered in a neighboring jurisdiction \nand state law requires the voter to vote in the jurisdiction in which \nhe is registered, meaning the vote was not cast in accordance with \nState law, the vote will not count. It was contemplated by the authors \nof the statute that under such circumstances, the vote will not count. \nIt is not the intent of the authors to overturn State laws regarding \nregistration or state laws regarding the jurisdiction in which a ballot \nmust be cast to be counted.\n\n  Additionally, it is inevitable that voters will mistakenly arrive at \nthe wrong polling place. If it is determined by the poll workers that \nthe voter is registered but has been assigned to a different polling \nplace, it is the intent of the authors of this bill that the poll \nworker can direct the voter to the correct polling place. In most \nStates, the law is specific on the polling place where the voter is to \ncast his ballot. Again, this bill upholds state law on that subject.\n  The legislation also speaks to efforts, through litigation or \notherwise, to extend polling hours beyond those set by law. Under this \nbill, those who vote in an election as a result of an order extending \npolling hours, they will be required to cast a provisional ballot. This \nsection only covers those who vote as a result of the order, it does \nnot cover those who are in line before the polls close but cast their \nballot after the closing time.\n  Those who vote as a result of the order will cast a provisional \nballot and the ballots are to be held separately from other provisional \nballots cast in that race.\n  As we have seen before in elections, lower courts have issued orders \nto extend polling hours only to have their order overturned later in \nthe day. But prior to passage of this bill, once ballots are cast, we \nhave no way of retrieving those ballots and candidates will be credited \nwith votes that should never have been cast. With the method required \nby this legislation, the ballots of those voting based on the order \nwill be segregated and identifiable. If the order is overturned, the \nparties involved in the election and perhaps the courts can then \ndetermine how to reconcile those ballots. It only seems fair that if \nthe order is overturned and a higher court decides that the polling \nhours should not have been extended, then the ballots cast as a result \nof that order should not count for or against any of the candidates.\n  The legislation also requires states to set up a computerized, \nstatewide voter registration system to maintain the names of all \nregistered, eligible voters. It has been discovered that in states \nacross the country, registration lists contains the names of people who \nhave left the jurisdiction, who are not eligible to vote because of \ntheir status as a felon, who are deceased or who are not eligible to \nvote in that jurisdiction for any number of reasons.\n  As I prepared to draft this legislation, I reviewed the voting lists \nin two jurisdictions in my State, St. Louis City and St. Louis County. \nIn the city, I found that one in ten voters were also registered \nsomewhere else in the State and at the time of the November 2000 \nelection, there were more registered voters than there were city \nresidents of voting age. In St. Louis County, I found nearly 35,000 \npeople who were registered somewhere else in the State. It was not \nunusual to find people who were registered four times in the state.\n  It is well documented that registration lists around the country as \nin disarray; they are bloated and contain the names of thousands of \npeople that no longer belong on the list. In part, this is because we \nlive in an increasingly mobile society. It is also because congress \nmade it more difficult for localities to maintain clean lists when \nMotor Voter was passed.\n  Under this law, States will be required to maintain a State system \nand therefore the central database of information containing the names \nof all registered voters in the state.\n  In most States, registration will be maintained for the first time on \na statewide basis rather than jurisdiction by jurisdiction. This will \nnot affect the obligation on the States to\n\n[[Page S10492]]\n\nconduct list maintenance according to the provisions of the National \nVoter Registration Act. First, for those States who are exempt from \nmotor voter, this will not affect that exemption and it will not affect \nthe way they maintain their voter lists. All other States must comply \nwith NVRA maintenance provisions. This legislation does not limit the \ncircumstances under which States can remove names from voter lists. The \nnotice provisions must still be complied with, although they have been \naltered by the terms of this legislation.\n  The requirement for a state-wide registration system will enhance the \nintegrity of our election process, making it easier for citizens to \nvote and have their ballots counted, while clearing ineligible and \nfalse registrations from the voter rolls.\n  The Help America Vote Act also includes two new crimes directed at \nthose who commit vote fraud. This should be taken as further evidence \nof the extent of the concern of the conferees and Congress at large \nabout voter fraud and the lengths that should be gone to stop voter \nfraud. One section in particular section, 905(a), requires additional \nclarification.\n  This section is as well intended to work with NVRA. Under NVRA, \npeople who use the mail registration card for the purpose of committing \nvote fraud are subject to a criminal penalty. The reading of NVRA \nappears to limit that to the person who actually commits the act, \nwhether it be sign the false card, mail the false card or turn it in to \nthe election officials. Section 905(a) of the Help America Vote Act, is \nintended to extend that reach of the statute to cover those who \norganize the fraudulent use of mail registration cards or who conspire \nwith others to use the mail registration cards to commit vote fraud. \nTherefore, it is clear it is the intent of Congress to extend the reach \nof the law to get the conspirators and the ring leaders in committing \nvote fraud.\n  Mr. President, I close expressing my sincere appreciation to the \nstaff. On Senator Dodd's staff: Shawn Maher, Kennie Gill, and Ronnie \nGillespie. On Senator McConnell's staff: Brian Lewis, Leon Sequeira, \nand Chris Moore. On the staff of Congressman Ney: Paul Vinovich, Chet \nKalis, Roman Buhler, Matt Peterson, Pat Leahy. On Congressman Hoyer's \nstaff: Keith Abouchar, Lennie Shambon, and Bill Cable.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dodd for that statement \nwhich clearly reflects the intent of the authors of the bill on these \nimportant sections. If the Senator would yield, I would like to ask him \nsome questions regarding various sections of this bill.\n  This conference report has a section on alternative language \naccessibility of voting systems, but the bill does not expand the \nlanguage accessibility beyond what is already required under the Voting \nRights Act. Is that the understanding of the conferees on alternate \nlanguage accessibility?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct. The Voting Rights Act requires certain \nvoting materials to be available to the language groups delineated in \nthe Voting Rights Act statute. The language in the bill simply States \nthat the statute should be enforced. It is the intent of the authors to \ndisplay our belief that enforcement of the Voting Rights Act is \nimportant but it is not the intent of the authors to expand that right.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator would yield, I have a few more \nquestions.\n  This bill makes significant changes in the voter registration process \nfor Federal elections. These changes are designed to clean up our \nNation's voter registration lists and reduce fraudulent registrations \nand voting. Congress has a compelling interest in protecting the \nintegrity of the Federal election process. This legislation will \nfurther that interest by helping to ensure accurate voter rolls, which \nis the first step in ensuring fair elections. The senior Senator from \nMissouri was a conferee on this bill and he has seen many instances of \nduplicate voter registrations and voter fraud in his State. I would \nlike to ask the Senator from Missouri if his understanding of the \nfunction and purpose of these new provisions is consistent with my \nunderstanding and the intent of the conferees on this conference \nreport.\n  The conference report on H.R. 3295 requires that individuals who \nregister to vote on or after January 1, 2004, for Federal elections \nmust provide their driver's license number on the registration form. If \nthe individual has not been issued a valid driver's license number, \nthen that individual must provide the last four digits of his or her \nsocial security number on the registration form. In the unlikely event \nthat an individual has neither been issued a driver's license number, \nnor a social security number, the State shall issue that individual a \nrandom registration number.\n  The State will then verify the registration information provided by \nthe individual with information in the State's department of motor \nvehicle database. The State's department of motor vehicle database will \nbe also be cross-checked against Social Security Administration \nrecords. It is important to note that States that utilize full social \nsecurity numbers for voter registration applicants can continue to do \nso after passage of this legislation. This new registration requirement \nis a minimum standard. If a State requires applicants to provide more \ninformation--such as their entire nine-digit social security number--\nthis legislation will not override that State requirement.\n  Furthermore, the new computerized statewide registration systems that \nwe require States to implement will also help safeguard voter \nregistration lists against fraud. A State's use of a statewide voter \nregistration list will not, however, override State registration \nrequirements. Thus, even though a voter's registration information has \nbeen entered into the statewide list that does not mean a voter will \nnever have to re-register if that voter moves to a different \njurisdiction within the State. The intent of the conferees is to \nprovide a centralized list of registered voters to help guard against \nfraud. The intent is not to create one-time registration for voters and \nforce States to let individuals vote from locations other than the \nprecinct in which the voter is registered.\n  I ask the Senator from Missouri if my explanation of these provisions \nreflects the intent of the conferees on this legislation?\n  Mr. BOND. I agree with the Senator from Kentucky. His understanding \nof these new voter registration provisions is correct. These provisions \nwere designed to create more accurate voter lists and help ensure the \nintegrity of elections. Recent studies have found that there are more \nthan 720,000 people registered in more than one State. Duplicate \nregistrations provide the opportunity for unscrupulous people to commit \nfraud and undermine honest elections by, in effect, invalidating \nlegally cast ballots.\n  Voter fraud can occur in many ways: submitting registration forms in \nthe name of deceased or fictitious people is one of the most common. \nBut some folks even fill out registration cards in the name of their \npet. In my home State of Missouri and in several other States and \nlocalities across the country, we have seen serious documented cases of \nfraudulent voter registrations. I have spoken many times of the fraud \nin St. Louis in the 2000 election and this is an ongoing and indeed, a \nnationwide, problem. Just last week, we learned that the FBI is \ninvestigating widespread voter fraud in South Dakota and Pennsylvania.\n  Based on the extensive documentation we have seen, there can be no \ndoubt that voter fraud is a serious and real problem in Federal \nelections. The use of driver's license numbers and full or partial \nsocial security numbers will help elections officials to verify the \nidentity and eligibility of individuals and reduce fraudulent voter \nregistrations from being added to our voter rolls.\n  I should also note that these provisions apply to all registrants for \nFederal elections regardless of the registrant's race, color or ethnic \norigin. It is not a burdensome or discriminatory requirement in any \nway. In fact, several States already require individuals to provide \nthis type of information on voter registration applications. Some \nStates require even more information from applicants, such as their \nfull nine-digit social security number. We have seen that States that \nrequire additional identifying information from registrants have \nsubstantially fewer\n\n[[Page S10493]]\n\nduplicate and fraudulent registrations on their voter rolls.\n\n  So, again, I agree with the Senator of Kentucky and am pleased to \nreport the conferees agreed that voter fraud is a serious problem and \nincluded these provisions to help reduce that fraud and clean up the \nNation's voter rolls.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would also like to ask my fellow conferee, the \nSenator from Missouri, about another voter registration provision in \nthis legislation. It is my understanding that some voter registration \napplications currently in use are ambiguous with regard to questions \nabout an applicant's citizenship status. Because of these ambiguous \nquestions and instructions for answering the questions, the conferees \nconcluded that registration forms should provide additional guidance to \nregistration applicants and election officials who process voter \nregistrations.\n  This legislation requires that voter registration applications \ncontain a question asking whether the applicant is a U.S. citizen and \nboxes for the applicant to answer the question by checking ``yes'' or \n``no.'' If neither box is checked, the election official must return \nthe application to the individual with instructions to complete the \nform. In effect, we have created a second-chance registration \nopportunity. The individual's registration application cannot be \nprocessed and the individual cannot be registered unless the \ncitizenship question is answered--and answered affirmatively. The \nregistration form shall also inform the applicant of this procedure I \nhave just described.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from Kentucky has accurately described the \nintent and effect of this provision. I would also add, as I am sure the \nSenator from Kentucky recalls, we learned that many jurisdictions in \nthis country have experienced continual confusion over citizenship \nquestions on registration forms. Some jurisdictions simply discard \nregistration applications or do not process the application when an \nindividual does not answer the citizenship question. Other \njurisdictions register individuals even though the individual did not \nanswer the citizenship question. Both of these scenarios threaten the \nintegrity of Federal elections. By requiring that incomplete \nregistration cards be returned to applicants, we help ensure that those \nwho innocently overlooked part of the registration form will be \nprovided a second opportunity to complete it.\n  As previously Stated, Congress has a compelling interest in \nprotecting the integrity of the Federal election process. The conferees \non H.R. 3295 believe that through this additional instruction about the \ncitizenship question, both voter registration applicants and elections \nofficials will take the appropriate actions to ensure those who are \nentitled to register are actually registered. Through this \nclarification and requirement that individuals affirmatively declare \ntheir U.S. citizenship, we help ensure that only eligible voters vote \nin Federal elections.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would also like to ask the senior Senator from \nMissouri about language in section 301 of the conference report. \nSection 301(a)(1), regarding Voting System Standards, says a voting \nsystem shall permit a voter to verify in a private and independent \nmanner the votes selected. Section 301(a)(1) also says a voting system \nshall provide a voter an opportunity in a private and independent \nmanner to change his or her ballot before the ballot is cast and \ncounted.\n  Am I correct that the conferees included the language ``in a private \nand independent manner'' to ensure that individuals can verify and \nchange their votes free from intimidation or coercion from poll \nworkers, election officials or others?\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from Kentucky is correct. The language ``in a \nprivate and independent manner'' was added to the Voting System \nStandards requirements to underscore the conferees' belief that voters \nshould not be harassed or intimidated at the polling place. Section \n301(a)(1)(C) of the conference report also emphasizes that the privacy \nof the voter and confidentiality of the ballot is paramount. If a voter \nchooses to review his ballot and or make changes to his ballot, he \nshould be able to do so free from the interference of others.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have a couple of more questions for the Senator from \nMissouri. The Conference Report on H.R. 3295 contains a new requirement \nthat voters in Federal elections have the opportunity to cast a \nprovisional ballot in cases where that person's name does not appear on \nthe list of eligible voters at a polling site and the voter declares \nthat he or she is properly registered to vote at that polling site. I \nwould like to ask the senior Senator from Missouri about the \nprovisional ballot requirement.\n  Am I correct that this legislation does not require a State or \nlocality to count a provisional ballot cast by an individual who is not \nproperly registered in the jurisdiction where the individual attempts \nto vote? And furthermore, this legislation does not require a State or \nlocality to permit a voter who is not registered in a jurisdiction to \nvote from that jurisdiction?\n  And am I also correct that a provisional ballot will be provided to a \nvoter if a poll worker or other individual, pursuant to State law, \nchallenges a voter's eligibility to cast a ballot?\n  Mr. BOND. I agree completely with the Senator's description of this \nprovision. Congress has said only that voters in Federal elections \nshould be given a provisional ballot if they claim to be registered in \na particular jurisdiction and that jurisdiction does not have the \nvoter's name on the list of registered voters. The voter's ballot will \nbe counted only if it is subsequently determined that the voter was in \nfact properly registered and eligible to vote in that jurisdiction.\n  In other words, the provisional ballot will be counted only if it is \ndetermined that the voter was properly registered, but the voter's name \nwas erroneously absent from the list of registered voters. This \nprovision is in no way intended to require any State or locality to \nallow voters to vote from any place other than the polling site where \nthe voter is registered.\n  Further, as the Senator from Kentucky correctly pointed out, if State \nlaw permits the challenge of provisional voters by someone other than \nelection officials, this legislation does not prevent that particular \nState practice.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the distinguished Senator from Missouri for \nhis insightful answers to my questions and for his tireless work on \nthis conference report. I urge my colleagues to vote for the conference \nreport.\n  Today is a monumental day for the United States Senate. After 22 \nmonths of hard work, we are finally ready to vote, and hopefully \noverwhelmingly approve, election reform legislation. The House-Senate \nconference committee has presented this body with an outstanding piece \nof legislation.\n  This conference report will usher in tremendous improvements to the \nelections process across this country and the Federal Government will \nshare the costs. Through the establishment of an independent bipartisan \ncommission, States will receive the best objective information on \nimproving election systems.\n  The conference report will ensure that those who are legally \nregistered and eligible to vote are able to do so, and do so only once. \nThe new requirements for the creation of statewide voter registration \ndatabases, voter registration and mail-in registrants voting for the \nfirst times are the core of the new protections against fraudulent \nregistration and fraudulent voting.\n  I thank the State and local organizations that have been there with \nus from the beginning and a special thank you to Doug Lewis from the \nElection Center. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a list of those organizations whose expertise and support \nwas invaluable throughout the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Once again I would like to thank and congratulate \nSenators' Dodd and Bond and Congressmen Ney and Hoyer and the rest of \nthe election reform conferees.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this historic \nconference report.\n  In my remarks yesterday I thanked the various staff members on both \nsides of the aisle for their outstanding work.\n  Also I ask unanimous consent an editorial in today's Wall Street \nJournal\n\n[[Page S10494]]\n\ncalled ``Dead Men Voting'' about the scandal unfolding in South Dakota \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 16, 2002]\n\n                Voter Fraud Wanders Off the Reservation\n\n                           (By John H. Fund)\n\n       Today the Senate will approve and send to President Bush a \n     landmark bill that will upgrade voting machines and begin to \n     curb the voter fraud that is creeping into too many close \n     elections. It can't come soon enough. Last week, a massive \n     vote-fraud scandal broke out in a Senate race in Tom \n     Daschel's home state of South Dakota that could determine \n     control of that body.\n       The FBI and state authorities are investigating hundreds of \n     possible cases of voter registration and absentee ballot \n     fraud. Attorney General Mark Barnett, a Republican, says the \n     probe centers on or near Indian reservations. ``All of those \n     counties are being flooded with new voters, ``says Adele \n     Enright, the Democratic auditor of Dewey County. ``We just \n     got a huge envelope of 350 absentee ballot applications \n     postmarked from the Sioux Falls office of the Democratic \n     Party.''\n       Steve Aberle, the Dewey County state's attorney, says, many \n     of the applications are in the same handwriting. At least one \n     voter, Richard Maxon, says his signature was forged. Mr. \n     Aberle, a Democrat with relatives in the Cheyenne River \n     Tribe, says many Native Americans have wanted little to do \n     with ``the white man's government.'' But this year many \n     tribal elections have been scheduled for Nov. 5, the same day \n     as the critical election for Democrat Tim Johnson's Senate \n     seat. A Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee memo last \n     month noted that the ``party has been working closely with \n     the Native population to register voters and Senator Johnson \n     has set up campaign offices on every reservation.''\n       More and more counties are uncovering fraud. Rapid City \n     officials are investigating two brothers who may have forged \n     registrations. Denise Red Horse of Ziebach County died Sept. \n     3 in a car crash. But both Ziebach and Dewey counties found \n     separate absentee-ballot applications from her dated Sept. 21 \n     in bundles of applications mailed from Democratic \n     headquarters. Maka Duta, who worked for the Democratic Party \n     collecting registrations in Ziebach, bought a county history \n     book that contains many local names. Some are turning up in \n     the pile of new registrations. At least nine absentee ballot \n     requests have been returned by the post office. Mable Romero \n     says she receive a registration card for her three-year-old \n     granddaughter, Ashley. Some voters claim to have been offered \n     cash to register to vote. In both Dewey and Ziebach counties, \n     the number of registered voters easily exceeds the number of \n     residents over 18 counted by the 2000 census.\n       Renee Dross, an election clerk for Shannon County, says her \n     office has received some 1,100 new voter registrations in a \n     county with only 10,000 people. ``Many were clearly signed by \n     the same person,'' she says. Some registrants actually live \n     in neighboring Nebraska. As in most states, South Dakotans \n     are on an ``honor system'' and don't show photo ID to \n     register or vote. Only the unprecedented flood of \n     applications raised any suspicions.\n       State Democrats told the Christian Science Monitor they \n     expect 10,000 new votes from the Indian reservations this \n     year. In 1996, Sen. Johnson won by only 8,600 votes. Russell \n     LaFountain, the director of Native Vote 2008, says his \n     organizers are encouraging ``strong absentee balloting.'' \n     Pine Ridge Reservation residents told me that 11 workers are \n     being paid $14 an hour to contact voters. The statewide \n     Indian voter project is run by Brian Drapeaux and Rich \n     Gordon, two former staffers for Sen. Daschle. Democratic \n     officials say they've fired Ms. Duta and claim they were the \n     first to bring the fraud to light. Ms. Enright, the Dewey \n     County auditor, says that claim isn't true and is ``pure \n     spin.''\n       Voter fraud isn't unknown on reservations. Democrats have \n     often given out free tickets to Election Day picnics for \n     voters on the Pine Ridge Reservation, where 63% of people \n     live below the poverty level. In 1998, that prompted U.S. \n     Attorney Karen Schreier, a Democrat, and Attorney General \n     Barnett, a Republican, to write an unusual joint letter to \n     county auditors noting that ``simply offering to provide'' \n     food or gifts ``in exchange for showing up to vote is clearly \n     against the law.'' Amazingly, Kate Looby, the Democratic \n     candidate for secretary of state this year, has criticized \n     laws barring the holding of picnics for those who vote. She \n     also wants to drop restrictions on absentee voting.\n       Making voting easy is desirable, but only if legitimate \n     voters don't have their civil right cancelled out by those \n     who shouldn't vote. In 1980, only about 5% of voters \n     nationwide cast absentee or early ballots. Now nearly 20% do. \n     ``Absentee voting is the preferred choice of those who commit \n     voter fraud,'' says Larry Sabato, a professor at the \n     University of Virginia. He suggests media outlets set up \n     ``campaign corruption hotlines'' and begin taking voter fraud \n     seriously. The Miami Herald won a Pulitzer Prize in 1998 \n     after its stories on how 56 absentee-ballot ``vote brokers'' \n     forged ballots in a Miami election. The sitting mayor was \n     removed from office.\n       In Texas, Democrat state Rep. Debra Danburg, who chairs the \n     state House elections panel, has tried without success to \n     reform absentee-ballot laws that are so loose she says they \n     make ``elderly voters a target group for fraud.'' Eric \n     Mountain of the Dallas County district attorney's office says \n     some campaigns have paid vote brokers $10 to $15 a ballot. \n     Many seniors are visited at home and persuaded to have \n     someone mark an absentee ballot for them. Others have \n     absentee ballots stolen from their mailboxes.\n       The law Congress is passing addresses some of the problems \n     the federal government created with the 1994 Motor Voter Law. \n     Let's hope the latest scandal in South Dakota--uncovered only \n     due to incredibly sloppy cheating--prompts states to examine \n     their own absentee-ballot laws so they will stop being \n     treated as an engraved invitation to fraud.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Thank you to the following organizations for their \n     significant contributions and steadfast support:\n       Election Center;\n       National Association of Secretaries of State;\n       National Association of Counties;\n       National Conference of State Legislatures;\n       National Association of State Election Directors; and\n       National Association of County Recorders, Election \n     Officials and Clerks.\n\n\n                           challenge ballots\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Maine has same day registration so a voter can register \nat the polls or at a public office nearby and vote on the same day. If \nsomeone challenges the voter's right on that day, the ballot is marked \nas a challenged ballot. If a voter goes to the polls to vote and does \nnot have identification or does not appear on the voting rolls, the \npresiding election official will challenge the voter, and his or her \nballot will be treated as a challenged vote. The presiding election \nofficial keeps a list of voters challenged and the reason why they were \nchallenged. After the time for voting expires, the presiding election \nofficial seals the list. The challenged votes are counted on election \nday. In the even of a recount, and if the challenged ballots could make \na difference in the outcome of the election, the ballots and list are \nexamined by the appropriate authority. The distinguished Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Senate Committee on Rules have done excellent \nwork crafting the important bill before us. I would ask them whether, \nthen, Maine's system complies with this Election Reform Act?\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from Maine for her excellent question \nand for her steadfast support for election reform efforts. Let me \nassure her that Maine's system does comply with the Election Reform \nAct. Senator McConnell, the distinguished Ranking Member of the Rules \nCommittee, do you agree?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the distinguished Chairman, and I also thank \nSenator Collins for her excellent question and for her steadfast \nsupport for election reform efforts. Let me also assure her that I \nagree with Senator Dodd that Maine's system does comply with the \nElection Reform Act.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I want to thank the Senior Senator from Connecticut and \nthe Senior Senator from Kentucky for their assistance and congratulate \nthem on the impending passage of this bill.\n\n\n                     ELECTION REFORM REIMBURSEMENT\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I have a question about the impact of \nprovisions of this bill for the Ranking Member of the Rules Committee, \nthe Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell and the Senator from Missouri, \nMr. Bond, who has been involved in the conference committee that \nreconciled the House and Senate versions of H.R. 3295.\n  I understand that this bill does allow localities that have upgraded \nvoting equipment in the past two years to be reimbursed retroactively, \nand I support this decision. We ought to reward, rather than penalize, \nthose States and localities that have aggressively moved ahead since \nNovember 2000 to improve the processes and procedures for voting and \nelections.\n  In Sections 261-263, having to do with payments to States and units \nof local government to assure accessibility for individuals with \ndisabilities, however, it is not clear whether the payments made may be \nmade retroactively, and this concerns me. I expect that this was the \nintent. This is important, however, because in Virginia, and, I believe \nin several other States such as North Carolina and Rhode Island, the \nState Board of Elections and the localities\n\n[[Page S10495]]\n\nhave made a concerted effort to improve polling place accessibility \nover the past two years. And I believe that for this November's \nelections Virginia will be very close to 100 percent of all polling \nplaces being 100 percent accessible. I would hate to have to tell my \nState and local officials that because they have stepped up to the \nplate and already made these polling places accessible over the past \ntwo years that they are ineligible to receive payment for the \nimprovements they have made. So, I ask the Senators from Kentucky and \nMissouri if they can assure me that States such as Virginia, which have \nmade polling place accessibility improvements during the past 24 \nmonths, are eligible for payment from the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for their costs of making polling places accessible for \nindividuals with disabilities that were incurred during that 24-month \nperiod?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Virginia is correct. States are \neligible for reimbursement from the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for costs incurred during the 24 months prior to the enactment \nof this bill of making polling places accessible to individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree with the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nconference report to the ``Help American Vote Act of 2002.''\n  First of all, I'd like to thank Chairman Dodd and Senator McConnell, \nfor their leadership and extraordinary efforts that have led us to \nfinal consideration of this legislation today. Also, I'd like to note \nthat arriving at this point has not been easy for the members of the \nConference, nor for their staffs, and I appreciate the hard work by \neveryone that led to this compromise.\n  That being said, I would be remiss if I failed to mention my concern \nabout the impact that enactment of this legislation could have on \nStates and localities, most of whom are experiencing extreme budget \nshortfalls. I raised this issue when we first debated this legislation \nin the Senate and I am disappointed that it has not been addressed in \nthe conference report.\n  Title III of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 includes a series of \nnew uniform and nondiscriminatory requirements for election technology \nand administration. These requirements include voter verification of \nvotes cast, a paper record for auditability and recounts, and \naccessibility for invividuals with disabilities. If enacted, these \nrequirements would apply to each voting system used in an election for \nFederal office. There is no question that these provisions have far-\nreaching consequences.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the intent underlying this legislation, \nwhich is that the system must be uniform in nature across the entire \ncountry, if it is to be successful in accomplishing the goal of \nelection reform.\n  I also appreciate the Conference Committee's stated desire that the \nprogram be fully funded. That being said, I must ask my colleagues the \ndifficult question: What if it isn't fully funded? We must consider the \nconsequences if a future Congress fails to provide adequate funding for \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I stated my objections to the unfunded mandates in \nthis conference report back in February when we first considered this \nlegislation. Today, I am once again stating my strong objection to even \nthe mere possibility that the burden of funding these mandates might \nfall upon the States.\n  Having expressed this concern, I also want to mention that this \nconference report makes several necessary and important changes to our \ncurrent system of voting, which is burdened with problems ranging from \nclaims of voter fraud to a lack of accessible voting devices for many \ndisabled Americans. This conference report also includes an important \nHatch-Leahy Internet voting study that will lay the groundwork for \nintegrating new technology into the political process.\n  As Americans, we have the right to participate in the greatest \ndemocracy in the world, and most will agree that the act of voting is \nthe bedrock of our democratic society. Americans take pride in the role \nthey play in shaping issues and determining their leaders, and yet, we \nsee that voter participation in recent years has decreased among people \nof every age, race, and gender. I find these statistics both \ndisappointing and tragic because, as Thomas Jefferson stated, ``that \ngovernment is the strongest of which every man himself feels a part.''\n  Why is voter turnout so low? Of the 21.3 million people who \nregistered but did not vote in the 1996 election, more than one in five \nreported that they did not vote because they could not take time off of \nwork or school or because they were too busy. Can technological \nadvances, like the Internet, increase participation in the electoral \nprocess by making voter registration easier or by simplifying the \nmethod of voting itself? As the elected representatives of the people, \nwe should consider every option available that might help involve more \nof our country's citizens in America's democratic process. Federal, \nState and local governments are duty bound to encourage all eligible \nAmericans to exercise their right to vote.\n  In the past, attempts have been made to increase voter registration \nand turnout. Unfortunately, these attempts have met with limited \nsuccess. The Motor Voter Act of 1993, for example, attempted to \nincrease voter participation by permitting the registration of voters \nin conjunction with the issuance of driver's licenses. According to \nrecent U.S. Census Bureau reports, 28 percent of the 19.5 million \npeople who have registered to vote since 1995 have done so at their \nlocal Department of Motor Vehicles. Notwithstanding this simplified \nvoter registration procedure, voter participation continues to decline. \nAlthough registering to vote at the DMV generally is more convenient \nthan other methods of registration, a substantial portion of registered \nvoters nevertheless continue to fail to register to vote and fail to go \nto the polls on election day.\n  Voting via the Internet has been suggested as one possible solution \nto the problem. The Internet has revolutionized the way people \ncommunicate and conduct business by permitting millions of people to \naccess the world instantaneously, at the click of a mouse. The Internet \nhas already increased voter awareness on issues of public policy as \nwell as on candidates and their views. In the future, the Internet may \nvery well increase voter registration and participation, and thereby \nstrengthen our country's electoral process.\n  Mr. President, as many of us have seen in the recent past, more and \nmore States are looking at ways to utilize the Internet in the \npolitical process. Proposals include online voter registration, online \naccess to voter information, and online voting. State and local \nofficials around the country are anxious to use the Internet to foster \ncivic action. I think that this is a positive step. In fact, today many \nStates already allow for portions of the voter registration process to \nbe completed online. For example, the Arizona State Democratic Party \nallowed online voting in the 2000 presidential primary and nearly \n36,000 Arizona Democrats took advantage of this opportunity. We can \nanticipate that this trend toward online voting will continue.\n\n  Real questions remain, however, as to the feasibility of securely \nusing the Internet for these functions. How can we be sure that the \nperson who registers to vote online is whom he or she claims to be? How \ncan we ensure that an Internet voting process is free from fraud? How \nmuch will this technology cost? There are also important sociological \nand political questions to consider. For example, will options like \nonline registration and voting increase political participation? Can \nthe Internet be equitably used in the political process?\n  We must be carefully evalate the issues that will arise as the civic \nprivilege of voting meets with technological advances. The original \nstudy I proposed would have created a special commission to conduct the \nstudy, which would have comprised of various experts ranging from First \nAmendment and election law experts to technical experts on the Internet \nand cyber-security. While this type of Commission in not part of this \nfinal conference report, it is my hope that the Commission will \nnonetheless call upon advisors with special expertise in these areas.\n  Proponents of ``electronic voting'' (so-called e-voting'') contend \nthat there are numerous advantages to the\n\n[[Page S10496]]\n\nemerging ``cyber'' political participation, including the immediate \ndisclosure of campaign contributions, an increase in the number of \ngrassroots volunteers, and the creation of a more accessible forum for \npolitical advertising.\n  Skeptics assert, to the contrary, that e-voting would only serve to \ndecrease ``real'' electoral participation, place personal privacy at \nrisk, and pave the way for election fraud. The late Senator Sam Ervin \nopposed simplifying voter registration and voting, stating that he did \nnot ``believe [in] making is easy for apathetic, lazy people'' to vote.\n  As we seek to ensure equal access to the voting place and integrity \nof the voting process, it would be irresponsible for us to ignore the \npotential effects, both good and bad, that new technology may have on \nthe political process. As I stand before you today, Mr. President, I do \nnot know whether online voter registration and e-voting will halt the \ndecline in voter participation. I do not know whether online voting \nregistration and e-voting even is wise. I firmly believe, however, that \nthese issues deserve serious examination as we seek to ensure that our \ndemocratic republic engages as many citizens as is possible. I am \npleased that the Hatch-Leahy provision will enable the study of \nforward-looking measures that will ensure our ability to properly \nintegrate new technology in the political process.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I reiterate my concern that this \nConference Report is an unfunded mandate on already overburdened \nstates. However, I must look past that serious concern, and vote for \nthis conference report because of the important changes it makes to our \ncurrent system.\n  No American who has exercised the right to vote should ever have to \nwonder if his or her properly cast vote will be counted. We must \npreserve the integrity of the voting process and I, again, commend the \nefforts of those who worked this compromise. Further, I believe that \nthe Hatch-Leahy Internet voting study is an important step forward in \nensuring the legitimacy of the voting process, and serves as a major \nenhancement to the conference report.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this measure.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Senate for \npassing the Help America Vote Act of 2002 today. This landmark \nlegislation will help the Nation avoid another debacle like the one \nthat occurred during the Presidential election in November of 2000. In \nthat election, thousands of ballots in Florida and in my home State of \nIllinois went uncounted for a variety of reasons. In fact, over 120,000 \nvoters in Cook County and thousands more throughout the rest of the \nState did their civic duty and cast a vote during the last Federal \nelection, only to have their ballots discounted because of problems \nwith machinery and inaccuracies on the rolls of registered voters. This \nis unacceptable in the United States of America, where we take pride in \nour freedom to cast a vote for our leaders.\n  With the Help America Vote Act of 2002, Congress has finally agreed \non a bipartisan solution to these problems. The conference report \ncontains several items to improve the administration of elections for \nFederal office. First, it requires that voting systems meet certain \nminimum requirements, including notifying voters of overvotes, allowing \nvoters the opportunity to correct their ballots, and having a manual \naudit capacity. The voting system must give disabled voters the ability \nto vote ``in a manner that provides the same opportunity for access and \nparticipation, including privacy and independence, as for other \nvoters.'' In addition, voting systems must operate under a maximum \nerror rate as currently established by the Federal Election Commission. \nThese national requirements for voting systems should significantly \nimprove the ability of all voters to cast ballots that accurately \nreflect their intentions.\n  Next, the legislation provides a fail-safe mechanism for voting on \nelection day. It requires that all states allow voters to cast a \nprovisional ballot at their chosen polling place if the voter's name \nisn't on the list of eligible voters, or an election official, for \nwhatever reason, declares a voter ineligible. Included in the right to \nvote provisionally is the right to have one's eligibility to vote \npromptly verified by the State and then to have one's ballot counted in \nthat election, according to State law. Finally, provisional voters have \nthe right to know whether their vote was in fact counted, and if not, \nwhy it wasn't. These measures seem dictated by common sense and \nfairness. Yet, many States, including Illinois, do not guarantee voters \nsuch rights today.\n  To secure the rights afforded by this legislation, the Department of \nJustice can ask the Federal courts to act. In addition, States are \nrequired to establish an administrative procedure open to any person \nwho believes a violation of any of the requirements has occurred, is \noccurring or will occur. States are free to add additional safeguards \nto protect these rights and are encouraged to provide the most \neffective remedy available to enforce them.\n  Another key component of this legislation is the requirement that \nStates implement an up-to-date, computerized, interactive, statewide \nlist of all registered voters that is accessible to election officials \nin every jurisdiction. This list is intended to help keep voter rolls \ncurrent and accurate and to reduce, if not eliminate, confusion about a \nvoter's registration and identification when a voter arrives at the \npolling place. This section also provides safeguards to preserve the \nconfidentiality of voter identification information and to protect \nagainst improper purging of names from the list. Make no mistake: In \norder to remove a voter's name from the list of registered voters, for \nany reason, election officials must comply with all of the preexisting \nrequirements of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. This act \ndoesn't change that.\n  To further the study and improvement of voting and the conduct of \nelections nationwide, the legislation creates an Election Assistance \nCommission, which will serve as a central clearinghouse on election \nadministration issues. Advised by State and local officials, this \ncommission will, among other things, provide for the testing and \ncertification of voting systems. Ultimately, the commission should \nidentify and report to Congress on continuing problems with election \nadministration and potential solutions.\n  To facilitate voting by Americans living abroad, particularly those \nserving their country in the Armed Forces, the Act enhances the \nprovision of election information, extends the duration of an \napplication for an absentee ballot, and requires states to accept early \nsubmissions of ballots by such voters.\n  Finally, the conference report authorizes $3.9 billion in Federal \nfunding over the next few years to replace antiquated voting systems, \nto educate voters on procedures and on their rights, to train election \nofficials, poll workers and volunteers, to improve polling place \naccessibility for individuals with disabilities, to promote research on \nvoting technology, and to otherwise comply with the requirements of the \nact. Of this amount, $650 million is to be made available on an \nexpedited basis, in part for the immediate replacement of punchcard \nvoting systems, the bane of the 2000 Presidential election. This should \nbe particularly helpful for Illinois, where the overwhelming majority \nof voters still vote by means of this troublesome technology. In fact, \nIllinois will be eligible for up to $45 million of this early money. \nThe bulk of funds - $3 billion over the next 3 years - is authorized \nspecifically to help States meet the requirements set forth in this \nact. Illinois stands to receive up to $155 million under this section. \nWhen these sums are appropriated, states will at long last have the \nresources to provide citizens with the best means available to exercise \ntheir right to vote.\n  Still, this legislation is not without its shortcomings. These \ninclude new limitations on the way first-time and newly registering \nvoters are permitted to identify themselves, which could create \nobstacles for some groups; the lack of an explicit, strong federal \nremedy through which voters can individually vindicate the rights \ngranted them in this legislation; and the absence of a guarantee that \nthe funds authorized by this legislation will actually be appropriated \nby Congress and the President. Thus, Congress has an ongoing \nresponsibility to provide the funds called for in this Act and to \nmonitor the implementation of its provisions over the next several \nyears.\n\n[[Page S10497]]\n\n  Nonetheless, on balance, this legislation embodies a good faith, \nbipartisan attempt to ensure that every eligible vote in an election \nfor Federal office is accurately cast and counted and I support its \nworthy goals.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The ``Help America Vote Act'' is timely and important \nbipartisan legislation to strengthen our Nation's election system and I \nurge the Senate to approve it.\n  The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy. As Chief \nJustice Earl Warren said in 1964: ``The right to vote freely for the \ncandidate of one's choice is the essence of a democratic society, and \nany restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative \ngovernment.''\n  Over the past century and a half, a number of constitutional \namendments and major laws have been acted to expand and help protect \nthis fundamental right, including the 15th Amendment in 1870 \nprohibiting voting discrimination because of race; the 19th Amendment \nin 1920 prohibiting voting discrimination because of gender; the Voting \nRights Act of 1965 outlawing racially discriminatory voting practices; \nthe 26th Amendment in 1971 lowering the voting age to 18; the Voting \nRights Act Amendments of 1982 which expanded the protections against \nracial discrimination in the Voting Rights Act; and, the National Voter \nRegistration Act of 1993--the ``Motor Voter'' law--which simplified \nvoter registration procedures.\n  Now, the passage of the ``Help America Vote Act'' will add another \nimportant chapter to our continuing efforts to protect and strengthen \nthe right to vote.\n  The 2000 election taught the entire nation a valuable lesson. We \nlearned that every vote does matter--but that every vote is not always \ncounted. Too often and in too many communities across the nation, \nindividuals who went to the polls on election day were denied the right \nto vote or did not have their votes counted. The reasons varied--such \nas confusing ballots, outdated or malfunctioning equipment, \ninadequately trained poll workers, and the lack of access for the \ndisabled. But the outcome was the same--the voices of well over one \nmillion Americans were not heard. The legislation before us today will \nhelp to ensure that this unacceptable result does not happen again.\n\n  The bill includes three core components. It establishes uniform \nrequirements for voting systems, provisional voting, and computerized \nvoter registration lists, which all States must meet in Federal \nelections. It creates a new four-member, bi-partisan, independent \nFederal agency--the Election Administration Commission--to provide \nguidance to the States, conduct studies and issue reports on Federal \nelection issues, and administer a new Federal grant program. Third, it \nauthorizes $3.9 billion in grants over the next three years to assist \nStates and localities in meeting the new requirements, modernizing \ntheir voting systems, and making polling places accessible to the \ndisabled.\n  These are all important and needed reforms and I strongly support \nthem. Their effectiveness will depend on the participation of all \nlevels of government, including adequate appropriations by Congress, \nand vigorous implementation of the reforms at the State and local \nlevel.\n  At the same time, however, I have serious concerns that some \nprovisions of this legislation create new Federal requirements that \ncould make it more difficult for certain groups, particularly racial \nand ethnic minorities, the poor, the elderly, and people with \ndisabilities to register and to exercise their right to vote.\n\n  The bill requires first time-voters who register by mail to provide \nspecific forms of identification. It requires the invalidation of a \nregistration when a voter inadvertently forgets to check off a \nduplicative ``citizenship box.'' It requires that, when registering to \nvote, voters must either provide their driver's license number, or, if \nthey lack one, the last four digits of their Social Security number. We \nall have a strong interest in preventing voter fraud, but these \nrequirements may not be an effective way to verify voter identity and, \nat the same time, they are very likely to create unnecessary barriers \nfor voters.\n  Congress, the new Election Administration Commission created by the \nbill, and the Department of Justice must be vigilant in ensuring that \nthese provisions do not restrict voting by certain groups and that they \nare enforced in a ``uniform and nondiscriminatory manner,'' as the \nlegislation requires. We know the potential harsh impact of these \nprovisions on those groups who have historically been denied full \nparticipation in elections, and we must do all we can to prevent any \nsuch impact. To implement the bill in good faith, Congress and the Bush \nAdministration should see that individuals who respect these basic \nvoting rights concerns are named to the new Commission.\n  With proper support and enforcement, the ``Help America Vote Act'' \ncan significantly increase political participation for every American. \nWe all share the great goal of protecting the most fundamental of all \nrights in our democracy--the right to vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it has been nearly 2 years since the \npresidential election left many Americans disenfranchised. In that \ntime, this country has faced other tremendous crises, and perhaps the \nfervor with which people supported election reform two years ago has \nwaned somewhat. But I believe that after all we have faced as a \ncountry, it is even more important that we preserve and improve the \nintegrity of our democracy by ensuring that every eligible voter who \nwants to vote is able to vote.\n  We can be thankful that we are past the days of poll taxes, literacy \ntests, and other discriminatory practices that kept voters away from \nthe polls. But if there is even an inadvertent flaw in the design or \nadministration of our voting systems that prevents Americans from \nhaving their votes counted, it is our utmost responsibility to ensure \nthat we remedy the situation.\n  There is simply no excuse for the most technologically savvy Nation \nin the world to be using voting equipment that is 30 years old. And it \nis disturbing, to say the least, that much of the oldest and least \nreliable equipment is found in the poorest counties across the country. \nOften, people of color make up the majority of the population in those \ncounties. None of us should ever again be in the position of having to \nexplain to urban, minority voters why a portion of their votes didn't \nget counted, while their white suburban neighbors, using better \nequipment, could rest assured that there were no voting irregularities \nin their precincts that would have caused their votes to be discarded.\n  If we can't promise all of our citizens that their votes will count \nequally, then all of the past work this Nation has done to guarantee \nthe right to vote to women, people of color and the poor will have been \nsquandered.\n  I have some serious concerns about a number of provisions in this \nlegislation. But, because I believe we must use every tool available to \nus to uphold our citizens' right to vote, I have decided to support \nthis conference report. On balance, I believe this bill will enable \nmore people to exercise their fundamental right to vote by setting \nuniform, minimum standards for Federal elections, by providing voters \nwith a chance to check for and correct ballot errors, and by providing \nfor provisional ballots. These provisions, along with funding to \nreplace outmoded voting systems, provide substantial improvements to \nthe current system.\n  Unfortunately, the compromise has significant shortcomings that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle insisted upon, ostensibly to \nreduce voter fraud, but which may make registration and voting \ndifficult for first-time voters. The bill's requirement that first-time \nvoters who register by mail provide specified forms of identification \nat the polls may disenfranchise a large number of voters, especially \npeople with disabilities, racial and ethnic minorities, students, and \nthe poor, who are far less likely to have photo identification than \nother voters.\n  I am also concerned about new language that will invalidate an \nindividual's registration if the person registering forgets to check \noff a box declaring that he or she is a U.S. citizen. Because voters \nalready must affirm their citizenship when they sign the registration \nform, it is unnecessary to require that this box be checked for \nregistration. Many elderly voters, visually impaired voters and voters \nwith low levels of literacy may inadvertently fail to check the box and \nwill, as\n\n[[Page S10498]]\n\na result, disproportionately be kept off the registration rolls. This \nlegislation is supposed to be an effort to make voting easier for \nqualified voters, and this provision adds an unnecessary, complicating \nstep.\n  This bill also requires that, in order to register, voters provide a \ndriver's license number or the last four digits of their Social \nSecurity number, and those numbers must be verified. This provision \ndirectly conflicts with the protections of the National Voter \nRegistration Act, which prohibit the use of a driver's license or \nSocial Security number to authenticate a voter's registration. Although \nI understand the desire to reduce instances of voter fraud, I believe \nthese provisions are overly burdensome and unfair to many voters. This \nprovision also has serious privacy implications.\n  I hope that the problems with the conference report are fixed in the \nvery near future, and I would strongly support efforts to rectify these \ndisenfranchising provisions before the next election. However, as a \nwhole, this bill solves more election-related problems than it creates. \nIf it is properly implemented by state elections agencies, Congress's \nintent to improve the voting system will be satisfied. This is an \nimportant piece of legislation that must be enacted now if we are to \nhave any improvements in place before the next national election.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the conference report to H.R. 3295, the ``Help America Vote Act \nof 2002.'' I congratulate the conferees on their dedicated and \npersistent effort in reaching a compromise agreement on this issue. I \nbelieve that this historic legislation will play a major role in \ncorrecting many of the problems that the country suffered during the \nYear 2000 elections.\n  In my judgment, this legislation is inextricably linked with the \ncampaign finance reform bill that became law earlier this year. Both of \nthese pieces of legislation are aimed at the heart of any successful \ndemocracy: restoring the voters' trust in their government. The new \ncampaign finance reform law is intended to reduce the influences of \nspecial interests by eliminating the large flow of unregulated soft \nmoney. This election reform legislation is designed to assure voters \nthat votes will be counted accurately, and that legally registered \nvoters will not be disenfranchised. I am especially proud that this \nlegislation will ensure for the first time in history that voters who \nare blind or visually-impaired will be able to cast a vote privately \nand confidentially.\n  However, I would urge my colleagues not to treat this legislation as \nthe conclusion of our work on the issue of election reform. The \nCongress must ensure that this legislation is implemented fairly and \neffectively. I know that concerns have been raised about the \nidentification requirements for first-time voters who have registered \nby mail. While I applaud the goal of eliminating instances of fraud, it \nis important that these provisions be implemented equitably to prevent \nthe disenfranchisement of minority or disabled voters.\n  In addition, I also would like to make a few recommendations \nregarding the implementation of this legislation. As the states develop \ntheir plans for meeting the new federal voting requirements and \nreceiving grant funding, I would urge them to solicit advice on \nsolutions to address the needs of disabled voters and others who have \nhistorically faced impediments at polling places. I also urge the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to consult closely with the \nElection Assistance Commission on the grant program to help states \nmaking polling places accessible to disabled voters. The applications \nfor grant funding and reports on the uses of these funds may be helpful \nto the Commission as it studies accessibility-related issues and \ndevelops voluntary voting system guidelines. It is also important to \nemphasize that concerns have been raised about the legislation's \nenforcement provisions. I appreciate that the Department of Justice has \na role in bringing civil actions against states that are not in \ncompliance with the mandatory requirements. We will have to be diligent \nin ensuring that these enforcement provisions are implemented.\n  On this historic day, I look forward to passage of this significant \npiece of legislation. As the recent events in Florida show, our voters \nstill face major challenges in getting their votes counted at the \npolling place. This legislation will present solutions to these \nproblems and reassure the American public that the best system of \ngovernment ever created continues to function in its 226th year.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the right to vote is one of the fundamental \ncomponents of our Republic. It is the central means by which the \nAmerican people can influence the direction of government, and thereby \nthe future of the nation. But, as we saw in the 2000 Presidential \nelection, just casting one's ballot is not the end of the process. \nVotes must be verified and counted, and done so quickly and accurately \nso that the American people have confidence in our elections. \nPreserving the integrity of our voting system is critical to preserving \nour representative form of government.\n  Over the years, I have watched as the percentage of eligible voters \nwho actually take the time to go to the polls and cast votes has \ndeclined. I find it beyond disappointing that American citizens would \nfail to exercise this precious right--in fact, this important \nresponsibility. Yet, I well understand how the spectacle of last year's \nelections and the irregularities that were widely reported can \nexacerbate a common misconception that one's vote does not count, a \nbelief that has permitted far too many minds in our nation. The federal \ngovernment can do more to reignite a passion for citizen participation, \nand we must do so if we are to ensure that our Constitutional form of \ngovernment will survive for future generations.\n  This bill establishes grant programs that will provide states with \nthe resources to replace outdated voting machines and train poll \nworkers. It establishes minimum federal voting standards for states, \nbut leaves responsibility for election administration at the local \nlevel.\n  The bill includes a number of safeguards designed to improve voter \naccess, including provisional ballot requirements, being able to \ncorrect improperly marked ballots, and funding for equipment to allow a \ndisabled voter to cast a private vote without assistance. In an effort \nto avoid a repeat of the Florida debacle of 2000, this bill mandates \nthat states create uniform standards for counting ballots.\n  I congratulate the members of the conference committee for their \nefforts to bring this bill to conclusion. I support this reform because \nit is an important first step in restoring confidence in our election \nprocess.\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to show my support for the \nelection reform proposal that will shortly be approved. There are a \nlitany of provisions too numerous to outline that are extremely \npositive steps toward ironing out very serious problems in our current \nvoting system. My thanks go out to Senators McConnell and Dodd, their \ncounterparts in the House, and all of the other conferees who fought \nlong and hard during the last few months to help ensure the \nelectorates' right to vote.\n  Secondly, and with much more remorse, I believe that many of the \nshortcomings that our men and women in the military face as potential \noverseas voters have not been fully addressed in the underlying \nconference proposal. I have stood in this body many times since the \n2000 election and have pushed for election reforms that would show \nthose who defend our way of life that their vote will not be cast-off \nfor technicalities through no fault of their own. Of course, I would be \nremiss if I failed to mention that some focus was paid to military \nvoters in this bill. I am pleased that early submission will no longer \nbe grounds for refusal of registration or absentee ballots. The focus \non requiring the Department of Defense to have more support for Voting \nAssistance Officers and emphasis on including postmarks on all ballots \nmailed is also favorably noted. However, the House has thrown up \nroadblocks to other important overseas voter measures, while the Senate \nas an institution has continued to show leadership in this effort. I \nhope that we will continue to do so in the future.\n  That being said, it is time now to look ahead. My support for the \nelection reform bill will not sway my feelings that there are still \nmany egregious errors in the process of overseas military\n\n[[Page S10499]]\n\nvoting. I promise to continue the fight and protect the rights of those \nmen and women who would give their lives for the country that they \ndearly love. The underlying election reform bill is a step in the right \ndirection, and I hope that congress can continue to follow that \npath.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased that today Congress \naddressed the debacle that occurred to diminish democracy during our \nlast Presidential election in Florida and other States. Access to the \npolls is a fundamental right; it is essential to our democracy. The \n2000 elections raised to the national stage problems that have been all \ntoo common and all too familiar to many voters around the country. \nSystems of administering elections are in many places flawed, \narbitrary, and discriminatory. I believe it is appropriate, even \nnecessary, for Congress to impose high voter participation standards on \nStates while providing the resources to meet those standards.\n  The Help America Vote Act contains a number of important reforms of \nAmerica's elections. The conference report authorizes funds to States \nto reform their election systems. It sets uniform, minimum standards \nfor Federal elections. It will ensure the accuracy of state voter \nregistration databases. It requires provisional balloting so registered \nvoters are not turned away from polling places. And it will help ensure \nthat disabled voters may cast their ballots independently and \nprivately. The legislation is an important step forward, and I support \nit.\n  However, I have reservations about provisions which have the \npotential, if not monitored and implemented carefully, to make voter \nregistration more onerous for some voters. In particular, provisions \nthat require voters to register using a driver's license number or \nSocial Security number could cause problems. While the act would \nrequire States to assign voters a number if they do not have either of \nthese forms of identification, I worry that some States may abuse this \nprovision to make it harder for certain citizens, particularly new \ncitizens and low income voters, to become registered.\n  One technical clarification I want to make about that provision: In \nMinnesota we have same day voter registration. It is my understanding \nthat this act would require the State to issue a voter ID number to a \nnonregistered voter who seeks to register on the day of the election, \nif the voter has a Social Security number or driver's license but does \nnot have either number physically with him or her at the polling place \non election day.\n  The act requires new voters to check a box on the voter registration \nform to indicate they are a citizen. Since new voters are already \nrequired to attest that they are citizens on voter registration forms \nunder current law, this seems to be a needless, redundant requirement \nwhich puts a hurdle, however small, in the way of new voters especially \nnew citizens. These provisions are probably unnecessary.\n  Finally, this legislation will only be fully effective if Congress \nand the administration step up the plate to fund it. I will urge my \ncolleagues to fully fund this program.\n  On balance, this bill is a step forward. I hope reality lives up to \nits promise.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I want to express my views on the Help \nAmerica Vote Act of 2002.\n  The Help America Vote Act of 2002 has many strong provisions that \nwill improve our Federal election system. This legislation requires \nthat election districts across the nation provide provisional voting \nand post sample ballots and other voter information. It allows voters \nthe opportunity to verify and change their vote before casting their \nvote. The act implements a statewide voter registration system to help \nreduce fraud and ensures that individuals are not wrongly refused the \nright to vote. It authorizes $3.9 billion in Federal funding to help \nstates improve voting systems, make the polls more accessible to the \ndisabled, train poll workers, and educate the electorate.\n  Despite these positive provisions, however, I cannot vote for this \nbill because the voting rights of New Yorkers will be negatively \naffected by this legislation.\n  For many years, the State of New York has had provisional voting and \nwhat is called signature verification. In the 1980s, New York City put \nin place a digitized signature verification system. When a New Yorker \nregisters to vote, his or her signature is scanned into a computer and \nplaced in the election board's files. Then on election day, the voter \nsigns the book of registered voters in that election district. If the \nsignatures do not match, the poll worker has the right to prevent the \nvoter from casting a ballot on the machine, but the voter is permitted \nto cast a provisional ballot. The board of elections later determines \nwhether the provisional ballot is valid and should therefore be \ncounted.\n  Because of New York State's system, there is no need for a voter to \npresent a form of identification at the poll. In fact, the poll worker \nmanual in New York explicitly states that poll workers cannot ask \nprospective voters for identification. This system was implemented in \nNew York City and across the State of New York more than a decade ago. \nThis system has worked in New York and should be a model for the \nNation.\n  Unfortunately, the Help America Vote Act would reduce the rights of \nNew Yorkers who are first-time voters in a federal election by \nrequiring them to present a valid photo identification, utility bill, \nbank statement or government identification that verifies the name and \naddress of the voter. If a first-time voter filled out a registration \nform and included either her driver's license number or the last four \ndigits of her Social Security number, then she would not have to \npresent a form of identification to a poll worker before voting. While \nthis may serve as a step in the right direction for other States, this \nis a new restriction for New York.\n  This provision will repress voter participation among those New \nYorkers who are in fact eligible to vote. Moreover, it will \ndisproportionately affect ethnic and racial minorities, recently \nnaturalized American citizens, language minorities, the poor, the \nhomeless, the millions of eligible New York voters who do not have a \ndriver's license, and those individuals who otherwise would have \nexercised their right to vote without these new provisions.\n  Many civil rights groups who oppose this legislation have compared \nthese provisions to poll taxes and literacy tests that were used to \nrepress voter participation in the past. I do not believe this is an \nunfair analog because I believe this bill may indeed reduce voter \nparticipation. When voter participation numbers hover at 50 percent, I \nbelieve that we should make every effort to increase voter \nparticipation, not reduce it.\n  I know this bill will pass the Senate today and will shortly become \nlaw, no matter what I do. But despite the many provisions in the bill \nthat may increase voter participation in some states across the country \nwho do not currently have provisional voting, I cannot support this \nlegislation because it will negatively affect the rights of voters in \nthe state that I am proud to represent--the State of New York.\n  New York is a state with 19 million people and 11 million voters; a \nstate that is home to the world's cultural and financial capitals. It \nis the gateway for millions of people from different countries and \nethnicities. New York represents one of the best things about our \ncountry--it's diversity. In America, the birthplace of modern \ndemocracy, we should do all we can to ensure that the right of every \nvoter is not unduly hindered unnecessarily. Unfortunately, I believe \nthe provisions in the Help America Vote Act will do just that.\n  I applaud the work of Senator Dodd, as chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Rules and Administration, for all of his work on the bill, \nand the other members of the election reform conference committee. I \nalso want to give a special thanks to the Rules Committee staff of \nSenator Dodd, especially Kennie Gill and Veronica Gillespie, who have \nworked from the first inception of the Senate's election reform bill to \nthe final words in this election reform conference report. I know many \nmembers of the conference committee and their staffs have done their \nbest to produce legislation that will try to improve our federal \nelection system.\n  I am also proud to have worked with Senator Dodd on a provision \nincluded in the conference report that calls\n\n[[Page S10500]]\n\nupon the new Election Assistance Commission to study and report to \nCongress on the extent of residual votes. These are over votes, under \nvotes, or ``spoiled'' votes that are created when a voter, \nunintentionally, makes a mistake in casting her ballot, either because \nshe doesn't understand the ballot or the voting machinery I have fought \nhard to support the voting rights of the disenfranchised voter. But I \ncannot in good conscience, representing the State of New York, support \nlegislation I believe will hurt the voting rights of New Yorkers. I \nwill continue, however, to do all I can to ensure that our Federal \nelection system and our democracy will be as strong as possible.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, Federal election reform is long \noverdue.\n  Two years ago, the election system's collapse became a public shame \nin my State. A lot of high-minded debate about the need to reform the \nsystem immediately followed the election, but since then this \nlegislation has moved at a snail's pace.\n  Only now, three weeks before the next election, are we poised to send \na reform bill to the President to upgrade voting equipment, require \nprovisional balloting and improve election administration. It's a shame \nthat it has taken so long to remedy such a serious failure. A failure \nwhich cast into doubt the winner of the most important elected office \nin the world.\n  As a result of the delays, these desperately needed improvements will \ncome too late for the upcoming election. That's unfortunate, because in \nspite of the positive reforms made at the state level in Florida, some \nprecincts experienced problems during the August primary election that \nmight have been avoided, or at least mitigated, under the federal \nreforms.\n  Similar problems could occur again and the failures are not likely to \nbe isolated to Florida when the general election is held in November. \nOur goal now must be to implement the changes in time for the 2004 \nelections.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has already chosen to slow down the \nreform process by rejecting a $600 million appropriation passed by \nCongress earlier this year in anticipation of final passage of the \nauthorizing legislation.\n  The administration unforgivably failed to accept the funds and the \nmoney must now be appropriated again. That process could take precious \nmonths that would otherwise be used by the States to prepare for the \n2004 elections.\n  There's no excuse for the administration's failure to accept \nCongress' down payment, especially after promising to support these \nreforms.\n  I hope President Bush will reaffirm his support for election reform \nby asking Congress to include the full $3.8 billion authorized by this \nbill in the next continuing resolution or, at the latest, as part of a \nsupplemental appropriation early next year. We shouldn't hesitate \nanother day to send this money to the States so that they have every \nminute possible to prepare for 2004.\n  A strong election system requires top-notch equipment, informed and \nable poll workers, a provisional voting system and outstanding voter \neducation programs. But it also requires sensible registration and \nvoting procedures that prevent fraud without disenfranchising voters.\n  Despite my support for this legislation, I am concerned that the \nbill's anti-fraud provisions may unfairly burden minority, elderly and \ndisabled voters. Eliminating voting fraud is absolutely essential, but \nthe mechanisms used to prevent fraud should not be so complicated, or \nintrusive, that they discourage or prevent voting by qualified people \nwho may not, as a consequence of their lifestyle, have the specific \ndocumentation required by this bill.\n  I support modifying these provisions to allow potential registrants \nor voters to use additional documentation to prove their identity or to \nattest, under penalty of perjury, that they are in fact who they say \nthere are. I understand that the conference committee would not approve \nsuch a change and I do not believe the entire bill should be \nsacrificed.\n  In light of this problem, I intend to follow closely this \nlegislation's implementation with a specific eye on how the anti-fraud \nprovisions work in practice. If the photo identification requirements \nand registration procedures set out by this legislation cause more harm \nthan good I will support their repeal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky controls 1 minute 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Missouri for his solid work. \nDisenfranchised by this bill are dogs such as Gidget--Salish's Potomac \nFervour--pictured here in front of the Capitol. A solid Republican, \nGidget will nevertheless never know the joy of participating in the \nelection process. I am advised she could have been a fine voter--with a \nvigorous appetite for punchcards and aptitude for touch-screens. These \nskills will now have to be channeled into canine agility trials, \ninstead of the election process. I congratulate the Senator from \nMissouri for that. That is one of the many fine results of this \noutstanding piece of legislation which, regretfully, is one of the few \npieces of legislation the second session of the 107 Congress has \npassed.\n  We will have passed only 2 of our 13 appropriations bills. We have no \nbudget and no terrorism reinsurance bill. It has really been a dismal \nrecord. But we do have something to be thankful for today, which is \nthat we are about to pass an extraordinarily important piece of \nlegislation on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis. This is, indeed, the \nway the Senate should work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in my remarks yesterday I commended my \ncolleagues who have been involved in this. I want to do so again, \nSenator McConnell and Senator Bond.\n  I also commended my new found friend from the House, Bob Ney, who did \na remarkable job as the Chairman of the House Administration Committee. \nSteny Hoyer has been involved in these issues for a long time, and I \nhave known him for a long time. I will not take the time today, as I \ndid yesterday, to thank him as profusely--but it is deeply felt. We \nwould not have arrived here without a lot of people working very hard \non this. I thank all of them, the leadership here and others who \nbrought us to this particular point.\n  I mentioned yesterday the juxtaposition of the events that unfolded \non November 7, 2000, and the events as they are unfolding today on \nOctober 16, 2002. When you consider the scenes that dominated the news \nmedia for days and days after the November 7 elections, with bulging \neyeballs glaring and butterfly ballots and hanging chads and people \nbellowing at each other and outside auditors at registrars of voters \noffices in Florida, here we are today in the relative calm of this \ninstitution, about to adopt, I hope overwhelmingly, legislation that \naddresses many of the concerns that were raised as a result of the \nevents in Florida.\n  But they were not just in Florida, as I said. There were other States \nas well, and it has been going on for some time. So this is an \nimportant day, one that will not demand or receive the kind of \nattention, obviously, that the events that provoked it did, almost 2 \nyears ago shy 3 weeks in November-December of the year 2000.\n  So it is an important landmark. We are breaking new ground. This is \nthe first time in more than 200 years that the Federal Government is \ngoing to take a very protective involvement in the conduct of \nelections. The Constitution insisted that both States and the Federal \nGovernment be involved in the election process in this country, but we \nhave only been involved marginally at best. In the 1965 Voting Rights \nAct, of course, we prohibited certain activities in the States such as \npoll taxes and literacy tests. But over 213 years have gone by since we \nhave had a proactive involvement in terms of what also must be done. \nThis legislation lays that out and asserts new rights.\n  As I said before, this is truly the first civil rights act of the \n21st century, insisting that all people who show up to vote will have a \nchance to do so, if only provisionally. My colleagues have had fun \ntalking about dogs who may have voted. There were human beings who\n\n[[Page S10501]]\n\nwere not allowed to vote, between 4 million and 6 million of them in \nthe last election. While it is humorous to talk about the dogs who may \nhave voted, it is not very funny to talk about the people who showed up \nand didn't and were denied the opportunity to do so.\n  This legislation, we hope, is going to solve at least part of that \nproblem beginning in the year 2004, where every person who shows up to \ncast a ballot in every precinct in America is going to be allowed to \ncast a ballot and never again be asked to step out of line and go home. \nThat ballot will be cast provisionally where there is a debate about \nwhether or not they have a right to do so, but the right to cast a \nballot is never again going to be denied to a person who shows up--the \nright to cast a ballot in America.\n  That is not an insignificant achievement. We also said for those who \nare blind and disabled, some 20 million who never showed up the last \ntime to vote because they have not been able to cast a ballot \nindependently and privately, those days are over with. Henceforth, \nbeginning in 2006 or before, if the States can get it done earlier, \npeople are going to be allowed to cast a ballot privately and \nindependently. The idea in this country that you could use Braille and \nhave sidewalks accessible to the handicapped, but ballots in America \nwere not--the only State in the country that has made a difference in \nthat is the State represented by the present Presiding Officer, the \nState of Rhode Island. As a result of your former secretary of state, \nwho himself suffers from a disability as a result of having been \ninjured, he understood it and went out and did it. The other States are \nnow going to do it in this country.\n  There are new rights here: The right to look at your ballot, correct \nyour ballot before it is finally cast. I know these are radical ideas, \nbut these are important provisions. No longer will you have to leave a \nvoting place wondering whether you might have voted twice--two people \nfor the same office, as happened in butterfly ballots in Florida. You \nare going to be able to go back and check your ballot before it is \nactually cast. So those rights in here are important.\n  Statewide voter registration will be facilitated for the first time. \nIf you move within a State--say from Lexington to Frankfurt, or if you \nmove from Hartford to Bridgeport, or if you move from some county in \nMissouri to another, you are not going to have to register again if you \nare in the same State and the State has statewide voter registration. \nStatewide voter registration will do an awful lot to relieve a lot of \nburdens on voters as they move. And many people do in this country. We \nare a mobile society today.\n  We also include provisions which Senator Bond insisted on in terms of \nresponsibility. We are going to make sure we do our best to see to it \nthat people who register to vote are who they say they are, so we don't \nhave people registering fictitious people and casting ballots for them. \nTo Senator Bond's credit, we worked very hard on that.\n  There will be for the first time a permanent Federal Election \nAssistance Commission, so we don't have to wait for another disaster in \nsome State and then occupy the time and attention of this institution \nresponding to it. On an ongoing basis, it will be a place where the \nStates, counties, municipalities, and the Federal Government can work \ntogether when it comes to election issues.\n  Of the $3.9 billion, 95 percent of the improvements will be borne by \nthe Federal Government because we are requiring it to be done. I don't \nbelieve in unfunded mandates. I wanted 100 percent. We had to \ncompromise at 95. We are now going to participate and support our \nStates and localities in making the changes they need to make in order \nto make our system work that much better.\n  I am thankful to all of our colleagues for their support and help \nduring the debate yesterday, I inserted a number of letters into the \nRecord which expressed support for this conference report. Today I ask \nunanimous consent to include in the Record letters which express \nconcerns about specific provisions of this legislation, including \nletters from the National Council of La Raza, the League of Women \nVoters, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Leadership Conference \non Civil Rights, and People for the American Way.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      National Council of La Raza,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2002.\n\n NCLR Urges Congress to Vote NO on the ``Help America Vote Act'' (H.R. \n                                 3295)\n\n       Dear Member of Congress: The National Council of La Raza \n     (NCLR), the largest national Latino civil rights \n     organization, opposes the ``Help America Vote Act'' (H.R. \n     3295), because it will disproportionately affect Latino \n     voters, suppresses voter registration and turnout, and in \n     some instances will roll back civil rights laws.\n       Furthermore, we note with concern the continuing \n     uncertainty of the appropriations process, which means that \n     no one, including the authors of the compromise bill, can \n     guarantee funding sufficient to implement the bill.\n       NCLR is an umbrella organization with over 280 local \n     affiliated community-based organizations and a broader \n     network of 33,000 individual associate members. In addition \n     to providing capacity-building assistance to our affiliates \n     and essential information to our individual associates, NCLR \n     serves as a voice for all Hispanic subgroups in all regions \n     of the country.\n       NCLR urges you to join us in opposing the ``Help America \n     Vote Act'' (H.R. 3295) because the ``compromise'' bill:\n       Requires first-time voters who register by mail to provide \n     specific forms of identification at the polls. This provision \n     will have a discriminatory impact on a large number of \n     voters, especially people with disabilities, racial and \n     ethnic minorities, students, the elderly, and the poor, who \n     are substantially less likely to have photo identification \n     than other voters. Additionally, having states implement this \n     requirement prior to the 2004 presidential election, without \n     the statewide list in place, is a dangerous experiment that \n     runs the risk of creating additional chaos at the polls.\n       Contains weak enforcement provisions. Voters who are denied \n     their right to vote because of this law cannot turn to the \n     federal courts for a remedy. Rather, disenfranchised voters \n     must either wait for the Department of Justice to take action \n     or ask the same state election system that disenfranchised \n     them to determine that there is a violation and provide a \n     remedy for the problem.\n       Contains new language that will require any registration to \n     be invalidated if the person registering forgets to check off \n     boxes declaring that he or she is a U.S. citizen. Because \n     voters already must affirm their citizenship when they sign \n     the registration form, it is unnecessary to require that this \n     box be checked for registration. Many elderly and low-income \n     voters, as well as voters with low levels of literacy, who \n     find filling out forms difficult, may inadvertently make the \n     mistake of failing to check the box and will, as a result, \n     disproportionately be kept off the registration rolls; and\n       Contains an intrusive, error-prone requirement that voters \n     provide a driver's license Number or, in the event they do \n     not have one, the last four digits of their Social Security \n     number. Election officials must independently verify the \n     number before registering someone, and any individual who has \n     either number but fails to provide it will not be registered. \n     This provision directly conflicts with the protections of the \n     National Voter Registration Act, which prohibits the use of a \n     driver's license or Social Security Number to authenticate a \n     voter's registration.\n       For almost two years NCLR worked diligently with both \n     Republicans and Democrats in the House and in the Senate on \n     election reform legislation, to address the need for good \n     election reform legislation. Today we oppose this bill \n     because the Latino community cannot accept a bill that does \n     more harm than good, and urge you to vote against it. Please \n     be advised that NCLR will recommend that votes related to \n     this bill and final passage be included in the National \n     Hispanic Leadership Agenda Scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n     Raul Yzaguirre,\n       President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   The League of Women Voters,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2002.\n\n    Election Reform Legislation in U.S. Congress--League Cautions: \n              Legislation Is a Gamble, Implementation Key\n\n       Washington, DC.--``The compromise election reform \n     legislation being considered this week by the U.S. Congress \n     makes important reforms in the voting process but erects new \n     bureaucratic hurdles for voters,'' stated Kay J. Maxwell, \n     president of the league of Women Voters of the United States. \n     ``The Help America Vote bill is a tradeoff, providing \n     stronger protections in our voting systems while taking away \n     safeguards in voter registration.''\n       ``There are many good things in this bill, but it also \n     undermines existing voter protections,'' Maxwell noted. ``On \n     the positive side, lawmakers are creating new federal \n     standards and providing the states with funds to buy new \n     voting machines that work, to better train and recruit poll \n     workers, to create statewide voter registration databases, \n     and put provisional balloting systems in place,'' said \n     Maxwell.\n\n[[Page S10502]]\n\n       ``But the League cannot overlook the fact that this bill \n     places voter protections at risk by cutting back existing \n     federal standards for voter registration. It weakens and \n     undercuts several of the hard-fought voter protections \n     established in current law,'' Maxwell stated. ``We are also \n     concerned that the discriminatory identification provision in \n     this legislation will erect barriers to voting. The \n     identification requirements place additional burdens on poll \n     workers and may create a mess at the polls in 2004,'' \n     cautioned Maxwell.\n       ``This bill is a gamble,'' said Maxwell, ``and \n     implementation will be the key in determining whether it \n     succeeds or fails. We hope that states take seriously the \n     larger role they now have in administering federal elections. \n     They must step up to their constitutional responsibility to \n     run elections effectively,'' stated Maxwell. ``The League at \n     the national, state and local levels will work closely with \n     state and local election officials and citizens across this \n     country to ensure that all the provisions of this bill are \n     carried out to enfranchise rather than disenfranchise \n     voters,'' concluded Maxwell.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n\n                                   Washington National Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2002.\n     Re H.R. 3295/Help America Vote Act.\n\n       Dear Member of Congress: The American Civil Liberties Union \n     (ACLU) urges you to oppose the conference report on HR 3295, \n     Help America Vote Act, because the agreement contains \n     provisions that would lead to discrimination and ultimately \n     result in disenfranchising many voters. This legislative cure \n     to the severe voting rights problems seen in the 2000 \n     Presidential election could be even worse than the disease.\n       In many respects, the conference report rolls back many of \n     the voting rights victories achieved over the past three \n     decades through the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the \n     National Voting Registration Act of 1993. Instead of making \n     sure that the voting process is as inclusive as possible, \n     this agreement would exclude people, negatively impacting the \n     elderly, the disabled, racial and ethnic minorities, \n     students, and the poor. Not only would this bill make it more \n     difficult to vote, it would make it more difficult to \n     register to vote.\n       While the conference report purports to address the voting \n     problems apparent during the 2000 Presidential election, its \n     solutions are illusory. For example, the legislation \n     establishes minimum standards for the performance of voting \n     machinery, but provides an exemption for punch card machines, \n     the most controversial and problematic technology used during \n     the 2000 presidential election, for over-vote notification. \n     Although this legislation requires election officials to \n     permit voters whose name does not appear on the voter \n     registration list to cast a provisional ballot, it gives \n     complete discretion to the state to decide when and if \n     provisional ballots will be counted, even in federal \n     elections. As we have seen in the past, these ballots can \n     determine the outcome of an election.\n       This election reform legislation is the only major piece of \n     civil rights legislation the Senate and House have taken up \n     in the 107th Congress. We urge you to carefully consider the \n     negative implications associated with the provisions that \n     will undermine critical advances the United States has made \n     in voting rights. While this legislation would authorize much \n     needed funding to states and local governments to improve \n     their election systems, it simultaneously imposes \n     requirements that will effectively suppress voter \n     participation. New machines are meaningless if policies are \n     enacted that prevent people from voting on them.\n       Outlined below are two problematic provisions contained \n     within the conference report that threaten to exacerbate the \n     very problems that the legislation is intended to correct, to \n     ensure that every citizen eligible to vote can vote. They are \n     the driver's license and social security number requirement \n     to register to vote and the photo identification requirement \n     to vote.\n\n\n   driver's license and social security required to register to vote\n\n       The conference report imposes additional requirements in \n     order for citizens to register to vote. Under this \n     legislation, the voter would be required to provide a \n     driver's license number or, in the event they do not have \n     one, the last four digits of their social security number. \n     Any voter who has either number but does not provide it--even \n     for privacy reasons--would not be registered.\n       When the voter provides either their driver's license \n     number or the last four digits of their social security \n     number, the state must verify the accuracy of the data \n     provided. This includes checking data against state motor \n     vehicle and Social Security Administration (SSA) databases, \n     to verify the voter's name, date of birth and social security \n     number. But, there are many reasons why the data provided by \n     an eligible voter may not match the data in a motor vehicle \n     or SSA database, even though it is the same person. For \n     example, women may have married or divorced without changing \n     their name in the SSA database. Many Latinos use both their \n     mother and father's surname, or both their father's and \n     spouse's surnames, which SSA may list incorrectly--resulting \n     in a false ``no-match.'' A simple juxtaposition of a number \n     could result in a ``no-match,'' whether due to the fault of \n     the applicant, or an SSA employee who enters the number into \n     the database incorrectly. This could result in either purging \n     or the invalidation of a voter's registration application.\n       Also, this conference report would remove social security \n     number disclosure (last four digits) from the protection of \n     the Privacy Act of 1974, which makes it unlawful for local, \n     state or federal agencies to deny someone a right provided by \n     law for refusing to disclose their social security number. \n     Congress did not limit the protection in Sec 7(a) of the \n     Privacy Act to parts of the social security number. All nine \n     digits of the social security number are part of the ``social \n     security account number'' and are therefore protected. It was \n     the use of the social security number for identification \n     purposes that Congress was restricting. There can be no doubt \n     that the requirement that voters disclose the last four \n     digits of their social security in order to register to vote \n     is an attempt to use the numbers as an identifier. If \n     Congress intended to protect only five (5) of the nine (9) \n     digits it would have written legislation that explicitly did \n     so. Permitting a state to require parts of the social \n     security account number creates an exception that would \n     frustrate the intent of Congress. Furthermore, it is \n     incorrect to suggest that by merely requiring a voter to \n     disclose the last four digits of their social security number \n     that their privacy is somehow protected.\n       In addition, forced disclosure of social security numbers \n     threatens a citizens' privacy and could lead to identity \n     fraud, where imposters armed with a person's name and social \n     security number can raid back accounts, establish fraudulent \n     credit cards and even ruin a voter's credit. The Social \n     Security Administration Office of Inspector General has \n     registered a 500 percent increase in allegations of Social \n     Security fraud in the past several years--from 11,000 in 1998 \n     to 65,000 in fiscal year 2001.\n\n\n                 photo identification required to vote\n\n       The second major setback in the conference report is the \n     photo identification requirement. As with the other methods \n     of disenfranchisement in American history, such as literacy \n     tests and poll taxes, the photo identification requirement \n     would present barriers to voting and have a chilling effect \n     on voter participation. There are voters who simply do not \n     have identification and requiring them to purchase photo \n     identification would be tantamount to requiring them to pay a \n     poll tax. As a disproportionate number of racial and ethnic \n     minority voters, the homeless, as well as voters with \n     disabilities and certain religious objectors, do not have \n     photo identification nor the financial means to acquire it, \n     the burden of this requirement would fall disproportionately \n     and unfairly upon them, perhaps even violating the Voting \n     Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973.\n       Further, the limited alternatives to photo identification \n     provided in the bill--including a government check or \n     government document, utility bill, or bank statement that \n     shows the name and address of the voter--place the poor in no \n     better position. Certain populations of battered women and \n     homeless people, for example, cannot produce any of the \n     required documents, because they often do not live in a house \n     or apartment and if they do, the utility bills are not in \n     their name, they do not have a bank account, and they may not \n     receive a government check. American citizens should not be \n     denied their constitutional right to vote because they do not \n     have these documents, particularly when there are other \n     alternatives to these requirements such as attestation or \n     signature clauses which are currently used effectively by \n     many states to prevent fraud.\n       The Department of Justice (DOJ) has consistently raised \n     objections to imposing photo identification as a prerequisite \n     for voting because such requirements are likely to have a \n     disproportionately adverse impact on black voters and will \n     lessen their political participation opportunities. In 1994, \n     DOJ found that African-American persons in Louisiana were \n     four to five times less likely than white persons to have \n     driver's licenses or other picture identification cards. In \n     addition, the Federal Elections Commission noted in its 1997 \n     report to Congress that photo identification entails major \n     expenses, both initially and in maintenance, and presents an \n     undue and potentially discriminatory burden on citizens in \n     exercising their basic right to vote.\n       Effective federal legislation should not erect new \n     obstacles or weaken existing voting rights laws. Eliminating \n     these discriminatory provisions is the most certain and \n     complete way to guarantee that all states meet the \n     requirements outlined by the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore, \n     121 S. Ct. 525 (2000). Voters should not have to resort to \n     the courts to ensure compliance with the ``one person-one \n     vote'' rule.\n       We recognize that reform of our nation's electoral systems \n     is critical. But it cannot be done in a manner that unduly \n     prevents legitimate voters from exercising their \n     constitutional right to vote. For the reasons indicated \n     above, we urge you to vote ``no'' on final passage and will \n     score a vote in favor of this legislation as a vote against \n     voting rights. If you have questions, please contact ACLU \n     Legislative Counsel LaShawn Warren.\n           Sincerely,\n     Laura W. Murphy,\n       Director.\n     LaShawn Y.

In a number of significant respects, the \n     House-Senate election reform agreement is an important step \n     forward in improving election procedures and administration \n     throughout the nation. However, we do have several remaining \n     concerns about the report language that prevent us from being \n     able to endorse the final package.\n       Given the fact the millions of American citizens were \n     denied their basic right to cast a vote and to have that vote \n     counted in the 2000 election, the enactment of meaningful \n     election reform has been the Leadership Conference's highest \n     legislative priority. We greatly appreciate the efforts of \n     Sens. Christopher Dodd (D-CT), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Charles \n     Schumer (D-NY) as well as Reps. Bob Ney (R-OH), Steny Hoyer \n     (D-MD), John Conyers (D-MI), Charlie Gonzalez (D-TX) and \n     others to reach a bipartisan agreement on comprehensive \n     election reform. Among its beneficial provisions, the \n     conference agreement will:\n       Set uniform, minimum standards for federal elections \n     nationwide, including providing voters with a chance to check \n     for and correct ballot errors;\n       Ensure accuracy of state voter registration databases by \n     implementing uniform, statewide computerized lists;\n       Provide provisional ballots, which allow voters who are \n     erroneously left off the voter registration lists to vote and \n     be counted once eligibility can be verified;\n       Help eliminate outmoded punch-card and lever voting \n     systems, and upgrade voting systems and equipment in every \n     state; and\n       Provide funding to ensure that voters with disabilities are \n     able to cast ballots privately and independently.\n       The conference report language, however, does contain \n     several troubling provisions:\n       First, the report contains a requirement that all persons \n     seeking to register must provide the state with a drivers \n     license number or, in the event they do not have one, the \n     last four digits of their social security number. Any person \n     who has either number but does not provide it--even for \n     privacy reasons--will not be registered. Once a voter \n     provides either number, the state must verify the accuracy of \n     the data provided by checking it against state motor vehicle \n     or Social Security Administration (SSA) databases. This \n     system set out by the conference report is both cumbersome \n     and prone to error. There are many legitimate reasons why the \n     data provided by an eligible voter may not match the data in \n     a motor vehicle or SSA database. For example, a woman may \n     marry or divorce without updating her last name in the \n     database; many Latinos use two last names, which the SSA may \n     list incorrectly; some Asians list their last name first; and \n     in entering their date of birth, some people enter the date \n     followed by the month, the opposite of U.S. customs. Even a \n     simpler juxtaposition of a number could result in a ``no-\n     match.''\n       Second, amendments that have been made to the ID \n     requirement fail to reduce its disenfranchising impact upon \n     first-time voters. While the conference report includes minor \n     improvements, these provisions fall far short of reducing the \n     disproportionate negative impact of the ID provision.\n       In order to reduce its harmful impact on first-time voters, \n     the ID requirement should have been linked to the requirement \n     that a state have a computerized voter list in place. \n     Instead, while the compromise bill requires mail-in \n     registrants to meet the ID requirements in the 2004 election-\n     cycle, it gives states a waiver until 2006 to create the \n     statewide computerized lists. As a result, voters in states \n     without state-wide lists will have to comply with the ID \n     provision anytime they move within the state. Thus, the \n     burden of the ID requirement will fall more heavily on \n     renters, who change residences more often than homeowners, \n     and who generally have lower incomes.\n       Third, the conference report would invalidate the \n     registration of any voter who does not check off a new box on \n     the registration form declaring that he or she is a U.S. \n     citizen. Many elderly voters and voters with low levels of \n     literacy, who find filling out forms difficult, will be \n     likely to inadvertently fail to check the boxes and will, as \n     a result, disproportionately be kept off the registration \n     rolls.\n       Provisional ballots will not solve the above problems. Even \n     if a voter is allowed to file a provisional ballot, it will \n     not be counted because he or she was never ``properly'' \n     registered, due to these onerous registration and \n     verification requirements.\n       We hope you will keep the above issues in mind when \n     deciding how you will vote on the conference report to H.R. \n     3295.

The legislation will allow registered individuals to \n     cast provisional ballots even if their names are mistakenly \n     excluded from voter registration lists at their polling \n     places. It will require states to develop centralized, \n     statewide voter registration list to ensure the accuracy of \n     their voter registration records. It will also require states \n     to provide at least one voting machine per polling place that \n     is accessible to the disabled, and ensure that their voting \n     machines allow voters to verify and correct their votes \n     before casting them. Finally, the legislation authorizes $3.8 \n     billion in critically needed funds to fix antiquated voting \n     systems and to meet the minimum standards set forth in the \n     bill.\n       At the same time, we are concerned by other provisions that \n     may erect new barriers to voting. These provisions include \n     the identification requirements for first time voters who \n     register by mail and the provision (added by the conference \n     committee) that allows election officials to return voter \n     registration forms as incomplete if the ``citizenship box'' \n     is left blank by the voter.\n       Since the effectiveness of this legislation depends on \n     uniform and non-discriminatory enforcement, PFAW will be \n     vigilant in our efforts to educate the public about new \n     requirements and will monitor the application of these \n     provisions in the states. We will be advocating for full \n     funding of programs authorized by the bill in order to ensure \n     that the bill does not contain empty promises. Concurrently, \n     we will begin to identify areas where we can strengthen the \n     progress made by this bill, and work with our allies on \n     legislation to correct deficiencies.\n       Finally, through PFAW Foundation's election protection \n     program, now operating in six states, we will intensify \n     efforts to educate voters to ensure that individuals know and \n     understand their new rights and responsibilities. People For \n     the American Way Foundation will also take other action as \n     appropriate to protect voters' rights.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ralph G. Neas,\n       President.\n     Stephenie Foster,\n       Director of Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. DODD. The concerns of these groups are reflected in three of the \nprovisions of the conference report: (1) the first-time mail \nregistration requirements of section 303(b); (2) the requirement that \nthe drivers license, or last 4 digits of the voter's Social Security \nnumber, be provided on the registration form under section 303(a)(5); \nand (3) the citizenship check-off box requirements of section \n303(b)(4). I intend to address each of these issues in turn.\n  Let me state from the start that each of these groups was \nsignificantly involved in the development of the original Dodd-Conyers \nlegislation, and all continued to provide valuable input and comments \nas we worked to develop a bipartisan compromise in the Senate last \nDecember and then perfect that compromise in conference with the House \nthis summer and fall. Many of these same groups expressed reservations \nat the time about the Senate compromise and withheld support for the \nbill when it passed the Senate. Each of these organizations played a \npivotal role in the formation of this legislation and I continue to \npersonally value their perspective and input.\n  Let me state for the record, that as the principal Senate author of \nthis conference report, it has consistently been my goal and position \nthat this legislation be uniform and nondiscriminatory in both intent \nand result without regard to color or class, gender or age, disability \nor native language, party or precinct. While I understand the \ncollective, and individual, concerns of these organizations, the \nultimate test of this legislation will be in its implementation by the \nStates and I am confident that a fair reading of its provisions will \nproduce the desired result. With that, let me offer my perspective on \nseveral issues raised by these organizations.\n  First, with regard to the anti-fraud provisions, I share the concern \nthat the hearings and studies by numerous organizations, including the \nSenate Rules Committee, over the past two years did not unearth any \nevidence of widespread voter fraud. However, even the anecdotal \nevidence of dogs and deceased persons registering, and perhaps even \nvoting, and registration lists with duplicate names in several \ndifferent jurisdictions illustrate the frailties of current \nregistration procedures. While I continue to believe that the most \neffective anti-fraud provision in the Senate-passed bill, and in this \nconference\n\n[[Page S10504]]\n\nreport, remains the requirement that States establish a centralized \ncomputerized registration list, I also recognize that but for the \nprovision of section 303(b) affecting first-time voters who register by \nmail, this legislation and all the good it contains would not have made \nit this far.\n  While I appreciate the sensitivities of these organizations to the \npotential that the first-time mail registrant voter requirement of \nsection 303(b) will fall disproportionately on minorities and low \nincome individuals, I am not convinced that the sound interpretation of \nthis legislation will ultimately result in the disenfranchisement of \nsuch voters. In order to better establish empirical data on the \nprevalence of such fraud, the conference report directs the new \nCommission to make periodic studies and reports, with recommendations \nto Congress, on nationwide statistics on voter fraud and methods of \nidentifying, deterring and investigating such fraud.\n  More importantly, the Commission is directed to conduct a special \nstudy, to be completed within 18 months of the effective date of the \nfirst-time voter provision, on the impact such requirement has on these \nvoters and voter registration in general. The Commission is directed to \nalso study the additional requirement that new registrants provide the \nlast four digits of their Social Security number at registration if \nthey do not have a valid drivers license number. If the results of \nthese studies indicate either a lack of empirical evidence that \nwidespread voter fraud exists, or that these new anti-fraud provisions \nare disenfranchising voters, particularly minority and low-income \nvoters, Congress will be in a position to modify or repeal these \nprovisions.\n  In the meantime, changes made to the conference report will work to \nmitigate, and perhaps even obviate, the need for States to implement \nthe first-time mail registrant voter requirement.\n  To make clear that Congress intends that the first-time voter \nprovision of section 303(b) must not result in a disparate impact on \nminority voters, the conferees agreed to add language to this section \nto require that it be implemented in a uniform and nondiscriminatory \nmanner. The conference report also contains a new notice provision, \nsection 303(b)(4)(iv), which requires that the NVRA registration form \ncontain a statement informing the applicant that if they register by \nmail, appropriate information must be included in order to avoid the \nadditional identification requirements upon voting for the first time. \nAs in the Senate-passed bill, if any voter is challenged as not being \neligible to vote, including for reasons that he or she is a first-time \nmail registrant voter without proper identification, such voter is \nentitled to vote by provisional ballot, and that ballot is counted \naccording to State law.\n  As I stated yesterday, nothing in this bill establishes a Federal \ndefinition of when a voter is registered or how a vote is counted. If a \nchallenged voter submits a provisional ballot, the State may still \ndetermine that the voter is eligible to vote and so count that ballot, \nnotwithstanding that the first-time mail registrant voter did not \nprovide additional identification required under section 303(b). \nWhether a provisional ballot is counted or not depends solely on State \nlaw, and the conferees clarified this by adding language in section \n302(a)(4) stating that a voter's eligibility to vote is determined \nunder State law.\n  More importantly, however, is the combination of the existing \nlanguage in the Senate-passed bill (offered by Senator Wyden) and the \nprovision, modified from the Senate-passed bill, which requires new \nregistrants to provide a drivers license number upon registration, or \nthe last 4 digits of their Social Security number if they do not have a \ndrivers license number.\n  The Wyden amendment included in the Senate-passed bill, and retained \nwithout modification in the conference report, provides a means by \nwhich first-time mail registrant voters can avoid the additional \nverification requirements of section 303(b) altogether. At the choice \nof the individual, under section 303(b)(3), a first-time mail \nregistrant voter can opt to submit their drivers license number, or at \nleast the last 4 digits of their Social Security number, on the mail-in \nvoter registration form in order for the State to match the information \nagainst a State database, such as the motor vehicle authority database. \nIf such information matches, the additional identification requirements \nof section 303(b)(1) do not apply to that individual.\n  Under the new requirements added in conference as section 303(a)(5), \neffective in 2004 (unless waived until 2006), all new applicants must \nprovide at the time of registration, a valid drivers license number, or \nif the individual does not have such, the last 4 digits of their Social \nSecurity number (or if they have neither, the State shall assign them a \nunique identifying number). States must then attempt to match such \ninformation, thereby satisfying the provisions of section 303(b)(3) \nwhich renders the first-time mail applicant provisions of section \n303(b)(1) inapplicable. By operation of section 303(a)(5) added in \nconference, in conjunction with the existing language of the Senate-\npassed bill (as added by Senator Wyden) in section 303(b)(3), the \nfirst-time voter identification requirement is obviated and essentially \nrendered moot, thereby avoiding the potential disenfranchisement of \nminority voters.\n  Secondly, with respect to the provisions of section 303(a)(5) which \nrequire verification of voter registration information, it is important \nto remember that nothing in this conference report establishes a \nFederal definition, or standard, for when a voter is duly registered. \nThat authority continues to reside solely with State and local election \nofficials pursuant to State law. Nor does this conference report \nrequire States to enact legislation changing voter eligibility \nrequirements to conform to the Act. As I pointed out yesterday, \nChairman Ney, the principal author of this conference report on behalf \nof the House, stated last week that this bill provides for basic \nrequirements that States shall meet, but leaves to the discretion of \nthe States how they meet those requirements in order to tailor \nsolutions to their own unique problems. This section is not an \nexception to that rule.\n  Section 303(a)(5) is a modification to provisions added to the Senate \nbill during floor debate which authorized States to request a voter's 9 \ndigit Social Security number. Concerns had been expressed, which I \nshared, that even allowing States the discretion to require the full \nSocial Security number potentially ran afoul of Privacy Act \nprotections. While this provision goes further than I would have \nwished, it is simply not an accurate reading of this section to \nconclude that a lack of a match--or a ``no-match'' will result in the \ninvalidation of a voter's registration application or the purging of \nthe voter's name.\n  First, with respect to purging, this provision applies only \nprospectively to new applicants and as such cannot be used to purge \nnames of existing voters from the rolls. More importantly, however, the \nlanguage of the conference report, and the Statement of Managers on \nthis point specifically, make it abundantly clear that any purging of \nnames must conform to existing NVRA requirements. There is no provision \nin the current NVRA which would authorize purging for lack of a match \nof either a drivers license number or the last 4 digits of a Social \nSecurity number.\n  As for the argument that this provision will result in the \ninvalidation of a voter's application, that conclusion is simply not \nsupported by a reading of all the relevant provisions. Effective in \n2004 (or 2006 if a waiver of section 303(a) is requested by the State), \nthis section prohibits States from accepting or processing a voter \nregistration application unless it contains the voter's drivers license \nnumber. However, there is no similar prohibition on local election \nofficials who presumably will continue to have the authority to process \nvoter applications until the State implements the centralized \ncomputerized registration list and becomes responsible for maintaining \nthe official list of eligible voters under section 303(a)(1).\n  In the meantime, if an applicant has not been issued a current and \nvalid drivers license, then the applicant must provide the last 4 \ndigits of his or her Social Security number. If the applicant has \nneither number, the State shall issue the individual a number which \nbecomes the voter's unique identifier (as required for the centralized \ncomputerize registration list). The chief state election official must \nalso\n\n[[Page S10505]]\n\nenter into agreements with the State motor vehicle authority and the \nCommissioner of Social Security in order to match information supplied \nby the voter with these databases.\n  However, nothing in this section prohibits a State from accepting or \nprocessing an application with incomplete or inaccurate information. \nSection 303(a)(5)(A)(iii) specifically reserves to the States the \ndetermination as to whether the information supplied by the voter is \nsufficient to meet the disclosure requirements of this provision. So, \nfor example, if a voter transposes his or her Social Security number, \nor provides less than a full drivers license number, the State can \nnonetheless determine that such information is sufficient to meet the \nverification requirements, in accordance with State law. Consequently, \na State may establish what information is sufficient for verification, \npreserving the sole authority of the State to determine eligibility \nrequirements for voters. Furthermore, nothing in this conference report \nrequires a State to enact any specific legislation for determining \neligibility to vote.\n  Moreover, nothing in this section prohibits a State from registering \nan applicant once the verification process takes place, notwithstanding \nthat the applicant provided inaccurate or incomplete information at the \ntime of registration (as anticipated by section 303(a)(5)(A)(iii)) or \nthat the matching process did not verify the information. The provision \nrequires only that a verification process be established but it does \nnot define when an applicant is a duly registered voter. Again, this \nconference report does not establish Federal registration eligibility \nrequirements those are found only in the U.S. Constitution. Section \n303(a)(5)(A)(iii) makes it clear that State law is the ultimate \ndeterminant of whether the information supplied under this section is \nsufficient for determining if an applicant is duly registered under \nState law.\n\n  Finally, with respect to the issue of the citizenship check-off box \non the voter application form under section 303(b)(4), the Senate-\npassed bill contained the requirement that the NVRA registration form \ninclude two new questions and a check-off box for voters to mark to \nindicate their answers to questions regarding age and citizenship \neligibility. The conference agreement added a new provision in section \n303(b)(4)(B) which requires that if a voter does not check-off the \ncitizenship box, the appropriate election official must notify the \napplicant of the omission and provide the applicant an opportunity to \ncomplete the form in time for processing to be completed to allow the \nvoter to participate in the next Federal election.\n  It is simply inaccurate to state that any registration application is \nrequired to be invalidated under this section if an applicant forgets \nto check-off the citizenship box. Nothing in this provision makes the \ncompletion of the check-off box a condition of Federal eligibility. The \nconference report does not establish Federal eligibility requirements \nfor voting. NVRA only requires that an applicant sign the registration \nform attesting to his or her eligibility, including citizenship. The \ncheck-off box is a tool for registrars to use to verify citizenship, \nbut nothing in the conference report requires a check-off or \ninvalidates the form if the box is left blank.\n  In fact, this provision will ensure that if a voter did not check-off \nthe citizenship box, his or her registration form cannot be discarded \nas invalid on its face. Ultimately, the registrar determines whether or \nnot the voter has met the citizenship requirement notwithstanding \nwhether or not the box is checked. A signed attestation as to \ncitizenship eligibility is still sufficient under NVRA. Jurisdictions \nthat currently use citizenship check-off boxes may continue to process \nsuch information pursuant to State law, but in fact will not be able to \ninvalidate a form based on the lack of a check-off without notification \nto the voter first.\n  With respect to each of these three issues, it is important to note \nthat each of these provisions will likely require some adjustment to \nthe NVRA registration form. The new Election Assistance Commission \nspecifically does not have rulemaking authority with the exception of \nthe authority permitted, and currently exercised by the Federal \nElection Commission, under section 9(a) of the NVRA (42 U.S.C. 1973gg-\n7(a)) to prescribe such regulations necessary to develop the mail \nregistration form used in Federal elections. Consequently, it is \nanticipated that the new Commission will be required to revise the \ncurrent NVRA registration form in order to effectuate the requirements \nunder this Act, including: notice requirements for first-time voters \nunder section 303(b)(4)(iv); the collection of a drivers license number \nor last 4 digits of a Social Security number under sections 303(a)(5) \nand 303(b)(3); and the age and citizenship check-off boxes under \nsection 303(b)(4), in addition to any other changes in the Federal \nregistration application form that the Commission views as necessary to \nimplement this Act. This exercise will afford interested parties an \nopportunity to ensure that these requirements do not result in the \ndisenfranchisement of applicant voters.\n  As a final observation, let me state that while the enforcement \nprovisions of the Senate-passed bill included tough preclearance-type \nreviews of grant applications by the Department of Justice, the \nconference report contains an important new administrative grievance \nprocedure intended to provide voters, and others aggrieved by violation \nof the requirements of this Act, a timely and convenient means of \nredressing alleged violations. Each State that receives funds under \nTitle I must establish a state-based administrative procedure for \nreviewing alleged grievances under Title III of this Act. If the State \ndoes not render a decision within 90 days of receiving a complaint, the \nproceeding is moved to an alternative dispute resolution process which \nmust resolved the issue within 60 days.\n  While I would have preferred that we extend the private right of \naction afforded private parties under NVRA, the House simply would not \nentertain such an enforcement provisions. Nor would they accept Federal \njudicial review of any adverse decision by a State administrative body. \nHowever, the state-based administrative procedure must meet basic due \nprocess requirements and afford an aggrieved party a hearing on the \nrecord if they so choose.\n  It is important to note that this state-based administrative \nproceeding is in addition to any other rights the aggrieved has and is \nlimited only to the adjudication of violations of the requirements \nunder Title III of this Act. This enforcement scheme in no ways \nreplaces or alters the adjudication provisions of any other civil \nrights or voting rights law.\n  As with all provisions of this legislation, the proof is in the \nimplementation of these requirements by the States. But nothing in this \nconference report requires States or localities to change any voter \neligibility requirements nor does this Act in any way infringe upon the \nsole authority of State and local election officials to determine who \nis a duly registered voter. I agree that it will require diligence and \neducation of State and local election officials to ensure that these \nprovisions do not serve to disenfranchise voters and I stand ready to \nmonitor actions by the States to ensure that they do not undermine the \npurposes of this Act: to make it easier to vote, but harder to defraud \nthe system.\n  Mr. President, the conference report that we are about to adopt is a \ntrue compromise. It is a melding of the House-passed and Senate-passed \nbills. While there was much in common in the legislation that passed \neach House, there were significant differences also. I commend my House \ncounterparts, Chairman Bob Ney and Congressman Steny Hoyer, for their \nwillingness to spend countless hours and several long nights to hammer \nout the differences in these two approaches in order to reach the \nconference report we present to the Senate for adoption today.\n  On at least one occasion, Chairman Ney, Congressman Hoyer and I, \nalong with our staff, worked literally around the clock for twelve \nhours in order to reach consensus, with the final agreement being \nreached long after the midnight hour. Such effort is just one \nindication of the level of commitment that the House conferees \ndemonstrated in reaching a consensus on this historic legislation, and \nI thank them for their dedication to seeing this process through to a \nsatisfactory conclusion. The American people owe them a debt\n\n[[Page S10506]]\n\nof gratitude for their efforts to ensure that henceforth, in Federal \nelections, every eligible voter will be able to vote and have their \nvote counted.\n  The original House and Senate bills addressed the problems that came \nto light in the November 2000 presidential election in similar ways. \nWhile the Senate bill set out minimum requirements of the States to \nmeet over the next four years, and funded those requirements at 100 \npercent of costs, the House bill used Federal funds as an incentive to \nencourage States to take preferred action, either by following Federal \nstandards or by adopting standards of their own. Both bills however, \npreserved the traditional authority of State and local election \nofficials to determine the specific means of meeting those requirements \nor standards. Both bills also preserved the authority of State and \nlocal election officials to be the sole determinants of whether an \napplicant is a duly registered voter. And both bills preserved the \nauthority of State law to determine when a vote has been cast and \nwhether a vote, once cast, will ultimately be counted.\n  My counterpart in the House, Chairman Ney, said it best last week \nduring the House debate on the conference report, and I agree with his \nassessment. Let me quote Chairman Ney:\n\n       One size fits all solutions do not work and only lead to \n     inefficiencies. States and locales must retain the power and \n     the flexibility to tailor solutions to their own unique \n     problems. This legislation will pose certain basic \n     requirements that all jurisdictions will have to meet, but \n     they will retain the flexibility to meet the requirements in \n     the most effective manner.\n\n  That is the hallmark of this legislation, it requires that States and \nlocalities meet basic requirements in the type of voting system they \nuse in Federal elections, in the offering of provisional ballots, in \nthe creation of a centralized computerized registration list and the \ncollection of data for that list, and in the verification of \nidentification for new registrants. But in the implementation of these \nrequirements, the sole determination is left to the State as to what \ntype of voting system a jurisdiction chooses to use, and whether a \nprovisional ballot is ultimately counted pursuant to State law, and \nwhether an individual registrant is determined under State law to be \nduly registered and entered into the centralized registration list.\n\n  I am gratified that the conferees agreed to include in this \nconference report what this Senator believes are the most important \nprovisions of the Senate bill: the requirements for voting system \nstandards, provisional balloting, and the creation of statewide \ncomputerized registration lists. The conference report retains the core \nrequirements and language of the Senate-passed bill, most of which were \ncontained in the original bill reported by the Senate Rules Committee \njust fourteen months ago in August of 2001 as S. 565. These \nrequirements were the fundamental elements of the Senate-passed bill \nand are an equally integral component of the conference report. These \nprovisions include required standards that all voting systems used in \nFederal elections must meet; the offering of provisional ballots so \nthat no voter is ever turned away from the polls again; and the \ncreation of an official centralized computerized registration list to \ninclude the names of all eligible voters and procedures for ensuring \nthe accuracy of that list, as well as provisions for verifying the \nidentity of certain new registrants.\n  Title III of the conference report contains the three basic \nrequirements for voting system standards and administrative procedures \nto be used in Federal elections.\n  Section 301 establishes six standards that all voting systems used in \nFederal elections after January 1, 2006 must meet:\n  (1) While maintaining voter privacy and ballot confidentiality, \npermit voters to verify their selections on the ballot, notify voters \nof over-votes, and permit voters to change their votes and correct any \nerrors before casting the ballot. The conference report retains the \nprovisions of section 101 of the Senate-passed bill that created an \nalternative means of notifying voters of over-votes for jurisdictions \nusing paper ballots, punch card, or central-count voting systems \n(including absentee and mail-in ballots). Such jurisdictions may \ninstead use voter education and instruction programs for notification \nof over-votes only. However, all voting systems, including these paper \nballot systems, must provide voters with so-called ``second-chance'' \nvoting, i.e., the ability to verify the voter's selection and the \nability to correct or change the ballot prior to it being cast. The \nconference report also clarifies that this requirement cannot be used \nto render a paper ballot invalid or unable to be modified in order to \nmeet the requirements.\n  Notification to the voter of an over-vote is essential because it \nprovides an eligible voter a ``second chance'' opportunity to correct \nhis or her ballot before it is cast and tabulated. Any such \nnotification must be accomplished in a private and independent manner. \nWith regard to the notification, it is the voting system itself, or the \neducational document, and not a poll worker or election official, which \nnotifies the voter of an over-vote. The sanctity of a private ballot is \nso fundamental to our system of elections, that the language of this \ncompromise contains a specific requirement that any notification under \nthis section preserve the privacy of the voter and the confidentiality \nof the ballot. The Caltech-MIT study noted that secrecy and anonymity \nof the ballot provide important checks on coercion and fraud in the \nform of widespread vote buying.\n\n  Paper ballot systems include those systems where the individual votes \na paper ballot that is tabulated by hand. Central count systems include \nmail-in absentee ballots and mail-in balloting, such as that used \nextensively in Oregon and Washington state, and other states where a \npaper ballot is voted and then sent off to a central location to be \ntabulated by an optical scanning or punch card system. A mail-in ballot \nor mail-in absentee ballot is treated as a paper ballot for purposes of \nnotification of an over-vote under section 301 of the conference \nreport, as is a ballot counted on a central count voting system. \nHowever, if an individual votes in person on a central count system, as \nis used in some states that allow early voting or in-person absentee \nvoting, for that voter, such system is required to actually notify the \nvoter of the over-vote.\n  As for the other types of voting systems, namely lever machines, \nprecinct-based optical scanning systems, and direct recording \nelectronic systems, or DREs, the voting system itself must meet the \nstandard. Specifically, the functionality of the voting system shall \npermit the voter to verify the votes selected, provide the voter with \nan opportunity to change or correct the ballot before it is cast or \ntabulated, and actually notify the voter if he or she casts more than \none vote for a single-candidate office.\n  The conference report recognizes the inherent differences between \npaper ballot systems and mechanical or electronic voting systems. The \nconferees retained the reasonable balance struck in the Senate-passed \nbill between ensuring that no voting system is eliminated as long as \nthe requirement that all voters have the opportunity to verify their \nballot and a ``second-chance'' to correct any error on the ballot or \nchange the ballot, before it is cast and counted. Although this \ncompromise provides an alternative method of notifying voters of over-\nvotes for punch card and paper ballot systems, nothing in this \nlegislation precludes jurisdictions from going beyond what is required, \nso long as such methods are not inconsistent with the Federal \nrequirements under Title III or any law described in section 906 of \nTitle IX of this Act.\n  The conference report is silent on the issue of notification to the \nvoter of an under-vote and neither requires nor prohibits such \nnotification. However, the Election Assistance Commission is charged \nwith studying the feasibility of notifying voters of under-votes.\n  (2) Each voting system must produce a permanent paper record for the \nvoting system that can be manually audited. Such record must be \navailable as an official record for recounts, however, there is no \nintent to mandate that the paper record serve as the official record. \nWhether this record becomes the official record is left to the \ndiscretion of the States. As the Chairman of the Rules Committee, let \nme advise my colleagues of the importance of this feature in the \nunlikely event that a petition of election contest is filed with the \nSenate. Often, in order to resolve such contests, the Rules Committee \nmust have access to an audit\n\n[[Page S10507]]\n\ntrail in order to determine which candidate received the most votes. \nThis standard will ensure that the Senate and the House will have \naccess to reliable records in the case of election contests.\n  (3) Consistent with the Senate-passed provision, each voting system \nmust provide to individuals with disabilities, including the blind and \nvisually impaired, the same accessibility to voting as other voters. \nJurisdictions may meet this standard through the use of at least one \nDRE, or other properly equipped voting system, at each polling place. \nHowever, any system purchased on or after January 1, 2007, if purchased \nwith Federal funds made available under Title II of the Act, must meet \nthe accessibility standard.\n  The accessibility standard for individuals with disabilities is \nperhaps one of the most important provisions of this legislation. Ten \nmillion blind voters did not vote in the 2000 elections in part because \nthey cannot read the ballots used in their jurisdiction. With 21st \ncentury technology, this is simply unacceptable.\n  The Senate Rules Committee received a great deal of disturbing \ntestimony regarding the disenfranchisement of Americans with \ndisabilities. Mr. James Dickson, Vice President of the American \nAssociation of People with Disabilities, testified that our nation has \na `` . . . crisis of access to the polling places.'' Twenty-one million \nAmericans with disabilities did not vote in the last election--the \nsingle largest demographic groups of non-voters.\n  To statutorily address this ``crisis of access,'' the conference \nreport contains the provisions of the Senate-passed bill requiring that \nby the Federal elections of 2006, all voting systems must be accessible \nfor individuals with disabilities, including nonvisual accessibility \nfor the blind and visually impaired. Most importantly, that \naccommodation must be provided in a manner that provides the same \nopportunity for access and participation, including privacy and \nindependence, as for other voters. Accessibility is required for \nindividuals with all disabilities, not just physical disabilities.\n  In order to assist the States and localities in meeting this standard \nby 2006, the conference report retains the Senate-passed provision that \nallows jurisdictions to satisfy this standard through the use of at \nleast one direct recording electronic (DRE) voting system, or any other \nvoting system that is equipped to accommodate individuals with \ndisabilities, in every polling place. It must be noted, moreover, that \nthe compromise does not require that a jurisdiction purchase a DRE to \nmeet the accessibility requirement since jurisdictions may also choose \nto modify existing systems to meet the needs of the disabled voter.\n  A DRE used to meet the accessibility standard under this requirement \nis not intended to be used solely by individuals with disabilities. \nObviously, any eligible voter should have access to such a machine, and \nin fact, may find voting on such a system to be preferable to other \nsystems used in that polling place. Nothing in this conference report \nis intended to suggest that because each polling place must have an \naccessible machine, that machine is for the exclusive use of \nindividuals with disabilities, nor that such machine, or individuals \nwho use such system, should be separated from other voters. Such \ntreatment would be contrary to the requirement in section 301(a)(3)(A) \nthat such individuals be given the same opportunity for access and \nparticipation (including privacy and independence).\n  In addition, the Caltech-MIT study suggests that DREs have the \npotential to allow for more flexible user interface to accommodate \nmultiple language ballots. Consequently, such DRE voting systems can \nalso be used to meet the accessibility requirements for language \nminorities under the Voting Rights Act, and this conference report, as \nwell.\n  It has been suggested that this may be a wasteful requirement for \njurisdictions that have no known disabled voters. Let me make clear \nthat the purpose of this requirement is to ensure that the disabled \nhave an equal opportunity to cast a vote and have that vote counted, \njust as all other non-disabled Americans, with privacy and \nindependence. It is simply not acceptable that individuals with \ndisabilities should have to hide in their homes and not participate \nwith other Americans on election day simply because no one knows that \nthey exist. It is equally unacceptable to suggest that individuals with \ndisabilities must come forward and declare their disability in order to \nparticipate in democracy through the polling place.\n  (4) Each voting system must provide alternative language \naccessibility as required by law. This is a slight modification to the \nSenate-passed bill in order to make clear that the alternative language \nrequirements must conform to existing Voting Rights Act requirements.\n  The Voting Rights Act mandates that covered jurisdictions must \nprovide translated voting materials, such as bilingual ballots, voter \nregistration forms, voting instructions, other voting materials, oral \ntranslation services and interpreters to ensure accessibility to the \nright to cast a vote and have that vote counted. Nothing in this Act \noverturns or undermines the Voting Rights Act.\n  The alternative language accessibility standard follows the \nprocedures for determining when a language minority (e.g., only the \nfour general groups currently recognized by VRA: Asian Americans, \npeople of Spanish heritage, Native Americans and native Alaskans) must \nbe accommodated under section 203 of the Voting Rights Act. This \nconference report leaves in place the numerical triggers under the \nVoting Rights Act, which require states and political subdivisions that \nmeet the triggers of non-English speaking citizens of voting age to \nprovide language assistance services at the polls for American voters. \nOn July 26, 2002, the Department of Justice released new jurisdictions \nand languages covered under the language assistance provisions of the \nVoting Rights Act based on Census 2000 figures.\n  The conference report provides safeguards to ensure an equal \nopportunity for all eligible language minorities to cast a vote and \nhave that vote counted. This is accomplished with uniform and \nnondiscriminatory requirements that ensure alternative language \naccessibility to voting systems, provisional balloting, and inclusion \nas a registered voter in the statewide voter registration lists. In \naddition, this compromise provides for the Election Assistance \nCommission to study and make recommendations as to whether the voting \nsystems are, in fact, capable of accommodating all voters with a \nlimited proficiency in the English language.\n  (5) Each voting system must comply with an ``out-of-the-box'' error \nrate standard as established in section 3.2.1 of the Federal voting \nsystem standards issued by the Federal Election Commission and in \neffect on the date of enactment. While the specific error rate will not \nchange, it is anticipated that over time, should technology provide for \nan improved error rate, Congress will amend this provision to reflect \nchanging technology. Neither the conference report, nor the Senate-\npassed bill, establishes performance error rates, or residual error \nrates, for particular types of voting systems, as recommended by the \nCarter-Ford Commission. However, the conference report does require \nthat the new Commission study the best methods for establishing voting \nsystem performance benchmarks, expressed as a percentage of residual \nvote in the Federal contest at the top of the ballot. If such \nbenchmarks can be established with reliability, a future Congress may \ndecide to add a performance benchmark, or performance error rate, to \nthe voting system standards.\n  Finally, (6) the conference report contains an additional standard, \ntaken from the House-passed bill, requiring each State to adopt uniform \nstandards defining what constitutes a vote and what will be counted as \na vote for each certified voting system. This provision is an \nimprovement over the Senate bill and will ensure that voters using \nsimilar machines will have their votes counted in a uniform and \nnondiscriminatory manner within a State.\n  Under this additional standard, States must define what constitutes a \n``legal'' vote on a specific voting system with a companion definition \nof when that ``legal'' vote will be counted on that specific voting \nsystem. These two state-based definitions will provide another \nincremental step toward ensuring that votes are cast and counted\n\n[[Page S10508]]\n\nin a uniform, non-discriminatory manner and should help ensure against \na repeat of the 4-6 million votes that were cast but not counted in the \n2000 general election according to the Caltech-MIT study. Such state-\nbased definitions will erase the inconsistent standards, practices, or \nprocedures within states and localities that have diluted votes cast in \ncertain communities. Now, no matter where the voter lives and votes, \nthat voter will have an equal opportunity to cast his or her vote and \nan equal opportunity to have his or her vote counted.\n  The effective date for the voting system standards remains for any \nFederal election held in a jurisdiction after January 1, 2006. It is \nimportant to note, that with regard to effective dates, the actual date \non which the standards under the voting system requirement must be \nimplemented will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction depending upon \nwhen the first Federal election occurs in 2006. A federal election \nincludes a general, primary, special, or runoff election for federal \noffice.\n  Section 302 establishes the second requirement that all States and \njurisdictions must meet beginning for Federal elections after January \n1, 2004: the requirement that jurisdictions provide for provisional \nvoting for any voter who is challenged as ineligible but who attests, \nin writing, that they are registered and eligible to vote. This \nprovision ensures that never again can a voter who appears at the polls \nin order to vote and desires to vote can be turned away, for any \nreason. The conference report follows the Senate bill in laying out the \nsteps that such provisional balloting must follow.\n\n  First, any voter who declares that they are registered to vote in a \nFederal election in a jurisdiction but are not on the official list of \nregistered voters or are otherwise alleged to be ineligible, must be \noffered and permitted to cast a provisional ballot. Any challenge to \nthe voter's eligibility qualifies the voter for a provisional ballot, \nincluding, but not limited to:\n  The voter's name does not appear on the official registration list; \nor\n  The voter's name, or other registration information, appears \ninaccurately on the registration list; or\n  The voter does not meet the requirements of section 303(a) because \nthere is a question about, or they cannot provide, the number on their \ndrivers license or the last 4-digits of their Social Security number, \nor the State/jurisdiction refuses to assign a unique identifier number \nthat the voter could use for voter registration purposes; or\n  A voter is a first time voter who registered by mail and does not \nmeet the requirements of section 303(b) because they do not have any of \nthe specified identification, such as a photo-ID, utility bill, bank \nstatement, paycheck or other government document required to be shown \nunder this Act; or\n  There are questions about the voter's eligibility to vote, even if \ntheir name appears on the official registration list; or\n  The voter believes he or she has registered within the States' \nregistration deadline but their names does not appear on the official \nregistration list; or\n  The voter has recently moved but his or her name does not appear on \nthe official registration list; or\n  There are questions about the voters' eligibility to vote based upon \nsection 303(c) that requires if polling hours are extended as a result \nof a court order, any ballot cast in a federal election during that \nextension be provisional and be held separately from other provisional \nballots; or\n  There are questions about the voters' eligibility to vote based upon \nreassignment pursuant to state re-districting laws; or for any other \nreason.\n\n  Any and all of the above voters may, under the conference report, \ncast a provisional ballot. Not only must the State provide access to \nthe provisional ballot, but the State or local election official has a \nlegal obligation under this Act to provide notice to each individual \nvoter, who has had his or her ability to cast a regular ballot \nquestioned, that they may cast a provisional ballot in that Federal \nelection at that polling place.\n  To receive and cast a provisional ballot, all the individual must do \nis execute a written affirmation that he or she is a registered voter \nin that jurisdiction and is eligible to vote in that election. If an \nindividual is motivated enough to go to the polls and sign an \naffidavit, under perjury of law, that he or she is eligible to vote in \nthat election, then the state or local election official shall protect \nthat individual's right to cast a provisional ballot. That right is so \nfundamental, as is evidenced by its widespread use across this Nation, \nthat we must ensure that it is offered to all Americans, not in an \nidentical process, but in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner.\n  Once executed, the affidavit is handed over to the appropriate \nelection official who must promptly verify the information and issue a \nprovisional ballot. It is important to note that in some jurisdictions, \nthe verification of voter eligibility will take place prior to the \nissuance of a ballot based upon the information in the written \naffidavit. In other jurisdictions, the ballot will be issued and then \nlaid aside for verification later. Both procedures are equally valid \nunder this compromise, which provides flexibility to states to meet the \nneeds of their communities in slightly differing ways. States that \noffer same-day registration procedures similarly meet the requirements \nof section 302 provided the individual attests, in writing, to their \neligibility and the State otherwise determines, pursuant to State law, \nthat the voter is eligible to vote.\n  Any provisional ballot must be promptly verified and counted if the \nindividual is eligible under State law to vote in the jurisdiction. \nNothing in this conference report establishes a rule for when a \nprovisional ballot is counted or not counted. Once a provisional ballot \nis cast, it is within the sole authority of the State or local election \nofficial to determine whether or not that ballot should be counted, \naccording to State law. Consequently, even if a voter does not meet the \nnew Federal requirements for first-time voters to verify their \nidentity, or for new registrants to provide their drivers license \nnumber, or the last four digits of their Social Security number, if \nthat voter otherwise meets the requirements as set out in State law for \neligibility, the State shall count that ballot pursuant to State law.\n  Finally, at the time that the voter casts a provisional ballot, the \nappropriate State or local election official shall give the individual \nwritten notice of how that voter can ascertain whether or not his or \nher ballot was counted through a free access system (such as a web site \nor toll-free telephone number). This is a particularly important \nprovision as it ensures that a provisional voter will be able to cure \nany registration defect in time to become a regular voter in the next \nelection. This provision, combined with the requirement in section 303 \nfor establishing a centralized computerized registration list, will \nensure that no eligible voter will be denied the right to vote and that \nState and local election officials will have access to accurate and up-\nto-date voting records.\n  All States must meet this requirement on provisional ballots for \nFederal elections in order to comply with this Act. However, those \nStates which are described in section 4(b) of the National Voter \nRegistration Act of 1993 (NVRA) and are currently exempt from the \nprovisions of the NVRA or those States that permit same-day \nregistration or require no registration may meet the requirements for \nprovisional balloting through their current registration systems.\n  The Caltech-MIT report estimates that the aggressive use of \nprovisional ballots could cut the lost votes due to registration \nproblems in half. The Carter-Ford Commission recommended going even \nfarther than this legislation in less time, recommending state-wide \nvoter registration. The Commission noted, ``No American qualified to \nvote anywhere in her or his State should be turned away from a polling \nplace in that State.'' While the conference report does not require \nstate-wide registration, nothing in the conference report prohibits, or \nis intended to discourage, States from enacting such a provision.\n\n  In addition to the provisions requiring provisional balloting, \nsection 302 also contains the requirement in the Senate-passed bill \nthat a sample ballot and other voter information be posted at polling \nplaces on election day. In order to ensure that voters are aware of the \nprovisional balloting process,\n\n[[Page S10509]]\n\nthe registration and voting requirements for first-time voters who \nregister by mail, including the option of providing a drivers license \nnumber or at least the last four digits of a Social Security number, \nalong with other new state standards, practices and procedures, such \nnotice and information are required to be posted at polling places on \nelection day. In this information age, the expectation is that targeted \nstate education programs will compliment any required posted \ninformation to best educate the voters and train poll workers, \nvolunteers, and election officials\n  Finally, the conference report contains a modified version of the \nrequirement that, if polling hours are extended as a result of a court \norder, any ballot cast in a Federal election during that extension be \nby provisional ballot. The Senate-passed bill could have been read to \napply to any voter who votes after the polls close, and not just voters \nwho vote pursuant to a court or other order. Consequently, the \nconference report clarifies that only voters who vote pursuant to such \norder vote by provisional ballot and such provisional ballots shall be \nheld separately from other provisional ballots.\n  Section 303 of the conference report includes the provisions of the \nSenate-passed bill requiring that all States establish a centralized \ncomputerized registration list of all eligible voters. This requirement \nis the single greatest deterrent to election fraud, whether by \nunscrupulous poll workers or officials, voters, or outside individuals \nand organizations. The ability to capture every eligible voter in one \ncentrally managed database with requirements for privacy and security \nof the information will help ensure the integrity of registration lists \nand ensure both the accuracy and authenticity of those lists.\n  The Carter-Ford Commission explicitly recommended that every state \nadopt a system of statewide voter registration. The Caltech-MIT report \nsimilarly recommended the development of better databases with a \nnumerical identifier for each voter. The Constitution Project also \ncalled for the development of a state-wide computerized voter \nregistration system that can be routinely updated and is accessible at \npolling places on election day.\n  The conference report contains much of the Senate-passed language on \nthis provision with important additions to highlight the official, \ncentrally managed nature of this list. Once implemented in 2004 (or \n2006 if the State seeks a waiver for good cause), voters should never \nagain have to be turned away from the polls because their name was not \nupdated on the list. Never again should poll workers have to wait hours \nto get through a central phone line in order to verify a voter's \nregistration. And once such a list is in place, every first-time mail \nregistrant voter should be able to verify their identity through the \nmatching of a drivers license number or at least the last 4 digits of a \nSocial Security number.\n  The conference report retains the Senate-passed provisions of section \n303(a)(2) regarding list maintenance of the computerized list. Those \nprovisions provide that any name that is removed from the list must be \nremoved in accordance with provision of the National Voter Registration \nAct (NVRA), the so-called ``Motor-Voter'' law. This requirement will \nensure that voters cannot be purged from the list unless they have not \nresponded to a notice mailed by the appropriate election official and \nthen have not voted in the subsequent two Federal general elections. \nMoreover, this provision ensures that voters who appear at the polls \nduring this period and wish to vote will be allowed to as provided for \nin section 8(3) of the Motor-Voter law (42 U.S.C. 1973gg-6).\n  As a practical matter, once the computerized list has been developed \nand implemented, list maintenance will be almost automatic. While many \nof us have read of allegations of massive duplicate registrations, the \nfact is that even though alleged duplicate names appear on more than \none jurisdiction's list, the vast majority of voters only live in one \nplace and only vote in one place. In a highly mobile society likes \nours, voters move constantly. And while voters may remember to change \ntheir mailing address with the post office, with utility companies, and \nwith the bank and credit card companies, they may not even think about \nchanging their address with the local election official until it comes \ntime to vote. At the end of the day, this conference report ensures \nthat mobile voters are not disenfranchised.\n  The conference report also added a new minimum standard for ensuring \nthe accuracy of the centralized computerized registration list. That \nprovision, section 303(a)(4), was drawn from a provision contained in \nthe House-passed measure, but with an important clarification. \nConsistent with section 303(a)(2), this provision parallels language in \nthe NVRA that requires States to make a reasonable effort to remove \nregistrants who are ineligible to vote, consistent with the provisions \nof NVRA, specifically the requirement that such voters fail to respond \nto a notice and then fail to vote in the subsequent two general Federal \nelections. Further, no voter may be removed from the list solely by \nreason of a failure to vote. As is stated in the Statement of Managers, \nthis provision is completely consistent with NVRA.\n  Section 303(a)(5) of the conference report is a new provision that is \na modification to provisions added to the Senate bill during floor \ndebate that authorized States to request a voter's 9 digit Social \nSecurity number. Effective in 2004 (or 2006 if a waiver of section \n303(a) is requested by the State), this section prohibits States from \naccepting or processing a voter registration application unless it \ncontains the voter's drivers license number. However, there is no \nsimilar prohibition on local election officials who presumably will \ncontinue to have the authority to process voter applications until the \nState implements the centralized computerized registration list and \nbecomes responsible for maintaining the official list of eligible \nvoters under section 303(a)(1).\n  In the meantime, if an applicant has not been issued a current and \nvalid drivers license, then the applicant must provide the last 4 \ndigits of his or her Social Security number. If the applicant has \nneither number, the State shall issue the individual a number that \nbecomes the voter's unique identifier (as required for the centralized \ncomputerize registration list). The chief state election official must \nalso enter into agreements with the State motor vehicle authority and \nthe Commissioner of Social Security in order to match information \nsupplied by the voter with these databases.\n  However, nothing in this section prohibits a State from accepting or \nprocessing an application with incomplete or inaccurate information. \nSection 303(a)(5)(A)(iii) specifically reserves to the States the \ndetermination as to whether the information supplied by the voter is \nsufficient to meet the disclosure requirements of this provision. So, \nfor example, if a voter transposes his or her Social Security number, \nor provides less than a full drivers license number, the State can \nnonetheless determine that such information is sufficient to meet the \nverification requirements based on whatever information they already \npossess, in accordance with State law. Consequently, a State may \nestablish what information is sufficient for verification, preserving \nthe sole authority of the State to determine eligibility requirements \nfor voters. Furthermore, nothing in this conference report requires a \nState to enact any specific legislation for determining eligibility to \nvote. In fact, State motor vehicle records are generally accurate and \ncurrent and State and local election officials should affirmatively use \nthese records to correct or complete the information wherever possible.\n  Moreover, nothing in this section prohibits a State from registering \nan applicant once the verification process takes place, notwithstanding \nthat the applicant provided inaccurate or incomplete information at the \ntime of registration (as anticipated by section 303(a)(5)(A)(iii)) or \nthat the matching process did not verify the information. The provision \nrequires only that a verification process be established but it does \nnot define when an applicant is a duly registered voter. Again, this \nconference report does not establish Federal registration eligibility \nrequirements those are found only in the U.S. Constitution. Section \n303(a)(5)(A)(iii) makes it clear that State law is the ultimate \ndeterminant of whether the information supplied under this section is \nsufficient for determining if an applicant is duly registered under \nState law.\n\n[[Page S10510]]\n\n  The conference report also retains the provision championed by \nSenator Bond which will require that voters who register by mail must \nprovide additional verification of their identity the first time that \nthey appear to vote in person or by absentee ballot. To make clear that \nCongress intends that the first-time voter provision of section 303(b) \nmust not result in a disparate impact on minority voters, the conferees \nagreed to add language to this section to require that it be \nimplemented in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. The conference \nreport also contains a new notice provision, section 303(b)(4)(iv), \nwhich requires that the NVRA registration form contain a statement \ninforming the applicant that if they register by mail, appropriate \ninformation must be included in order to avoid the additional \nidentification requirements upon voting for the first time. As in the \nSenate-passed bill, if any voter is challenged as not being eligible to \nvote, including for reasons that he or she is a first-time mail \nregistrant voter without proper identification, such voter is entitled \nto vote by provisional ballot, and that ballot is counted according to \nState law.\n  In the case of an individual who registers by mail, the first time \nthe individual goes to vote in person in a jurisdiction, he or she must \npresent to the appropriate election official one of the following \npieces of identification: a current valid photo-ID; or a copy of any of \nthe following documents: a current utility bill; a bank statement; a \ngovernment check; a paycheck; or another government document with the \nvoter's name and address. This compromise does not specify any \nparticular type of acceptable photo identification. It is clear, \nhowever, that a driver's license, a photo-ID issued by the a DMV, a \nstudent ID, or a work ID that has a photograph of the individual would \nbe sufficient. Additionally, states may continue to define its own form \nof acceptable photo-ID so long as such definitions are inclusive and \nnot have the unintended consequences of targeting the persons with \ndisabilities, poor, elderly, students, racial and ethnic minorities and \notherwise legitimate voters.\n  The conference report also preserves the existing exemptions under \nthe NVRA law under section 1973gg-4(c)(2) of title 42 in the \nimplementation of this compromise. A state may not by law require a \nperson to vote in-person if that first-time voter is: (1) entitled to \nvote by absentee ballot under section 1973ff-1 of title 42 of the \nUniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act; (2) provided the \nright to vote otherwise than in-person under section 1973ee-\n1(b)(2)(b)(ii) and 1973ee-3(b)(2)(b)(ii) of the Voting Accessibility \nfor the Elderly and Handicapped act; and (3) entitled to vote otherwise \nthan in-person under any other federal law. These exemptions have the \npractical affect of preserving existing laws that provide the long-\nstanding practice of states permitting eligible uniform service and \noverseas voters to continue to vote by absentee ballot without this \nfirst-time voters requirement attaching. Similarly, these exemptions \nhave the practical affect of preserving the rights of persons with \ndisabilities not to be required to show-up in-person to vote or to be \nrequired to provide copies of photo-IDs or documents by mail.\n  As I stated yesterday, nothing in this bill establishes a Federal \ndefinition of when a voter is registered or how a vote is counted. If a \nchallenged voter submits a provisional ballot, the State may still \ndetermine that the voter is eligible to vote and so count that ballot, \nnotwithstanding that the first-time mail registrant voter did not \nprovide additional identification required under section 303(b). \nWhether a provisional ballot is counted or not depends solely on State \nlaw, and the conferees clarified this by adding language in section \n302(a)(4) stating that a voter's eligibility to vote is determined \nunder State law.\n  More importantly, however, is the combination of the existing \nlanguage in the Senate-passed bill (offered by Senator Wyden) and the \nprovision, modified from the Senate-passed bill, which requires new \nregistrants to provide a drivers license number upon registration, or \nthe last 4 digits of their Social Security number if they do not have a \ndrivers license number.\n  The Wyden amendment included in the Senate-passed bill, and retained \nwithout modification in the conference report, provides a means by \nwhich first-time mail registrant voters can avoid the additional \nverification requirements of section 303(b) altogether. At the choice \nof the individual, under section 303(b)(3), a first-time mail \nregistrant voter can opt to submit their drivers license number, or at \nleast the last 4 digits of their Social Security number, on the mail-in \nvoter registration form in order for the State to match the information \nagainst a State database, such as the motor vehicle authority database. \nIf such information matches, the additional identification requirements \nof section 303(b)(1) do not apply to that individual.\n  Under the new requirements added in conference as section 303(a)(5), \neffective in 2004 (unless waived until 2006), all new applicants must \nprovide at the time of registration, a valid drivers license number, or \nif the individual does not have such, the last 4 digits of their Social \nSecurity number (or if they have neither, the State shall assign them a \nunique identifying number). States must then attempt to match such \ninformation, thereby satisfying the provisions of section 303(b)(3) \nwhich renders the first-time mail applicant provisions of section \n303(b)(1) inapplicable. By operation of section 303(a)(5) added in \nconference, in conjunction with the existing language of the Senate-\npassed bill (as added by Senator Wyden) in section 303(b)(3), the \nfirst-time voter identification requirement is obviated and essentially \nrendered moot, thereby avoiding the potential disenfranchisement of \nminority voters.\n  The conference report also retains the Senate-passed provision that \nadds questions and check-off boxes to the NVRA registration form \nregarding age and citizenship. Under section 303(b)(4), the Senate-\npassed bill contained the requirement that the NVRA registration form \ninclude two new questions and a check-off box for voters to mark to \nindicate their answers to questions regarding age and citizenship \neligibility. The Senate-passed bill was silent as to the result of an \nunmarked box and left to States to determine whether such an omission \nwas a fatal defect in the registration form.\n  In order to clarify that States may not just summarily discard such \nincomplete forms, the conferees agreed to include language requiring \nthat the registrar notify the voter of an incomplete form. Such notice \nmust be provided in time for the registration application to be \ncompleted and processed prior to the next Federal election. However, \nnothing in this provision requires that the application be invalidated \nunder this section if an applicant forgets to check-off the citizenship \nbox. Nor does anything in this provision make the completion of the \ncheck-off box a condition of Federal eligibility. The conference report \ndoes not establish Federal eligibility requirements for voting. NVRA \nonly requires that an applicant sign the registration form attesting to \nhis or her eligibility, including citizenship. The check-off box is a \ntool for registrars to use to verify citizenship, but nothing in the \nconference report requires the check-off to be complete to process the \nregistration form or invalidates the form if the box is left blank.\n  In fact, this provision will ensure that if a voter did not check-off \nthe citizenship box, his or her registration form cannot be discarded \nas invalid on its face. Ultimately, the registrar determines whether or \nnot the voter has met the citizenship requirement notwithstanding \nwhether or not the box is checked. A signed attestation as to \ncitizenship eligibility is still sufficient under NVRA. Jurisdictions \nthat currently use citizenship check-off boxes may continue to process \nsuch information pursuant to State law, but in fact will not be able to \ninvalidate a form based on the lack of a check-off without notification \nto the voter first.\n  This compromise provides state and local election officials with the \nnecessary additional tools to make the ultimate decision regarding \neligibility of voters to register to vote, eligibility of the voter to \ncast a regular vote and the eligibility of vote to be counted. Nothing \nin this compromise usurps the state or local election official's sole \nauthority to make the final determination with respect to whether or \nnot an applicant is duly registered, whether the voter can cast a \nregular vote, or whether that vote is duly counted.\n\n[[Page S10511]]\n\n  In the case of any missing information on a mail-in registration \nform, the election official may process it as he or she determines is \nappropriate under State law. That applies equally to the requirement \nfor the citizenship check-off box, the requirement to provide one's \ndrivers license number or the last 4 digit of the Social Security \nnumber, or any other provision of this Act. This means that State law \ngoverns whether the form is returned, whether and how the voter is \ncontacted regarding the omission or whether the form is discarded. \nCurrent law under the NVRA does not require that voters be registered--\nonly that the voter be given the opportunity to register through a \nwider variety of State and local offices, including the DMV (thus the \ntitle, ``Motor-Voter\"). Current law under the NVRA does not supercede \nthe sole authority of State and local election officials to determine \nwhether or not an applicant is duly registered. Similarly, this \ncompromise does not supercede state law with respect to registration. \nAfter this law is enacted, there will still be no Federal law that \noverrides state law and preempts the field with respect to voter \nregistration.\n  Again, as with almost every aspect of this compromise, state \nimplementation of the individual provisions of this compromise is key \nand will determine if the franchise is preserved and protected for all \neligible American voters and if the integrity and security of the \nelections system is protected from corruption. Once again almost all \nthe civil rights organizations and civil liberties coalitions, but \nparticularly our language minority communities, raised legitimate \nconcerns about the potential discriminatory solution to the check-off \nquestions. At the end of the day, it will be the State and local \nelection officials who will interpret what the omission on a \ncitizenship box and an age box mean with respect to registration, \nconsistent with State law, standards, practices or procedures. These \nState laws must implement all of these requirements in a uniform and \nnondiscriminatory manner. There is no cover of law under this \ncompromise for any State or locality to establish a standard, practice \nor procedure that permits the check-off boxes to act as anti-\nregistration vehicles by voiding otherwise legal registrations under \nstate law.\n  In implementing these requirements, the States will have to rely on \nvoluntary guidelines and voluntary guidance issued by the new Federal \nElection Assistance Commission. While the conference report includes \nthe House prohibition on rule making authority for the new Commission, \nthe conferees included an important modification to this language. \nSection 209 provides an exception to the no rule making authority to \nthe extent permitted under section 9(a) of NVRA (42 U.S.C. 1973gg-\n7(a)).\n\n  With respect to the provisions of the requirements affecting \nnotification to first-time mail registrant voters, the submission of a \ndrivers license number or the last 4 digits of a Social Security \nnumber, or the change in the citizenship check-off box, some adjustment \nto the NVRA registration form will be necessary. The exception provided \nto the no rule making authority would allow the new Commission to \nproscribe such regulations necessary to develop the mail registration \nform used in Federal elections.\n  Consequently, it is anticipated that the new Commission will be \nrequired to revise the current NVRA registration form in order to \neffectuate the requirements under this Act, including: notice \nrequirements for first-time voters under section 303(b)(4)(iv); the \ncollection of a drivers license number or last 4 digits of a Social \nSecurity number under sections 303(a)(5) and 303(b)(3); and the age and \ncitizenship check-off boxes under section 303(b)(4), in addition to any \nother changes in the Federal registration application form that the \nCommission views as necessary to implement this Act. This exercise will \nafford interested parties an opportunity to ensure that these \nrequirements do not result in the disenfranchisement of applicant \nvoters.\n  With regard to effective dates, the conference report continues to \nharmonize the effective date of the computerized registration list with \nthe 2004 effective date for provisional balloting. However, since it \nwas widely acknowledged that some States may have legitimate difficulty \nin implementing the statewide registration list by January 1, 2004, a \ncertification of good cause will be sufficient to request a waiver of \nthe effective date until January 1, 2006. This waiver recognizes the \nadministrative burden of the provision on both States and voters and so \nprovides adequate time for jurisdictions to come into compliance and \neducate voters. This compromise also establishes a uniform effective \ndate of January 1, 2003 for first-time voter registration subject to \nthe first-time voter provision. This assures that all eligible voters, \nregardless of where they live or vote, will know that if they register \nto vote after that date, they will have to meet the new requirements \nfor first-time mail-registrant voters.\n  Finally, the conference report strikes a middle ground between the \nHouse-passed and Senate-passed bills with regard to how funds will be \ndirected to the States to meet the requirements and fund other election \nreform initiatives. The conference report provides initial funds by \nmeans of a combination of targeted buy-outs of punch cards and lever \nsystems, as well as a formula grant program, with a guaranteed $5 \nmillion payment per each State. The requirements payments are similarly \ndisbursed through a formula based on the relative voting age population \nof the State, with a minimum guaranteed payment of one-half of one \npercent per fiscal year.\n  Borrowing from the Senate-passed bill, in order to receive \nrequirements payments, States must first submit a State plan outlining \nhow they will spend such funds to meet the requirements of Title III \nand otherwise meet the requirements of the Act. Such a plan is \ndeveloped by a committee headed by the chief state election official, \nwith community input and public review for a 30 day comment period. \nOnce the plan is submitted to the Commission, it is published in the \nFederal Register and a State must wait 45 days after submitting the \ninitial plan before it can apply for a requirements payment.\n  While the enforcement provisions of the Senate-passed bill included \ntough pre-clearance reviews of grant applications by the Department of \nJustice, the conference report contains an important new administrative \ngrievance procedure intended to provide voters, and others aggrieved by \nviolation of the requirements of this Act, a timely and convenient \nmeans of redressing alleged violations. Each State that receives funds \nunder Title I must establish a state-based administrative procedure for \nreviewing alleged grievances under Title III of this Act. Such \nprocedure must allow for a party to request a hearing on the record and \nif the State does not render a decision within 90 days of receiving a \ncomplaint, the proceeding is moved to an alternative dispute resolution \nprocess that must resolve the issue within 60 days.\n  Voters have the legal right to turn to their State to seek a remedy \nif their right to register or vote or have their vote counted has been \nviolated. Aggrieved persons have a legal right to file the complaint \nand are entitled to a hearing on the record. If the State determines \nthat there is a violation, then the State is required to order a \nremedy. If the State does not make a final determination within 90 days \nof the date that the complaint is filed, then the complainant may seek \nto initiate the alternative dispute resolution procedures (ADR). Under \nthe enforcement provisions of this compromise, the State shall create a \nprocedure to use ADR if they fail to meet the 90 day deadline for \nresolution of the complaint. The ADR procedure is an important \nguarantee within the state complaint process. However, the ADR \nprocedure shall not be implemented to supplant any administrative \njudicial review which States already provide under State law.\n  The complaint procedures, set up under this conference report, are in \naddition to, and are not intended to override or preempt, the \nprocedures by which a State guarantees judicial review of state \nadministrative procedures. The determination made by the State under \nthis conference report shall be subject to the existing State laws \nwhich may, or may not, allow for judicial review of administrative \ndecision making. Furthermore, this conference report is not intended to \nin any way limit or prohibit a state from creating, if they do not \nalready have one,\n\n[[Page S10512]]\n\na provision to allow state courts to review the administrative \ndecisions made in accordance with this bill.\n  Most importantly, this conference report preserves and protects \nexisting voting rights laws, which provide for enforcement by private \nindividuals who have either been denied the right to vote or had that \nright infringed. The conference report is designed to protect the \nenforcement provisions of many laws, including the Voting Rights Act \nand the National Voter Registration Act. Therefore, nothing in this \nlegislation limits the enforcement measures or avenues of redress \navailable to persons under those critical civil rights laws enumerated \nin Section 906 of Title IX of this Act.\n  While I would have preferred that we extend the private right of \naction afforded private parties under the NVRA, the House simply would \nnot entertain such an enforcement provisions. Nor would they accept \nFederal judicial review of any adverse decision by a State \nadministrative body. However, the state-based administrative procedure \nmust meet basic due process requirements, including a hearing on the \nrecord if the aggrieved individual so chooses.\n  It is important to note that this state-based administrative \nproceeding is in addition to any other rights the aggrieved has and is \nlimited only to the adjudication of violations of the requirements \nunder Title III of this Act. This enforcement scheme in no ways \nreplaces or alters the adjudication or enforcement provisions of any \nother civil rights or voting rights law.\n  As with all provisions of this legislation, the proof is in the \nimplementation of these requirements by the States. But nothing in this \nconference report requires States or localities to change any voter \neligibility requirements nor does this Act in any way infringe upon the \nsole authority of State and local election officials to determine who \nis a duly registered voter. It will require diligence and education of \nState and local election officials to ensure that these provisions do \nnot serve to disenfranchise voters undermine the purposes of this Act: \nto make it easier to vote, but harder to defraud the system.\n  As is the case with any historic legislation that goes to the core of \nour democracy, a number of organizations participated in this effort. \nYesterday, I recognized the efforts of over 60 staff members who \nparticipated in this effort. As is often the case when trying to \ndevelop a comprehensive list, there is a danger that someone's name \nwill be inadvertently omitted. Unfortunately, that did occur and I \nwould be remiss in not recognizing the significant efforts of Stuart \nGottlieb of my staff. In addition to staff, I want to list the numerous \norganizations that have assisted in the development of this \nlegislation. While not every organization supported every provision in \nthis measure, each organization provided us with thoughtful input and \nsuggestions and were of considerable help in the formation of this \nlegislation over. The list of organizations that have provided \ninvaluable assistance to this effort over the last 23 months is almost \ntoo lengthy to include here. But it is important to note the breadth \nand depth of the input that went into crafting this historic \nlegislation. At the risk of again inadvertently leaving someone out, I \nwant to recognize and thank the following organizations which have \nprovided their expertise to this effort:\n\n       American Association for People With Disabilities.\n       American Association of Retired Persons (AARP).\n       American Civil Liberties Union.\n       American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n     Employees.\n       American Foundation for the Blind.\n       American Institute of Graphic Arts.\n       Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n       Brennan Center for Justice.\n       Center for Constitutional Rights.\n       Common Cause.\n       Commission on Civil Rights.\n       Caltech-MIT Voting Technology Project.\n       Constitution Project.\n       Disability Rights Education Defense Fund, Inc.\n       Election Center.\n       International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n     Agricultural Implement Workers of America.\n       Judge David L.

It is an historic bill. It is \nlandmark legislation. Members of the House of Representatives referred \nto this legislation last week as the first civil rights bill of the \n21st century. It is worthy of such a title and I am honored to have \nbeen able to be a part of the effort to bring this important \nlegislation to pass. In the view of this Senator, at the end of this \nhistoric process, the Congress will have made a lasting contribution to \nthe continued health and stability of this democracy for the people, by \nthe people and of the people. I urge my colleagues to vote for the \nconference report.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a series of editorials from Greensboro, \nas well as from Sarasota, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, \nHartford Courant, New Haven Register, and others be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Hartford Courant, Oct. 16, 2002]\n\n                        Score One for Sen. Dodd\n\n       Congress' accomplishments have been few and far between \n     over the past year. But count as one of them the imminent \n     passage of bipartisan election reform legislation that chief \n     sponsor Sen. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut calls ``the \n     first civil rights act of the 21st century.''\n       Mr. Dodd is proud of this measure, and rightly so.\n       It addresses many of the procedural and technological flaws \n     that cast a cloud over the 2000 presidential election in \n     Florida and other states. Badly designed ballots that \n     confused voters, punch-card ballots that were difficult to \n     count, eligible voters who were turned away from the polls \n     and other problems disenfranchised many voters in Florida and \n     elsewhere.\n       Congress promised to act quickly to address the \n     irregularities, but Senate and House versions ran aground in \n     the conference committee for months.\n       But earlier this month, after intense negotiations between \n     House and Senate conferees of both parties, Mr. Dodd \n     announced agreement on a bill that is expected to pass and be \n     signed by President Bush, Senate action is scheduled today. \n     Here, in part, is what the legislation will do:\n       The federal government is authorized to spend $3.8 billion \n     over the next three years to help states replace and renovate \n     voting equipment, train poll workers, educate voters, upgrade \n     voter lists and make polling places more accessible to the \n     disabled. Connecticut will be able to tap some of that money, \n     perhaps to complete its statewide voter registration list and \n     to buy new equipment if state officials decide to replace the \n     ancient mechanical voting machines.\n       A voter who does not appear on a registration list cannot \n     be turned away from the polls, but must be allowed to cast a \n     provisional ballot. The ballot would be counted if election \n     officials later confirmed that the voter was eligible.\n       Voters must be given a chance to correct any errors on \n     their ballots before they are finally cast.\n       States will be required to develop uniform standards for \n     counting ballots so that procedures don't vary from county to \n     county or precinct to precinct.\n       Anyone registering to vote after January 2004 must provide \n     a driver's license number or the last four digits of his or \n     her Social Security number for verification.\n       Some Democrats were uncomfortable with the identification \n     requirements, saying they would discourage first-time voters, \n     the poor and immigrants. Requiring ID's to cut down\n\n[[Page S10513]]\n\n     on fraud is sensible, however. Some Republicans were opposed \n     to Washington interfering in local elections. But clearly, \n     minimum statewide standards are needed. This is an acceptable \n     compromise.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 10, 2002]\n\n                      Fixing Democracy's Machinery\n\n       As recently as a month ago, hope of fixing serious flaws in \n     the nation's creaky voting system appeared doomed on Capitol \n     Hill. House and Senate negotiators, stalled over some \n     seemingly modest sticking points, appeared to have lost their \n     stamina for repairing glitches that have kept thousands of \n     Americans from exercising their right to participate in the \n     political process. Election reform was poised to become one \n     more casualty of the partisan gridlock that has stymied this \n     Congress for much of the year. But last month's chaotic \n     Florida primary was a bracing reminder that the nation's \n     damaged election system poses a continuing threat to our form \n     of democracy. It was, fortunately, the spark that ignited \n     renewed fervor for election reform and the event that \n     galvanized congressional negotiators to produce a compromise \n     bill the president has said he will sign.\n       If the bill is enacted this week, as House and Senate \n     leaders anticipate, the 2004 presidential election could be a \n     far cry from the 2000 Florida debacle. The days of antiquated \n     punch-card voting machines, voter registration roll confusion \n     and botched elections may be numbered. The bill adopted by \n     the House and Senate negotiators would, for the first time, \n     impose minimum federal standards meant to guarantee the basic \n     quality of elections; allow voters to check their ballots and \n     correct errors; improve polling place access for the \n     disabled; discourage fraud by requiring new voters to provide \n     a driver's license number or the last four digits of their \n     Social Security number and, if they apply by mail, a current \n     photo ID card or utility bill; and require states to have a \n     computerized, statewide voter registration database to \n     prevent a person from voting in multiple jurisdictions. To \n     help states upgrade their voting machinery and train poll \n     workers, the bill calls for $3.9 billion in federal money \n     over three years--$1 billion of which congressional leaders \n     believe can be appropriated during the current fiscal year to \n     jump-start the reform effort.\n       While the election reform bill is every bill the \n     ``historic'' federal response to Election Day flaws that \n     sponsors claim it to be, it would not supplant the functions \n     of state and local election officials. Their roles would \n     remain essential. The legislation would, however, \n     substantially fund the new requirements imposed on the \n     states, with the federal government shouldering 95 percent of \n     the costs. That the final measure has drawn bipartisan \n     congressional backing is testimony to the broad support \n     across the nation for revamping America's election system.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 8, 2002]\n\n                       Upgrading the Way We Vote\n\n       Congress now seems on the verge, at long last, of passing \n     meaningful legislation to improve the reliability of American \n     elections.\n       The House and Senate had earlier passed bills addressing \n     the flaws in voting equipment and procedures that were so \n     manifest in the 2000 presidential vote. The sense of urgency, \n     however, seemed to erode as negotiators sought to reconcile \n     the two measures. Democrats had second thoughts about signing \n     on to anti-fraud provisions, while Republicans had qualms \n     about expanding the federal government's role in running \n     elections. Then last month, Florida's chaotic Congressional \n     primaries provided a fresh reminder of the price of inaction. \n     Last week the conferees struck a deal that the full Congress \n     is expected to approve within days and that President Bush is \n     expected to sign into law. The legislation calls for a big \n     infusion of federal resources into the administration of \n     elections--$3.9 billion over three years. Until Congress \n     actually appropriates the money, however, this amounts to \n     little more than a promise--one on which Mr. Bush and the \n     Congressional leadership are obliged to deliver.\n       The funds will enable states to upgrade their equipment, \n     train poll workers and otherwise improve how elections are \n     administered. The legislation also imposes federal standards, \n     starting in 2004. States must offer ``provisional balloting'' \n     for voters whose eligibility is questioned at the polls, and \n     a means of allowing voters who have made mistakes in casting \n     their ballots a chance to rectify them. States must also \n     ensure access to disabled voters, establish uniform vote-\n     counting standards and create computerized registration \n     lists.\n       The legislation requires first-time voters who register by \n     mail to verify their identity when they vote. Some argue that \n     this imposes too onerous a burden on minority voters. We \n     disagree, although the Justice Department will have to be \n     vigilant to ensure that this anti-fraud provision is not \n     abused. The final draft of the legislation should also spell \n     out that this provision will not take effect until the full \n     $3.9 billion is appropriated.\n       More might have been done to nationalize election \n     procedures, but in the context of America's federalism, this \n     legislation is a sound accomplishment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 7, 2002]\n\n                         Cleaning Up Elections\n\n       One of the most underreported stories in recent American \n     politics has been the growth in election fraud. We'd even say \n     that the politicians have been far ahead of the press corps \n     on this problem, perhaps because their futures depend on \n     honest vote counting.\n       Two useful cases in point are now coming out of Washington, \n     of all unlikely places. One is the election reform bill that \n     finally looks ready to emerge from House-Senate conference. \n     The other is Attorney General John Ashcroft's effort this \n     week to mobilize his department to counter fraud from now \n     through this Election Day of November 5.\n       Mr. Ashcroft has summoned assistant U.S. attorneys from \n     around the country to a day-long seminar tomorrow to focus on \n     elections crimes. There are plenty of anti-vote fraud laws on \n     the books, but rarely if ever are allegations of fraud \n     investigated, much less prosecuted. Mr. Ashcroft has invited \n     three assistant U.S. attorneys with experience in election \n     crimes--from the ripe climates of Kentucky, Alabama and New \n     York--to share their lessons and case studies.\n       The Chihuahuas of the Beltway press corps will be inclined \n     to treat this as little more than political public relations. \n     But that's why they miss so many stories, including the \n     outbreak of voting fraud in places like Philadelphia, San \n     Francisco and St. Louis. In the latter, the dead and pets \n     cast ballots in 2000; only last year the voter rolls in St. \n     Louis included 13,000 more names than the U.S. Census lists \n     as the total number of adults over age 18. In New York City \n     earlier this year, the name of a candidate for lieutenant \n     governor was discovered to have voted twice in a previous \n     election. He dropped out after the New York Post broke the \n     story.\n       It's helpful for Mr. Ashcroft to draw public attention to \n     this before Election Day, both to mobilize his own department \n     and perhaps to deter those looking to commit fraud. He's \n     asking each of his U.S. Attorneys to meet with state election \n     and law enforcement officials in the next month, says a \n     recent internal memo, to find ways to ``work together to \n     deter electoral corruption and bring violators to justice.''\n       The election reform bill compromise also includes much-\n     needed attention to ballot integrity. The heart of the bill \n     is of course aimed at avoiding another Florida butterfly-\n     ballot fiasco, by sending $3.9 billion to the states to \n     upgrade their voting equipment and train poll workers, as if \n     the job were all that difficult.\n       But the best provisions are those aimed at cleaning up \n     voter lists. Beginning this January 1, new voters who \n     register by mail will have to provide a photo ID or another \n     document, such as a utility bill, that shows a name and \n     address. States will also have to maintain a statewide voter \n     registration list. And voters who do not appear on a \n     registration list will be able to cast a provisional ballot, \n     to be counted only if its data can be later verified.\n       Our own view is that if a citizen is too lazy to register \n     before an election, he's disqualified himself from voting. \n     But these reforms will at least address some of the problems \n     created by the disastrous ``motor voter law'' of 1994 that \n     was supposed to increase voter turnout; instead it created \n     many more opportunities for cheating.\n       The people who pushed motor voter are also the same folks \n     now raising public doubts about the anti-fraud provisions of \n     this election reform. They are liberal lobbies who like to \n     shout about the ``possible disenfranchisement of voters,'' as \n     Kay Maxwell of the increasingly ideological League of Women \n     Voters put it to the Los Angeles Times. This is a subtle \n     race-card play, suggesting that the U.S. in 2002 resembles \n     Birmingham, Alabama circa 1956.\n       Even in the contested Florida election of 2000, the black \n     share of the total vote was a record high, which is hard to \n     square with allegations of voter intimidation. Connecticut \n     Senator Chris Dodd and other Democrats deserve credit for \n     overruling their staffs and the liberal lobbies to cut a \n     reform deal with Republicans.\n       With American politics now closely divided, many elections \n     are bound to be close and the temptation on both sides will \n     be to shout fraud whenever they lose. That's all the more \n     reason to attempt to deter fraud before Election Day.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From Newsday, Oct. 8, 2002]\n\n          Enact Balloting Reforms But Only If Money's Attached\n\n       In resuscitating a bill to reform the nation's voting \n     procedures, House and Senate negotiators have crafted a solid \n     approach to reduce the likelihood of future voting fiascoes \n     like those that roiled the 2000 presidential election, whose \n     results were unclear for more than a month.\n       Congress dawdled too long for its reform to have any impact \n     Nov. 5. But the next presidential race is just two years \n     away, so lawmakers should pass the bill--but only if the \n     money to fund it is assured. The bill sets minimum federal \n     standards for voting, including error rates, and authorizes \n     $3.9 billion to help states cover the cost of compliance. \n     Without that money, reform would be a sham; change would come \n     slowly, if at all.\n       That would be a shame as the bill strikes a pretty good \n     balance between autonomy and accountability. Washington would \n     monitor performance and offer guidance on equipment \n     procedural changes, but its recommendations would not have \n     the force of law. State and local officials would have wide \n     discretion on how to meet the standards, for instance, in \n     choosing types of voting machines. The Justice Department \n     could\n\n[[Page S10514]]\n\n     sue to enforce the new standards. But election reform \n     wouldn't be micromanaged from Washington.\n       Election-reform bills passed the House and Senate months \n     ago, but the effort to reconcile the two versions ran \n     aground. Republicans sought safeguards against fraud; \n     Democrats wanted to make sure that new identification \n     requirements would not disenfranchise voters.\n       Under the current agreement, people registering to vote \n     would have to provide a driver's license number or Social \n     Security number. First-time voters who register by mail would \n     have to present one of those documents to poll workers before \n     casting their ballots.\n       Civil rights advocates worry that poor or minority voters \n     would be deterred by those requirements and by poll workers \n     who might not apply them fairly and consistently. Those \n     concerns are important and should be closely monitored. But \n     they should not derail reform.\n       Voting is too fundamental to democracy for the nation not \n     to get it right.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Oct. 10, 2002]\n\nVoting for Progress: Congressional Negotiators Agree on Election Reform\n\n       If the 2000 presidential election in Florida weren't enough \n     of a debacle, the problems experienced in the same state's \n     primary election last month made the point anew:\n       If American democracy is to retain any respect, Congress \n     had better help the states improve the way they hold \n     elections. After months of wrangling, Congress has risen to \n     the challenge, although controversy may still sink the \n     effort.\n       After House and Senate negotiators reached agreement last \n     week, Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, \n     correctly observed that it ``will help America move beyond \n     the days of hanging chads, butterfly ballots and illegal \n     purges of qualified voters.'' Some $3.9 billion in federal \n     money would be provided to the states over three years for \n     upgrading voting equipment, training poll workers and setting \n     up a computerized voter database.\n       But so much for the mechanics of voting, the principal \n     concern of Democrats. What about the Republican fear of voter \n     fraud? This might be called the historic Tammany Hall \n     problem, immortalized by the line ``Vote early and often.''\n       The Republicans had a point, whatever their political \n     motives. Just as it is important to make sure votes are \n     counted properly, it is also crucial to the integrity of the \n     system to make sure that those voting are entitled to do so.\n       But civil rights groups and the League of Women Voters of \n     America object to any provision that would require checking \n     the IDs of voters; they say such requirements would unfairly \n     discourage minorities and elderly people from voting. It is \n     an understandable concern, but it has been overblown.\n       The compromise legislation is hardly onerous. Beginning \n     Jan. 1, new voters who registered by mail would be required \n     to provide a current photo ID or another document such as a \n     utility bill with name and address. Eventually, voters would \n     have to supply part of a driver's license number or Social \n     Security number (or be assigned a number if they didn't have \n     one). If questions arose about a person's eligibility to \n     vote, he or she would receive a provisional ballot that would \n     be counted if the registration were later verified.\n       In a sign that the agreement is not as bad as advertised, \n     the Congressional Black Caucus endorsed it. Former presidents \n     Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, who are honorary co-chairs of \n     the National Commission on Federal Election Reform, said the \n     bill ``represents a delicate balance of shared \n     responsibilities between levels of government.'' They're \n     right--and the House and Senate should approve what their \n     negotiators have worked out.\n       There is a local footnote to the federal debate: When the \n     Post-Gazette suggested recently that some sort of voter ID \n     was not a bad idea for Pennsylvania, a couple of Democratic \n     legislators objected strongly. As this development in \n     Washington illustrates, once again the commonwealth is behind \n     the curve.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Oct. 15, 2002]\n\n                            Getting Over It\n\n       Angry and embarrassed over the election debacle of 2000, \n     the newly chosen Congress vowed to make reforming the \n     antiquated, 50-state patchwork system its first order of \n     business. Now, it appears the election reform bill will be \n     among the last items enacted as the 107th Congress stumbles \n     to a messy close.\n       A final vote of the Senate tomorrow and the expected \n     signature of President Bush will establish federal standards \n     intended to ensure that eligible voters will never again be \n     turned away from the polls or have their votes voided because \n     of confusing ballots. The reforms come too late to apply to \n     this year's congressional elections, and may not have been \n     approved at all but for the botched Florida primary last \n     month that kick-started a stalled legislative drive.\n       Much of the delay centered on a dispute over a requirement \n     that first-time voters who register by mail show one of \n     several forms of identification at the polls. Republican \n     senators, in particular, insisted on an ID requirement to \n     fight voter fraud.\n       Civil rights groups complained such a requirement would \n     impose a barrier to voting for low-income Americans who don't \n     have drivers licenses or other common forms of \n     identification. At a minimum, they argued, the request for \n     such papers would be used as a way to harass or discourage \n     voters.\n       Rep. Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, a leading Democratic \n     negotiator on the bill, won House approval for a version of \n     the measure without an ID requirement. But he faced a Senate \n     that had voted 99-1 to include one. He and the vast majority \n     of his colleagues, including the Congressional Black Caucus, \n     decided to accept the provision rather than let the bill die.\n       That was the right choice. The legislation directs $3.9 \n     billion in aid to the states to replace outdated punch-card \n     and lever voting machines and to train poll workers. Among \n     its innovative features is a $5 million program to recruit \n     college students to serve as poll workers and take over tasks \n     now often being performed by elderly party volunteers.\n       Safeguards were also included: Voters without \n     identification or whose eligibility is otherwise challenged \n     would be allowed to cast provisional ballots so that no one \n     who turns up at the polls is turned away.\n       The most scandalous aspect of our voting process is neither \n     fraud nor errors but the failure of half or more of all \n     eligible voters to even bother to cast ballots.\n       Congress cannot mandate civic enthusiasm. But it can help \n     increase confidence in the election process by doing away \n     with a system that routinely lets thousands of votes from \n     those who do bother to show up go uncounted.\n       Activists in both parties as well as voter and civil rights \n     advocates should work together to implement the new \n     procedures as quickly as possible and correct any flaws.\n       It is long past time to get over it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the News and Record, Oct. 12, 2002]\n\n           Nearly Two Years Later, Voting System Is Reformed\n\n       Until last week, reform of the nation's voting process was \n     as dead as an uncounted hanging chad. National outrage over \n     Florida's voting debacle in the 2000 presidential election \n     had been high-pitched, but Congress lost interest. Florida's \n     botched primary last month--equipment failure, human error--\n     put reform back on the radar screen. Congress passed \n     bipartisan legislation last week that authorizes $3.9 billion \n     over the next three years to help states buy new voting \n     equipment, computerize registered voter lists and train poll \n     workers.\n       The bill also requires new voters who register by mail to \n     provide personal identification, such as a driver's license \n     or Social Security number, when they arrive at the polls. The \n     proviso prevents election fraud.\n       The bill also requires ``provisional voting,'' meaning a \n     voter who goes to the polls and whose registration cannot be \n     validated is allowed to vote. If election officials later \n     verify the voter's registration, the vote counts. North \n     Carolina commendably adopted ``provisional voting'' years \n     ago.\n       The legislation carefully pays constitutional obeisance to \n     states' rights. States, not the federal government, will \n     determine what constitutes a legal vote. That raises the \n     specter of Florida's recount of hanging chads. Yet Florida, \n     and other states, will supposedly have improved voting \n     machines and better trained poll workers before the 2004 \n     presidential election when the reforms become operative.\n       The bill enjoys bipartisan support but not without prior \n     hassles. Republicans feared voter fraud and insisted on \n     identification for new voters who register by mail. Fair \n     enough. Democrats sought to expand the franchise with \n     ``provisional voting'' and registering by mail. They, too, \n     got their wish.\n       President Bush, whose brother, Jeb, is governor of Florida \n     and has been tarnished by his state's flawed voting system, \n     is eager to avoid a messy repeat performance. The president \n     is expected to sign the authorization bill and, ultimately, \n     the appropriations bill that funds it.\n       It has taken a dawdling Congress two years after the \n     embarrassing 2000 presidential election to adopt voting \n     reforms. If it had failed to do so, voters' rights would have \n     been egregiously undermined.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, Oct. 12, 2002]\n\n Federal Election Reform, Finally; Florida's Problems Helped Congress \n                          Resolve Differences\n\n       Federal election reform appears to be a reality at last. \n     The nation can thank South Florida, whose recently bungled \n     primary inspired Congress to resolve stubborn differences \n     over a voting bill and push it toward final passage.\n       The federal breakthrough comes too late for Florida, but \n     it's welcome nonetheless. Once it gains expected final \n     approval, the measure will address the kind of fundamental \n     election problems that savaged the 2000 presidential contest \n     and--despite state reforms enacted in 2001--bit Florida again \n     in the September primary. That federal reform took so long is \n     really a shame--but then, so are botched elections. The Bush/\n     Gore battle of 2000 taught Americans how frustrating the act \n     of voting can be when rules vary from state to state, county \n     to county and chad to chad.\n       As time passed, however, Congress' zeal to reform the mess \n     devolved into partisan quibbling. Though both the House and \n     Senate\n\n[[Page S10515]]\n\n     passed election bills, the chambers lacked the resolve to \n     work out their differences; the bills lay comatose for months \n     and by summer were presumed dead.\n       Then came the September primary: Florida's newfangled \n     machines and revised procedures brought on precisely what \n     they were designed to avoid--angry voters, disputed ballot \n     and official confusion.\n       Congress took note, resuscitated the election bills and \n     finally worked out a deal. It was announced last Friday in a \n     ceremony long on self-congratulation and short on details. \n     Here are some of the key points:\n       The legislation would authorize nearly $4 billion to help \n     states modernize voting machines, educate voters, train poll \n     workers and improve the administration of elections. \n     (Separate appropriations bills are needed to actually come up \n     with the cash.)\n       It would set more uniform election standards in machines, \n     counting, and other related procedures, and set up a \n     commission to lead this effort.\n       It would modernize the lists of registered voters; require \n     voters to have the opportunity to correct their ballots if \n     they err; and allow provisional votes for people whose \n     eligibility is questioned.\n       It would require certain anti-fraud measures; encourage \n     better access for overseas and military voters; and contain \n     criminal penalties for people who provide false information \n     in registering or voting. People who conspire to deprive \n     voters of fair elections also would face criminal sanctions.\n       Florida already has initiated many of these reforms, but \n     the troubled September primary proved that implementation \n     requires lots of time and training. Congress should bear this \n     in mind and funds its legislation accordingly, lest Florida-\n     style embarrassments pop up nationwide.\n       Some civil rights groups oppose certain identification \n     requirements in the legislation, but these measures are \n     needed to discourage fraud--a crime that injures every \n     voter's right to be counted.\n       Uniformity in election procedures, and money to achieve it, \n     are the key benefits of the federal legislation. Without \n     consistency from state to state and precinct to precinct, \n     it's difficult to guarantee that voters receive equal \n     protection--the concept on which the Supreme Court leaned for \n     its controversial ruling deciding the 2000 standoff.\n       As the court wrote with notable understatement, ``The \n     problem of equal protection in election processes generally \n     presents many complexities.''\n       This legislation could simplify many of those complexities. \n     It deserves final approval and full funding. Now.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues how much I appreciate \ntheir patience on this. This has been a very long and arduous effort to \nget to this point. This is not a perfect piece of legislation, but I \nthink it advances considerably the role the United States ought to be \nplaying as a Federal Government in the conduct of elections. The world \nlooks and watches us. We are not shy about lecturing people about \ndemocracy. When we have error rates as we do and millions of people \nturned away at the polls, it is long overdue that we correct the \nsystem. This bill goes a long way in doing that. It is a proud day. It \nought to be for all of us here who responded to the challenge that was \nasked of us as a result of the elections of 2000.\n  I commend my colleagues in the other body, and the leadership there \nand the leadership here, for allowing us to reach this point.\n  I urge the adoption of this conference report.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards).

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their overwhelming \nsupport for this legislation. As I said earlier, it has been a long \njourney to bring us to this juncture.\n  We never claimed perfection in this bill. It is a compromise, \nobviously. We think it advances the cause of enfranchising people. I \nmentioned earlier people who talked about dogs who may have voted. I \nfind a certain amount of humor in that and a degree of seriousness, if \nthat is the case. When we end up with 4 million to 6 million human \nbeings who could not vote, I hope we will spend a lot of time talking \nabout this legislation, making sure people show up to vote who are \nalive and well.\n  I thank my colleagues for their backing of this legislation. I look \nforward to, I hope, a Presidential signature on this legislation, and \nthen doing the hard work of implementing the provisions of this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator, I can remember his managing the bill. \nIt was very tough. He did a wonderful job of moving this most \ncontentious legislation through the Senate.\n  He was able to develop bipartisan support for it in committee and on \nthe floor. There were many who felt we could never get this bill out of \nconference, but the Senator from Connecticut was persistent, \nunyielding, and we now have a bill.\n  I hope people understand what a sea change this is going to be for \nvoting in America. In Nevada, we need this legislation. The Secretary \nof State--who, by the way, is a Republican--was one of the first \nsupporters of this legislation and developed a friendship with the \nSenator from Connecticut as a result of this legislation. It is that \nway all over the country. I only hope in the months and years to come, \nwe understand how important this is and put our money where our mouths \nare. We have now authorized this most important legislation and have to \nfund it.\n  This is groundbreaking, but I repeat, we have to put our money where \nour mouth is so we can implement this legislation. I hope we do that. \nIf we do that, it is going to make elections fair, and it will make \npeople feel good about their votes counting.\n\n[[Page S10516]]\n\n  None of this would have happened but for the doggedness of the \nSenator from Connecticut. He simply would not give up when many said it \ncould not be done.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I noted earlier the support of House Members \nwho did a tremendous job in getting a bill done. I talked about Bob Ney \nand Steny Hoyer. Obviously, bills do not get done just because they get \ndone in the Senate. They can only finally get to the President's desk \nif the other body also acts, and without the leadership of Bob Ney of \nOhio and Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the Chair and ranking Members of the \nHouse Administration Committee, we never would have had a negotiation \nto produce this product.\n  So I want to extend my appreciation to them and to John Conyers, who \nwas my coarchitect of this bill going back now a year and a half ago, \nwho wanted to be available in Washington this morning, but he got \ndelayed on a flight and could not be present for this final vote. When \nI first announced this bill, I stood in the room with two people. One \nwas John Sweeney of the AFL-CIO. The other one was John Conyers, the \ndean of the Congressional Black Caucus in the House. John Conyers was a \ntremendous supporter of this effort all the way through. I am very \ngrateful to him, again grateful to Steny Hoyer, Bob Ney, and a whole \nhost of people who made this possible: The NAACP, the AFL-CIO, \ndisability groups across the country, the National Association of \nSecretaries of State. There is a long list of organizations that \nrallied behind this effort, and without their support we would not have \nbeen able to arrive at this moment.\n  So I thank all of those who were involved in this. I thank my \ncolleague from Nevada for his very kind and generous comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10516-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nOctober 9, 2002.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes for debate, 5 minutes each for the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. \nInouye, and the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, and the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today with my \ncochairman Senator Stevens to present our recommendations to the Senate \non the conference report for H.R. 5010, the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2003.\n  The conference agreement represents a compromise reached after a \nmonth-long series of discussions by the managers.\n  Our recommendations bring the total in the bill to $355.1 billion, \n$298 million below the Senate passed bill and $395 million above the \nHouse level.\n  This conference agreement represents a good faith effort to balance \nthe priorities of the House and Senate in meeting our National Security \nrequirements. I am confident it achieves that objective.\n  Our time is brief today, so I will not detail all of the items in \nthis measure. But I want to make three points.\n  First, this bill is likely to be one of the two appropriations bills \nto be completed before the election. As such, there were many items \nthat members sought to have included in this conference report. I am \nhappy to report to the Senate that no extraneous matters were included \nby the conferees. This is a very clean bill.\n  Second, last week the Senate passed a resolution authorizing the use \nof force against Iraq. It is imperative we pass this bill before we \nrecess to ensure our forces have the support they require to carry out \nwhatever missions our Nation asks them.\n  Third, I commend my co chairman, Senator Stevens, for his work on \nthis bill. He was instrumental in defending many of the priorities of \nthe Senate, including our efforts to support strong financial \nmanagement in DoD: Fully funding the C-17 program and paying off our \nunfunded liability on shipbuilding programs.\n  As always, my friend was assisted in this by his very capable staff \nled by Steve Cortese, and including Sid Ashworth, Kraig Siracuse, \nJennifer Chartrand, Alicia Farrell, and Nicole Royal. I also want to \nnote the fine work of my staff: Charlie Houy, David Morrison, Susan \nHogan, Mazie Mattson, Tom Hawkins, Bob Henke, Leslie Kalan, Menda Fife, \nand Betsy Schmid.\n  Mr. President, finally I commend the House for their courtesy and \ncooperation. Chairman Lewis and Representative Murtha could not have \nbeen more gracious. While there were many issues upon which we \ndiffered, we were able to resolve those in a friendly and constructive \nfashion.\n  I note as well the great work of their fine staff led by Kevin Roper \nand Greg Dahlberg, and including:\n  Betsy Phillips, Doug Gregory, Alicia Jones, Greg Walters, Paul Juola, \nSteve Nixon, David Norquist, Greg Lankler, Clelia Alvarado, Paul Terry, \nSarah Young, Sherry Young, Chris Mallard, David Killian and Bill \nGnacek.\n  Mr. President this is a good bill, it is exactly what our armed \nforces need, and I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here with my \ndistinguished colleague from Hawaii to offer this bill. It is the \nlargest Defense bill in history. It is a bill that merits the support \nof every Member of the Senate.\n  I do congratulate Senator Inouye for his leadership and for his hard \nwork and cooperation with the Members of the House, whom he has named, \nwith whom we have worked on this bill.\n  We have had different views on this bill, but we have proceeded \nwithout rancor and I think worked out a compromise that is satisfactory \nto the administration, particularly the Department of Defense and the \nPresident. I believe it is a balanced and fair bill.\n  There were nearly $18 billion in differences between the House and \nSenate bills. All of these have been reconciled within the limits of \ndiscretion and with good will. I think these compromises should receive \noverwhelming support from the Department because they actually make the \nbill much more functional, more workable. It is the kind of bill that \nwe should have in the times we are in now, where we are close to a very \ndifficult problem as far as Iraq is concerned.\n  This bill fully funds all military requirements for the armed \nservices. It contains a 4.1-percent pay increase and lifetime health \ncare benefits for the military retirees.\n  It further reduces the out-of-pocket costs for some of the military \nfamilies who do not have the benefit of on-base housing.\n  We really have tried to strike a balance between near-term readiness \nand the investments we must make for the future, as far as our defense \nestablishment is concerned.\n  This bill mandates full funding for six Stryker brigades to transform \nour ground combat forces and adds funds for future combat systems.\n  For the Navy, funding the CVN-X and the DD-X and the littoral combat \nship and the Virginia class submarine,\n\n[[Page S10517]]\n\nall accelerate the introduction of a completely new 21st century \ntechnology for the Navy. The Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force all \nawait deployment of the Joint Strike Fighter, and so do we. The bill \nsustains the deployment of that new aircraft and adds funds for two new \nengine options. The Air Force receives funds to expand the effort for \nthe production of the F-22, the C-17, and hopefully for the replacement \nof our aging fleet of air refueling tankers.\n  One of the difficult dreams I have is a flight of our fighters coming \nback to meet a tanker and finding it is not there. We have to work on \nthis and work very hard to make sure we have the tanker capacity \nbecause our air power depends entirely upon our tanker capability. \nThese commitments will deliver the capabilities we must have for the \nfiscal years ahead of us.\n  These systems not only contribute to the war against terrorism today, \nbut they will fund replacement of equipment rapidly deteriorating. They \nmust be functional for us in combat in the global war on terrorism. It \nis consistent with the President's budget request. This bill in \nparticular funds a missile defense system at the President's request.\n  I hope all Members will realize, ranging from ground- and sea-based \nmissiles to airborne lasers, we are going to have layers of defense \nthat will protect our troops abroad and at sea, and our people here at \nhome. That missile defense system must go forward.\n  Again, I commend my good friend, the chairman of the committee. It is \na pleasure to work with him and the chairman of our full committee, \nSenator Byrd, in their efforts to move this bill forward. We have urged \nthat the Defense bill be first, and the Defense bill is first. It \nindicates the priority that the whole national Federal Government \nplaces upon defense. I believe this conference report, as I said, \nmerits the support of every Senator.\n  I also send my personal appreciation to the chairman of the House \nsubcommittee, Congressman Jerry Lewis, and the ranking member of the \nHouse subcommittee, Congressman Jack Murtha. They have been very \ngracious people to work with under difficult circumstances.\n  I also ask that the Senate commend the staffs of both the majority \nand minority in the Senate and the majority and the minority in the \nHouse. These people have worked behind the scenes, around the clock, \nsometimes through weekends, to eliminate the difficult problems that \nhave come up in this bill. As I said, $18 billion of difference and \nthere is not an argument between us in terms of this bill. But led by \nCharlie Houy here on the majority side and Steve Cortese, who is by my \nside now, our staffs have worked, I think, just without any rancor at \nall.\n  I do want to say at last, though, Kevin Roper and Greg Dahlberg, as \nSenator Inouye mentioned, made a tremendous contribution to this work \nin the House.\n  I urge approval of this conference report.\n\n\n     JOINT COMPUTER AIDED ACQUISITION AND LOGISTICS SUPPORT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Will my friend, the Senator from Hawaii, who ably serves as \nthe chairman of the subcommittee on Defense, yield for a colloquy?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am pleased to yield to the Chairman of the Committee on \nappropriations, the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is my understanding correct that the FY 2003 Defense \nAppropriations Bill now before the Senate contains an increase of $21.5 \nmillion above the President's budget request for the Joint Computer \nAided Acquisition and Logistics Support, JCALS, program, for a total FY \n2003 program level of $58.9 million?\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chairman for his assurances. If I may inquire \nfurther, it is also my understanding that it is the committee's intent \nthat $21.5 million of the JCALS funds in the Army RTDE account are to \nbe spent exclusively on activities directly related to the JCALS \nTactical Logistics Data Digitization (TLDD) initiative, which operates \nout of Hinton, WV.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator is correct that it is our strong intention \nthat the TLDD initiative be expanded and deployment accelerated by use \nof the $21.5 million of JCALS Army RDTE funds provided in the FY 2003 \nDefense Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chairman. If he would yield for a final \nquestion, am I correct in my understanding that it is the Committee's \nfurther intent that the JCALS Program leverage and expand the \ncapabilities of the Southeast Regional Technical Center now primarily \nlocated in Hinon, WV to provide support and training for the TLDD \ninitiative? This action will address a key recommendation by the \nInstitute for Defense Analysis in a study it prepared last year for the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense to increase training and support for \nthe military services that utilize the JCALS program.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator from West Virginia is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for his clarification and assistance \nwith this most important issue.\n\n\n  APPLICATION OF THE BERRY AMENDMENT TO THE MULTI-YEAR AIRCRAFT LEASE \n                             PILOT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in order to enter into a colloquy \nwith the Senator from Hawaii to seek clarification on the correct \ninterpretation of report language in the conference agreement report \nthat deals with the Berry amendment and the Multi-Year Aircraft Lease \nPilot Program.\n  As I read this language, it appears the report language provides an \nexplanation of Section 308 in the fiscal year 2002 Supplement \nAppropriations bill that permitted the multi-year aircraft lease \nprogram to proceed without meeting the Berry amendment restrictions on \nthe use of foreign sourced specialty metals in the procurement of air \nrefueling tanker replacements. I, and many of my colleagues, are \npleased to see that the report language seems to indicate that this \nsuspension of the Berry amendment is only applicable to this unique \nmulti-year leasing program. I ask the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii, am I correct reading this report language?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, if I may respond to my good friend from \nNevada, he is correct that this report language does state that Section \n308 from the FY 2020 Supplemental Appropriations bill only applies to \nthis specific Multi-year Aircraft Leasing Program and no other \nprocurement or leasing program.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also would like to ask the Senator a \nquestion regarding another aspect of the report language. This language \ndirects the Secretary of the Air Force to conduct a study and report to \nCongress on a comparison of foreign and domestic-sourced specialty \nmetals to be used in this leased fleet of refueling tankers with the \nspecialty metal content of military aircraft that have been procured by \nthe Air Force in the last five years.\n  It appears that this new study by the Air Force is designed to look \nat the specialty metal content on a new ``system-level'' basis rather \nthan on the current aircraft-by-aircraft basis. Therefore, I am \nconcerned that this new ``system-level basis'' study could be the first \nstep in eroding the longstanding practice of determining Berry \namendment compliance under a whole new standard and could, in turn, \nharm our domestic specialty metal industry and its employees. I would \nlike to ask the Senator from Hawaii whether this new Air Force study \nwill be used by the Appropriations Committee to advocate additional \nBerry amendment exemptions for other procurement programs to modify the \noverall content requirements of the Berry amendment for future military \nprocurement programs?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada raises an \nexcellent point. I want to assure him and my colleagues that I strongly \nsupport the provisions of the Berry amendment and I am not interested \nin supporting any legislative action that would harm our nation's \nspecialty metal industry or its employees. The exemption of the Berry \namendment for the Multi-Year Aircraft Leasing Program was a unique \nsituation and I do not believe the multi-year leasing program should be \nthe basis for any modification of the important aircraft-by-aircraft \ncontent requirements inherent in the Berry amendment. I hope this fully \naddresses the gentleman's concerns.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his support of the \nBerry amendment and for his commitment to ensure a viable and healthy \ndomestic specialty metals industry.\n\n[[Page S10518]]\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I am proud today to express my support \nfor the 2003 Defense Appropriations Act. The Conference Report I will \nvote for provides a much-needed boost to our Defense budget, a total of \n$355.1 billion, $21 billion more than was appropriated for this year. \nThis is the largest defense budget in our Nation's history, and it \ncould not come at a more important time.\n  Our military is engaged in a global campaign against terror, and \ncould be preparing for another war soon. It is essential that our \nmilitary remains outfitted with the most advanced equipment to meet \nthreats to our Nation today as well as into the future. But our most \nimportant asset is our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. I am \nproud to support this bill, and its funding for a 4.1 percent increase \nin basic pay for all service members.\n  This bill is good for the military, good for the country, and good \nfor Missouri. In fact, it funds over $293 million for a number of \nMissouri defense projects, many of which will directly stimulate \neconomic development in my State. In particular, the projects funded in \nthis bill, from Boeing F/A-18 aircraft, to new advances in chemical and \nbiological defenses, will support America's war effort against \ninternational terrorism.\n  Missouri's single largest defense contract, the F/A-18 program \nemploys over 4,000 people in the St. Louis area. I am pleased that the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee increased funding for this program \nby $120 million over the Administration's Super Hornet budget proposal.\n  Despite testimony by the Navy's top leaders requesting an increase in \nfunding for this program, the President's original budget proposal \nreduced the number of Super Hornets that the Navy was originally \nscheduled to buy in 2003. Under the existing contract between Boeing \nand the Navy, the Defense Department was scheduled to purchase 48 \naircraft in 2003. However, the President's budget only proposed 44 \naircraft to be purchased in 2003.\n  This continues a downward trend for the F/A-18's budget, which is now \nin its third year of a multi-year contract. Coupled with reductions \nmade in previous years, the President's proposed 2003 budget would mark \na total of 10 aircraft cut in the course of three years. In response, I \nworked to restore funding for aircraft purchases.\n  I was pleased that earlier this year, the Senate passed a bill that \nincluded an additional $240 million for this program, even though the \nHouse did not. While the final conference report did not fund this \nincrease in full, it did provide $120 million more than the original \nproposal submitted to Congress by the Administration.\n  This is an important development, and I pleased to lend my support to \nthis Conference Report today. Today's bill marks Congress's continued \nbacking for not only these critical tactical aircraft but for the \nmilitary's ongoing modernization to transform and meet the challenges \nour country will face in both the near and long term.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise again to address the issue of \nwasteful spending in appropriations measures, in this case, the \nAppropriations Committee Conference Report to accompany H.R. 5010, a \nbill to fund the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2003. This \nlegislation would provide $355.1 billion to the Department of Defense. \nThis year's defense appropriations bill adds 1,760 programs not \nrequested by the President, at a further cost of $7.4 billion with \nquestionable relationships to national defense at a time of scarce \nresources, budget deficits, and underfunded, urgent defense priorities.\n  Just last week the Senate passed the Iraqi War Resolution by a vote \nof 77 to 23, authorizing the President of the United States to commit \nthe United States Armed Forces to achieve a regime change in Iraq. \nAmerica remains at war, a war that continues to unite Americans in \npursuit of a common goal, to defeat international terrorism. All \nAmericans have, and undoubtably in the future will make sacrifices for \nthis war. Many have been deeply affected by it and at times harmed by \ndifficult, related economic circumstances. Our servicemen and women in \nparticular are truly on the front lines in this war, separated from \ntheir families, risking their lives, and working extraordinarily long \nhours under the most difficult conditions to accomplish the ambitious \nbut necessary task their country has set for them.\n  Despite the realities of war, and the serious responsibilities the \nsituation imposes on Congress and the President, the House and Senate \nAppropriations Committees have not seen fit to change in any degree its \nblatant use of defense dollars for projects that may or may not serve \nsome worthy purpose. Furthermore, some of the add-ons clearly impair \nour national defense by depriving legitimate defense needs of adequate \nfunding.\n  Even in the middle of a war against terrorism, a war of monumental \nconsequences that is expected to last for some time, the Appropriations \nCommittees remain intent on ensuring that part of the Department of \nDefense's mission is to dispense corporate welfare. It is a shame that \nat such a critical time, the United States Senate persists in spending \nmoney requested and authorized only for our Armed Forces to satisfy the \nneeds or the desires of interests that are unrelated to defense and \neven, in truth, unconcerned about the true needs of our military.\n  If the war against terrorism is taken to the Iraqi theater there will \nbe bills to pay. White House economist, Lawrence Lindsey, estimates \nthat a full scale mobilization in Iraq could cost as much as $100 to \n$200 billion. A lower estimate reported in the Washington Post puts the \ncost of committing United States forces in Iraq at $30 to $50 billion. \nThis lower estimate assumes, quoting the September 24, 2002 Washington \nPost, a war `` . . . with inept enemy forces, no use of chemical or \nbiological weapons, access to bases and airspace in most Gulf states \nand Turkey, and low casualties on our side.'' It is quite obvious that \nthe costs of the use of force in Iraq will be substantial. With the \npossibility of such a large expenditure in our future how can \nAppropriators spend our precious defense dollars so foolishly?\n  An Investor's Business Daily article published late last year \nentitled At the Trough: Welfare Checks to Big Business Make No Sense, \nstated, ``[a]mong the least justified outlays [in the federal budget] \nis corporate welfare. Budget analyst Stephen Slivinski estimates that \nbusiness subsidies will run $87 billion [in 2001], up a third since \n1997. Although President Bush proposed $12 billion in cuts to corporate \nwelfare [in 2001], Congress has proved resistant. Indeed many post-\nSeptember 11 bailouts have gone to big business. Boeing is one of the \nbiggest beneficiaries. . . . While corporate America gets the profits, \ntaxpayers get the losses. . . . The Constitution authorizes a Congress \nto promote the general welfare, not enrich Boeing and other corporate \nbehemoths. There is no warrant to take from Peter so Paul can pay \nhigher dividends. In the aftermath of September 11, the American people \ncan ill afford budget profligacy in Washington. If Congress is not \nwilling to cut corporate welfare at a time of national crisis, what is \nit willing to cut?''\n  Yet, Congress didn't get the message this year. In the Fiscal Year \n2003 Defense Appropriations conference report that we are considering \ntoday, the Appropriations Committees added nearly $500 million in \naircraft procurement that the Department of Defense did not request. \nThere were funds appropriated for twenty-four types of aircraft; \nunfortunately none of these were identified by the military as \nrequirements. It staggers the mind to think of what programs the \nservices desperately need could have been funded by $500 million.\n  Here is a very short list of just some of the more egregious examples \nof Defense appropriations\n  $12 million for the 21st Century Truck. This program has been around \nfor years and not once has the Department of Defense requested funding \nfor it. While I'm sure we all would love to jump into a truck that \ncould be in a James Bond movie, I'm not sure it is appropriate for the \nDepartment of Defense to pay for it.\n  $3.4 million for the Next Generation Smart Truck. I suppose this is \nwhat we will drive before the 21st Century Truck is ready.\n  $1 million for Canola Oil Fuel Cells. I would think that the only \ncanola oil the Department of Defense should be investing in should be \nused for salad\n\n[[Page S10519]]\n\ndressing for our troops, not inventing batteries.\n  $4.5 million for a Coastal Cancer Research Center. A worthwhile \nexpenditure, but the Defense Appropriations Bill is not the place for \nthese funds to come from.\n  $1 million for Math Teacher Leadership.\n  $3 million in Impact Aid for Children with Disabilities.\n  $19 million for International Sporting Competitions.\n  $7.7 million for the Alaska Wide Mobile Radio Program.\n  $1 million for Animal Modeling Genetics Research.\n  $2.6 million for the Pacific Rim Corrosion Project.\n  $6 million for the Pacific Disaster Center Project.\n  $1 million for the Rural Telemedicine Demonstration Project.\n  These are just a few glaring examples of the more than 1,760 Member \nadditions that leave many people scratching their heads trying to find \nthe link to defense program funding.\n  Here is a very abbreviated list of some of the member additions that, \nwhile at least connected to the Department of Defense, were still not \nrequested in the President's budget nor were they on any of the \nservice's unfunded priority lists. Remember, every one of these \nadditions come at the expense of programs that our services need to \ncarry out their missions. For every dollar spent on these additions, it \nis one taken out of priority programs.\n  $53 million in Distance Learning.\n  $101.3 million in Defense Wide Administration Activities.\n  $44 million for Multi-Purpose Vehicles.\n  $58.5 million for Automated Data Processing Equipment.\n  $30.8 million for Non-System Training Devices.\n  $14 million for Drones and Decoys.\n  $6.7 million in Base Information Infrastructure.\n  $1 million in Polar Fleece Shirts.\n  $5 million for the Institute for Creative Technology.\n  $2 million for the Center for Geo-Sciences.\n  $3 million for the Concepts Experimentation Program.\n  $2 million for the Consortium for Military Personnel Research.\n  I will not list the rest of the additions as that would take hours. A \nlarger list of Defense Appropriations Conference Committee earmarks is \navailable on my website. I find it incredible that we are funding these \nunrequested and unneeded programs when we have more than 500 items that \nthe Department of Defense says they need on their ``Unfunded Priority \nLists''.\n  You will recall that last year, during conference negotiations on the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee inserted into the bill unprecedented \nlanguage to allow the U.S. Air Force to lease 100 Boeing 767 commercial \naircraft and convert them to tankers, and to lease four Boeing 737 \ncommercial aircraft for passenger airlift to be used by congressional \nand Executive Branch officials. Congress did not authorize these \nleasing provisions in the fiscal year 2002 National Defense \nAuthorization Act, and in fact, the Senate Armed Services Committee was \nnot advised of this effort by Air Force Secretary Jim Roche during \nconsideration of that authorization measure.\n  Again this year, without benefit of authorization committee debate or \ninput--the Senate Appropriations Committee has added funding in the \nFiscal Year 2003 Department of Defense Appropriations bill in the \namount of $3 million for the ``Tanker Lease Pilot Program'' for the \nproposed Boeing 767 aerial tanker leasing scheme. Furthermore, \nadditional language in the bill modifies a provision that had been \ncarefully negotiated by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, with \nappropriators last year, and may now permit the Air Force to circumvent \nlaw, OMB and standard leasing arrangements and, with respect to the 100 \nBoeing 767s, will allow the Air Force to defer the termination \nliability costs up-front, unprecedented in leasing arrangements \naccording to leasing experts and certainly against good business \npractices.\n  In multi-year contracts such as leases there is a statuary \nrequirement to obligate money for termination liability payments in the \nfirst year of the contract. The reason is quite simple. If the \ngovernment, the Air Force in this case, cancels the contract then the \nAir Force is required to pay Boeing for breaking the terms of the \ncontract. What would happen if a Boeing 767 tanker was hit by hostile \nfire which caused a catastrophic fire onboard and the Boeing 767 tanker \ncrashed. Under a similar leasing arrangement like the one that the Air \nForce signed with the Boeing Company for Boeing 737 VIP Executive \naircraft, ``loss or destruction of the aircraft constitutes a notice of \ncancellation'' and under the terms of the lease the Air Force would be \nrequired to make a termination liability payment. Not planning for this \nis irresponsible, especially concerning military aircraft which operate \nin harms way with great regularity. This deferment of termination \nliability payment is an unfunded federal liability. This leaves \nCongress with no recourse but to foot the cost of this unfunded \nliability with the Boeing Company and leaves the taxpayer stuck with a \nbig bill without any say in the matter. Boeing gets paid under this \ntermination liability clause, yet the taxpayer is out an aircraft.\n  Particularly disconcerting is a provision that would allow the Air \nForce to fund the Boeing 767 aerial tanker lease from Air Force \nreadiness appropriations rather than the ususal procurement accounts \nalready committed to purchase $72 billion worth of other new weapons \nsystems, aircraft and ships. According to statute, readiness \nappropriations or operations and maintenance accounts, finance the cost \nof operating and maintaining the Armed Forces. Specifically, included \nare the amounts for training and operation costs, pay of civilians, \ncontract services for maintenance of equipment and facilities, fuel, \nsupplies, and repair parts for weapons and equipment. Using critical \nreadiness dollars to pay to lease 100 Boeing 767 tankers, under a new \nstart program, can only be properly referred to as a mistake of great \nproportions that will eventually have great consequences for all of our \nArmed Forces and not just for the Air Force. Since 1999, the defense \nbudgets have made strides to reverse years of under-funding in the \nreadiness accounts, however, I have serious concerns about the future \nstate of preparedness of our units and our men and women in the \nmilitary if we continue to follow the advice of the Secretary of the \nAir Force under some ``rob Peter to pay Paul'' leasing scheme.\n\n  There is yet another egregious legislative provision included in the \nappropriations bill that certainly could be regarded as a bail out for \nBoeing. This provision would authorize the Air Force to pay annual \nadvance payments, up to one year in advance, for leasing Boeing 767 \ntanker aircraft. I would like to have one of my colleagues from the \nAppropriations Committee explain to me how is this provision in the \nbest interest of the government or the taxpayer for that matter. This \nBoeing leasing arrangement is projected to cost $20 billion, that means \nthe Air Force may have to pay up front, each year, literally billions \nof dollars to Boeing with the promise to deliver aircraft later what a \ndeal, courtesy of the Appropriations Committee. As a senior member of \nthe Armed Services Committee, I would have liked to have heard some \ntestimony regarding this significant change in acquisition policy. In \nfact, the Armed Services Committee is the proper committee to make \nrecommendations as to reforming defense procurement policy, not the \nAppropriations Committee. The truth is there is no gain to the \ngovernment for this provision the gain is all on the side of the ledger \nof the Boeing Company. This is waste that borders on gross negligence.\n  Does the appropriations committee have any respect for the \nauthorizing committees in the Senate? I don't think so.\n  I believe this expensive aerial tanker lease program to be a new \nstart that has been estimated by the Office of Management and Budget to \ncost between $20-$30 billion over six years. A program of this \nmagnitude should require considerable consultation with the Secretary \nof Defense directly, not just that of Air Force Secretary Jim Roche or \nhis staff or a nebulous entity know as the Leasing Review Panel that\n\n[[Page S10520]]\n\nwas recently organized by the DOD acquisition secretary and DOD \ncomptroller for the sole purpose to recommend leasing major weapons \nplatforms such as aircraft, vessels, and combat vehicles according to \nthe Project on Government Oversight. I am deeply concerned that the \nArmed Services Committees have not been given adequate time for review, \ninspection or comment on this significant, unprecedented proposal and \nthat we do not have the advice of the Defense Secretary that this \nprogram is warranted. Recall, however, that we did hear from the \nDefense Secretary about the Army's Crusader that would have had a total \nprogram cost of only a half to a third as much as Air Force's scheme to \nlease Boeing 767 aerial tankers.\n  I appreciate the Secretary of Defense's strong support for the \npractice of using American taxpayers' money in a cost-effective manner \nto procure the best weapon system, at the best price for our men and \nwomen in uniform. I strongly endorse this practice. On June 28, 2001, \nin testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Defense \nSecretary said, ``[w]e have an obligation to taxpayers to spend their \nmoney wisely. Today, . . . there is no real incentive to save a nickel. \nTo the contrary, the way the Department operates today, there are \ndisincentives to saving money. We need to ask ourselves: how should we \nbe spending taxpayers dollars? We are doing two things: First, we are \nnot treating the taxpayers' dollars with respect--and by not doing so, \nwe risk losing their support; second, we are depriving the men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces of the training, equipment and facilities \nthey need to accomplish their missions. They deserve better. We need to \ninvest that money wisely.''\n  The tanker leasing debate has not benefited from authorization \ncommittee input or a clear understanding of the Secretary of Defense's \nviews on the requirement for this large procurement plan and the \nalleged Department of Air Force's change in policy to procure major \nweapons platforms, such as aircraft, through leasing schemes. I am \nconcerned the impact of these provisions has not been adequately \nscrutinized, and the full cost to taxpayers has not been sufficiently \nconsidered.\n  I would like to note that OMB Director Mitch Daniels has often \nindicated his preference to maintain scrutiny of government leasing \npractices out of regard for U.S. taxpayers. Just last year, in a letter \nfrom the OMB Director to Senator Kent Conrad, OMB cautioned against \neliminating rules intended to reduce leasing abuses. OMB's letter \nemphasized that the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) scoring rules ``were \nspecifically designed to encourage the use of financing mechanisms that \nminimize taxpayers' costs by eliminating the unfair advantage provided \nto lease-purchases by the previous scoring rules. Prior to the BEA, \nagencies only needed budget authority for the first year's lease \npayment, even though the agreement was a legally enforceable commitment \nto fully pay for the asset over time.'' OMB's letter continued by \nexplaining that this loophole had permitted the General Services \nAdministration to agree to 11 lease-purchase agreements with a total, \nfull-term cost of $1.7 billion, but to budget only the first year of \nlease payments. OMB's letter stated, ``[t]he scoring hid the fact that \nthese agreements had a higher economic cost than traditional direct \npurchases and in some cases allowed projects to go forward despite \nsignificant cost overruns. . . .'' Sounds very familiar.\n  As I mentioned before on the Senate floor when the Fiscal Year 2002 \nDefense Appropriations Conference Report was being debated, this is a \nsweet deal for the Boeing Company that I'm sure is the envy of \ncorporate lobbyists from one end of K Street to the other. The Project \non Government Oversight a politically independent, non-profit watchdog \norganization called Secretary Roche's Boeing tanker lease deal `` . . . \na textbook case of bad procurement policy and favoritism to a single \ndefense contractor.''\n  Let me review some of the highlights of the information and costs of \nthis leasing scheme that have been provided to the Congress by the \nOffice of Management and Budget, the General Accounting Office, the \nDepartment of Defense Inspector General, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the Department of Defense, and other important outside \nindependent experts:\n  GAO estimates the cost to lease 100 Boeing 767 tankers for 6 years to \nbe $20 to $30 billion.\n  GAO estimates that the cost to modernize and upgrade 127 KC-135 Es to \n``R'' Models is $3.6 billion; a $22.4 billion savings to leasing 100 \ntankers.\n  GAO estimates the cost for building new infrastructure for 100 Boeing \n767 tankers to be $1.7 billion, the same cost to modernize 59 older KC-\n135 tankers.\n  The Air Force estimates that their current fleet of KC-135s have \nbetween 12,000 to 14,000 flying hours on them only 33 percent of the \nlifetime flying hour limit and no KC-135E's will meet the limit until \n2040.\n  According to the Air Force, the Mission Capable Rate for KC-135 \ntankers is 80 percent the highest in the Air Force inventory. The B-2 \nMission Capable Rate by comparison is 39 percent.\n  According to the Air Force Air Mobility Command, there is no \nrequirement to begin replacing KC-135's before fiscal year 2013.\n  OMB reports that the current fleet of KC-135s is in good condition.\n  According to OMB, leasing 100 Boeing 767 tankers, cost $26 billion, \nwill result in an overall decrease of total tanker fleet capacity of 2 \nmillion pounds of fuel; whereas upgrading 126 KC-135 Es to ``R'' \nmodels, cost $3.2 billion, will result in an increase of total tanker \nfleet capacity of 1.7 million pounds of fuel over and above existing \ncapacity.\n  According to the Air Force ``Tanker Requirement Study 05,'' replacing \nthe KC-135E fleet with leased Boeing 767 tankers would not solve, and \ncould exacerbate, the shortfalls identified in the TRS-05.\n  According to the DOD IG, the Air Force competition/Request for \nInformation, RFI, on leasing tankers was only 14 days, not the ususal \nlength of time of 90 days constituting a concern regarding the true \nnature of the competition.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has reported that a long-term lease \nof tanker aircraft would be significantly more expensive than a direct \npurchase of such aircraft.\n  According to DOD, while the KC-135 is an average of 35 years old, its \nairframe hours and cycles are low with proper maintenance and upgrades \nthe KC-135 may be sustainable for another 35 years.\n  But this is just another example of Congress' political meddling and \nof how outside special interest groups have obstructed the military's \nability to channel resources where they are most needed. I will repeat \nwhat I've said many, many times before, the military needs less money \nspent on pork and more spent to redress the serious problems caused by \na decade of declining defense budgets.\n  This defense appropriations bill also includes provisions to mandate \ndomestic source restrictions; these ``Buy America'' provisions directly \nharm the United States and our allies. ``Buy America'' protectionist \nprocurement policies, enacted by Congress to protect pork barrel \nprojects in each Member's State or District, hurt military readiness, \npersonnel funding, modernization of military equipment, and cost the \ntaxpayer $5.5 billion annually. In many instances, we are driving the \nmilitary to buy higher-priced, inferior products when we do not allow \nforeign competition. ``Buy America'' restrictions undermine DOD's \nability to procure the best systems at the least cost and impede \ngreater interoperability and armaments cooperation with our allies. \nThey are not only less cost-effective, they also constitute bad policy, \nparticularly at a time when our allies' support in the war on terrorism \nis so important.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld and his predecessor, Bill Cohen, oppose this \nprotectionist and costly appropriations policy. However, the \nappropriations' staff ignores this expert advice when preparing the \nlegislative draft of the appropriations bills each year. The defense \nappropriations bill include several examples of ``Buy America'' pork, \nprohibitions on procuring anchor and mooring chain components for Navy \nwarships; main propulsion diesel engines and propellers for a new class \nof Navy dry-stores and ammunition supply ships; supercomputers; carbon, \nalloy, or armor steel plate; ball and roller bearings; construction or \nconversion of any naval vessel; and, other\n\n[[Page S10521]]\n\nnaval auxiliary equipment, including pumps for all shipboard services, \npropulsion system components such as engines, reduction gears, and \npropellers, shipboard cranes, and spreaders for shipboard cranes.\n  I am pleased that an amendment that I introduced on the Senate floor \ncarried through Conference Section 8147. This legislative provision \nwould prohibit spending $30.6 million for leasing of Boeing 737 VIP \nExecutive aircraft under any contract entered into under any \nprocurement procedures other than pursuant to the Competition and \nContracting Act which promotes full and open competition procedures in \nconducting a procurement for property or services. I believe this \namendment would ensure full and open competition with respect to Boeing \n737 VIP Executive aircraft. Although last year's DOD Appropriations \nbill specified 4 Boeing 737 aircraft, it did not authorize the lease \nsolely from the Boeing Company. Yet the Air Force only negotiated a \nsole source contract totaling nearly $400 million with the Boeing \nCompany, seemingly in direct violation of this statutory language if \nthey disburse funds for this VIP Executive aircraft lease without a \nfair and open competition. In today's failing economy, I imagine there \nare many leasing entities that would like to compete for this lucrative \nleasing arrangement with the Air Force. With the downturn in the \ncommercial aviation industry and the serious financial condition of \nmost airlines in the United States, it is very likely that there are \nmore than a few airlines that would like to participate in a full and \nopen competition to provide excess Boeing 737 transport aircraft under \nsome leasing arrangement with the Air Force.\n  I look forward to the day when my appearances on the Senate floor for \nthis purpose are no longer necessary. I reiterate, over $7.4 billion in \nunrequested defense programs have been added by the Committee to the \ndefense appropriations bill. Consider how that $7.4 billion, when added \nto the savings gained through additional base closings and more cost-\neffective business practices, could be used so much more effectively. \nThe problems of our Armed Forces, whether in terms of force structure \nor modernization, could be more assuredly addressed and our warfighting \nability greatly enhanced. The American taxpayers expect more of us, as \ndo our brave servicemen and women who are, without question, fighting \nthis war on global terrorism on our behalf.\n  But for now, unfortunately, they must witness us, seemingly blind to \nour responsibilities at this time of war, going about our business as \nusual.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Defense \nDepartment appropriations conference report.\n  I believe we must provide the best possible training, equipment, and \npreparation for our military forces, so they can effectively carry out \nwhatever peacekeeping, humanitarian, warfighting, or other missions \nthey are given. They deserve the across-the-board pay raises of 4.1 \npercent, the incentive pay for difficult-to-fill assignments, and the \nreduced out-of-pocket housing costs from the current 11.3 percent to \n7.5 percent contained in this conference report.\n  The report would also fully fund active and reserve end strengths, \nincluding well over 700 new positions for the Army National Guard, \nwhich will hopefully ease the current burden on our overstretched men \nand women in uniform. For many years running, those in our Armed Forces \nhave been suffering from a declining quality of life, despite rising \nmilitary Pentagon budgets. The pressing needs of our dedicated men and \nwomen in uniform, and those of their families, must be addressed as \nthey continue to be mobilized in the war against terrorism. This \nconference report goes far in addressing those needs. In addition, it \nprovides $150 million for Army peer review breast cancer research and \n$85 million for prostate cancer research.\n  The conference report also provides $417 million for the Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program, which seeks to secure airtight \ncontrol over fissile materials and technologies from Russia and other \nformer Soviet Union states to ensure that none makes its way into the \nhands of terrorists or to places like Iraq. Further, the report gives \n$70 million more than the administration requested to fund Israel's \nArrow antimissile program, which could protect Israel against Scud \nmissiles fired by Iraq. Finally, the report shifts $368.5 million from \nCrusader research and development to a new, lighter cannon, which will \nengage the expertise of the highly skilled workforce at the United \nDefense Industries plant in Minnesota. For these reasons and others, I \nwill vote for it today.\n  I also thank my colleagues on the conference committee for their hard \nwork and their passage of an amendment I included in the Senate version \nof the Department of Defense appropriations bill. The final bill \nincludes $5 million to put confidential victim advocates on military \ninstallations across the country. This would ensure that victims whose \nlives are in danger have an alternative place to turn that is \nconfidential and where their needs can be met without qualification.\n  The bill will also ensure that funds are made available to establish \nan impartial, multidisciplinary, confidential Domestic Violence \nFatality Review Team. The team would be charged with investigating \nevery domestic fatality in the military and helping to find ways to \nprevent fatalities in the future.\n  Finally, this bill would require that the Secretary report to \nCongress on progress in implementing the recommendations of the \nNational Defense Task Force on Domestic Violence. Domestic violence is \nsomething that we in Congress must constantly work to prevent, reduce, \nand eventually end. Having such reporting will help us work with the \nMilitary to address this terrible problem.\n  The National Defense Taskforce on Domestic Violence reported that \n``Domestic Violence is an offense against the institutional values of \nthe Military Services of the United States of America. It is an affront \nto human dignity, degrades the overall readiness of our armed forces, \nand will not be tolerated in the Department of Defense.'' I do not \nthink anyone who has followed the recent events at Fort Bragg \nwould disagree.\n\n  Sadly, the North Carolina incidents, while unusual in that they were \nclustered within such a short time, are not unique. The Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service reported 54 domestic homicides in the Navy and \nMarines since 1995. The Army reported 131 and the Air Force reported \n32. This is a problem that is by no means limited to the military, but \nits dimensions in the military context are complex. They need to be \naddressed. I know that Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary \nWolfowitz share that view. I applaud the Secretary and the Deputy \nSecretary for the attention they have given to this issue and the \nwillingness they have shown to address it. I also applaud my \ncolleagues, particularly Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens, for their \nleadership in passing this important legislation.\n  I am however, very disappointed that the conferees took out an \namendment, that I offered and which the Senate adopted, that would have \nbarred any funds in this bill from being used to enter contracts with \nU.S. companies who incorporate overseas to avoid U.S. taxes.\n  Former U.S. companies who have renounced their citizenship currently \nhold at least $2 billion worth of contracts with the Federal \nGovernment. I don't think that companies who aren't willing to pay \ntheir fair share of taxes should be able to hold these contracts. U.S. \ncompanies, that play by the rules, that pay their fair share of taxes, \nshould not be forced to compete with bad actors who can undercut their \nbids because of a tax loophole.\n  The loophole gives tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks to major \nmultinational companies with significant non-U.S. business. It also \nputs other U.S. companies unwilling or unable to use this loophole at a \ncompetitive disadvantage. No American company should be penalized \nstaying put while others renounce U.S. ``citizenship'' for a tax break.\n  Well, the problem with all this is that when these companies don't \npay their fair share, the rest of American tax payers and businesses \nare stuck with the bill. I think I can safely say that very few of the \nsmall businesses that I visit in Detroit Lakes, MN, or Mankato, in \nMinneapolis, or Duluth\n\n[[Page S10522]]\n\ncan avail themselves of the Bermuda Triangle.\n  I should also say, that the amendment that the conferees dropped was \nreally a very mild version. It was mostly prospective, and it only \naffected fiscal year 2003. I think it is appropriate for us to say that \nif the U.S. company wants to bid for a contract for U.S. defense work, \nthen it should not renounce it's U.S. citizen for a tax break.\n  We all make sacrifices in a time of war, the only sacrifice this \namendment asked of federal contractors is that they pay their fair \nshare of taxes like everybody else.\n  My final point on this issue is that it is now clear that this fight \nis going to take place on the Homeland Security bill. The Senate has \nadopted a very strong amendment that I offered. There is a very similar \namendment in the House passed bill. If the Republicans would end their \nfilibuster of the homeland security bill we could get it to conference \nand get a good provision signed into law to crack down on these tax \ncheats. The Congress will not dodge this issue.\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, after many long months of \nnegotiation, the fiscal year 2003 Defense Appropriations will finally \ncome to a close today. I add my strong support for this bill and would \nlike to thank Senators Inouye and Stevens for their work to ensure our \ncontinuing support for the men and women in the United States Armed \nServices.\n  At the very beginning of his administration, President Bush made it a \npriority to rebuild our military after 8 years of substantial and \ndangerous levels of operation and maintenance funding shortfalls under \nthe previous administration. Those of us in the Senate have also heeded \nthis call and I am pleased that we are about to take the next step in \nmaintaining a military fully capable of defending our Nation and \nmeeting our foreign policy goals.\n  While some balked at the largest defense budget increase in nearly 2 \ndecades, I support the President in his efforts to transform our \nmilitary. His reasoning for this increase is firm, and I quote the \nPresident for his two reasons behind the plan:\n\n       I sent up to Congress the largest increase in defense \n     spending since Ronald Reagan was the President. I did it for \n     two reasons. One, any time we commit our troops into harm's \n     way, they deserve the best pay, the best equipment, and the \n     best possible training. And secondly, the reason I asked for \n     an increase the size of which I did is because I wanted to \n     send a message to friend and foe alike that when it comes to \n     the defense of our freedoms, we're not quitting. There's not \n     calendar on my desk that says, well, we've reached this time, \n     it's time to stop. That's not how I think. That's not how \n     America thinks. We want our friends understanding that. We \n     want the enemy to know it, as well--that when it comes to the \n     defense of our country, comes to defending the values we hold \n     dear, it doesn't matter how much it costs, it doesn't matter \n     how long it takes, the United States will be firm and \n     resolved. We owe that to our children, and we owe it to our \n     children's children.\n\n  Specifically, I would like to point out some very important programs \nthat have a great deal of bearing on the safety of our country. As the \nranking member on the Strategic Subcommittee, I have made it abundantly \nclear how important missile defense is to not only our defense, but \nalso our close allies. The most advanced cooperative military project \nbetween the United States and Israel is the Arrow missile defense \nsystem--a theater wide missile defense system capable of shooting down \nballistic missiles fired at Israel or U.S. troops stationed in the \nMiddle East. The Arrow system is operational, providing Israel with a \nfunctioning defense against surface-to-surface missiles.\n  The appropriations conferees agreed on this priority and have \nprovided $70 million to continue funding this very important program. \nThis funding will ensure that Arrow remains capable of providing \nreliable protection against evolving threats, such as decoys and faster \nand longer-range ballistic missiles and also speed production of \nadditional Arrow missiles.\n  Likewise, I am encouraged by the $15 million allocated to purchase \ncommercial satellite imagery. Three high-level DOD commissions, the \nSpace Commission, the NRO Commission, and the NIMA Commission, all \nstated that DOD needs to better utilize commercial imagery. The NIMA \nCommission suggested that a new OSD account should be established with \nan initial budget of $350 million for the first year. The Space \nCommission stated that the ``U.S. Government could satisfy a \nsubstantial portion of its national security-related imagery \nrequirements by purchasing services from the U.S. commercial imagery \nindustry.'' I am convinced that there is yet more untapped potential \nwith commercial space imagery, and I believe this is a good first step.\n  This Defense Appropriations bill also provided funding for a number \nof developmental programs critical to space-based systems and \ntechnologies. The Network, Information, and Space Security Center will \nfacilitate cooperation for protecting information and information \nsystems, which is becoming increasingly important in the face of \ncyberterrorism threats from around the world. The Center for \nGeosciences is a leading-edge environmental research center \ncontinuously improving weather forecasts for our military forces around \nthe world. TechSat 21 will demonstrate the technical and operational \nfeasibility of microsatellites--a truly transformational approach to \nspace-based systems. And finally, the GPS Jammer Detection and location \nSystem will enable our military commanders to rely on GPS and GPS-\nsupported systems such without the threat of interference or jamming by \nthe enemy.\n  While we find ourselves at the end of another legislative year, the \nSenate and our colleagues in the House have taken a solid step toward \nthe transformation of the United States military. While much work \nremains to be completed in the coming years, it bodes well for our men \nand women in the armed services that Congress will continue to support \nthem in the defense of our country.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against the conference \nreport accompanying the fiscal year 2003 Department of Defense \nappropriations bill. I regret that Congress has missed another \nopportunity to reorient the thinking, and spending, of the Pentagon.\n  I strongly support our men and women in uniform in the ongoing fight \nagainst global terrorism and in their other missions, both at home and \nabroad. I commend the members of the National Guard and Reserves and \ntheir families for the sacrifices they have made to protect our \nsecurity and freedom. All members of our military and their families, \nactive duty, National Guard, and Reserves, deserve our sincere thanks \nfor their commitment to protect this country and to undertake the fight \nagainst terrorism in the wake of the horrific attacks of September 11, \n2001.\n  And they deserve our support as they face the uncertainly surrounding \npossible military action against Iraq.\n  Each year that I have been a member of this body I have expressed my \nconcern about the priorities of the Pentagon and about the process by \nwhich we consider the Department of Defense authorization and \nappropriations bills. I am troubled that the Department of Defense does \nnot receive the same scrutiny as other parts of our Federal budget. \nThis time of national crisis underscores the need for the Congress and \nthe Administration to take a hard look at the Pentagon's budget to \nensure that scarce taxpayer dollars are targeted to those programs that \nare necessary to defend our country in the post-Cold War world and to \nensure that our Armed Forces have the resources that they will need for \nthe battles ahead.\n  There can be no dispute that Congress should provide the resources \nnecessary to fight and win the battle against terrorism. There should \nalso be no dispute that this ongoing campaign should not be used as an \nexcuse to continue to drastically increase an already bloated defense \nbudget.\n  The conference report on which we are about to vote accompanies what \nwill be the largest defense appropriations bill that Congress has ever \npassed. It represents a $34.1 billion increase over the fiscal year \n2002 level, including supplemental defense spending that was \nappropriated in the wake of the September 11 attacks. It represents a \n$54.5 billion increase over the fiscal year 2001 funding level.\n  The United States spends more on defense than all of the other \ncountries of the world combined.\n  Of course, a strong national defense is crucial to the peace and \nstability of\n\n[[Page S10523]]\n\nour nation. But a strong economy is also essential to national \nsecurity. We must not focus on one to the detriment of the other. Many \nof the expensive weapons systems for which there are billions in \nappropriations in this conference report have little or nothing to do \nwith the fight against terrorism, which is often cited as the reason \nfor the $34 billion increase in defense spending for fiscal year 2003. \nI am concerned that if we continue down this path, defense spending \nwill spiral further out of control, perhaps putting other areas of our \neconomy at risk.\n  I am pleased that this conference report contains no funding for the \nArmy's Crusader mobile artillery program. I support the Secretary of \nDefense's decision to cancel this outdated program, and earlier this \nyear, I introduced legislation that would have done just that. I \ncommend the Secretary of Defense for his efforts to transform our \nmilitary to meet the challenges of the 21st Century and beyond, and \nagree that weapons that were better suited to the Cold War than to the \nbattles of this century should be terminated.\n  I regret that so little progress has been made to transform the \nmilitary for these new challenges. The hard-fought battle to terminate \nthe Crusader program, a program that was canceled by the Secretary of \nDefense, stands as an example of how difficult it is to change the \nmind-set of the Pentagon and the Congress. The beleaguered Crusader is \nthe poster child for an obsolete, Cold War-era program, yet there are \nthose in the Congress and at the Pentagon who tried desperately to save \nit. The termination of a weapon system such as the Crusader is an \nexample of the hard decisions that this body will have to make as we \nface the realities of the Federal budget and as we seek to provide our \nArmed Forces with the equipment that they will need to fight the \nbattles of the future.\n  As I have said time and time again, there are millions upon millions \nof dollars in this bill that are being spent on outdated or \nquestionable or unwanted programs. This money would be better spent on \nprograms that truly improve our readiness and modernize our Armed \nForces. This money also would be better spent on efforts to improve the \nmorale of our forces, such as ensuring that all of our men and women in \nuniform have a decent standard of living or providing better housing \nfor our Armed Forces and their families. For those reasons, I will \noppose this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Under the previous order, Mr. Wellstone is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank both of my \ncolleagues, Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens, for their fine work. I \nalso think this is a very important piece of legislation, extremely \nimportant to our Armed Forces, just on the basis of making sure the men \nand women who serve our country--from salaries to living conditions, \nyou name it; it is just an important piece of legislation.\n  I also thank both of my colleagues for fighting in the conference \ncommittee to keep an amendment in that deals with the problem of \ndomestic violence and sexual assault. We all agree that both Under \nSecretary Wolfowitz and Secretary Rumsfeld are well aware of some of \nthe problems and are more than willing to put together the necessary \ntask force and really take a long, hard look at this to make sure we do \nwhat we need to do. I thank them for that.\n  This amendment also says we really need, on our bases, to have a \nplace where women can go with some confidentiality if, in fact, they \nare in a situation where they are being battered and there is nowhere \nto go for support. It is extremely important for these women. It is \nextremely important for these children. It is extremely important for \ntheir families. I am glad this amendment is in. I know there was some \ndiscussion down at Fort Bragg about the amendment and it was very \npositive. So I thank my colleagues for supporting this.\n  I want to finally express my indignation, even though I believe in \nboth these Senators, that this is one part of this political process \nthat drives people in Minnesota nuts, drives people in the country \nnuts, and drives me nuts. I brought an amendment to the floor. It was \neminently reasonable. It said for those companies that go to Bermuda \nand renounce their citizenship so they do not pay their fair share of \ntaxes--it was only prospective, it did not look back; it was for 1 \nyear--they don't get Government contracts.\n  If they want to renounce their citizenship and not pay their fair \nshare of taxes, they are not going to get any government contract.\n  There is overwhelming support on the floor of the Senate.\n  I have learned my lesson now. I will have been here almost 12 years. \nWhy haven't I learned my lesson and ask for a rollcall vote? Maybe that \nwouldn't have done any good, anyway. It seemed that there was strong \nsupport from some Senators who didn't want to vote against it but who \ndidn't want to vote for it. But I thought, OK, the point is to get this \npassed.\n  This was taken out in the conference committee. With all due respect, \nmy understanding is the House conferees would not budge. They would not \nbudge.\n  I want to just say to the House Republican leadership and to the \nconferees, you are not going to be able to continue to win on these \nkinds of votes. People in Minnesota and in the United States of America \nare outraged that these companies go to Bermuda and renounce their \ncitizenship and don't pay their fair share of taxes.\n  You get into the conference committee, and it is the same old, same \nold, same old. Special interests do their lobbying and get the job \ndone.\n  Senator Lieberman is on the floor. If this homeland defense bill goes \nin, we have this provision in that bill. I am counting on Senator \nLieberman's support.\n  I thank Senator Inouye for fighting as hard as he could.\n  I want to say to the House Republican conferees, you are not going to \nwin this fight. This is going to come back. You are not going to win \nthis fight. And you are way out of sync with about 90 percent of the \npeople in this country on this question.\n  Listen, I have been involved in fights on the floor of the Senate \nwhere I was the one who was in the minority.\n  But let me tell you, on this question, you guys are just wrong. You \ntook it out of conference committee, but you are not going to win this \nfight. We are going to bring this provision back, and we are going to \nget it into legislation. It is in the very sweeping homeland defense \nbill. We are going to keep it in that bill, and come back and back.\n  It is not right for the businesses in your State, Mr. President--New \nJersey--or in Minnesota. Ninety-nine percent of the businesses that \nplay by the rules of the game but don't have the lawyers and the \naccountants to tell them how to evade paying their fair share of \ntaxes--they wouldn't do it even if they could because they don't think \nit is right--why should they be penalized for doing the right thing? \nAnd why should these companies get away with murder?\n  I wish this had not been taken out by the conference committee. I \nregret it. I know my colleagues did their best. We will be back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.

Mr. President, last week, the Judiciary Committee pulled \nfrom their agenda the pending nomination of Judge Dennis Shedd to fill \na seat on the 4th circuit court of appeals. That was contrary to all of \nthe understandings as to what would happen with regard to that nominee. \nI think various Members on the judiciary committee on several occasions \nhad been assured he would be given a vote. I think there is no question \nthat Senator Thurmond had been under the impression there would be a \nvote on Shedd's nomination this year. Yet the nomination was removed \nfrom the calendar and, therefore, not even considered by the committee. \nA vote was not taken, and I presume it was blocked procedurally because \nthere would have been enough votes in the Committee to actually report \nShedd's nomination to the full Senate had there been a vote.\n  I understand that moving to the executive calendar is traditionally a \nprerogative of the Majority Leader. However, there has been an \nextraordinary and unprecedented violation of Senate rules and tradition \nin the manner in which Judge Dennis Shedd's nomination was considered \nin the Judiciary Committee. I also believe that the manner in which \nSenator Thurmond was led on regarding Judge Shedd's nomination \nconstituted a slight of Senator Thurmond during the final days of his \nlong and distinguished Senate career. I remind Senators that we depend \nvery heavily around here on comity and trust to do the vast majority of \nour business on behalf of the American people. When that trust is \nviolated or misused it is hard to conduct business as usual.\n  Mr. President, Dennis Shedd's nomination was finally put on the \nJudiciary Committee's agenda way back on Sept. 19, but was held over to \nthe next mark-up which as it turned out was last Tuesday, October 8th. \nIt is also my understanding that the normal practice is that when \nSenators in the Committee hold legislation and nominations over at a \nmark-up, the tradition and practice has always been that the items held \nover are placed on the very next mark-up.\n\n  In this instance, the October 8th mark-up was actually postponed from \nthe previous Thursday, October 3rd, so that Chairman Leahy could \nconcentrate on passing the Department of Justice (DOJ) Re-authorization \nConference Report. During the vote to invoke cloture on that bill, it \nis my understanding that Senator Thurmond was once again assured by \nSenator Leahy that Judge Shedd would be on the mark-up on October 8th.\n  Unfortunately, that assurance as well as the practices and traditions \nof the Committee were violated last week because Judge Dennis Shedd's \nnomination was pulled from the committee's agenda--preventing the \nCommittee from reporting him out to the full Senate. However, breeches \nin decorum regarding Judge Shedd and Senator Thurmond predate last \nweek.\n  On July 31st, Chairman Leahy publicly promised Senator Thurmond at a \ncommittee meeting that Judge Shedd would be voted on this year. When \nShedd wasn't on the August 1st mark-up, Senator Leahy assured Senator \nThurmond's Chief of Staff that Shedd would be voted on immediately \nafter the August recess. When Shedd was not on the agenda for the first \nmark-up after the Senate returned in September--which was Sept. 5th--\nSenator Thurmond then was assured that Dennis Shedd would be on the \nnext mark-up on Sept. 19th.\n  While Shedd was actually put on that mark-up on Sept. 19th, he was \nheld over to the next mark-up--which is the right of Senators in the \nCommittee to do. And then, as I said previously, contrary to tradition \nand practice, Shedd was kept off the agenda for the last mark-up of the \nyear by Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt about Judge Shedd's qualifications. \nHe has strong bipartisan support. One of his most ardent supporters is \nthe distinguished Democrat Senator from South Carolina, Senator \nHollings. The ABA--the ``Gold Standard'' so often cited by Senator \nLeahy--gave Judge Shedd a ``Well Qualified'' rating, its highest \nrating. So, it is not Judge Shedd's qualifications which are standing \nin the way.\n  He was appointed by President George H.W. Bush to the United States \nDistrict Court for South Carolina in 1990, and has now served as a \nfederal jurist for more than a decade--following nearly twenty previous \nyears of public service and legal practice. In addition to his service \non the District Court, he has sat by designation on the Fourth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals on several occasions. Judge Shedd also has served on \nthe Judicial Conference Committee of the Judicial Branch and its \nSubcommittee on Judicial Independence.\n  From 1978 through 1988, Judge Shedd served in a number of different \ncapacities in the United States Senate, including Counsel to the \nPresident Pro Tempore and Chief Counsel and Staff Director for the \nSenate Judiciary Committee when Senator Thurmond was the Chairman.\n  Judge Shedd would bring unmatched experience to the Fourth Circuit. \nHe has handled more than 4,000 civil cases since taking the bench and \nover 900 criminal matters. In fact, no judge currently sitting on the \nFourth Circuit has as much federal trial experience as Judge Shedd, and \nnone can match his ten years of experience in the legislative branch.\n  Mr. President, Dennis Shedd's record demonstrates that he is a \nmainstream judge with a low reversal rate. In the more than 5,000 cases \nJudge Shedd has handled during his twelve years on the bench, he has \nbeen reversed fewer than 40 times (less than one percent). So, it \nshould be clear that Judge Shedd is the victim of a deliberate, \ncalculated, attempt by outside groups to embarrass one of President \nBush's nominees and not any deficiency in his professional training or \ntemperament.\n\n  But Judge Shedd is not the only victim here. This is also an affront \nto Senator Thurmond in his final days as a Senator. We owe it to \nSenator Thurmond, as a sign of our respect and admiration for his \ndistinguished service, to vote on the nomination of his former staff \ndirector before Senator Thurmond's career comes to an end--an action \nthe Senator feels that Senator Leahy gave him his word he would do.\n  Mr. President, the rules of the Senate provide a motion to discharge \na nomination. I want to do that. But I am under no illusion that I \nwould be allowed to make that motion and have it succeed under any \ncircumstances. That has been tried on the other side of the aisle when \nI was majority leader, and I know that it would be interpreted as a\n\n[[Page S10525]]\n\npartisan vote and that the majority leader would have to press his \nmembers not to allow that to happen. But I feel so strongly about the \nunfairness of the treatment of this nominee and the way it has \nreflected on Senator Thurmond that I have to take some action.\n  The Senate must be in executive session in order to move to discharge \na nomination. That would not happen. Having said that, we feel we must \nmake another effort. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session; that the nomination of Dennis Shedd, to \nbe a Fourth Circuit judge, be discharged from the Judiciary Committee \nand placed on the calendar; further, I ask unanimous consent that at a \ntime determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of \nthe nomination, with no intervening action or debate; that following \nthe vote the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, \nand the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that this action occur prior to the \nadjournment of the 107th Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me respond briefly. It has been the practice of the \nSenate, since we have been in the majority, to take up all nominations \nthat have been reported out of the committee. This nomination has yet \nto be reported out of the committee. There have been a number of others \nwho have sought recognition and have asked to be heard on the Shedd \nnomination, which is why the nomination was tabled.\n  I hasten to add that, on that very day--I don't recall the exact \nnumber--a significant number of judicial nominations were passed out. I \nbelieve the number was 17. So there are 17 additional judicial \nnominations, which brings us close now to 100 judicial confirmations, \nif we deal with those 17 pending now on the calendar. More than 80 have \nalready passed and were confirmed, and we have 17 pending and could be \nconfirmed before the end of the year. That is close to an all-time \nrecord. I think that is all the more laudatory, given the fact that we \nhave not been in the majority for the entire 2-year period of time. \nDuring that first 6-month period of time, the Republicans failed to \nconfirm one judicial nomination; they failed on all counts to confirm \neven one. So the Shedd nomination is being reviewed. There are others \nwho wish to be heard, and I respect the decision made by the chairman, \nin particular, that this nominee be given additional consideration, and \nthat others who want to be heard be given that opportunity as well.\n  I do object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question and a \nsuggestion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished Republican \nleader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are in session this week--today and I \npresume tomorrow. I guess there is a possibility we will be in session \nagain next week. In view of the commitments that were made that this \nnominee would be considered by the committee, is there a chance there \nwould be another executive session or markup session of the Judiciary \nCommittee either tomorrow or next week to further consider this \nnomination, because at least 2 weeks will have transpired between the \nlast time it was supposed to be considered and when the Senate would go \nout for the election, and possibly even after the election?\n  The majority leader will note my UC just asked consent that it occur \nbefore the adjournment of the 107th Congress. I did not say today or \nnext week, although, obviously, I feel strongly it should be considered \nsoon. Is there a possibility something could be worked out in this \nregard?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there is always a possibility, and I will \ncertainly work with the Republican leader on all the nominations. He \nand I have talked on numerous occasions about how we might accommodate \nall of those nominees whose names are pending on the calendar. We have \nnot yet been able to address those.\n  I would like very much to clear the calendar, to do as much as \npossible to get those who have been reported out cleared and confirmed \nprior to the time we leave. Clearly, I would work with him and \ncertainly with the Judiciary Committee. I cannot make any commitments \nthis afternoon without consultation with the Chair. But I think the \ncommittee has been more than fair and more than productive in its \neffort to move out of the committee the large number of nominations, \nboth at the district and circuit levels. I will certainly consult with \nthe distinguished Republican leader and the Chair in the coming days.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is aware when the Republicans were in the \nmajority, we tried on a number of occasions to get a significant number \nof judges to have hearings. For example, I can remember last week \nSenator Boxer spoke to me about judges in California who waited over 4 \nyears to have a hearing. Does the Senator recall that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Unfortunately, I do. I think if we go back, we would \nrecognize there are a number of nominees who waited 3 and 4 years and \nnever even got a hearing. Mr. Shedd was at least given a hearing. As I \nsay, people are continually coming before the committee and seeking \nadditional opportunities to address the committee on the Shedd \nnomination. That is far more than what a number of the nominees were \ngiven over the course of the Clinton administration.\n  We are hoping to rectify that, which is why we have confirmed as many \njudges as we have to date. As I say, almost 100 judges will have been \nconfirmed if we clear the Federal calendar prior to the time we adjourn \nsine die.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe I still have the floor. I was \nasking the Senator to yield. He was still, I guess, proceeding under \nhis objection. I take my time back. I would like to put some other \nissues into the Record.\n\n  Mr. President, I do want to respond to the comments about the \nnominations that have been confirmed and those that are still pending. \nThere have been 131 judicial nominations submitted by President Bush \nduring the 107th Congress--32 U.S. circuit nominees; 98 district \nnominees, and one U.S. Court of International Trade judge. So far, 80 \nof the 131 nominees have been confirmed--14 U.S. circuit court judges \nand 66 district court judges. But the key figure is that there are \nstill 49 nominations pending before the Senate, without final action 49 \nnominations. There are still 31 nominations pending in committee. Of \nthe 16 U.S. circuit court positions that have not been confirmed--15 \nare still in the committee, just one is on the floor, and that one is \nthe nominee for the Sixth Circuit, Mr. John Rogers, who has been \npending on the Executive Calendar since July.\n  I thought there had been an agreement that we would move that \nnomination before the August recess. Again, that circuit court nominee \nhas been pending on the Senate floor since July--almost 4 months ago. \nAnd there are 15 other circuit nominees in committee, some of whom have \nbeen waiting over 500 days without even a hearing.\n  As to district court nominees, there are still 15 of them in \ncommittee as well, and the 17 that are on the floor for consideration \nwere just reported last week. I hope we will at least confirm those \nnominations before we leave, although on many occasions, we had to have \nrecorded votes to move even district judges. I wonder if that means we \nare going to have to have 12, 14, 16, 17 recorded votes in the Senate \non district judges to get them confirmed before we adjourn for the \nyear. And, of course, the one USIT position is still pending in \nCommittee and has been since December of last year.\n  The key point is the alarming number of vacancies on the federal \ncourts--77, which is almost 10 percent of federal judgeships. I \nunderstand from the Judicial Council and from the Chief Justice, that \nover 30 of these nominations are for seats that are considered \nemergency vacancies that need to be filled.\n\n[[Page S10526]]\n\n  We can always talk about percentages and numbers, Mr. President. For \nexample, so far only 43 percent of this President's circuit nominations \nin his first 2 years have been confirmed. President Clinton got over 86 \npercent of his circuit nominees confirmed in his first 2 years in \noffice, the first President Bush got 96 percent and President Reagan \ngot 95 percent. Only 43 percent of circuit court judge nominations have \nbeen confirmed in this Congress compared to almost 90 percent for other \nPresidents over the past 20 years. That is a problem.\n  I know there have been disagreements in the past about nominations \nwhen I was majority leader, but we did move large blocks of \nnominations. We had some approved that were very controversial and \nothers were not moved in the final analysis.\n  The problem with this particular nomination is not only the \nexceptional qualifications of the nominee and his history as a former \njudiciary committee staffer, but more importantly, the way Senator \nThurmond has been treated in the process. Judge Shedd is eminently \nqualified for the job. He is a former staff director of the Judiciary \nCommittee. And he has been a sitting Federal district judge for over a \ndecade, confirmed by the Senate, probably unanimously. Nevertheless, \nafter Senator Thurmond was given the word that he would have this \nnomination voted on before the year was out, this nomination was pulled \nfrom the calendar of the committee's last markup.\n  Mr. President, that is simply a tragic conclusion to an almost five-\ndecade career in the Senate. It is also in my view a violation of the \nunwritten rules of civility about which we all talk and aspire to in \nthe Senate. That is why I will make a continued effort to find a way \nfor this nominee to be considered by the committee and confirmed by the \nSenate in this Congress before Senator Thurmond retires. Senator \nThurmond, Judge Shedd, and the American people deserve better. Senator \nThurmond as an icon of this institution in his final days deserves \nbetter. And the honor and traditions of the U.S. Senate deserve better.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                           shedd's background\n\n       Appointed by President George H.W. Bush to the United \n     States District Court for South Carolina in 1990, Dennis W. \n     Shedd has served as a federal jurist for more than a decade \n     following nearly twenty years of public service and legal \n     practice.\n       In addition to his service on the District Court, he has \n     sat by designation on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on \n     several occasions. Judge Shedd also has served on the \n     Judicial Conference Committee of the Judicial Branch and its \n     Subcommittee on Judicial Independence.\n       From 1978 through 1988, Judge Shedd served in a number of \n     different capacities in the United States Senate, including \n     Counsel to the President Pro Tempore and Chief Counsel and \n     Staff Director for the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Judge Shedd is well-respected by members of the bench and \n     bar in South Carolina. According to South Carolina \n     plaintiff's attorney Joseph Rice, ``Shedd--who came to the \n     bench with limited trial experience? has a good understanding \n     of day-to-day problems that affect lawyers in his courtroom . \n     . . He's been a straight shooter.'' [Legal Times, May 14, \n     2001.]\n       According to the Almanac of the Federal Judiciary, \n     attorneys said that Judge Shedd has outstanding legal skills \n     and an excellent judicial temperament. A few comments from \n     South Carolina lawyers: ``You are not going to find a better \n     judge on the bench or one that works harder.'' ``He's the \n     best federal judge we've got.'' ``He gets an A all around.'' \n     ``It's a great experience trying cases before him.'' ``He's \n     polite and businesslike.''\n       Plaintiffs lawyers commended Shedd for being even-handed: \n     ``He has always been fair.'' ``I have no complaints about \n     him. He's nothing if not fair.'' [Almanac of the Federal \n     Judiciary, Vol. 1, 1999.]\n       Judge Shedd would bring unmatched experience to the Fourth \n     Circuit. He has handled more than 4,000 civil cases since \n     taking the bench and over 900 criminal matters. In fact, no \n     judge currently sitting on the Fourth Circuit has as much \n     federal trial experience as Judge Shedd, and none can match \n     his ten years of experience in the legislative branch.\n       Shedd's record demonstrates that he is a mainstream judge \n     with a low reversal rate. In the more than 5,000 cases Judge \n     Shedd has handled during his twelve years on the bench, he \n     has been reversed fewer than 40 times (less than one \n     percent). Since taking his seat on the Fourth Circuit in \n     2001, Judge Roger Gregory (a Democrat appointed by President \n     Bush) has written opinions affirming several of Judge Shedd's \n     rulings.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, this past year has been a challenging \ntime for residents of the capital region. First there was the September \n11 attack on the Pentagon. Then there were the anthrax attacks, and now \na serial sniper is terrorizing the national capital region, attacking \ninnocent people going about their daily lives. These attacks affect \neach and every one of us.\n  Here in the capital region especially, there have been seven attacks \nin Montgomery County and in Prince George's County in my own home State \nof Maryland. The sniper has also made three attacks in Northern \nVirginia. Our friends and our neighbors have been either injured or \nkilled. Our schools are now locked down. Eleven of our neighbors have \nbeen shot, nine people have died, two others are still fighting for \ntheir recovery, including a child who was shot as he walked into his \nschool in the accompaniment of his aunt, a nurse.\n  These senseless and brutal murders have left grieving families and \nterrified our communities. I wish to express my sympathy for the \nfamilies of the victims. I want them to know they are not alone; that I \nam on their side and at their side; and also that the resources of the \nFederal Government are at the disposal of local government and local \nlaw enforcement to catch this criminal.\n  We in Maryland are deeply grateful for the support of President Bush, \nwho has pledged the support of every Federal agency to be at the \ndisposal of local government and local law enforcement.\n  I thank the Attorney General, Mr. Ashcroft, and the FBI Director, Mr. \nMueller, for their immediate response when these attacks on our \ncivilians occurred.\n  This killer must be brought to justice. It is going to take \npersistence and patience. It is going to take great detective work, \nwhich is already underway. I want everyone to know that just like the \nmanhunt is not going to go away, Federal support is not going to go \naway, and the resources are not going to go away until this criminal is \nbrought to justice.\n  So many of my colleagues have expressed their support. They have \nasked me how my constituents are doing. Well, let me tell everyone what \nI know about the Marylanders I so proudly represent. We Marylanders \nstrongly believe when times get tough, the tough get going. We are \nunflinching in our determination to get through these attacks, to stand \nwith each other, and to do all we can to support law enforcement to \ncatch the criminal, to keep our businesses open, and also to make sure \nour children are safe.\n  We are particularly sensitive to these issues, but our grief and \nshock must be coupled with action. Congress must respond with deeds, \nnot just words. This is why I believe one of our first actions should \nbe to pass something called the BLAST Act. The BLAST Act deals with \nballistic fingerprinting. It was introduced by our colleague, Senator \nKohl. It would keep a database that includes the fingerprint of every \nbullet and shell to enable law enforcement to solve crimes by providing \na scientific link between gun crimes and their owners.\n  Ballistic evidence has already helped us determine that these \nshootings were linked to the same killer. We now need the kind of \nlegislation that just as we take fingerprints of criminals, we need to \nhave the same type of fingerprinting on guns.\n  I know this is controversial, but let's begin the debate. Let's move \nthis legislation through the committee. I know there are issues related \nto technology, there are issues regarding those who want to tamper with \na gun in some way, but this is the United States of America. We have \nthe genius in regard to technology. Let's solve the problems by doing \nsomething to make ballistic fingerprinting available, reliable, and \naccurate. Let's not solve it by doing nothing and saying there are too \nmany problems.\n\n[[Page S10527]]\n\n  My constituents want action. They want us to not only find the \ncriminal, but they want us to prevent these type of deeds from being \ndone again. So this is why I support the BLAST Act. I am a proud \ncosponsor and hope to vote for it in the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, the sniper is not the only killer who attacked our \nregion and the people living in it. One year ago today, a letter \ncontaining the deadly anthrax was opened in the Senate. Before that \nletter reached the Senate office building, it passed through the \nBrentwood postal facility, exposing workers to its deadly contents. On \nthis anniversary, I want to express my deepest condolences to the \nfamilies who suffered in these attacks, particularly the families of \ntwo postal workers who died from anthrax exposure, my two constituents, \nJoe Curseen, Jr., and Thomas Morris, Jr. Both of these men lived in \nMaryland. They were public servants. They were patriots. They died in \nthe service of their country.\n  I want them to know I will continue to stand sentry to make sure we \nwill not forget them. America must not only remember the sacrifices \nthey made and the pain felt by their families but the fact that every \nsingle postal worker continued to work, show up for duty, deliver the \nmail and was unflinching and unabashed in fulfilling their duty as \npostal workers.\n  I was proud to join with my colleagues in the House, Representatives \nWynn and Norton, in passing a bill to rename the Brentwood facility \nafter Mr. Curseen and Mr. Morris, but I want to do more. The postal \nworkers are scared. Little is known about the long-term effects of \npossible exposure to anthrax. Some are quite ill and continue to be \nill. This is why I will be offering legislation calling on HHS to \nexamine the effects of anthrax exposure on the long-term health of our \npostal workers.\n  I also want to thank every Senate employee who, though we have been \nfaced with anthrax, continue to keep the doors of the Senate floor \nopen. Thanks to our personal staff, our professional staff, to the \npages, to the elevator operators, everybody, we survived that attack, \nand we survived it because we stuck together. God bless them, and God \nbless America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Maryland has \nexpired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10527-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10527-S10531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS REPORTING THIRTEEN APPROPRIATIONS BILLS BY \n                             JULY 31, 2002\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 304, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 304) encouraging the Senate Committee \n     on Appropriations to report thirteen, fiscally responsible, \n     bipartisan appropriations bills to the Senate not later than \n     July 31, 2002.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has begun debate \non the extension of several critically important budget enforcement \ntools. I want to thank the majority leader, Senator Daschle, for \nbringing up this important matter and for finding the time for this \nSenate debate.\n  I know that floor time is scarce and there are many other important \npriorities for this Senate, but I believe this amendment, authored by \nmyself, Senator Domenici, Senator Gregg, and Senator Feingold, is one \nof the most important measures the Senate will vote upon this year.\n  As I have indicated, I am especially pleased to be joined in this \namendment by the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Domenici.\n  The amendment that we offer today represents a major step in \npreserving fiscal discipline in the Senate. The bipartisan amendment \nincludes a 1-year extension requiring 60 votes in the Senate to waive \ncertain Budget Act points of order. The extension would continue the \n60-vote waiver of these points of order against legislation that would, \namong other things, decrease the Social Security surplus, increase \nspending, or cut taxes beyond levels specified in the most recent \nbudget resolution.\n\n  A 1-year extension of the Senate pay-as-you-go rule that has been in \neffect since 1993 is also included. This Senate rule requires 60 votes \nto waive a point of order raised against direct spending or tax cut \nlegislation that would increase the deficit, further tapping into the \nSocial Security surplus. In addition, the resolution extends the pay-\nas-you-go rule to mandatory spending items added to appropriations \nbills.\n  If you pierce the veil, because that is a lot of technical language \nthat is important, the fundamentals of this amendment are very simple. \nThis is a question of whether or not we are going to have the budget \ndisciplines we have had in place for most of the last decade that \nproved to be so important to having fiscal discipline in the Congress.\n  This amendment will help protect Social Security. As previously \nmentioned, it extends the Senate pay-go rule which helps to prevent use \nof the Social Security surplus for tax cuts or mandatory spending. It \nwill extend the requirement for 60 votes to waive a point of order \nagainst a reconciliation bill that would make changes in Social \nSecurity. It will extend the requirement for 60 votes to waive a point \nof order against a budget resolution that would reduce the Social \nSecurity surplus, and it will extend the requirement for 60 votes to \nwaive a point of order against legislation that would reduce the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  This amendment does not accomplish everything I would like to \naccomplish. Back in June, Senators Domenici and Feingold and I offered \nan amendment to the Defense authorization bill that would have included \nall of the elements of this amendment but also would have gone further.\n  At that time, we recommended to our colleagues to set a limit of $768 \nbillion on discretionary spending for fiscal year 2003 and a required \n60 votes to waive a point of order against legislation that would \nexceed that limit. We offered an extension of the statutory rules that \nwould enforce that discretionary limit through sequestration. We also \nwould have extended the statutory pay-as-you-go rules that require that \nincreases in mandatory spending or tax cuts be paid for and that \nenforce requirement for sequestration.\n  Although we had bipartisan support for that amendment, we fell one \nvote short of the supermajority that was required. The President will \nrecall on that day we had 59 votes to extend the enforcement procedures \non the budget, 59 votes for a spending cap. But 59 votes was not \nenough. The rules require that we have the supermajority of 60 votes; \nwe fell 1 vote short.\n  Senator Domenici, the ranking member of the Budget Committee, stood \nwith us in that effort. Senator Stevens, the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, stood with us on that vote. Senator McCain, a \nprominent Republican Presidential candidate, stood with us on that \nvote. Again, we did not achieve the 60 votes necessary to have that \nmeasure passed.\n  I would still like to put in place a limit on discretionary spending \nand extend the more comprehensive package of enforcement tools on which \nwe voted that day. Getting agreement between the House, Senate, and the \nWhite House on a discretionary spending limit is not possible right \nnow. For now, we have to take this different approach, even though it \nis more limited. Because of the importance of extending Senate rules \nenforcing limits on mandatory spending and tax cuts, Senator Domenici \nand I agreed to proceed with this simple Senate resolution.\n  Let me be clear; this is not a budget resolution. There has been some \ndiscussion, and I know Senator Domenici expressed concern to me. He is \nright; this is not a budget resolution. This is a measure that extends \nbudget enforcement procedures in the Senate. It extends the expiring \nrequirements for 60 votes in the Senate to waive the point of order \nrelating to mandatory spending and tax cuts. It is, unfortunately, \nsilent on the level of discretionary spending for fiscal year 2003.\n  Again, while this is not everything I want or everything that needs \nto be done to ensure fiscal discipline, I am convinced this is all that \nis possible today. It represents a very important step forward in the \nfight for fiscal discipline. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. Let us demonstrate to the American people that the Senate \nhas not abandoned budget discipline.\n\n[[Page S10528]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 4886\n\n  I call up my amendment which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Conrad), for himself, \n     Mr. Domenici, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Gregg, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4886.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike all after the Resolved Clause and insert the \n     following: That the Senate encouraging the Senate Committee \n     on Appropriations to report thirteen, fiscally responsible, \n     bipartisan appropriations bills to the Senate not later than \n     July 31, 2002. :\n\n     SEC. __. BUDGET ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) Extension of Supermajority Enforcement.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any provision of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974, subsections (c)(2) and \n     (d)(3) of section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \n     shall remain in effect for purposes of Senate enforcement \n     through September 30, 2003.\n       (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the \n     enforcement of section 302(f)(2)(B) of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974.\n       (b) Pay-As-You-Go Rule in the Senate.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of Senate enforcement, \n     section 207 of H. Con. Res. 68 (106th Congress, 1st Session) \n     shall be construed as follows:\n       (A) In subsection (b)(6), by inserting after ``paragraph \n     (5)(A)'' the following: ``, except that direct spending or \n     revenue effects resulting in net deficit reduction enacted \n     pursuant to reconciliation instructions since the beginning \n     of that same calendar year shall not be available''.\n       (B) In subsection (g), by striking ``2002'' and inserting \n     ``2003''.\n       (2) Scorecard.--For purposes of enforcing section 207 of \n     House Concurrent Resolution 68 (106th Congress), upon the \n     adoption of this section the Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate shall adjust balances of direct spending \n     and receipts for all fiscal years to zero.\n       (3) Application to appropriations.--For the purposes of \n     enforcing this resolution, notwithstanding rule 3 of the \n     Budget Scorekeeping Guidelines set forth in the joint \n     explanatory statement of the committee of conference \n     accompanying Conference Report 105-217, during the \n     consideration of any appropriations Act, provisions of an \n     amendment (other than an amendment reported by the Committee \n     on Appropriations including routine and ongoing direct \n     spending or receipts), a motion, or a conference report \n     thereon (only to the extent that such provision was not \n     committed to conference), that would have been estimated as \n     changing direct spending or receipts under section 252 of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (as \n     in effect prior to September 30, 2002) were they included in \n     an Act other than an appropriations Act shall be treated as \n     direct spending or receipts legislation, as appropriate, \n     under section 207 of H. Con. Res. 68 (106th Congress, 1st \n     Session) as amended by this resolution.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. At this point, I thank my very able colleague, the \nranking member of the Budget Committee, who has provided leadership to \nthis body on these issues for a very long time and is keenly committed \nto the budget process, and who is deeply committed, as well, to fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is very late to be talking about \nthis, but better late than never. So we will get something, rather than \nnothing.\n  Perhaps people are wondering what we are doing. If you think back the \nlast 8 or 9 months, a vote will occur in the Senate, only in the \nSenate; a vote is going to occur, and someone stands up and makes a \npoint of order to honor the Budget Act.\n  When you first do one of these, it is something big. I remember \nmaking one and you wonder what is going to happen. The staff told you \nhow to do each little thing, and when it came time to vote, you \nwondered if you really did it. But it is a very heavily used situation \nin the Senate.\n  Members call up an amendment. It costs a lot of money either in \nprogram authority or outlays. The money is not found in the budget \nresolution that should have already been passed. Members get up and \nsay: I am asking that that amendment be deemed invalid because it \nviolates the Budget Act. Another Senator says: I move we waive this \nbudget point of order under the Budget Act. Then Members state which \npart or provision to be waived.\n  What happens in that situation, from that point forward? If you call \nup that amendment, you need 60 votes. Many Americans, especially \nacademicians, are wondering what happened to the Senate: Have we \nstopped being a body where the majority prevailed? Don't we have \nmajority rules anymore?\n  The Budget Act provides an opportunity within its language--and it is \nonly a 25-year-old statute--that if you violate the Budget Act by \nintroducing and calling up an amendment or a bill, you can ask that it \nbe deemed null and void, and the other side says: I want to try a \nwaiver.\n\n  How effective has this been? We put this together with the first \nPresident Bush a number of years ago. We did not know it would be so \neffective. Let's see how effective it has been.\n  Fifteen Budget Act points of order that would have reverted now to \nsimple majority votes, in a budget point of order, have been raised 65 \ntimes. Republicans raised 47, Democrats raised 18. Only eight times did \nthese points of order get waived by having 60 votes or more.\n  When this rule for 60 votes first came about, we were talking about a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. Someone said: How in \nthe world are you going to enforce it? So if you read the \nconstitutional amendments--and the American people thought they \nabsolutely prevailed--it said the only way you could violate that was \nby 60 votes in the Senate. That was borrowed, not knowing how well \neither of them would work, the one that didn't happen or this one, but \nhere it worked.\n  What happened? To those who are listening to this strange talk, that \nside of the aisle, the Democrats in the Senate, had a responsibility \nmany months ago to pass a budget resolution. We have passed a budget \nresolution every year, sooner or later, since we have had a Budget Act. \nYou come down to the floor and you give to the Senate an opportunity to \nvote on the big issues that will be part of a budget, saying how much \nwill be spent and included within it or the entitlement programs, and \nobviously if there are big increases, you show them. Then you adopt \nthat budget resolution.\n  That is the instrument around here for fiscal responsibility. Some \npeople do not think it is strong enough; others think it is too \ncomplicated; others think it is too porous. But nobody denies if you do \nnot have it around, the void will be worse than having it.\n  So months went by, and we did not get a budget resolution because the \nDemocratic side, under their leadership, did not produce one we could \npass, Then we started to talk, the chairman and I, about maybe we ought \nto save a piece of this. This is the piece we decided to try to save.\n  I hope all the Senators understand that, of the issues to be voted \non, the most significant opportunity to save taxpayers' money for the \nnext year is this little resolution.\n  Let me repeat that. If anybody wants to go home and say, ``I really \nwatched out for your taxes, but I voted against this particular \nresolution,'' you can count on this Senator--and I am sure the Chairman \nwill stand up and say count on him--to say you voted ``no'' on the most \nimportant opportunity to save expenditures of this whole year.\n  Somebody will come up with an entitlement program we have all been \nwaiting for and we do not have it because it is too expensive, and we \nwill be stirring around saying, What do we do? We are going to lose \nthis one.\n  We would not lose this one, if this was the law because we would \nstart telling everybody it violates the budget. Then pretty soon when \nwe finish debate, that 60 votes would come into effect. It will not be \nin order unless this little resolution is adopted by the Senate.\n  It is very short. It is only in the Senate. You don't have to take it \nto the House because the budget resolution is a resolution, and this \npart of the budget does not apply in the House. So we have to do it. We \nare doing it. Frankly, I hope whatever the arguments are made, we can \nstraighten them out and vote for it.\n  I told Senators what it said about entitlement spending programs. It \nalso says if this is part of the way you do business, you have this \nresolution adopted and you want to cut taxes, if, in fact, your budget \nis not balanced, you have to put into your budget resources to make up \nwhat you are taking out by taxes.\n\n[[Page S10529]]\n\n  Some will not like that. But we get both together because if you want \none, you have to take the other. That is the way we have done the law. \nThat is how we have lived under it.\n  My friend Senator Gramm, who had been an ardent apostle of this 60-\nvote margin and this approach, has his own version as to why he would \nlike it not to happen for a while. He will offer his own amendment and \nwe will debate again.\n  I hope he will not win unless, after we discuss it with him, it \nessentially is about the same resolution we talked about here, and it \nwill take up expenditures and not taxes.\n  I understand he has a very legitimate concern. But I tell you, so do \nI. I have a big concern. We had 4 years of balanced budgets and that \nwas great. The American people liked that, and the markets in America \nliked that, and the foreign investors liked that, and we had very low \ninterest rates, which were very good for Americans. I do not intend to \ncarry on a debate, unless somebody cares to, as to who caused it. Many \nfactors caused it. But we are now back into an unbalanced situation.\n  If we had had these provisions in when we had a surplus and we would \nnot vote for new expenditures, or to cut taxes unless we had paid for \nthem, or unless they were in the budget resolution, then why wouldn't \nwe have it now when we have this huge deficit? Unless we are providing \nfor something absolutely important--such as war or the continuation of \na recession that lasted a long time--in those cases, obviously the \nSenate would say the 60 votes are not so hard to make; let's vote and \nget it done so we can spend the extra money.\n  We know of no better way to maintain our system--which should have \nbeen 51 votes, majority vote--no way of putting it in a mode where it \ncan take care of excessive spending by corralling excessive spending \nand the extra tax cuts with a resolution that says we choose, \nourselves, to restrain spending by enacting a law, in effect, that \nrestrains us. It puts a little collar around us and tightens us.\n  I have some additional remarks that go into a little more history, \nbut I have a hunch we will talk more at some point. When I first \nstarted talking about this, I went to talk to Senators on that side of \nthe aisle. I note the presence of one of the Senators, who asked me \nthen: If you do this, please put me on. We did add the Senator as we \nsaid we would. I assume the Senator still agrees we ought to have the \n60-vote majority requirement?\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I know the Senator from \nWisconsin has wanted to speak for some time.\n  I speak for the entire Senate when I say how much I appreciate the \nleadership of Senators Conrad and Domenici. I think, as Senator \nDomenici has said, we could have a long, drawn-out debate on why we are \nin this economic situation. The two managers of this bill have decided \nto go the path less traveled in recent months and talk about what is \nreally the best thing for the country. There is no question the best \nthing for the country is to have fiscal constraints that are not \nmandatory unless we pass this legislation. I hope we can quickly \nresolve this issue. It is so important for us and the future of this \ncountry.\n  Again, I compliment and applaud the two managers of this bill for \nworking together in a bipartisan fashion to allow us to get to the end \nof the road, where we need to get on this issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to ask the Senator from Wisconsin \nif he is going to join us.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I support it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am going to stop in a minute and let him speak. But I \nbelieve we need 60 votes at some point on this resolution. I hope \nSenators will understand we have drawn it in the fairest way possible. \nIf somebody thinks we should only apply it to the entitlements, then I \nam afraid half the Senate will vote against it because they would say: \n``It started with both; it is only for 1 year; let's see how it \nworks.''\n  Even in better times, I think we ought to have it on the books rather \nthan have nothing.\n  I will be back to talk to Senators again about it, once Senator Gramm \nhas come to the floor. Maybe he can find some amendments that will make \nhis concerns disappear, in which event this Senator will be helping \nhim.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: Is there any parliamentary order with \nreference to when we might vote on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator to yield for 30 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Judd Gregg be \nshown as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the Chair to confirm that I am an original \ncosponsor of this as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to join the Chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Chairman Conrad, the Ranking Republican Member, \nSenator Domenici, and the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, in \noffering this amendment to extend the budget process.\n  Exercising the power of the purse is among Congress's most important \nresponsibilities. Justifiably, there has been much concern in the \nNation about how Congress has exercised and will exercise its \nresponsibilities under the Constitution's war powers, and certainly \nthat is a grave and consequential responsibility. But we should recall \nthat the way that the Congress ended the Vietnam war was through the \nexercise of the power of the purse, by constraining spending. The power \nof the purse is a momentous power.\n  Article I, section 9, of the Constitution reserves the power of the \npurse with Congress through the admonition that:\n\n     [n]o Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law . . . .\n\n  Interpreting that power, our Founder James Madison wrote in the \n``Federalist Papers'':\n\n       They, in a word, hold the purse that powerful instrument by \n     which we behold, in the history of the British Constitution, \n     an infant and humble representation of the people gradually \n     enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance, and \n     finally reducing, as far as it seems to have wished, all the \n     overgrown prerogatives of the other branches of the \n     government. This power over the purse may, in fact, be \n     regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which \n     any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the \n     people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for \n     carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\n\n  That is what James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 58.\n  Congress exercises that power of the purse through its rules and \nthrough the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The strength of \nCongress's power of the purse depends on the orderly rules that the \nCongressional budget process provides.\n  Regrettably, those rules and that Congressional budget process \nlargely expired at the beginning of this month. That is why it is so \nimportant that the Senate adopt this amendment to extend the budget \nprocess.\n  Our responsibilities under the Constitution would be enough of a \nreason to extend these rules. But added to that, and making the need \nfor budget rules even more pressing, is the dire turn of affairs that \nour government's finances have taken in this last year-and-a-half.\n  In January of last year, the Congressional Budget Office projected \nthat, in the fiscal year just ended, fiscal year 2002, the Government \nwould run a unified budget surplus of $313 billion. In its latest \nprojections, however, CBO now estimates that we will have run a unified \nbudget deficit of $157 billion. That is a dramatic swing of $470 \nbillion--the disappearance of nearly half a trillion dollars--for that \n1 year alone.\n\n  If, as the law requires, we do not count Social Security surpluses \ntoward that total, then the picture is even more alarming. In January \nof last year, CBO projected that for fiscal year 2002, the government \nwould run a surplus of $142 billion, without using Social Security \nsurpluses. Now, CBO projects a deficit of $314 billion, not counting \nSocial Security. If that projection holds, it will have been the third-\nlargest on-budget deficit in our Nation's history, rivaling those of \nthe bad old days of 1991 and 1992, when the\n\n[[Page S10530]]\n\nUnited States logged its record highest on-budget deficits. Instead of \nusing those Social Security surpluses to prepare for the coming needs \nof that vital program, the Government has instead been using them to \nfund other Government programs.\n  And the baseline projections for the fiscal year just begun bring no \nrespite. For the year that started at the beginning of this month, \nfiscal year 2003, CBO projects baseline deficits similar to those for \nthe year just ended. For 2003, CBO projects a unified budget deficit of \n$145 billion, and a deficit of $315 billion, not counting Social \nSecurity.\n  And that is before taking into account the costs of a possible war \nwith Iraq. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that American \ntaxpayers may have to come up with between $100 billion and $200 \nbillion more to wage a war in Iraq, according to President Bush's chief \neconomic adviser. He said that we could have to add $100 to $200 \nbillion to the non-Social Security deficit that CBO says will already \nbe $315 billion this year. If those predictions prove true, yielding \non-budget deficits of $415 to $515 billion, then the government would \nbe running the largest on-budget deficits in our nation's history, by \nfar.\n  Looking into the years to come, one can see little if any relief from \nthe damaging fiscal outlook. CBO projects that under current policies, \nunified budget deficits will continue until 2006. And without counting \nSocial Security, CBO projects that deficits will continue until 2011, \nwhen the sunset of the tax cut brings us back to on-budget surplus \nagain, just barely. And it is among the most fervently-held articles of \nfaith among many on the other side of the aisle that those tax cuts \nshall not be allowed to sunset.\n  Over the next 10 years, CBO projects a deficit of more than $1.5 \ntrillion, without counting Social Security. And that is before taking \ninto account a war with Iraq, before taking into account a prescription \ndrug benefit that most Senators agree is needed to bring Medicare up to \ndate, and before taking into account any of the many additional tax \ncuts that the President and many in the Senate would still like to \nenact.\n  It is sad to say that there is no way to look at these numbers \nwithout coming to this conclusion.\n  The government is in dire fiscal circumstances. I am concerned that \nmany elected officials have not yet come to realize how grave those \ncircumstances are.\n  We must not forget why sound fiscal policy is important. We must stop \nrunning deficits because they cause the government to use the surpluses \nof the Social Security Trust Fund for other government purposes, rather \nthan to pay down the debt and help our nation prepare for the coming \nretirement of the Baby Boom generation.\n  We must stop running deficits because every dollar that we add to the \nFederal debt is another dollar that we are forcing our children to pay \nback in higher taxes or fewer government benefits in the future. When \nwe in this generation choose to spend on current consumption and to \naccumulate debt for our children's generation to pay, we do nothing \nless than rob our children of their own choices which they deserve the \nopportunity make. We make our choices to spend on our wants, but we \nsaddle them with debts that they must pay from their tax dollars and \nthe sweat of their brow. That is not right.\n\n  That is why Senator Gregg and I offered an amendment in the Budget \nCommittee markup of the budget resolution to extend budget rules and \nset appropriations caps for 5 years.\n  That is why Senator Gregg and I offered an amendment on the Senate \nfloor on June 5 to extend the budget rules and set appropriations caps \nfor 5 years.\n  That is why I joined with our distinguished and very able chairman, \nChairman Conrad, on June 20 in yet another attempt to extend the budget \nrules and set appropriations caps for 2 years. Fifty-nine Senators \nvoted for extending the budget process on that day, just one short of \nthe number we need to adopt such a measure.\n  That is why I am joining with my Colleagues the Chairman and Ranking \nRepublican Member of the Budget Committee and Senator Gregg to offer \nthis amendment to extend the budget process today.\n  Yes, I would prefer to strengthen the budget process. I would prefer \nto do more.\n  But this is the bare minimum that we should do. The Conrad-Domenici-\nFeingold-Gregg amendment would provide some minimal restraint on \nentitlement spending and tax cuts. And we can do no less.\n  The Senate must preserve its vital role in exercising the power of \nthe purse that the Constitution vests in Congress.\n  We must stop using Social Security surpluses to fund other government \nprograms. We must stop piling up debt for our children to pay off. We \nmust adopt this amendment and extend the budget process.\n  I again want to thank the chairman for his leadership and the \nopportunity to work with him on this issue. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. \nFeingold, for his strong support of this amendment. I also want to \nthank him for his contribution on the Budget Committee. He has been a \ndisciplined voice for fiscal responsibility. He has been a leader in \ntrying to bring to the attention of our colleagues how dramatically the \nbudget circumstance of the Federal Government has changed. I thank \nSenator Feingold for reminding our colleagues of where we were a year \nago, where we are now, and where we are headed.\n  It is critically important that our colleagues, the others on the \nother side of the Capitol in the other body, and the American people \nunderstand how dramatically our fiscal circumstances have changed.\n  A year ago, we were told we could expect over the next 10 years \nnearly $6 trillion in surpluses. Now we know with the latest look from \nthe Congressional Budget Office that the money is all gone. If we were \njust to put in place the President's proposals for spending and revenue \nover the next decade, there wouldn't be $6 trillion of surpluses. There \nwouldn't be $4 trillion of surpluses. There wouldn't be $2 trillion. \nThere would be $400 billion of deficits. That is from $5.6 trillion, \nwhich we were told a year ago we would have in the surpluses over the \nnext decade, to $400 billion of deficits. That is a $6 trillion swing \nin 1 year.\n  Now the question before this body is we are going to leave this place \nwithout the fiscal discipline that helped us get deficits under control \nonce before in our history--after the 1980s when deficits were \nexploding, and we put in place a framework to get us back on track, a \nframework that worked, a framework that moved us from deficits to \nsurpluses, that led to the longest economic expansion in our history, \nthat led to the lowest inflation in 30 years, and the lowest \nunemployment in 30 years. Are we going to abandon all of that now?\n  That is the question before this body. Are we going to have the \nfiscal discipline that will be critically important to economic \nrecovery? That is the question.\n  That is what this amendment is about. That is why it is important. \nThat is why I thank Senator Gregg, Senator Feingold, and Senator \nDomenici for cosponsoring this amendment. That is why I ask my \ncolleagues to adopt it.\n  This is important. It is important not just for the notion of fiscal \ndiscipline, but it is important for the economy. When the markets see \nthat we are serious about living within our means, we know that means \ngood things for interest rates, and we know that means good things for \nthe economic strength of America.\n  That is what this amendment is about. I know there are some who have \na different view. I can't think of any good thing that will come from \ndoing away with the budget disciplines that have worked so effectively \nin this Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope those who wish to speak on the matter \nnow before the Senate will do so. It is 4 o'clock. We understand there \nare a number from each side who wish to speak. We hope that will occur.\n\n[[Page S10531]]\n\n  Others wish to speak on other issues. If they feel so inclined, I \nhope they will come and speak now. We would like to have as little down \ntime as possible before we go out this evening. If there are no \namendments or further debate, of course, we can move to third reading. \nI am told there may be some amendments, but I don't think either leader \nwants us to wait around here doing nothing on this resolution.\n  If there are going to be amendments, I hope Members will come and \noffer them. If not, as I indicated, we can move to third reading at any \ntime.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 4886 to S. Res. 304 is the \npending business.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10531-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10531-S10546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3018\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on October 1, Senator Grassley and I \nintroduced a bipartisan Medicare package, the Beneficiary Access to \nCare and Medicare Equity Act. Our bill would address a number of \nMedicare payment changes--primarily reductions--that went into effect \nat the start of the fiscal year. At the beginning of the fiscal year, \nMedicare payment reductions automatically went into effect in many \nareas. What were they? Cuts to home health services. Cuts to nursing \nhomes. Cuts to hospitals. One of the most damaging cuts of all, for \nMedicare physician payments, is scheduled to take place beginning \nJanuary 1, 2003. This is the second year in a row such physician \npayment cuts would occur. Mr. President, these cuts threaten access to \ncare for tens of millions of seniors across America.\n  Sadly, since this bill was introduced, the Administration has \nindicated that preventing these cuts from going into effect is simply \nnot a priority.\n  Tom Scully, the administrator of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices made this clear last Tuesday. He said:\n\n       It would be fine with the Bush administration if Congress \n     does not pass Medicare provider payment legislation this \n     year.\n       If I had to guess right now--I guess there won't be any \n     give-back bill.\n\n  The White House Office of Management and Budget Director, Mitch \nDaniels, also said he thinks ``the Federal Government cannot afford to \npass a Medicare provider give-back bill.''\n  Mr. President, the Administration says it cannot afford, after all \nthe billions that have been spent elsewhere, to restore some of the \ncuts that have already gone into effect.\n  The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee has been equally \nunenthusiastic about addressing these cuts.\n  The Administration and the chairman of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee may believe this legislation is not a priority. I \nrespectfully disagree. This bill is a priority. It is a priority for \nevery senior who receives home health care. It is a priority for every \nsenior who receives nursing home care. It is a priority for all \nAmericans of all ages who depend on our teaching hospitals. And it is a \npriority to anyone who cares about ensuring our seniors receive access \nto physician services.\n  Again, a large cut goes into effect for physician services after \nJanuary 1. Last January, physicians saw their payments cut by 5.4 \npercent. Already some doctors are talking about leaving Medicare. Why? \nBecause they are concerned that Medicare payments may not be enough to \nallow them to pay for the costs of caring for seniors.\n  If this legislation I have introduced with Senator Grassley does not \npass, physician payments will be cut again by over 4 percent. This must \nbe changed.\n  Our bill also is a priority for our children. Under current law, \nfunds for the Children's Health Insurance Program that have not yet \nbeen spent are scheduled to be returned to the Federal Treasury. I \nthink this money should remain where it belongs--with the States, \nhelping children. It is helping children who need health insurance \nbenefits. We have about 9,500 Montana kids, and many more children in \nmany other States, who are currently receiving coverage through CHIP. \nIf our bill does not pass, America's kids stand to lose as much as $2.8 \nbillion.\n  This bill is also a priority for States. We have all heard about the \nbudget problems threatening States in every corner of our Nation, about \nthe possibility of deep cuts to important programs and services, such \nas Medicaid. Our bill will send an extra $5 billion in fiscal relief to \nthe States to forestall these cuts.\n  This bill is a priority for rural America. From Montana to Maine, the \nMedicare payment system continues to discriminate against rural \npatients and rural providers. Our bill takes strong steps to address \nthese regional inequities.\n  This bill is a priority. I cannot imagine the administration saying \nthis is not a priority, given all the other areas where we spend \ndollars. Defense, homeland security, and other issues are vitally \nimportant. But our Nation's health is also important, and we should \ninvest in it accordingly.\n  I cannot believe this administration is saying it is not a priority \nto prevent these cuts from taking effect. I cannot believe that. \nNevertheless, that is what they say. This legislation tries to address \nthat situation so those cuts do not go into effect.\n\n  I said this bill is a priority. It is a priority for our seniors. It \nis a priority for our children. It is a priority for our State \ngovernments and rural areas in our country, for anyone who cares about \npreserving access to quality care in America.\n  I might add, this is a bipartisan bill. Senator Grassley and I have \nworked very hard on this legislation. Senator Grassley is the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee. We worked together at every point to \ncraft this bill. We sought input from our colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle. We met with our respective caucuses. We worked closely with \nmembers of the Finance Committee.\n  When the Senator from Oklahoma objected to my unanimous consent \nrequest almost two weeks ago, he suggested this bill appeared out of \nnowhere on the Senate floor. That could not be further from the truth.\n  The Senator also objected to this bill because we lack official CBO \nscoring. That issue has been cleared, as we received an official \nestimate of the bill on Friday. CBO estimates this bill would cost \nabout $43.8 billion over 10 years. We guessed it would cost about $43 \nbillion. CBO said our guess is pretty close; it is $43.8 billion.\n  I believe that is the minimum investment we should make to address \nthe priorities I mentioned. So today as the Medicare payment cuts go \ninto their 16th day, and as many more cuts loom on the horizon in \nJanuary, I will again ask unanimous consent to pass S. 3018.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 3018, a bill to amend title 18 of the Social \nSecurity Act; that the bill be read a third time and passed; that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, \nunfortunately this bill did not go through committee. I ask the Senator \nif he would modify his request to refer the bill to the Finance \nCommittee to be reported out within 48 hours. Will he be willing to \nmodify his request?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am sorry, I was distracted.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Correct me if I am wrong, but the Senator is trying to \npass his bill which never had a markup in the Finance Committee. I \nhappen to be a member of the Finance Committee. I would like to offer \nan amendment. I know Senator Snowe has an amendment she would like to \noffer. Senator Sessions has an amendment he would like to offer, or \nmyself or someone else on the committee to offer on his behalf.\n\n[[Page S10532]]\n\n  We would like other Members to have a chance to amend the bill. So \nwill the Senator be willing to modify his request to request this bill \nbe referred to the Finance Committee for 48 hours for a markup so all \nmembers on the Finance Committee would have a chance to have input on \nthis particular bill?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in responding to my good friend from \nOklahoma, I have a couple points. First, as my good friend well knows, \nsince he is a member of the committee, this issue, the Medicare \nprovider bill, has been discussed for many weeks. It was in the Finance \nCommittee informally, with several discussions and meetings.\n  In order to prevent the harm that these Medicare cuts represent, I \nbelieve, and I think Senator Grassley believes--we should check with \nhim and make doubly certain--that we should pass this bill now. It \nmakes more sense to pass this consensus bill than to go back and try to \nmake it perfect in the view of some other Senators.\n  Second, there are very few days remaining in the session. There are \nvery few days remaining before the election occurs. What does that \nmean? It means under the Senate rules, anybody who wants to frustrate \nthe will of the majority, frustrate the will of 99 Senators, can \nessentially do so by objecting or by offering amendments.\n  The Senator knows this because we have had four separate votes on the \nissues he is indirectly referring to. Any attempt to refer legislation \nback to a committee for the purpose of offering amendments is really a \nveto tactic. It is an indirect way of accomplishing the same objective \nby objecting. As the Senator well knows, the amendments he is thinking \nof will not pass the Finance Committee, will not pass the floor, and \nwill have the effect of preventing the Medicare provider bill from \nbeing enacted.\n  So in good faith, in order to help millions of Americans, \nparticularly the millions of seniors who need help right away, I could \nnot agree to that modification. If there are other amendments on other \nissues such as prescription drug benefits, which I know the Senator is \nindirectly referring to, let us try at a later date to get that passed. \nWe have tried for months, almost a year, to get prescription drug \nbenefits passed, but there has been no breakthrough, there has been no \nagreement.\n  But there has been agreement on this Medicare provider bill, basic \nagreement within the committee and basic agreement between myself, the \nchairman of the committee, and Senator Grassley, the ranking member of \nthe committee. Let's not let perfection be the enemy of the good.\n  Seniors need help. They need help right now. The cuts have already \nstarted to take effect. So let's pass this legislation, and then we can \ndeal at a later date with the issues to which the Senator is referring. \nLet us get this bill passed so the seniors can get some help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will repeat to my friend and colleague, \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, I will work with him to try to \ncome up with a package that can pass this Congress this year. I want it \nto pass, and I want it to be signed into law. To come up with a package \nthat the administration is opposed to means it will not become law.\n  Some of us want to alleviate some of the problems. This particular \nbill the Senator has asked to pass by unanimous consent, which means no \nSenator gets to offer any amendment, flies in the face of Senate \ntradition.\n  Senate tradition has always been--I did a little homework on \nMedicare. Twenty-two of twenty-three significant Medicare changes \npassed the Finance Committee in a bipartisan fashion and passed the \nSenate usually with overwhelming numbers--not all the time but usually \nwith overwhelming numbers. So I was sincere in saying let us refer it \nback to committee, let us have some amendments, let us have some votes, \nand maybe we can come up with a bipartisan package that then will have \nmomentum to pass on the floor.\n  I might remind my friend and colleague from Montana, my suggestion \nwas that is the way we should do the prescription drug bill. We did not \ndo that on prescription drugs, and we ended up with no bill. Seniors \ngot zero, and I am afraid if we continue going down this path on the \nso-called Medicare adjustment give-back bill, they will end up getting \nzero. I would like for us to provide some assistance by passing \nsomething that could become law.\n  When I objected to this previously--I believe it was a week ago \nFriday, October 4--there was not a Congressional Budget Office scoring. \nThe bill was just introduced, and I said: How much is it going to cost? \nTo my colleague's credit, he said about forty-some-odd billion dollars, \nand it was forty-some-odd billions dollars. I said: How much will it \ncost the first 2 years? Because sometimes these 10-year estimates do \nnot mean a lot but the first year or two does.\n  He said that over the first 2 years it would be $10 billion. We did \nget CBO's estimate, and the first year's cost, 2003, was $10.1 billion. \nThe second year's cost, 2004, was $11.8 billion. So the total cost is \nalmost $22 billion the first 2 years, so it is twice as much as it was \nestimated in the original 2 years. That is real money. Can we do this \nright?\n  We have a letter from AARP, and I ask unanimous consent that this \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2002.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: The legislative session is drawing \n     to a close with no Medicare drug coverage in sight. Once \n     again, after years of waiting and with drug costs soaring, \n     beneficiaries and their families find that they get no help \n     from Congress. What they face instead is yet another round of \n     provider ``givebacks'' that will raise their Part B premiums.\n       The provider pay hikes enacted in the Balanced Budget \n     Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) and the Medicare, Medicaid, and \n     SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) \n     are already costing beneficiaries $14 billion over ten years \n     in higher Part B premiums. The over $40 billion givebacks \n     package being considered by the Senate will raise Part B \n     premiums even higher--$6 billion in the first five years \n     alone. Less than 10 percent of that package would directly \n     benefit Medicare beneficiaries--the people the program is \n     supposed to be serving.\n       These added costs to beneficiaries come in addition to \n     double-digit hikes in prescription drug costs for older and \n     disabled Americans, many of whom have little or no options \n     for drug coverage. Employers continue to reduce or eliminate \n     health care coverage. Medigap premiums continue to rise. And \n     now, nine more Medicare+Choice plans are pulling out of \n     Medicare.\n       AARP opposes giveback provisions without drug coverage in \n     Medicare, and our 35 million members will not understand how \n     the Senate can take this course of action. Our members want \n     providers who treat Medicare patients to be paid fairly. \n     Errors or miscalculations in Medicare payment formulas should \n     be corrected. Fiscal relief to states to avoid drastic \n     Medicaid cuts should be addressed. Those can be done for much \n     less than $40 billion. And it must be done at a far smaller \n     cost to the millions of Medicare beneficiaries still waiting \n     for the Senate to fulfill its long overdue promise of \n     affordable prescription drug coverage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William D. Novelli.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. AARP, which I do not always agree with, basically says--\nI will read this one sentence:\n\n       AARP opposes give-back provisions without drug coverage in \n     Medicare, and our 35 million members will not understand how \n     the Senate can take this course of action.\n\n  They have stated they are opposed to doing a give-back bill on a \nstand-alone basis.\n  The House passed a Medicare adjustment bill, or give-back bill, in \naddition to passing prescription drugs. I know the Senator from Maine \nhas indicated an interest in trying to do that. Asking unanimous \nconsent to pass it without amendment would deny the Senator from Maine \nthe opportunity to offer an amendment either in committee or on the \nfloor. It would deny the Senator from Alabama the chance to do more for \na rural provider wage adjustment, which I know Senator Sessions has \nrepeatedly said he wanted to address. He should at least have that \nopportunity, either in committee and/or on the floor. To do something \nstrictly by unanimous consent denies them that opportunity.\n  I make those points, but I am still willing to work with our \ncolleagues to see if we can do an affordable bill, one\n\n[[Page S10533]]\n\nthat can pass both the House and the Senate and be signed by the \nPresident this year. Maybe that is this week, maybe it is next week, \nmaybe it is the week after election, but I am willing to do that this \nyear. I am willing to try to get all parties together so we can \nactually not make campaign statements but we can change the law and \nhave that law changed by a signature of the President. I think that is \ndoable, but we are going to have to get all parties together, and to my \nknowledge that has not happened at this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to join my colleagues on the \nSenate Finance Committee in cosponsoring S. 3018, the Beneficiary \nAccess to Care and Medicare Equity Act of 2002. Although this bill does \nnot include all that I would have wanted, and indeed includes some \nprovisions with which I disagree, on balance, I believe it is necessary \nto pass such a bill this year in order to provide needed assistance to \nboth Medicare providers and beneficiaries.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to express my strong support \nfor provisions contained in S. 3018 which increase reimbursement rates \nfor physicians, skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies. \nPhysicians' Medicare reimbursements were reduced by approximately 5 \npercent in 2002. Unfortunately, the estimates used by the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, when calculating the physician \npayment formula were erroneous in some cases, and, regrettably, \nphysicians will continue to be subjected to large cuts in future years \nif Congress does not take appropriate action. This is simply not fair \nto physicians or their patients.\n  Doctors in Utah have been calling me about this issue since late last \nyear and have explained to me over and over again that these reductions \nwill have a lasting, negative impact on patient care. Some Utah \nphysicians have told me that they will no longer accept Medicare \npatients or, even worse, are thinking about dropping out of the \nMedicare program all together. And what impact does that have on \npatients, especially those in rural areas? In my opinion, there is no \nquestion it could lead to reductions in the number of Medicare \nproviders in rural areas. And, for those who are left, it will be \nvirtually impossible to spend quality time with patients.\n  Is this our goal? I do not think so. And I will be doing everything \npossible to increase reimbursement rates to physicians to help them \ncontinue to provide the high quality care that patients so deserve.\n  Another important component of S. 3018 is the valuable assistance \nthis bill provides to rural states, such as my home state of Utah. S. \n3018 incorporates many of the recommendations included in the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission's, MedPAC, 2001 report on rural health \ncare. This report found that beneficiaries living in rural areas \nencounter more obstacles when receiving health care than those who live \nin urban areas, primarily due to cost barriers. In addition, the MedPAC \nreport stated that rural hospitals have had lower Medicare inpatient \nmargins than urban hospitals throughout the 1990s. This gap has widened \nfrom less than a percentage point in 1992 to 10 percentage points in \n1999. These statistics not only apply to inpatient care, but also to \nmost Medicare services in rural regions of our country. In the end, the \nreport states the obvious, current Medicare payment policy places rural \ncommunities at a distinct disadvantage and changes are necessary. S. \n3018 takes steps toward addressing these important concerns and \nattempts to provide equity between rural and urban Medicare providers \nand patients. In my book, this is sorely needed.\n  In addition, it is important to me that Medicare funding for Skilled \nNursing Facilities, SNFs, is included in S. 3018. I have heard from \nfacilities across my State about the dire financial situation many SNFs \nare facing due to reduced Medicare spending in fiscal year 2003. SNFs \ncare for our nation's most vulnerable seniors and provide valuable \nmedical assistance to these Medicare beneficiaries and their families. \nI have been working with both Finance Committee Chairman Senator Max \nBaucus and Ranking Republican Chuck Grassley on this important matter. \nWhile I am pleased that the Senate Medicare provider give-back bill \nprovides more money to SNFs than the House-passed bill, I believe that \nthe funding level for SNFs should be even higher. I intend to continue \nto work with my House and Senate colleagues on improving the Medicare \nreimbursement rates for SNFs.\n  I also am pleased that S. 3018 includes provisions that will \neliminate the 15 percent reduction in home health payments. There is no \nquestion in my mind that home health services are among the most \nvaluable Medicare provides. Home health agencies are providing \ncompassionate, caring services which, quite simply, help keep \nbeneficiaries out of more costly institutional settings. Home health \nagencies across my State have urged me to support the elimination of \nthis cut. They have shown me how these potential cuts could cause many \nhome health providers in Utah to go out of business. Over my Senate \ncareer, I have been extremely supportive of home health services, and \nwill continue my advocacy for this important program.\n  The preceding things having been said, one great concern that I have \nwith S. 3018 is the impact that this legislation could have on small \ndurable equipment manufacturers in Utah. The bill contains provisions \non competitive bidding which my constituents believe could drive them \nout of business. On the one hand, I do recognize the need to ensure \nefficiency in spending for scarce Medicare dollars. On the other hand, \nthough, I am deeply concerned about the effect this legislation could \nhave on these companies. I am working with CMS officials and my Utah \nmanufacturers to resolve concerns that have been raised about the \ncompetitive bidding program included in this bill and will do \neverything possible to protect small durable medical equipment \ncompanies in Utah and across the country.\n  Let me also mention the Medicaid program. There is no secret that the \nmajority of States are running deficits in this program, expected to \nreach $58 billion during this fiscal year. Adding to the urgency is the \nfact that States have also used up two-thirds of their cash and their \n``rainy day'' funds. According to a recent survey by the National \nConference of State Legislatures, more than 40 States had instituted \nsome kind of spending freeze or an across-the-board cut and 22 states \nhave cut Medicaid funds.\n  Included in the Baucus-Grassley legislation is a provision that would \ndirect some funds back to the States for their Medicaid programs. This \nlegislation increases the Federal medical assistance percentage by 1.3 \npecent for 12 months. Additionally, it directs $1 billion in state \nfiscal relief grants for Fiscal Year 2003.\n\n  In a perfect world, this is not the approach I would have preferred \nwe take to address the issue of fiscal relief for States. I have doubts \nabout the advisability of using an entitlement program to address a \nshortfall in State funds. The precedence for linking an entitlement \nprogram to the economy is unsound policy, in my opinion. If we had \nadopted that policy years ago and were consistent in following it in \ngood times as well as bad, FMAP rates would have been lowered in the \n1990s when States were experiencing surpluses, resulting in the current \nFMAP rates being much lower than they are now. I am also very concerned \nthat this ``temporary fix'' will end up becoming permanent. Both the \nFederal Government and the States do not have the best record when it \ncomes to cutting off a funding source we may have come to rely upon. \nHowever, I do recognize that States are being forced to cut back \nessential services to low and middle income individuals and families as \na result of States' considerable budget deficits.\n  Additionally, this legislation includes a much-needed fix for the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, CHIP. Without this provision, some \n$2.8 billion of unspent CHIP funds are scheduled to revert back to the \nTreasury. It is critical that States are able to access these funds. \nSome States experienced significant challenges when implementing their \nCHIP programs. However, they are meeting that challenge and have \n``ramped up'' considerably. They now are in a position to draw down \nthese dollars. Given these uncertain economic times, we should not \ndeprive states of funding to help finance the social safety net.\n\n[[Page S10534]]\n\n  I also believe the provision prohibiting States from using their CHIP \nmonies to cover childless adults is wise policy. While I am extremely \nsympathetic to the needs of the uninsured, it is important to note that \nSenator Kennedy and I worked very hard to pass the CHIP program as a \nway of helping the 10 million uninsured children in the country. As the \ntitle reflects, the bill was solely directed at ``Children.'' Indeed, \nit was not the health insurance program, HIP, nor the Adult Health \nInsurance Program, AHIP, but the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nCHIP.\n  If we would like to help needy, uninsured adults, by all means, let's \nlook at how we can accomplish that. In fact, Senator Wyden and I have \nrecently introduced a bill to jump-start that discussion. However, in \nthe meantime, we should not distort the focus of a program that is \nworking well to help its intended participants and lose the sense of \nmission that has made it so effective.\n  Finally, I have serious concerns about the provisions in S. 3018 on \nthe Section 1115 waiver process for Medicaid and CHIP waivers. I will \nbe submitting a separate statement for the record which will outline my \nthoughts on this issue in more detail.\n  In conclusion, I believe that passage of S. 3018, the Beneficiary \nAccess to Care and Medicare Equity Act, is critical for both Medicare \nproviders and beneficiaries. This legislation, while not perfect, will \nprovide access to quality and affordable health care to Medicare \nbeneficiaries across the country. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill and, in my opinion, we must pass this legislation before we \nadjourn. Partisan politics needs to be put aside because this issue is \nmuch too important to both Medicare beneficiaries and providers. \nMedicare providers, and most importantly, the beneficiaries they serve, \nare depending on us to get this job done, once and for all. Let's not \nlet them down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the two most powerful words in the Senate \nare ``I object.'' The Senator from Oklahoma has demonstrated the power \nof that by just objecting to the request by the Senator from Montana to \nbring up the Medicare provider reimbursement legislation.\n  Some seem to believe there is no urgency about this issue. The \nSenator from Montana has described bipartisan legislation that I \nsupport very strongly and that I think it is urgent we pass. This is \nbipartisan legislation addressing an urgent, serious, and difficult \nproblem. Let me describe it from the standpoints of two different types \nof health care providers.\n  First of all, with respect to nursing homes, on October 1, long-term \ncare facilities experienced a cliff, or a sharp drop, in their Medicare \nreimbursement. As of October 1, skilled nursing homes face a 10-\npercent, or $1.7 billion, reduction in their payment rates for the \ncurrent fiscal year, and a 19-percent cut in 2004 unless Congress acts \nto respond to it.\n  We can talk about numbers, this can all be about finances, but my \ncolleagues know what it really is about. It is about the quality of \ncare for people in our nursing homes. If the decision is made not to \nreverse these cuts for long-term care, the quality of care is going to \nbe diminished for those folks who are in nursing homes.\n  I suppose one of the saddest days of my life was when I took my \nfather to a nursing home some months after my mother had been killed. I \nwill never forget the moment we decided he had to go to a nursing home \nand then when I took him there. He did not want to go. The time he \nspent in that nursing home meant I spent a lot of time there as well, \nand I came to understand what long-term care was all about and what the \nquality of care for our senior citizens was about. I have deep \nadmiration for the people who ran that nursing home. I do not know what \nmy father would have done without the care he received in that \nfacility.\n  In my State, we rank right near the top in this country with respect \nto the number of nursing home beds per resident in the State are \nconcerned. Yet, on October 1, at a time when nursing homes are already \nstruggling and do not have the money they need, we find this cliff \nexists where they get a reduction in reimbursement--and a pretty \nsubstantial one at that.\n  Now we are nearing the last few days of this session and my colleague \nMr. Baucus brings to the floor legislation that I think makes great \nsense. It is bipartisan. The chairman and the ranking member of the \nFinance Committee are sponsors of this legislation. They say we need to \nget this done, it is urgent, but we have people who stand up and say, I \nobject.\n  There are a thousand reasons to object, but there is only one good \nreason to do what we need to do here to protect the quality of care for \nvulnerable seniors in nursing homes, and that is because it is our \nresponsibility.\n  I have talked about nursing homes and how important they are. The \nsame is true with hospitals. For hospitals in my State, and I suspect \nthe States of Montana, Iowa, and many other States, the level of \nMedicare reimbursement is going to determine whether we have hospitals \nthat are available to people who need acute care, who need emergency \ncare, in the future.\n  Now, we have the opportunity to do something to provide decent \npayment to these hospitals.\n  Under the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, everyone in this Chamber \nunderstands we cut too deeply. We understand that. The fact is, we have \nhospitals and nursing homes on the brink of going out of business or \ncutting back services. Rural hospitals, just about all of the hospitals \nin my State, are disadvantaged by lower reimbursement rates. In my \nState, and many others, rural and small urban hospitals receive a \nstandard payment that is woefully inadequate. We have to fix that. When \nyou take a look at the standardized payment for hospital payments, you \nrealize the standardized payment is not standard at all. This \nlegislation fixes that concern.\n  I know it is the eleventh hour. The fact is that Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley have offered a piece of legislation that everyone in \nthis Chamber knows must be done. Yet we have people walking around as \nif to say this is not an urgent problem. Check yourself into a nursing \nhome and tell me it is not an urgent problem. Check into a rural \nhospital and check the financial records as you walk through the front \ndoor and tell me it is not an urgent problem.\n  We spend a lot of time in the Senate during the year on things not so \nserious. But there is a serious problem with Medicare reimbursement. We \noften treat the light too seriously and the serious too lightly. This \nis serious. We have a responsibility now to deal with this issue.\n  I hope the Senator from Montana will come to the floor every single \nday we are in session and make the same unanimous consent request until \nat some point we will not see people standing up to object. I hope he \nwill come tomorrow and I hope next week. At some point we will see this \nSenate and the other body on the other side of this Capitol say: Yes, \nlet's do this. We have a responsibility to get this done for nursing \nhomes, for hospitals, and for other providers.\n  I did not mention physician reimbursement. I will mention that when I \ntalk tomorrow about this subject.\n  I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Montana and the \nleadership of Senator Grassley. This legislation is the right thing for \nright now. Not next year, not the year after, but right now. It will \nhave an impact on the quality of care for the American people in \nhospitals and nursing homes across this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Mrs. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am deeply disheartened by what I am \nhearing today, the refusal to refer the Medicare provider give-back \nlegislation to the Finance Committee for the deliberation and the \nconsideration it deserves. Time and again this Senate has circumvented \nthe traditional and conventional procedures to undermine the \npossibility of enacting a prescription drug benefit for our Nation's \nseniors.\n  It is clear to me if my colleague from the other side of the aisle \nwish to achieve and accomplish a victory for our Nation's seniors, they \nwill work with me and others--the Senator from Oklahoma, those of us \nwho worked on this legislation in the committee--who crafted a \ntripartisan package to provide comprehensive prescription drug\n\n[[Page S10535]]\n\ncoverage for our Nation's seniors. The Senator from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords, Senator Breaux from Louisiana, Senator Grassley from Iowa, \nthe ranking member of the committee, worked together. We could make it \npossible.\n  I am deeply disappointed by what I am hearing today. Again, it gets \nback to the all-or-nothing proposition. Some have said, we have already \nhad votes on this issue. What does that have to do with our Nation's \nseniors who are denied the possibility of having a prescription drug \nbenefit included in their Medicare package? That is who we should be \ntalking about today. It is not an all-or-nothing proposition. We can do \nboth. It is possible to do the Medicare provider give-back package the \nSenator from Montana is referring to.\n  It is also possible to do a prescription drug benefit for our \nNation's seniors and include it in one package. There is no reason we \nhave to be in any other situation than including and considering these \nissues in tandem. That is the desire of the Senator from Oklahoma, \nSenator Nickles. That is my desire. That is the desire of our Nation's \nseniors. In fact, it is the desire of the largest organization that \nrepresent our Nation's seniors, AARP.\n  I know the letter has already been printed in the Record, but I will \nread it. It is important to read.\n\n       The legislative session is drawing to a close with no \n     Medicare drug coverage in sight. Once again, after years of \n     waiting and with drug costs soaring, beneficiaries and their \n     families find that they get no help from Congress. What they \n     face instead is yet another round of provider ``givebacks'' \n     that will raise their Part B premiums.\n       The provider pay hikes enacted in the Balanced Budget \n     Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) and the Medicare, Medicaid, and \n     SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) \n     are already costing beneficiaries $14 billion over ten years \n     in higher Part B premiums. The over $40 billion givebacks \n     package being considered by the Senate will raise Part B \n     premiums even higher--$6 billion in the first five years \n     alone. Less than 10 percent of that package would directly \n     benefit Medicare beneficiaries--the people the program is \n     supposed to be serving.\n       These added costs to beneficiaries come in addition to \n     double-digit hikes in prescription drug costs for older and \n     disabled Americans, many of whom have little or no options \n     for drug coverage. Employers continue to reduce or eliminate \n     health care coverage. Medigap premiums continue to rise. And \n     now, nine more Medicare+Choice plans are pulling out of \n     Medicare.\n       AARP opposes giveback provisions without drug coverage in \n     Medicare, and our 35 million members will not understand how \n     the Senate can take this course of action. Our members want \n     providers who treat Medicare patients to be paid fairly. \n     Errors of miscalculations in Medicare payment formulas should \n     be corrected. Fiscal relief to states to avoid drastic \n     Medicaid cuts should be addressed. Those can be done for much \n     less than $40 billion.\n\n  The fact is AARP, our Nation's largest organization that represents \nthe seniors' interest, is opposed to passing a give-back program \nwithout including a prescription drug benefit for our Nation's seniors.\n  Mr. President, we have the opportunity. Yes, we have the time. Over \nthe last month, there have been a number of hearings and markups that \nhave been scheduled in the Finance Committee. They have then been \ncanceled on a variety of pieces of legislation, including the Medicare \ngive-back. I and others in the committee, and Senator Breaux, were \nplanning to offer an amendment to the Medicare provider give-back more \nthan a month ago again when that legislation was scheduled for markup \nin the Finance Committee which is appropriate because that is the \ncommittee of jurisdiction. We intended to offer an amendment to that \nlegislation. Then the markup was canceled. There were a variety of \nother markups that were scheduled in the Finance Committee over this \nlast month on various issues.\n  Again, we were saying if we can have time to consider these other \nimportant pieces of legislation, clearly we should have the opportunity \nand we have the time to consider a prescription drug package.\n  Now, you might say, we had votes in July on this issue in the Senate. \nThat is true. Did the Finance Committee have a markup on the \nprescription drug bill? The answer is an unequivocal no. I can't state \nwhy. The Finance Committee, the committee of jurisdiction, did not have \na markup on a bill I think virtually everybody in this Chamber would \nagree is one of our Nation's top domestic priorities. Everyone would \nagree with that. So you might ask, why didn't the committee have a \nmarkup, going through the conventional procedures, so that both sides \nhave the chance to deliberate, to amend, debate, and vote upon a \npackage? It is a very good question, a question to which I do not have \nan answer. Yet I have never had an answer. This is close to a $400 \nbillion package that would provide prescription drug coverage to our \nNation's seniors. Yet we did not have a markup. That clearly undermined \nour ability to achieve a consensus on this legislation.\n  You could take the tax-cut legislation in the year 2001. No one knew \nwhat the end result of that bill would be when it came before the \nFinance Committee. We had the ability over several days to amend it, \ndebate it, and vote upon the various issues the Members had presented \nto the committee. Ultimately we voted on a package. It came to the \nfloor. We had more amendments. We had more than 50 amendments to the \ntax cut bill because we had the right and the prerogative to express \nour positions and our views of the States that we represent. During the \nnatural course of the legislative procedure, we had the ability to \nexpress ourselves on that very important piece of legislation and then \nultimately vote for its enactment.\n\n  The same was not true when it came to this significant issue that \naffects most of our Nation's seniors. So it became an either/or \napproach. What I am saying today is let's take the Medicare provider \ngive-back legislation and let's have the opportunity to also consider \nan amendment--amendments to that legislation that would include a \nprescription drug package. I will make a unanimous consent request \nshortly on that issue.\n  But I think we have the time, we have the ability to do both in this \nChamber right now. The question is, Do we have the political will? Some \npeople, as I said earlier, say we have voted on this issue. It is not \nabout us. It is not about us. The last time I checked, Members of the \nSenate had health care coverage that included prescription drug \ncoverage. It is about our Nation's seniors, and it is making this \ninstitution work on behalf of the people we represent. Each of us have \nan individual and collective responsibility to make that happen.\n  It is a true failure on our part that we did not make this possible. \nWe worked a year and a half ago--the Senator from Vermont is here, Mr. \nJeffords, and Senator Breaux from Louisiana, Senator Grassley and I \nworked--more than a year and a half ago to begin the process of shaping \na comprehensive package so we could include this significant benefit in \nthe Medicare Program to avoid political collisions, to avoid the \nscenario that has now manifested itself in this institution on this \nparticular issue.\n  But what we got instead was denial and obstruction and circumvention \nof the conventional processes of this Senate--No. 1, because we did not \nhave a markup in the Finance Committee; and, No. 2, it was an up-or-\ndown vote in the Senate floor on two packages, no amendments. So we did \nnot have the ability to work through our differences, work through the \nconcerns that each of us might have in terms of how do we shape this \nmost significant benefit that nobody denies the seniors deserve and \ndesperately need. No one is denying that. So what is impossible about \ndoing it right here and now?\n  If we have had time over the last few months to schedule markups in \nthe committee on various initiatives, including the Medicare provider \ngive-back, then why don't we have the time to also include, in \nconjunction with those bills, a prescription drug coverage?\n  How can we fulfill our commitment to our Nation's seniors if we fail \nto do that in this session of this Congress? And to provide a provider \ngive-back bill that I certainly support, but also one that raises Part \nB premiums? It raises Part B premiums. And that is not my estimate. \nThat is the estimate of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  What we are saying is, recognizing the impact that will have on our \nNation's seniors and the costs to them directly, when you raise Part B \npremiums, you are obviously going to have to pay more of their out-of-\npocket costs for their Medicare coverage. So why then are we not also \nconsidering a\n\n[[Page S10536]]\n\nprescription drug benefit to ease the impact of the cost to our \nNation's seniors, if they can even pay? Even if they can afford to pay \nout-of-pocket costs for their drugs. But most, as we know, are forced \nto choose between food and paying for their prescription drugs \nprescribed by their doctors.\n\n  I believe we have a greater obligation. We have a greater obligation \nto build upon the support of both goals here today. I hope we will be \nable to do that. That is why I think it is so clear that we do not have \nto end this session this way. If we had the ability to consider a $43 \nbillion package that provides reimbursements to our rural hospitals and \nhome health care, to medical providers--and they, too, will acknowledge \nhow imperative this benefit is to our Nation's seniors--they certainly \nwould welcome the Senate's action on both pieces of legislation in \ntandem.\n  The House of Representatives passed, months ago, both a prescription \ndrug bill and a Medicare provider give-back. While some may have \ndifferences in this Chamber with what direction and what provisions \nthey included in that package, they ultimately passed a package that \nincluded both initiatives. I happen to believe that we have a greater \nobligation to do the same.\n  I don't think we can use the rationale that we are here at this point \nin time and that we do not have the time anymore. Let's send this back \nto committee. I regret the Senator from Montana objected to the request \nmade by the Senator from Oklahoma to refer this back to the committee. \nWe have the next couple of days. We are going to be here. We may be \nhere next week. We have the ability to mark up this legislation, both \nthe provider give-back and the prescription drug bill--we have the \ntime--and then report it back to the floor so each of us have the \nopportunity again to debate and amend, if at all possible, on various \nissues, and have a final vote.\n  I think we should try to work together to advance a viable, \ncomprehensive prescription drug plan that warrants strong bipartisan \nsupport. We developed a tripartisan package beginning more than a year \nand a half ago. We announced our principles a year ago July, setting \nout the framework so we would avoid the political collisions and the \npolarization and partisanship that seem to be the monkey wrenches \ngrinding this legislative process to a halt.\n  But again, I guess it was not sufficient to overcome those \nimpediments. Those negotiations we did have during the course of the \nsummer, even in the aftermath of the votes that were taken, the up-or-\ndown votes on the two packages--one by Senator Graham, one that was \noffered by those of us who represented the tripartisan plan--we even \nhad negotiations this fall. We all felt a breakthrough compromise was \nnear.\n  The foundation of that compromise was going to be, in fact, the \ntripartisan package. In fact, we had one of the meetings that was \nchaired by the Senator from Montana that included more than 14 \nSenators, almost equally divided across the political aisle. We were \nreally focusing on the several issues that really did represent the \nareas of disagreement. Somehow the meetings were canceled.\n  No explanation was given. This is all the more unfortunate and \ndisappointing because I think we did have a sense of agreement.\n  The bottom line is we have never been closer than we were in \nSeptember of providing this package--a universal, comprehensive \nMedicaid benefit for our Nation's seniors. The basis of a consensus \npackage exists today.\n  I hope we can agree today to do both. I am committed to doing that.\n  I know there are others here who are committed in this Senate to do \nwhat is right for our Nation's seniors. We can argue about not having \nthe time. Tell that to our Nation's seniors--that we just didn't have \ntime. We have time for other issues, but we don't have time for our \nNation's seniors when it comes to this vital benefit that can make the \ndifference between life and death.\n  We have all heard the traumatic stories and circumstances that many \nof our Nation's seniors have been placed in because they do not have \nthe kind of coverage that is extended to each of us here in this \ninstitution.\n  I happened to come across a poll not too long ago. It says when \nasked, Should senior Americans have the right to choose between \ndifferent health care plans with different benefits just like Members \nof Congress and Federal employees? Of course 90 percent said, yes, they \nwant to have that choice. They want to be able to choose in their \nMedicare benefit package prescription drug coverage. They would have a \nchoice under the tripartisan package. They could choose the traditional \nMedicare Program, the new enhanced fee-for-service program, or the \nMedicare+Choice. But whichever program they would choose, they would \nhave the option of a prescription drug benefit. That is the way it \nshould be.\n  We all know the Medicare Program was developed almost 40 years ago. \nIt needs to be reformed and overhauled in a way that modernizes and \nreflects the kind of health care that seniors are getting today. But \nsome say the traditional program works, and they should have that \noption and benefit. If they want a new, enhanced fee-for-service that \nalso includes prescription drug coverage, they should have that \nbenefit. But the fact is they should have a choice.\n  We are told, ``the next Congress.'' I have been hearing that every \nCongress. As far as I can check, we have been talking about this for \nalmost the last 4 years or more--the next Congress; the next year. It \nis here and now that we have an obligation. We have an obligation to do \nit now.\n  AARP is right in saying that you can't do one without the other--\nespecially because it has the impact on increasing our Nation's \nseniors' Part B premiums. That, of course, has been underscored by the \nCongressional Budget Office as well--that it will raise the cost of \nPart B premiums as a result of this give-back bill. If we are going to \ndo the give-back--and I wholeheartedly support that--then we also have \na responsibility to provide this most critical coverage to our Nation's \nseniors.\n  It would be a terrible oversight if we fail to do what is right. This \naction is warranted. Seniors cannot put off their illnesses, and we \nmust not put off a solution.\n  I come to the floor to offer a proposal that we consider not only \nSenator Baucus' legislation and provide for his legislation but also \nthe tripartisan prescription drug package. I made a commitment to our \nNation's seniors that I would protect their interests and do everything \npossible to pass the Medicare prescription drug benefit this year.\n\n  Now is the time to be giving that consideration. To say that we don't \nhave time is really failing our Nation's seniors. We do have time. We \nhave time because we are considering the Medicare-provided give-back. \nWe have time because a number of markups were scheduled before the \nSenate Finance Committee, and they were canceled. But there was \nobviously time that was included on the schedule for the members of the \ncommittees to consider other pieces of legislation for markup in \ncommittee. I don't object to that. But what I object to is denying our \nNation's seniors the ability to have a prescription drug benefit \nbecause we are denied the ability to give voice to that benefit and to \nexpress our will through the traditional procedures of the committee \nand here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I regret that the majority leader will not allow a vote and a vote on \nan amendment and consideration on both issues in tandem. We could do it \nin the committee and bring it to the floor. That is certainly what I \nwould prefer. But if not, we ought to be able to consider both of these \ninitiatives before the full Senate. We should let the process work the \nway it is designed because our Nation's seniors deserve at least that.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately turn to the \nconsideration of S. 2; that following the reporting by the clerk, a \nsubstitute amendment at the desk which contains the text of S. 3018, \nthe Beneficiary Access to Care and Medicare Equity Act of 2002, and S. \n2, the 21st Century Medicare Act, be considered and agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and the bill then be open \nto further amendment and debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to my \nfriend from Maine, the distinguished senior Senator, that maybe she \nprotesteth too much.\n\n[[Page S10537]]\n\n  The fact is the prescription drug package that she talks about did \nnot get a majority vote in the Senate. The one that received a majority \nvote of 51 Senators was the Gramm-Miller amendment prescription drug \nplan. That received a majority vote of the Senate.\n  I think her idea is a good idea--that we go ahead and adopt what the \nSenator from Montana, the chairman of the Finance Committee, has come \nto the floor twice today and talked about doing the Medicare give-\nback--have that and have the prescription drug bill have a majority \nvote. Graham of Florida and Miller--51 votes.\n  That would let the will of the Senate work where the majority of the \nSenate determines what happens. The problem was we didn't get 60 votes. \nWe had 51 votes.\n  I also say my friend from Maine talks about protecting the interests \nof seniors. I know she wishes to protect the interests of seniors. I \nthink the best way to do that is with the best prescription drug \npackage that has surfaced in the Senate--the one that received the \nmajority vote of the Senate. Let us pass that. That would protect the \ninterests of seniors.\n  I would also say this: I say it with a smile on my face. To have the \nminority talk about us having enough time to do things is about as \nclose to being ridiculous as anything I have heard. I have sat on this \nfloor--not for minutes but hours, days--I have sat here for weeks while \nthe minority has prevented us from doing anything. We can't pass our \nappropriations bills because they won't let us. We can't pass homeland \ndefense because they won't let us. We can't pass the conference report \non terrorism insurance because they won't let us. We can't pass the \nprescription drug bill because they won't let us. We can't pass the \ngeneric drug bill because they won't let us. I could go on and on.\n  So don't tell me that we do not have enough time to do things. We are \nnot having enough time to do things because the minority won't let us.\n  So I object, unless my amendment is accepted.\n  I move to amend the unanimous consent request to accept the \nlanguage----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Maine has the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  In response to what the majority whip mentioned, the fact is that we \nhad the opportunity and the time. The motion that I offered with \nrespect to the Medicare-provided give-back legislation and the \nprescription drug benefit is including further amendments and debate.\n  That is all we are asking, to have the opportunity to debate and \namend a package on the floor of the Senate that gives our Nation's \nseniors the option of having a prescription drug benefit in the \nMedicare program. It is not a question of whether I protest too much. I \ncan assure you, our Nation's seniors will protest when they learn about \nthe failure of this institution to pass any prescription drug benefit.\n  We were close to working out our differences on the few issues that \nreally did separate us on the two packages that were before the Senate \nback in July. It really came down to several different issues. We had \nongoing negotiations, even including additional Members who had been \nworking on this issue before, because we were reaching out. We were \nclose to reaching an agreement, whether it was on the cost or the \nfallback, to ensure every senior had the option and the access to a \nprescription drug benefit that was designed in that program, regardless \nof where they lived in America, so no one would be denied.\n  We were close to reaching that consensus. But for some unexplainable \nreason, further negotiations were suspended. That was regrettable \nbecause we could have been at a point where we could have enacted a \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare program.\n  When I asked for this unanimous consent, it was to also include the \nopportunity for the Senate to amend and debate this legislation. We do \nhave the time. If we have the time to bring up Medicare provider give-\nback legislation of more than $43 billion, then clearly we also have \nthe time to consider a prescription drug bill. Then, I would argue, we \nare even further along in this institution in examining all of the \ncomponents and provisions and the issues surrounding the development of \na comprehensive universal package. We are much further ahead because we \ndid have debate on the two proposals on the floor, but we didn't have \nthe opportunity to amend our various packages. It was up or down, all \nor nothing, either/or, take it or leave it, get the 60 votes or not--\nnot expressing our will through the conventional procedures of this \ninstitution.\n  I cite again the example of the tax-cut measure we ultimately adopted \nin the Senate back in May of 2001. It required several days. In that \ncase, there were 50 amendments. But we expressed ourselves. We had the \nopportunity to offer amendments and then ultimately vote on a final \npackage, yes or no. That is not the same opportunity that has been \ngiven to this issue.\n  Our Nation's seniors deserve to know that. They also deserve to \nconsider both of these initiatives in tandem. I have yet to hear a \nreasonable argument as to why we can't do that, why we cannot include \nboth of these initiatives in one package, similar to what the House of \nRepresentatives did months ago. We should be able to do the same thing \nin the Senate, send the package to the conference, and work out the \nissues.\n  Believe me, there is great urgency to obviously resolve both of these \ninitiatives to reach a final conclusion. I think there is genuine \ninterest on both sides of the political aisle here in this institution \nand on the other side to work these issues out in the final and \nremaining days of this Congress. But to say it can't be done, tell that \nto our Nation's seniors.\n  Voting on an issue means nothing unless you produce results. Results \nmeans taking final action on a piece of legislation that is sent to the \nPresident of the United States. The President is eager to have \nlegislation that can be signed into law to give this much-needed \nbenefit to our senior citizens.\n\n  We can do it. I hope the Senate will recognize it is a very \nreasonable unanimous consent request. I hope they will reconsider their \nobjection to this request.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator repeat herself? I was speaking to one of \nmy staff.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I hope the Senator would reconsider his objection to my \nunanimous consent request because this motion really is asking to \ninclude both issues in one package in tandem and to be able to further \namend and debate. I think it is a reasonable request, and it is one \nthat should not be denied.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator allow me to respond?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I am glad to have the Senator respond.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has asked if I would respond or reconsider. I \nhave the greatest respect for the Senator from Maine. We have worked \ntogether on many issues. She is a fine legislator, but she is simply \nwrong.\n  It seems somewhat unusual to me that in the waning hours of this \ncongressional session, suddenly we want to have a debate on Medicare \ngive-backs and prescription drugs. We have fought the minority all year \nlong on many issues. On the list, of course, is prescription drugs. \nThat is the second one we have here. We were forced to pass something \nthat is good, but certainly not what we wanted with the generic drug \nbill. It is buried in the dark hole of the Republican-led House of \nRepresentatives because they will not go to conference.\n  We have the Medicare give-backs, which is so important for the people \nof the State of Nevada and Maine and Vermont, West Virginia and \nMontana, any State in the Union, a very important piece of legislation. \nThat is ready to move. We could pass that in a matter of minutes.\n  The prescription drug bill I referenced, the Graham-Miller \nlegislation, had extended debate on the floor. We have heard enough \nabout that. People understand the issue. It got a majority vote. We \ndon't need another amendable item on which we have, frankly, your side \nstall, stall, stall, as you have done all year long.\n  I have reconsidered. The only thing I would suggest we do is adopt \nthe proposal of the Senator from Montana, the proposal of the Chairman \nof the Finance Committee, on Medicare give-backs and stick in that, if \nwe have so\n\n[[Page S10538]]\n\nmany on the other side who suddenly found religion and want to do \nsomething to help seniors with prescription drugs; that we pass, as a \nmajority of the Senate has already said we should do, the Graham-Miller \nprescription drug bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Feingold). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in response to the points made by the \nSenator from Nevada, obviously the minority do not design the floor \nschedule. That is the prerogative of the majority. The minority did not \npreclude the Finance Committee from marking up this legislation. We did \nnot choose to postpone the consideration of a prescription drug package \nin the Finance Committee. The Senator from Nevada would acknowledge a \nmarkup in the Finance Committee was important and essential to \nachieving the consensus that is so critical in passing any significant \npiece of legislation.\n  In this instance, we are discussing a package that represents more \nthan $400 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Mr. President, I think everybody would agree the Finance Committee \nshould have had the opportunity to consider that initiative. I cannot \nthink of the last time that creating a new benefit, a new package, or a \nnew program that represents close to $400 billion over the next 10 \nyears, has not had the benefit of a markup in the committee--at least, \nif you are thinking about enhancing the ability to create the consensus \nfor the final passage of that legislation. So the process was \ncircumvented, for whatever reason, I do not know.\n  But what I do know is what is possible today. I do know if we had the \npolitical will, we could resolve the few differences between the \npositions that were offered on the floor back in July that, \nregrettably, we didn't have the opportunity to amend or further amend. \nIt was, again, as I said, up or down, either/or, all or nothing. Well, \nyou cannot achieve cooperation and consensus on a major package of this \nkind without working through the various issues.\n  So all I am asking is we have the opportunity to consider a \nprescription drug benefit in tandem with the Medicare provider give-\nback. If we have time to provide $43 billion in additional assistance \nto Medicare providers--and I would wholeheartedly support that, but I \nalso would support providing prescription drug coverage to our Nation's \nseniors. How can we do one without the other? I have not heard an \nexplanation I think would be acceptable to the senior citizens of this \ncountry.\n  We didn't have time? Well, where have we been over the last 2 years? \nWe didn't have time, Mr. President? I don't think that is acceptable. \nHow does anybody go home and say to their constituents we didn't have \ntime--especially because that has been the rationale given for the last \n4 years: we will put it on to the next Congress.\n  We are elected to do what is important here and now. That is our \nobligation. If we have to stay here day and night, through the weekend, \nwhat greater obligation do we have than to do what is important to the \npeople we represent? This is an issue that has been acknowledged by \nboth sides to be one of our top domestic priorities, and we are saying \nwe don't have time. We don't have time in the committee. We didn't have \ntime in the committee last July. We didn't have time in the committee \nlast spring. We have not had time. When do we have time around here, \nMr. President? When do we have time to do what is right in this \ninstitution? When do we have time? How do we do it?\n  We had a tripartisan group from the Senate Finance Committee begin to \nwork on this issue a year ago--I would say in June, and we announced \nour principles a year ago July--to avoid this type of political \nshowdown, to avoid the all-or-nothing confrontation that seems to \npervade this institution. Guess what. We are denied the ability to mark \nup this bill in the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Well, I might be protesting too much, but, frankly, I think our \nNation's seniors deserve better. I know they are protesting. Tell them \nwe don't have time. Explain to them why we didn't have a markup in the \ncommittee that would have increased the likelihood of the passage of \nthis legislation.\n  Now we are hearing we should have this Medicare provider give-back. I \nendorse that, but I don't believe these are mutually exclusive issues. \nI want to make that clear. These are not mutually exclusive items. \nObviously, AARP agrees because of the letter they sent to the \nlegislative leadership, the committee leadership, and the ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee, that you should not do one without the \nother. I am speaking on behalf of the seniors I represent in my State \nof Maine. They deserve better.\n\n  I hope the Senator from Nevada will reconsider, so we have the \nability here and now to consider the provider give-back benefit, and if \nthe Senator indicates there is general unanimous agreement to provide \nthat, then we can focus on the prescription drug benefit and on the few \nareas we have identified to be the issues in disagreement between what \nwas offered by Senator Graham and the tripartisan package offered by \nthe Senator from Iowa, Senator Breaux from Louisiana, Senator Jeffords \nfrom Vermont, and myself. We can do that. I hope I will hear that \nmessage today. Let's begin here and now.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I try to be very patient; sometimes I am and \nsometimes I am not. But I have to tell you the statement of my dear \nfriend, the senior Senator from Maine, is really trying my patience. \nShe has stated numerous times she likes the tripartisan piece of \nlegislation. More power to her. The fact is, it could not get a \nmajority vote in the Senate. We had a piece of legislation that got a \nmajority, but she refuses to talk about that. She talks about \ncommittee, committee, committee. We recognize how the Senate works. The \ncommittee structure, I support. I have great respect for the traditions \nof the Senate. But there are times when the committees don't have full \nhearings on pieces of legislation.\n  The minority should become consistent because, on the one hand, they \nare telling us if the committee works and they don't like what the \ncommittee does, the matter should come to the floor anyway. Let's see \nhow that would work here. If something happens in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and they make a determination and the minority doesn't like \nwhat happens in the committee, then it should come to the floor anyway. \nIt would seem to me if you are consistent, you have to recognize we \nhave a situation where we have had extensive debate that took place \nover a period of many weeks on prescription drugs. The only one that \ngot a majority vote is the one I talked about--on two separate \noccasions--by Senators Graham and Miller. Let's pass that now. I think \nthat is fine.\n  I see the Senator from Michigan, who spent weeks of her time working \non prescription drugs. We didn't get a prescription drug bill because \nwe could not get 60 votes. But we had a majority. We passed a generic \ndrug bill--not a perfect bill but a good one--that would lower the cost \nof drugs in America, not only for seniors but for everybody. It allows \nreimportation from Canada.\n  Where is that bill? It's buried over in the dark hole of the \nconferences of the Republican-led House of Representatives. They won't \neven let us do that. Here we have somebody telling us we have lots of \ntime. Let's do another prescription drug bill, but we want to start \nthis one in the committee. When it comes to the floor, we want to have \na lot of amendments, or a few amendments.\n  We know that is a prime-time word for the big stall. That is all this \nis. I have great respect for the AARP. It is a great organization, but \nthey don't run the Senate or this country. There are many people in the \nState of Nevada, and all over the country, who badly need this Medicare \ngive-back. So I am willing to take my chances with AARP because the \nRepublicans would not let us pass a prescription drug bill, a generic \ndrug bill. I will take my chances with AARP and go with the Senator \nfrom Montana. Let's pass the Medicare give-back bill to help millions \nof people in America--rural America and urban America--people who badly \nneed this. I am going to have convalescent centers going broke in \nNevada, filing bankruptcy.\n  Is that what we want? We had a convalescent center in rural Nevada. \nThey had all kinds of problems. They did not know what to do with the \npeople in the\n\n[[Page S10539]]\n\ncenter because they were going broke. What do they do with them? It was \nthe only center in town. This legislation would direct money to that \nsituation.\n  AARP is a great organization, but they can take that letter and \ncarpet floors with it because that is not how we run the Senate. We do \nwhat is best for the people of our States, and the best for our States \nis to do what the Senator from Montana said to do. We tried to pass all \nkinds of legislation, and we have had the big stall. So do not have \nanyone lecture me on enough time to do things. I have spent days, \nweeks, and probably months of my life sitting here doing nothing \nbecause they would not let us do anything.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am thankful the Senator from Maine is \nstill on the floor. I wish to respond to a couple points she made.\n  I do not know that there is anybody in the Senate who wants to get a \nprescription drug benefit for seniors more than the Senator from Maine. \nBelieve me, I understand that. I have been at many meetings with the \nsenior Senator from Maine where she has made that very clear.\n  There is also no one on the floor who wants to pass a prescription \ndrug bill more than the senior Senator from Montana. The same is true \nof the Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Nebraska, and the \nSenator from West Virginia, as well as the current occupant of the \nchair, the Senator from Wisconsin. We all want to get a prescription \ndrug benefit passed.\n  On the one hand, there is the so-called tripartisan bill, which the \nSenator from Maine supports, and which is basically the insurance \ncompany model. On the other hand, there is the bill that would use \npharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, to administer a drug benefit. This \nis essentially the Medicare model. Reducing it to its basic simplicity, \nthat is the argument.\n  The Senator says she wants a prescription drug benefit passed, but \nshe slyly indicates she wants hers passed. But her bill did not get a \nmajority vote in the Senate. There are others who want to get \nprescription drug benefits passed who have a different view of what a \nprescription drug benefit should be, and that is the problem. Neither \nside wants to give in. Both sides think they are right.\n  We just witnessed a good example of that. The Senator from Maine \nsays: Bring up a prescription drug bill, but bring up hers, the way she \nwants it. She does not agree to bring up the other bill, apparently, \nthat the Senator from Nevada suggested, the one that received a \nmajority vote. That is the problem. Neither side agrees. Each side \nwants its bill passed.\n\n  I say to my good friend--and she well knows this--I have worked so \nhard with her to get a prescription drug benefit passed. I called the \nmeeting in my office with the Senator from Maine and with other \nSenators who were key Senators on this subject as a last-ditch effort \nto get a bill passed because I share with her the view we owe it to our \nseniors to get a prescription drug benefit bill passed. I understand \nthat.\n  But the Senator knows well that there are huge differences of \nagreement. The issue is basically, should we have a more privatized \nsystem or not? That is basically the argument.\n  The Senator from Maine suggests the approach that privatizes \nprescription drugs to seniors with insurance companies. That is \nbasically her bill. There are others who say: No, do not do that; that \nis wrong because insurance companies will take too much for themselves; \nthe insurance companies will not give the benefits to the seniors, and \nbesides that, insurance companies are not sure they want to do it, \nanyway.\n  It is very easy for a Senator to stand up and say: Let's do \nprescription drug benefits. The hard part is actually coming up with a \ncompromise so we can reach a solution and pass a bill that does give \nbenefits to our seniors.\n  To be frank, I have not heard the Senator from Maine come forth to me \nor anybody with a reasonable compromise. She has been pushing for this \ninsurance company model, and she is not coming up with a compromise. I \nsay that because that indicates the degree of separation and the \ndivision in this Senate over how to get prescription drug benefits to \nseniors.\n  But while we all want to pass a benefit, we also want to make sure it \nis done right. If we are going to pass legislation on the order of $400 \nbillion over 10 years, we have to make sure it is done right and that \nit works for seniors. It does not make sense just to pass a bill. It \nmakes sense to pass a bill that works.\n  I could not agree more with the Senator that we should pass a bill, \nbut in all candor, at this late moment, coming up to the Chamber \nwithout first suggesting an honest-to-goodness compromise sounds as if \nthis is obfuscation. On the surface, it sounds good: Let's pass a \nprescription drug benefit. I know she means well, but there are others \non her side of the aisle for whom this is an obfuscation, a desire not \nto get an underlying give-back bill passed.\n  The reason the Medicare give-back bill is here is because there is \nagreement. There is agreement on almost all of the provisions: an \nagreement that we should not allow the home health cut go into effect; \nagreement on what the restoration for physicians should be; agreement \non hospital payments, the so-called standardized amount. There is \nagreement.\n  But there is not agreement on how to provide prescription drug \nbenefits, and the Senator from Maine well knows that. Her argument is: \nLet's just try; let's try it.\n  Sometimes we have to tell it like it is. The fact is, both sides are \nso stuck in their ways that I have made the judgment that it is nearly \nimpossible in the remaining days to reach agreement because we are in \nsuch a political season.\n  If the Senator from Maine wants to come forth and give me a \nlegitimate compromise, then maybe we can get a bill passed. She says \nshe wants the tripartisan bill up for consideration. She does not say: \nlet's sit down and work out a legitimate agreement and see if we can \nput something together.\n\n  I would like to sit down with the Senator from Maine and see if we \ncan reach agreement. I know the Senator from Maine would like to do so. \nTo be honest, she has not suggested anything except the tripartisan \ninsurance company model. And that plan did not even get a majority vote \nin the Senate. The approach by Senator Graham received a majority of \nvotes in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, if we don't pass this bill to restore Medicare \npayments, we should consider all of the seniors who may get less care \nin nursing homes, and seniors who may get less care because doctors \nwill no longer provide Medicare services to patients.\n  My good friend from Maine points out that the Medicare payment bill \nwill increase costs to seniors. She does not tell us that of the \nincreased cost to seniors 90 percent is caused by a restoration of \npayments to physicians. This restoration is needed to ensure that \nphysicians will still provide care to seniors.\n  If she wants doctors to continue to withdraw from Medicare, that is \nher right, that is her choice, when she complains about the amount of \nthe increase seniors will have to pay. It is true that they will have \nto pay a little more. We have to figure out a solution to that. I am \nhopeful we can do it next year, and I am hopeful there will be more of \na bipartisan mood around here.\n  I know the Senator's motives are pure. Hers are pure, but I cannot \nsay that for the majority of the Members on the other side of the aisle \non this issue at this moment. I have been around here a while and know \nhow this place works. I have the utmost respect for the Senator from \nMaine. She has pure motives, but her offering this unanimous consent \nrequest at this time is clearly an effort on the part of others--not \nher--on the part of others to try to slow down and prevent the Medicare \ngive-back bill from passing.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, I have agreed \nto cosponsor S. 3018, the Beneficiary Access to Care and Medicare \nEquity Act of 2002, because I believe it is imperative we act this year \nto correct deficiencies in Medicare payment levels that are certain to \ncreate hardships for providers and those they serve, beneficiaries.\n  I want to take this opportunity to underscore concerns I have with \nSection 706 which deals with the process for development and \nimplementation of Medicaid and CHIP waivers.\n\n[[Page S10540]]\n\n  I am sympathetic to the underlying concerns expressed by the sponsors \nof this provision, especially as they relate to coverage of childless \nadults under the CHIP program. CHIP was designed to address the needs \nof children of working parents who made too much money to qualify for \nMedicaid, but, many times, could not afford private health insurance. I \nbelieve that the integrity of the CHIP program must be maintained. For \nthis reason, I have even opposed attempts to expand CHIP to cover \npregnant women, because I believe funding should be devoted to \nproviding coverage to uninsured children, preserving the original \nintent of this legislation. It should come as no surprise to my \ncolleagues that I oppose expanding CHIP under a waiver to cover \nchildless adults.\n  However, there are those who do not share my views on this issue and \nI believe that they should be heard. There are those who believe that \nCHIP enrollment is not as high as it could be because parents are not \ncovered by the program. They believe that one way to capture children \nunder CHIP is to offer family coverage. I do not agree with that \napproach, but I do believe that there should be a debate on the issue.\n  Before Congress adopts provisions which could limit both the Federal \nand State governments' ability to adopt innovative approaches to \naddress the problem of the uninsured, we ought to have a thorough and \ncomprehensive debate. The Senate Finance Committee should hold hearings \non these important waiver issues prior to enacting legislation which \ncould be detrimental to State flexibility and innovation. I strongly \nobject to including a provision which is opposed by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services and the National Governors Association in an \nattractive package of Medicare reimbursements and fiscal relief for the \nstates. Both HHS and NGA have concerns with this provision because it \nlimits a State's flexibility to provide expanded health coverage \ntailored to the specific needs of its residents.\n  I believe that, as drafted, Section 706 would deter a state's attempt \nto provide health insurance coverage to those who are currently \nuninsured. Additionally, it is my view that Section 706 would not \nimprove the waiver process, but would actually function as a \ndisincentive for States to undergo an open dialogue with stakeholders \nas they go through the process of securing a Medicaid or CHIP waiver.\n  Section 706 would require that 60 days prior to the date that a state \nsubmits a waiver or amendment application to the Secretary, the state \nmust publish, for written comment, a notice of the proposed waiver that \ncontains at least the following: projections regarding the likely \neffect and impact of the proposed waiver on any individuals who are \neligible for receiving medical assistance or health benefits coverage. \nIn addition, a State must make a statement regarding the likely effect \nand impact of the proposed waiver on any provider or suppliers of items \nor services for which payment may be made under the Medicaid or CHIP \nprogram.\n  It would seem to me, that we are putting the cart before the horse \nhere. Isn't it the purpose of a public comment period to determine the \neffects and impacts on individuals and providers? Aren't we setting the \nStates up to be criticized for coming to pre-determined conclusions \nabout the effects of a proposed waiver by requiring them to effectively \ndevelop these conclusions before the public has had a chance to weigh \nin on the matter?\n  Section 706 goes on to require that the State must have one meeting \nwith the state's medical care advisory committee and two public \nhearings on the waiver. I am somewhat confused by these provisions. It \nseems to me that rather than encouraging an open and comprehensive \ndialogue in the state over a proposed waiver, Section 706, if enacted, \nwould curtail and truncate the process, effectively limiting input from \nthe very individuals and groups which would be affected by the waiver. \nIn short, to comply with Section 706, a State could conclude what the \neffects of the waiver would be prior to public comment, hold two \nperfunctory public hearings and be done.\n  Officials in my State of Utah, in developing their waiver, did not \nneed the Federal Government to come in and tell them how to reach out \nto stakeholders on this issue. I am informed that the state held \nmeetings for 10 months prior to getting approval for their waiver with \nlow-income advocates, providers, insurance companies, employers and \nstate legislators. The state held a series of work conferences and \ncommunity meetings on issues associated with Utah's waiver. The State \nhad several legislative task force meetings which were open to the \npublic as well as several budget hearings, also open to the public. \nOfficials from my State who were overseeing the waiver process attended \nmonthly meeting of advocate groups and met repeatedly with their \nmedical care advisory committee.\n  Now, it might be that other States contemplating a waiver might not \nneed such a comprehensive public outreach effort. Other states could \ndetermine they should emulate such an approach. Is it really the role \nof the Federal Government to micro-manage this process?\n  Section 706 would also require states to file copious records \ndocumenting detailed descriptions of the public notice and input \nprocess; copies of all notices, dates of meetings and hearings; a \nsummary of the public comments; and, a certification that the state \ncomplied with any applicable notification requirements with respect to \nIndian tribes.\n  If we are looking for ways to encourage unwilling states to reach out \nto the public for input, one of the least effective ways to do so, in \nmy opinion, is to require States to jump through a bunch of \nbureaucratic hoops. This will not foster open debate nor will it \nencourage the states to try and draw a buy-in from stakeholders. \nInstead, in my opinion, it will create an atmosphere where the state \nwill do the bare minimum in order to meet the requirements and no more. \nThis is not the way to promote outreach efforts and a free-flowing \nexchange of ideas. In fact, I believe that if enacted, Section 706 will \nstifle such an approach.\n  In considering the role of HHS relative to the waiver process, I am \ninformed that HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson has written in opposition to \nSection 706. I share the Secretary's concerns that, as drafted, this \nsection would leave HHS vulnerable to costly and burdensome lawsuits. I \nagree with Secretary Thompson that State and Federal resources should \nbe spent addressing the issue of the uninsured and should not go, \ninstead, to fending off legal challenges from every national advocacy \ngroup who did not get exactly what they wanted.\n  Finally, one of the facts that gets overlooked in these waiver \ndiscussions is that we have 41 million uninsured Americans and states \nare trying to cover them. This is really the bottom line, here, the \nstates are trying to find ways to get some coverage to Americans who \nwould otherwise have no coverage. Rather than looking for ways to \ninhibit the states from accomplishing this, we should be making it \neasier for them.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Finance Committee \nto accomplishing this important goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I find myself in total agreement with \nthe Senator from Montana, sadly so but nevertheless very much so. But \nthis situation strikes me as ironic.\n  I support the position of the Senator from Montana and what he is \ntrying to do with the give-back. The Senator from Maine talked about \nresolving a few minor differences, and the Senator from Montana said \nthey are not minor. They have to do with whether or not a State such as \nWest Virginia, which this Senator represents, will have any \nprescription drug benefits at all because there are no insurance \ncompanies that have any intention of coming into the State of West \nVirginia and making those available.\n  I am not so sure that any would be willing to go to Maine. I do not \nthink they would be willing to go to Montana. I do not think they would \nbe willing to go to--well, I don't know. They probably would be willing \nto go to Florida, probably Nevada a little bit, Michigan a little bit, \nbut Nebraska not very much; Wisconsin, I do not know.\n  Basically, all rural States--and 81 percent of all counties in the \nUnited States of America are rural--will be shut out by this \nprescription drug bill which the tripartite approach embraces. I hope \nthe Presiding Officer\n\n[[Page S10541]]\n\ndoes not think for one moment the Senator from West Virginia is going \nto contemplate working out a compromise on the floor of the Senate, \nwith only a few days left, when we have been filibustered on every \nsingle thing we have brought up, especially something as complicated as \na difference between a pharmacy benefit manager and an insurance model.\n  There is a lot of educating that has to go on on the Senate floor \nthat has taken place in the Finance Committee. There was a vote on the \nfloor. The vote said one thing and the Senator from Maine says she \nwants something else.\n  I am extremely disappointed we are not able to get the unanimous \nconsent that was sought to proceed to the Beneficiary Access to Care \nand Medicare Equity Act of 2002.\n  I have heard nonstop from those in my State concerning the effects of \nthe declining Medicare reimbursement on access to critical care \nservices. The reality is we will also be unable to enact a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit for this year. Why? Because of the huge \nideological gap which I have just finished describing.\n  People can describe it as a minor difference. It is the Grand Canyon \nof difference, and it is the difference between whether people from \npopulated, wealthier areas get a prescription drug benefit and \neverybody else does not.\n  If that is what one wants, fine; but that is not what the Senator \nfrom West Virginia wants, and it is not what my people want. It is not \nwhat the majority of the people in this country want. Yes, they want \nsomething called a prescription drug benefit. But there is a question \nof saying how do they get it and who gets it? The mechanism is \nimportant.\n  I want a prescription drug benefit. I dare say the income of Medicare \nbeneficiaries in the State of West Virginia is lower--about $10,800--\nthan the Medicare beneficiaries in the State of Maine.\n  People spend $4,000, $5,000, to $6,000 out of their pockets on \nprescription drugs. Do I want a prescription drug benefit? You better \nbelieve I do, but I want one which will actually get to the people I \nrepresent and which are represented across America in rural States.\n  We do not have a choice of being able to say let's do both. We cannot \nfinish that debate on this floor. We cannot reach agreement on this \nfloor. Not the Senator from Maine, but there are many on the other side \nof the aisle who do not want to see that happen in some respects \nbecause they do not want to see the Graham-Miller bill pass because \nthat would be deemed a victory for the wrong people, or something like \nthat.\n  However, one priority that cannot wait until next year is providing \nStates with fiscal relief. That would include the State that the \nPresiding Officer is from.\n  On July 25, 75 members--talk about a consensus. The Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins; the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Nelson; and this \nSenator put forward a compromise plan, and it got 75 votes. It got half \nthe Senators on the other side of the aisle to vote to provide States \nwith $9 billion in assistance. That has since been somewhat cut down in \nan agreement with the Republican leader on the Finance Committee to $5 \nbillion, but that is still substantial relief--$4 billion in Medicaid \nand then $1 billion in Social Security's block grant. That is a lot of \nmoney. It will help all States.\n  Since we passed that amendment by an overwhelming vote, the situation \nin the States has, in fact, gotten much worse. The last time States \nfaced a budget crisis this bad was in 1983. I happen to remember that \nbecause I was Governor of West Virginia and our unemployment rate was \nabout 21 or 22 percent. One does not forget those things quickly.\n  At least 46 States struggled to close a combined budget gap of $37 \nbillion in the past fiscal year. This year's gap is even wider. This \nyear it is going to be a combined $58 billion deficit. Most States are \nrequired by law to balance their budgets, something we did up until a \nyear and a half ago. Then a variety of things happened, and it is no \nlonger balanced. So they are being forced to slash their spending. The \nGovernors do not want to, but they have to.\n  This year coming up, 18 States are planning to cut families from \nMedicaid coverage, and 15 States are eliminating important health care \nbenefits. Twenty-nine States are cutting or freezing provider payment, \nfurther jeopardizing access to health care. As a result, thousands of \nAmericans, at the least, will join the ranks of the uninsured and \ncountless more will find access to needed benefits reduced or \neliminated altogether.\n  In this tough fiscal climate, a new survey of Medicaid programs shows \nan increasing number of States are dropping certain groups of patients, \ncurtailing some services, requiring poor people to help pay for their \nown care when they can, limiting access to expensive drugs and then \ncutting or freezing payments to hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, and \nother providers of care. Is that kind of important? You bet your bottom \ndollar it is. Fundamental access to health care.\n  In Massachusetts, the legislature had to stop covering about 50,000 \nunemployed adults. In California, children spent longer in foster care \nbecause of cuts in adoption services.\n  In New Jersey, the working poor will lose access to State-funded \nhealth care. In Louisiana, there will not be future hospital beds \navailable for low-income patients. The Kaiser Commission on Medicaid \nand the Uninsured, which nobody disputes, in a new study found that 18 \nStates are planning to tighten their eligibility rules in the coming \nfiscal year, compared with 8 States last year.\n  The most common strategy that States are using to cut costs is to \nlimit their expenditures on prescription drugs by reducing \npharmaceutical payments or making it more difficult for doctors and \npatients to select expensive but necessary medicines. Forty States are \ntrying to cut costs by limiting their drug expenditures. In Illinois \nlast month, Medicaid officials began requiring patients who need the \npopular antidepressant drug Zoloft to get tablets that are twice as \nstrong as they need and then break the pills in half. I do not know if \nthat makes a tragedy, but it sure is a lousy way to do business.\n  In a subtler strategy, some States are curtailing recent innovations \nthat were designed to find more people who are eligible for public \ninsurance and then make it easier for them to stay covered once \nenrolled. Delaware stopped a very good initiative which had been paid \nthrough an outside grant to publicize Medicaid and the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program and to help clients fill out applications. \nThey had to stop that because they had no money.\n  So the decision being made by Governors, legislators, and Medicaid \nadministrators underscores the pressure that States are confronting in \na weakened economy, which I dare say will stay weakened for some time. \nTheir revenues are plunging. Increases in unemployment and poverty are \nprompting more people to sign up for government help. As a result, \nStates are reversing the trend that lasted nearly a decade when they \nadded money and changed rules so the public insurance programs could \nhelp more Americans who lack health coverage and pay for more kinds of \ncare.\n\n  The fiscal crisis has a direct impact on the families in our States \nbut it also has a direct impact on local economies. Medicaid is the \nlargest purchase of maternity care in the United States of America. It \npays for half of all nursing home care which everybody faces at some \npoint in their life.\n  Medicaid provides significant support for local hospitals and for \nnursing homes. Providers in some instances are struggling to stay in \nbusiness, and in many instances have stopped. Eight out of 10 hospitals \nin West Virginia are losing money. How long can they continue in small \nrural counties? The bottom line is that means Medicaid plays a critical \nrole in sustaining local economies as well as people's lives and health \ncare. For every dollar a State cuts from Medicaid--and that is what is \nhappening--it loses between $1 and $3.31 in Federal assistance. That is \none large loss. That loss would have otherwise gone to hospitals, to \nhome health services, nursing homes, and health clinics tied into our \nlocal economy.\n  For this reason, the legislation introduced last week in the Senate \nto increase payments to providers under Medicare, which we just failed \nto get unanimous consent on, also includes a\n\n[[Page S10542]]\n\nbillion dollars in fiscal relief for States. In many ways, States are \nthe largest providers of health care, and ensuring their stability is \nthe best way to maintain access.\n  If Congress does not act to provide a temporary boost to Medicaid \nfunding for States to help them meet their responsibility to protect \nthe most vulnerable citizens, and all citizens, since a great majority \nof Medicare citizens are vulnerable, the situation will get worse.\n  We have made significant progress over the last 10 years in expanding \naccess to health insurance. This year, 50 million Americans are \nexpected to receive health insurance through two programs: Medicaid and \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program which was started in the Senate \nFinance Committee. These programs provide health coverage to more than \n10 percent of all Americans.\n  In closing, this coverage is now at risk unless, as the Senator from \nMontana wants, the Congress refuses to act. This is one priority that \ncannot wait until next year. We should pass the Senate's proposal to \nreduce the current law cuts to critical Medicare providers. Even if we \nfail to do that, we must enact a provision to provide additional relief \nto the States that struggle to provide our Nation's people with the \ncrucial safety net.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I respond to some of the issues raised by \nthe Senator from Montana, for whom I have a great deal of respect. It \nis important to clarify some of the issues suggested by the Senator \nregarding the legislation I and others have proposed, the tripartisan \nlegislation.\n  The Senator from Montana did schedule meetings in his office with \nSenators from both sides of the political aisle, Senators who were very \nconcerned about the legislation. Obviously, there were differences \namong all the Senators. We were trying to narrow the areas of \ndifferences.\n  I was surprised by the characterization suggested by the Senator with \nrespect to those meetings. He had established the agenda. In fact, he \nasked everyone at the meetings, what should be the basis for \nnegotiations? What should be the starting point for discussions? It was \nagreed by those in the room, when he initiated the question, that the \ntripartisan legislation should be the basis for the discussion and \nnegotiation. The staff had been given instructions to develop language \nwith respect to the three areas in which we had identified to be the \nmajor areas in disagreement.\n  One was the assets test, one was the cost, and one was the fallback \nprovisions as to whether or not the provision included in the \ntripartisan package was in and of itself sufficient to guarantee \nprescription drug coverage to a senior, regardless of where they lived \nin America. We thought our language certainly met the conditions for \nensuring that our Nation's seniors, regardless of whether they lived in \nan urban or rural area, would have the benefit of a prescription drug \ncoverage as designed in our legislation. But we were certainly amenable \nto additional language, additional protection in the legislation to \nabsolutely guarantee we would provide seamless coverage in the event \nthat an insurer was not providing the options for prescription drug \ncoverage to seniors in a particular area of the country for whatever \nreason. So no matter what, a senior would have the benefit of the \ncoverage, regardless of where they lived, and they would have a choice \nof at least two plans, so we were more than amenable. We were amenable \neven on the price tag. We were considering language on the acid test.\n  The chairman did not reconvene meetings after assigning the staff \nwith the responsibility of drafting the new legislation. We were never \ngiven reasons no additional meetings were scheduled.\n  In the meantime, markups were scheduled in the Finance Committee this \nfall on various issues, including the provider give-back. We said we \nintend to offer the tripartisan package because that had the support of \nSenator Grassley, who worked on it a year and a half ago; Senator \nJeffords from Vermont, a member of the committee; Senator Breaux from \nLouisiana; and myself as a member of the Finance Committee. We would \noffer that as an amendment and see where the process takes us in \nFinance Committee. The markups were canceled.\n  If our bill was not going anyplace, as the chairman suggests, then \nwhy were the markups canceled? If our bill had no opportunity to go \nanyplace, why were the markups canceled? Is it because these four \nmembers of the Finance Committee had at least offered a basis for a \nbipartisan--in this case a tripartisan--comprehensive prescription drug \npackage? We did not say it was all or nothing. We did not suggest \ninflexibility or intransigence on our part. We say let's offer this as \na basis for amendment, further consideration, and debate and votes.\n  The same was true in the unanimous consent request I presented on the \nfloor that was ultimately rejected. It says ``be open to further \namendment and debate.'' That does not suggest inflexibility. I didn't \nsay take tripartisan package or nothing. I am saying the only way you \nwork things out is being able to bring up the bill and offer amendments \nand debate and vote on the amendments and reach a final conclusion. Now \nwe are talking about July.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. To be honest, I think if all Members of the Senate were \nlike the Senator from Maine, we would have an agreement. The Senator \nwell knows there are a lot of other Senators in this body who were dug \nin and who very much wanted their points of view.\n  We had the last meeting. We were working on five issues: Assets test, \nbenefit design, Medicare reforms, consumer protections, and how to \ndesign a viable fallback mechanism, which would take effect in the \nevent of private plans not entering a particular market. Roughly \nspeaking, we were working off the basis of the so-called tripartisan \nview, but is it not also true at that time that was very loose and \nthere were an awful lot of issues to work out?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would like----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It was my judgment after that meeting and checking with \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, that discussions were going \nbackwards on prescription drugs. I basically made a decision that \nSenators were digging in so much that they were not going to agree.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would like to pose a question to the Senator from \nMontana as to why we didn't have any additional meetings based on your \ninstructions to the staff to work out language in the various areas? I \ndidn't sense there was inability to reach a consensus. It might well \nhave been, after we considered and pondered the legislative language \nthey were drafting, language over the weekend. We didn't have the \nopportunity to talk about those issues.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Ms. SNOWE. We didn't have an opportunity to talk about the language \nthe staff was instructed to draft in these three areas.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might ask the question--the reason is because I checked \nwith Senators who were at that meeting and they said: No, sorry, I am \nnot going to agree with that. They are going backwards. They were going \nin the other direction. They didn't want to meet. It is unfortunate, it \nis so unfortunate. To be candid, Senator, you and I know you and I were \nthe last two standing on this issue. Basically you are the last one \nstanding on this issue trying to find agreement.\n  But it is clear there are not enough Senators in this body who also \nwant agreement at this time. That is why I think we cannot let the \nMedicare provider legislation be held hostage to another bill which \ndoes have an agreement.\n  It is very unfortunate we could not get agreement. But it is partly \nbecause the Senate, as well as the House, is still a bit too partisan \non all matters--not all matters, but most matters. Particularly on this \nissue, because it gets to a very fundamental question which this body \nand the other body will have to address, the whole country is going to \nhave to address, and that is: What is the future of health care in this \ncountry? To what degree is it going to be privatized, to what degree \nnot? That is a huge question. The prescription drug benefit debate is \nreally the opening shot of that larger debate.\n  I wish that were not so. I wish we could pass the prescription drug \nbenefit\n\n[[Page S10543]]\n\nquickly this year, but it is the judgment of this Senator, and I think \nit is the judgment of virtually every other Senator in this body, that \nit is not going to happen now. I wish that were not true.\n  Therefore, I think let discretion be the better part of valor and let \nthis Medicare payment bill pass.\n  Ms. SNOWE. In response to what the Senator from Montana indicated, \nlet me say this. Obviously I am not privy to his private conversations, \nbut we were sitting in those meetings in good faith, and I didn't hear \nfrom anybody around that table--more than 14 Members--who resisted the \nidea we should not proceed, that we should not work out these areas, \nthat it was impossible.\n  Maybe in the final analysis, it might have been impossible, but that \ncertainly was not the expression of the sentiment in that meeting \nduring that course of time. The fact is quite the contrary. I think \nmost of the Senators--as I said, it was equally divided between \nRepublicans and Democrats, including Senator Jeffords from Vermont. \nThere was an indication of strong interest to proceed to try to see if \nwe could work through and resolve the identified areas in disagreement.\n  Those are the ones I mentioned previously.\n  So I didn't hear any indication there was a ``can't do'' attitude. In \nfact, just the contrary. They were suggesting we could proceed and \ninstructed the staff to work over the weekend on those various areas.\n  Suffice it to say we didn't have the process in the committee to work \nthese through. Obviously, for whatever reasons, it did not work out as \na result of those negotiations. But they were, I think, very close. I \nthink we were very close.\n  I know if those individuals sitting around the table had agreed in \nthese areas, we certainly could have overcome any political obstacles \nand impediments here in the Chamber because I think there is virtually \nunanimous desire to get something done on behalf of our Nation's \nseniors.\n  I cannot imagine anybody here in the Senate would want to tell their \nseniors that somehow it could not be done. We are elected to get things \ndone. We are responsible for ensuring this institution functions in a \nway that does dignity to the process. Unfortunately, I think in this \ninstance we failed.\n\n  I happen to believe on the Medicare provider give-back, if we were \nsomehow to be able to resolve those differences behind closed doors, \nwithout a markup and on the floor, then clearly we should be able to do \nwhat has been deemed to be the impossible--the impossible in this \ninstitution--in advancing this legislation in the interests of our \nNation's seniors. In fact, we invited the AARP to be part of our \nnegotiations this fall to talk about some of the issues.\n  Yes, they had concerns with the tripartisan bill, as they did with \nthe bill that had been offered by Senator Graham, in providing an \nunfunded mandate on States. But the fact is, who is to say any \nlegislation is perfect? We certainly didn't indicate ours was. This is \nthe agreement we had reached. We were prepared to accept amendments and \nto consider different ideas. That is where we were in these meetings \nthat were scheduled by the Senator from Montana in his office.\n  Ultimately, there were not additional meetings, even though the staff \nhad been instructed to draft language in the three areas I mentioned \noriginally. The fact is, this failure is at whose expense? It is at our \nNation's seniors' expense. As prescription drug prices go up each and \nevery year by more than 15 percent, it is 2\\1/2\\ times faster than the \ncost of additional health care components. By 2011, the prescription \ndrug spending is expected to be 15 percent of all health care spending \nin America. Rising prescription drug costs have made prescription drug \ncoverage for Medicare beneficiaries less available and more expensive. \nWe have seen employer-sponsored retiree health plans provide 28 percent \nof Medicare beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage, more than \nany other source. It is a major source of prescription drug coverage \nfor our Nation's seniors.\n  Now what are we finding? Far fewer employers are offering coverage to \ntheir employees. Those employers who continue to do so are requiring \nseniors to pick up a larger share of the costs. That is what we are \ntalking about. The proportion of larger employers offering retiree \nhealth benefits dropped from 31 percent to 23 percent between the years \n1997 to 2001. Those who were requiring Medicare-eligible retirees to \npay the full cost of their coverage rose from 27 percent to 31 percent.\n  Those are not my figures. Those are the figures that have been given \nby the GAO, that have been certified. Certainly I think they underscore \nthe costs of prescription drugs to our Nation's seniors and, I think, \nthe challenges we face in this country if we fail to address this most \nserious problem.\n  As AARP indicated in its own letter, the costs of prescription drugs \nare going up, as was said, more than 15 percent on an annual basis. \nThese added costs to beneficiaries, as we have seen, because the \nMedicare provider give-back is going to increase part B premiums. There \nis no question about that. So that is going to raise the premium $6 \nbillion in the first 5 years alone. These added costs, as they said in \ntheir letter recently, come in addition to double-digit hikes in \nprescription drug costs for older and disabled Americans, many of whom \nhave little or no options for drug coverage.\n  Employers continue to reduce or eliminate health care coverage. \nMedigap premiums continue to rise. And now, nine more Medicare+Choice \nplans are pulling out of Medicare.\n  So, you see, we do have an obligation to do what is right. I would \nnot be standing here today insisting on getting this done if I didn't \nthink it was possible. That is because I have had a number of \nconversations with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, on different \nsides of the issues, different philosophies. Many have indicated they \nare prepared to make concessions and develop compromise and consensus \non this issue to get it done here and now.\n  I agree with the statement that was made by the Senator from West \nVirginia with respect to the provider give-back legislation, I think it \nis necessary for our Nation's hospitals and home health care. So is \nthis. They are not mutually exclusive. They go hand in glove for our \nnation's seniors.\n  I have toured many of the hospitals in my State.\n  I have heard firsthand from seniors in my State about the plight of \nsome who have gone without prescription drug coverage.\n  I was told a story about a man who had diabetes and was supposed to \ntake his medication and couldn't take his medication. He knew what that \nwould lead to. He didn't have prescription drug coverage. So he was \nunable to take the medication prescribed by his doctor after he was \nreleased from the hospital. He had diabetes which ultimately led to \namputation and ultimately to his death.\n  Those are the kinds of tragic stories we hear over and over again. \nThose are choices our seniors shouldn't have to make.\n  We have the time. We have the time to do what is right.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 3018, the Beneficiary \nAccess to Care and Medicare Equity Act, which was recently introduced \nby the Chairman and Ranking member of the Finance Committee.\n  This act would provide more than $40 billion over the next 10 years \nto improve benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, guarantee that Medicare \nbeneficiaries continue to receive the high quality health care they \ndeserve, and increase reimbursements to Medicare providers.\n  I would prefer that we address these issues as part of comprehensive \nMedicare reform, reform that includes a new prescription-drug benefit. \nUnfortunately, the process the Majority Leader used to bring a \nprescription drug benefit to the Senate floor guaranteed its defeat, \nand no drug proposal put forward won the 60 votes necessary for \npassage. While the Senate was unable to pass a prescription drug bill, \nwe still have an opportunity to address other critical Medicare issues.\n  And it is critical. In 1997, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act. \nThis act made significant cuts in Medicare provider reimbursements and \nimplemented new payment systems. In many cases, these cuts made sense. \nHowever, in some cases they went too far. Moreover, the process of \nimplementing these new payment systems for home\n\n[[Page S10544]]\n\nhealth care, hospital outpatient services and skilled nursing-facility \nservices has not been a smooth one.\n  One key area where we see this is in payments to physicians. \nPhysicians are reimbursed for providing services to Medicare \nbeneficiaries under a fee schedule. The fee schedule is updated \nannually under a very complex formula. The formula considers the \nsustainable growth rate which is based on four factors: the estimated \nchanges in fees; the estimated changes in the average number of \nMedicare Part B enrollees, not including Medicare+Choice beneficiaries; \nestimated projected growth in real gross domestic product growth per \ncapita; and estimated change in expenditures due to changes in law or \nregulations.\n  On November 1, 2001, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(CMS) announced that the annual update of the fee schedule in 2002 \nwould result in a 5.4 percent reduction in reimbursements. A number of \nfactors led to this decline, including the adjustment by the \nsustainable growth rate. But the sustainable growth rate is flawed \nbecause of mistakes made by CMS. In the late 1990's, CMS overestimated \nthe number of Medicare beneficiaries in the Medicare+Choice program and \nunderestimated gross domestic product growth. These errors resulted in \nreimbursements greater than what they should been if CMS had not made \nthem. As more accurate data came about CMS has corrected its previous \nerrors. This correction has partially led to the -5.4 percent update \nthis year. Additionally, physicians are looking at future payment cuts \nnext year and the two years following that. Overall, physicians could \nsee a 17 percent reduction in reimbursements from Medicare over these \nfour years.\n  The key concern, of course, is really not so much Medicare \nreimbursements for physicians, but Medicare beneficiaries' access to \nmedical care. There is increasing evidence that doctors are not taking \nnew Medicare beneficiaries, are retiring early or accepting \nadministrative positions. According to a report in the March 12, 2002 \nedition of the New York Times, 17 percent of family doctors are no \nlonger taking new Medicare patients. The Beneficiary Access to Care and \nMedicare Equity Act would increase reimbursements to physicians over \nthe next three years, and, in turn, help stem the tide of doctors \nrefusing to treat new Medicare patients.\n\n  Of course, physicians are not the only health-care providers that \nthis legislation would help. The legislation would eliminate a 15 \npercent reduction in home health-care reimbursements mandated by the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. As it turns out, the Balanced Budget Act's \noriginal change in the payment system for home health care services \nhelped save money. But it is no longer necessary to implement the 15 \npercent cut. Additionally, this legislation would help smooth out the \ntransition to a new payment system for skilled nursing facilities. S. \n3018 would also provide both urban and rural hospitals with increases \nin reimbursements. It has many provisions to help alleviate the \nreimbursement differences between rural and urban hospitals. Of \nparticular note, S. 3018 contains a technical change that will allow \npublicly-funded safety net hospitals to negotiate for lower drug \nprices. These hospitals bear a disproportionate burden in caring for \nthe uninsured in our country; allowing them to negotiate lower prices \nwill save them millions of dollars.\n  Another provision of note is section 805, which would provide $48 \nmillion annually for two years to States and other providers that offer \nfederally-required emergency medical treatment to illegal aliens. A \ncongressionally-commissioned study by the U.S.-Mexico Border Counties \nCoalition estimates that the 24 counties along the southwest border \nincur uncompensated costs of over $200 million per year in connection \nwith the provision of emergency health treatment to undocumented \naliens. The non-border counties in southwest States, and other states, \nincluding New York, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Massachusetts, \nWashington, Colorado, and Maryland, also incur tremendous costs. The \nentire state of Arizona, for example, incurs unreimbursed costs of \napproximately $100 million per year to provide such treatment.\n  These southwest States and counties, many of which have very small \ntax bases and small annual budgets, and other States should not be \nforced to bear the responsibility of providing emergency health \ntreatment to undocumented aliens. These unreimbursed costs have helped \nput Arizona's and other States' affected hospitals in a state of dire \nfiscal emergency. Many hospitals have closed, or are in danger of \nclosing, their emergency rooms either temporarily or permanently.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 provided funding to states to help \ndefray some of these uncompensated costs; however, this provision \nexpired at the end of fiscal year 2001. Section 805 would specifically \nextend and refine the Balanced Budget Amendment Act of 1997 to provide \n$32 million in each of fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 to the 17 \nStates with the highest number of undocumented aliens, as defined by \nthe U.S. Department of Justice. Additionally, in fiscal year 2003 and \nfiscal year 2004, $16 million would also be allotted to the six highest \nundocumented alien apprehension States, as defined by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Forty-eight million dollars per year is just a fraction of the \nunreimbursed costs that the States incur each year, but this funding \nwill at least begin to defray some of the costs.\n  Although, I strongly support most of the provisions contained in S. \n3018, I do have concerns about others. For instance, section 707 of S. \n3018 provides States with a temporary 1.3 percent point increase in \ntheir Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, FMAP, payments, the amount \nthat the Federal Government supplements States' Medicaid spending.\n\n  Under FMAP, Medicaid funds are distributed to States based upon a \nformula designed to provide a higher Federal matching percentage to \nthose States with lower relative per capita income, and a lower Federal \nmatching percentage to those States with higher per capita income. This \nformula, although not perfect, is justified because States cannot \nmanipulate it for their own gain; the data are periodically published \nand can be estimated with reasonable accuracy. Additionally, the use of \nper capita income is a proxy for state-tax capacity which, in turn, \nrelates to a State's ability to pay for medical services for needy \npeople. To put it simply: poorer States get more help than wealthier \nStates.\n  Unfortunately, S. 3018 ignores the Medicaid formula and gives each \nState a 1.3 percent point increase. Under this section, States that \nhave been determined by the Medicaid formula to receive the lowest FMAP \nof 50 percent receive the greatest percentage increase in FMAP. States \nwith the highest FMAP receive the lowest percentage increase. This is \nthe exact opposite of how the funds should be allocated. The Medicaid \nformula, whatever its faults, does indicate a relative sense of need. \nIt would be wrong to give the least needy States the largest percentage \nincrease.\n  Even though I have concerns about how funds are distributed under \nthis section, I urge my colleagues to support S. 3018. It is vitally \nimportant that Congress enact changes to Medicare payment policies \nbefore we adjourn. I also support the passage of a Medicare \nprescription-drug benefit, preferably the tripartisan modernization \nproposal; but we should not allow our inability to reach a consensus on \nthat matter to stop us from making the appropriate changes to \nMedicare's payment policies. Medicare beneficiaries need guaranteed \naccess to high quality care, and S. 3018 is a means to that end.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I first want to salute the Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Baucus, as well as my good friend and colleague, Senator \nGrassley, for their bipartisan effort and leadership in crafting S. \n3018, the Beneficiary Access to Care and Medicare Equity Act of 2002.\n  As the chairman and the ranking member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, they have worked long and hard on legislation that is \ncritically important to the future of health care for our citizens that \nrely on Medicare. I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 3018, and I urge \nall of our colleagues to support its passage as soon as possible.\n  In the closing days of the 107th Congress, there will be many bills \nthat on their way to consideration and passage will enjoy the unanimous \nconsent of\n\n[[Page S10545]]\n\nthe Senators. There are few of these many bills more worthy of our \nconsideration and unanimous consent than this measure.\n  Vermont, like so many of our States, has a healthcare system that is \nfacing reductions in levels of Medicare reimbursement that are \nuntenable. In some cases, these reductions took effect on October 1 and \nothers will occur at the end of this month. The cuts have already led \nto fewer physicians and services being available to care for our \nelders.\n  The list of cuts and reductions is long. Physicians and other \nhealthcare professionals, home health agencies, critical access \nhospitals, skilled nursing facilities, sole community hospitals, and \nothers are being affected. And make no mistake, these cuts translate as \ncuts in access to healthcare for our elders.\n  But it is not too late. We can pass this legislation, engage in a \nconference with our colleagues in the other chamber, and have a bill \nfor the President to sign before the end of this Congress.\n  Once again, I want to commend Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley for \ntheir work on this bill and for this chance to speak to its merits \ntoday. It is needed legislation, it is balanced, and it is well \ncrafted. Our elders need it passed. Our providers need it passed. \nChildren depending on SCHIP need it passed, and our States need it \npassed. We should not let this opportunity to enact this legislation go \nby, and so I urge our colleagues to support its passage.\n  Also I want to commend the Senator from Maine for her statement with \nwhich I agree and commend her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, the Senator from Maine has \ntold us what the Baucus-Grassley unanimous consent request to move the \nlegislation forward won't do, what it has been said is included, what \nhas not been included in it, and, therefore, as a result it shouldn't \nbe considered at this point.\n  I will concede the point to my friend from Maine that it is a \ntremendous shame we didn't somehow pass a prescription drug benefit for \nour seniors. I have worked with her. We even shared an amendment on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I know of her passion for health care and for \nthe benefits for our seniors. I share those values, and I share the \nconcern we all have today everywhere that we don't have a prescription \ndrug benefit for our seniors.\n  I have to go back to Omaha and face George and Lee, who have spent so \nmuch time telling me about the importance of having a prescription drug \nbenefit. But you know we had three shots at it this session. One was it \nwas too expensive, one was it didn't provide enough benefits, and the \none my friend from Maine supported--the insurance model--failed by \ngetting only 48 votes.\n  But I come from an insurance State. And not one insurer that I spoke \nto told me they planned to offer this benefit anywhere, let alone in \nthe State of Nebraska.\n  There were a lot of reasons why that particular bill didn't make it. \nThere were reasons why the other two bills didn't make it.\n  I would like to have us pass a prescription drug benefit before we \nleave, but I don't want to do it at the expense of this legislation \nthat is so necessary.\n  When I go back, if we don't pass it because we try to pass a \nprescription drug benefit that causes the failure of this legislation \nwhich I am going to describe in a minute, I will have to face George \nand Lee. Not only will they tell me we didn't get a prescription drug \nbenefit, but their physician Medicare rates are down and their doctor \ndoesn't want to provide the care for them anymore. Or I have to go back \nand find out the skilled nursing facilities are not going to be funded \nor the State fiscal relief that Senators Rockefeller and Collins and I \nworked so hard to get through is now cut back from $9 billion to $5 \nbillion and that is not going to be available to the State.\n  I agree with the passion of the Senator from Maine and her concern \nabout the fact we didn't get a prescription drug benefit done yet this \nsession. But I don't agree we ought to pull this legislation which is \nbefore us back into committee so they can attach to it a bill that \nfailed, only got 48 votes, and which I don't think will work. I think \nwe have to separate these two issues--and they have been separated.\n  Let us talk about the bill that is now before us, the Baucus-Grassley \nbill, a bipartisan effort. The ranking Member from Iowa is pushing to \nhave this considered on the floor rather than to go back and be delayed \nin committee.\n  Under current law, Medicare's physician payment rates are projected \nto fall by 12 percent over the next 3 years. In Nebraska, physicians' \nlosses due to the 2003-2005 cuts will total about $63 million or \n$17,230 per physician. This comes on top of a 5.4 percent payment cut \nwhich cost Nebraska doctors a total of $12.9 million or about $3,875 \nper physician in 2002.\n  An AMA survey conducted earlier this year found that one in four \nphysicians either has restricted or plans to restrict the number or \ntype of Medicare patients treated. One in three has stopped or intends \nto stop delivering certain services to Medicare beneficiaries.\n\n  Additional payment cuts of an extra year will only exacerbate these \nproblems and cause significant access problems in the State of \nNebraska--a State that is already challenged geographically to be able \nto provide access to our residents.\n  Let us talk for just a moment about skilled nursing facilities and \nwhat will happen there.\n  Our skilled nursing facilities are also in jeopardy. If action isn't \ntaken and if this legislation does not pass, then Nebraska's facilities \nwill lose $28.48 per patient per day next year, for a total of $10 \nmillion. There are just some that aren't going to make it. They are \ngoing to be in small communities that will be left out when it comes to \nskilled nursing facilities.\n  When it comes to State fiscal relief, my colleague from West Virginia \nand I--both former Governors from our States--know very well what the \nimpact is going to be on the States of Nebraska and West Virginia, as \nwell as the rest of the States. Forty-nine out of 50 States must \nbalance their budgets by law.\n  It is no secret the economy is hurting. States are facing a number of \ndifficult decisions as a result of that. When States have to make \nbudget cuts, let me assure you it affects real people. There may be \nline items in a budget, but there are faces associated in every case.\n  In a special session in Nebraska in August, the legislature made some \ndrastic cuts. It wasn't pretty. Thirteen thousand kids were cut from \nMedicaid.\n  That is why we have been working so closely, Senators Rockefeller, \nCollins, and I, to pass State fiscal relief, which is part of this \nlegislation. Seventy-five of our Senate colleagues agreed with us when \nthey supported our amendment in July. Senators Baucus and Grassley have \nincluded State fiscal relief in this very important provider package, \nand it is extremely important to the people in the State of Nebraska \nand the States of every one of our colleagues here in the Senate.\n  If I were one of my residents of Nebraska, or one of my constituents \nwatching or listening to the debate today and heard about unanimous \nconsent requests, objections, sending this back to committee for \nfurther consideration, trying to deal with what cloture is, how many \ntimes, what person did what, and how many of us are all interested in \nmaking sure we get not only this legislation through but also a \nprescription drug benefit, they have to be confused.\n  Their only question is, Why don't you just get this legislation done \nand work also on a prescription drug benefit? What has one got to do \nwith the other? Don't, for heaven's sake, deny us our prescription drug \nbenefit because you can't get it through, and at the same time now come \nalong and make sure our doctors aren't going to get reimbursed enough, \nor our skilled nursing homes aren't going to have enough money, and our \nStates are going to continue to cut back on Medicaid benefits. Separate \nthe two issues and get them done.\n  Three tries, and I don't think we are out. That is true in baseball. \nI don't think it is true here. I think we can dust off one of these \nversions and make it work well.\n  I have met with Senator Snowe on a prescription drug benefit. I have \nmet with everybody I can in the interest of finding a prescription drug \nbenefit. I know it is possible. I also know it is\n\n[[Page S10546]]\n\ndifficult. But I think it is extremely important for us to first \nfulfill our obligations with the Baucus-Grassley effort. Let us let \nthis come to a vote. Let us stop the objections. Let us withdraw the \nobjection from the other side. Let us get a vote. Then let us see if a \nbunch of us can come back together--and we should--and get a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  But, for heaven's sake, even in the greatest and most sincere effort \nin the world, we should not think about one bill here because we are \ntrying to save another, when we know very well it is not going to work. \nWe have not run out of time. We can do this. We should bifurcate them. \nWe should separate them, get the Baucus-Grassley bill done, withdraw \nthe amendment, and let us work on a prescription drug benefit so I can \ngo home and I can talk to Lee and George and tell them something more \nthan: Well, we tried.\n\n  I sure don't want to have to go back and say: Well, we didn't get \nanything on prescription drugs. But that isn't where the bad news ends. \nThere is worse news. We also didn't get the give-back bill through, and \nthat means if you have to go to a nursing home, there may not be one. \nYour doctor may decide he is not going to treat you because he has had \na reimbursement dropped or if, heaven forbid, they have to go on \nMedicaid, there will not be any benefits to provide for seniors as \nwell.\n  I don't want to have to tell the children of Nebraska there are \nfurther cuts coming because we could not get the State relief, the \nFMAP, as it is called, back to the States to take care of the short \nbudgets so that people are not going to be further disadvantaged by \nthese unfortunate economic conditions in these times.\n  I agree with my friend from West Virginia, there is more passion in \nthis Senate body to pass a prescription drug benefit than you can \nimagine. The problem is very simple. We just cannot agree on how to do \nit. It cannot cost too much, the benefits cannot be too little, and we \ncannot pass something that will not work.\n  I think we have the collective wisdom to find a way to do it, but it \nis going to require the collective will to do it. But this mechanism is \nnot the mechanism on which to do it. And let's not sink it trying to do \nsomething noble for those who are the most vulnerable among us, our \nseniors.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10546-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10546-S10548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CONCURRENT RECEIPT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise at this point on a different \nsubject, with the tolerance and forgiveness of the Senator from \nLouisiana, to discuss a different problem, concurrent receipt.\n  I am very pleased my friend from Minnesota is in the Chair because he \nis on the Armed Services Committee, and so it makes me very happy to be \nable to present this argument to him.\n  We are all very familiar with this practice of requiring military \nretirees to choose between military pay for retirement and disability \nbenefits. There is a history of this which I will get into. The money \ncomes from the Department of Veterans Affairs, but it is a very sad \nstate of affairs that we have come into.\n  This is a practice that my friend, Bill Stubblefield, of Martinsburg, \nwhich is a large town in West Virginia, who serves on the board of \ndirectors of the Retired Officers Association, told me ``is patently \nunfair when a serviceman or woman, who has devoted 20 plus years of \ntheir life in service to this country--suffering physically as a \nconsequence--has to be penalized by having their VA disability offset \nby their retirement pay.''\n  It is a huge subject. We have been fighting for years to eliminate \nthis injustice. While the Senate, under the leadership of Senator Harry \nReid of Nevada, has passed such a provision several times, this is the \nfirst time we have something to offer that approximates the Senate's \nefforts in dealing with the House, which is now a problem.\n  Money has been set aside in the deeming resolution to fund some \nversion of concurrent receipt.\n  Now we learn that the Bush administration is threatening to veto--\nthey have said the President will veto--the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill. I think the enormity of that is $347 billion, \nsomething of that sort. They said the President will veto the entire \nbill because officials in this administration oppose concurrent receipt \nfor service members who are retired from the Armed Forces with a \nservice-connected disability.\n  A disability is a very special condition. Frankly, I find this \nopposition highly objectionable. I find it shocking. It wholly \ndisregards the enormous dedication and sacrifice of our men and women \nin uniform, and it labels their claim to compensation earned in service \nto this Nation as ``double-dipping,'' which is a slam and a putdown. It \nis something you say in sort of contemptuous terms.\n  When did this become double-dipping? More than 100 years ago, \nCongress examined the military pensions of veterans of the Mexican-\nAmerican war. At that time, Congress found the retired service members \nwho returned to active duty could draw active duty, retirement, and \ndisability pay. So life was good and right and fair.\n  During debate, the late Senator Francis Marion Cockrell, who, I \nconfess, is unknown to me, argued that:\n\n       [T]he salary we pay the officers of the Army is intended to \n     be in full for all military services. We allow longevity pay \n     . . . in lieu of pension and everything else.\n\n  In 1891, therefore, Congress banned what is called ``dual \ncompensation'' for past or active service and disability compensation. \nSo that is history, 1891.\n  That legislation accomplished its goal. Service members can no longer \nreceive retirement or full disability compensation while on active \nduty. However, the Congress of 1981 painted with too broad a stroke. \nRetirement and compensation are and have always been intended to \ncompensate very different purposes. One is called retirement; the other \nis called a disability. They are totally unconnected.\n  This is a very important issue to veterans in this Senator's State \nand to veterans throughout the country. In fact, I would say to the \nPresiding Officer, there is no single subject on which this Senator \ngets more mail and more telephone calls and more conversations when in \nmy State than on this subject of concurrent receipt. It is an \noverwhelmingly emotional and powerful argument of anger and disgust and \nfrustration on the part of the veterans of this country.\n  Veterans such as Hugh Weeks of Beckley, WV, a veteran of World War \nII, Korea, and Vietnam--that's not bad--a career military man, writes \nto tell me that while their military careers placed hardships on them \nand their families, they never stopped serving during those hardships. \nHugh wrote to me: ``Now is the time for the government to stop \ndiscriminating against us.''\n  In yet another disturbing setback for retiree veterans, the House of \nRepresentatives Appropriations Committee, last week, reported out a VA-\nHUD appropriations bill for fiscal year 2003 spending. This bill \ncontains a provision that would prohibit specifically VA from using any \nstaffing funds to adjudicate claims for VA service-connected disability \nbenefits that would result in concurrent receipt.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the applicable text of \nthe bill and committee report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   H.R. 5605--Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2003\n\n       Sec. 114. (a) No appropriations in this Act for the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs shall be available for the \n     adjudication of any claim for disability compensation filed \n     after the date of the enactment of a new concurrent receipt \n     law by a veteran who is entitled to retired or retainer pay \n     based upon service in the uniformed services if the Secretary \n     determines that, if compensation under the claim is awarded \n     to the claimant, the veteran will, by reason of the new \n     concurrent receipt law, be entitled to payment of both \n     compensation under the claim and some amount of such retired \n     pay determined without regard to the provisions of sections \n     5304 and 5305 of title 38, United States Code.\n       (b) For purposes of subsection (a), the term `new \n     concurrent receipt law' means a provision of law enacted \n     after October 1, 2002, that\n\n[[Page S10547]]\n\n     provides that certain veterans are entitled to be paid both \n     veterans' disability compensation and military retired pay \n     (in whole or in part) without regard to sections 5304 and \n     5305 of title 38, United States Code.\n                                  ____\n\n\nDepartments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and \n             Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2003\n\n       Section 114 prohibits VBA funds from being used to \n     adjudicate claims arising from any new concurrent receipt \n     legislation. The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates \n     that enacting concurrent receipt of compensation benefits and \n     military retirement pay would result in estimated mandatory \n     costs to VA of approximately $16,000,000,000 over ten years, \n     as well as administrative costs of $124,000,000 in the first \n     year and $245,000,000 over a five year period. These \n     estimates do not include the additional costs to the \n     Department of Defense. The Department estimates the \n     concurrent receipt claims workload would add more than \n     800,000 claims over the next three years. VA has been working \n     diligently over the years to reduce the claims backlog and \n     adjudication time. As of August, VA adjudicated almost \n     730,000 claims in fiscal year 2002 and still has a current \n     workload of over 355,000 claims with a lag time of 225 days. \n     Regardless of the policy surrounding concurrent receipt, the \n     Committee is concerned that the deluge of new concurrent \n     receipt claims will paralyze the system and those veterans \n     who have been waiting for years to get a determination will \n     never see the benefit. The Committee directs the \n     Administration to budget appropriate VA funding for both \n     mandatory and administrative costs should such new concurrent \n     receipt legislation be enacted.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, if this provision becomes law, no \nservice member who retires next year and is disabled because of service \nwill be found service connected by VA. No current retiree who has yet \nto file a claim with VA but is disabled because of service will be \nservice connected by the Veterans' Administration. No retiree who is \nalready service connected, whose condition worsens, will receive a \nservice-connected rating increase. No widow of a retiree who died of a \ndisability related to service will be able to receive VA service-\nconnected death benefits if she receives Department of Defense survivor \nbenefits.\n  It is discrimination. It is wrong. If followed to its logical \nconclusion, none of the benefits that flow from service-connected \ndisability status will be given to otherwise completely eligible \nindividuals. These important benefits include free health care and, \nmost importantly, obviously, long-term care, vocational rehabilitation \nand certain life or homeowner's insurance, health care, education, and \nhome loan eligibility for surviving spouses and children.\n  Our House colleagues have justified this action, so to speak, this \npolicy choice, by pointing to the cost to the Federal Government of \npaying for benefits that rightfully accrue to veterans who devoted a \nlifetime of service to this country. The House Appropriations Committee \nalso warned of a potential flood of new claims that might be filed if \nconcurrent receipt passes, increasing delays in processing.\n  My shock over these provisions and the rationale given for them is \nnot that of the chair, which I am, of an authorizing committee seeing \nits role usurped by appropriators. One gets accustomed to that. No one \nis more concerned about the way the Veterans' Administration \nadjudicates claims than I am. As chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, I have been working on this issue for a very long time. I am \ntroubled not only about the length of time the Veterans' Administration \ntakes but the quality of the decisionmaking in that process.\n  We can quibble over the number of claims that might arise if \nconcurrent receipt passes and how much they might add to VA's already \nshocking backlog. That is why we must support, therefore, a sufficient \nappropriation to process and pay for these claims.\n  None of these concerns aforementioned by me justify prohibiting \nbenefits to eligible veterans and their families, benefits they have \nearned through their service to this country. Nothing justifies that.\n  It can be straightened out in this body. It is time for us as a \nnation to step up and do the right thing. Otherwise, how can we face \nHugh Weeks, the aforementioned veteran from Beckley, WV, and all of the \ndisabled retirees who stand with him. When will it be time to stop \ndiscriminating against those who continue to serve after they have \nsuffered disabling injuries or illnesses? I hope that time is now.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am glad to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I just want to thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for his insight and leadership and for educating me, a Senator \nfrom Florida, from his position as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee.\n  I wanted to bring to the Senator some late-breaking news. We have \njust had a conference committee meeting of the Armed Services Committee \nin which we are trying to get final resolution on the DOD authorization \nbill. The House conferees refused to show up with the Senate conferees \nto hammer out the final version because of a dispute over concurrent \nreceipt. But it is not a dispute from the entire membership of the \nHouse of Representatives. In fact, they had a motion to instruct \nconferees to accept the Senate's position, as articulated by the \nSenator from West Virginia on concurrent receipt; in other words, that \nif you have a military retirement, you ought to have that, and it \nshould not be offset by what you are also entitled to if you are a \ndisabled veteran who is entitled to disability benefits.\n  Despite the fact that the House passed a motion to instruct \nconferees, 400 to 0, to accept the Senate position--in other words, to \naccept concurrent receipt--and give these disabled veterans what they \nare entitled to, the White House sends a message to the House of \nRepresentatives leadership and says: Don't agree with the Senate.\n  I was so proud of the chairman of the Armed Services Committee; when \nhe found out that was the position, he said: Nothing doing. We are not \nagreeing to the White House's position. We are going to stand up. The \nSenate is going to stand up for concurrent receipt.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I wanted to bring him that \nlate-breaking news.\n  I also want to put very clearly where the responsibility is because \nthe veterans of this country don't know that they are going to be \ndenied concurrent receipt because of instructions from the White House \nstaff and President Bush.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to add my words on this issue and \nalso to thank the Senator from West Virginia for his comments, as well \nas the Senator from Florida. The Senator from West Virginia is \nabsolutely correct; this is a very important issue to Americans \ngenerally, particularly in the context in which we find ourselves, \ngetting ready to perhaps fight yet another war and honing our designs \non homeland security, but particularly to the veterans and their \nfamilies that are affected.\n  Unfortunately, the President has stated he will, in fact, veto the \nDefense bill over this issue. I urge him--and I am sure many of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle do as well--to reconsider. While \nthere is a cost associated with this, clearly it is an injustice that \nshould be corrected.\n  A veteran, a person who has put their life on the line, particularly \nin recent years, been called up again and again and again into active \nreserves and also reservists have been called up, to have a person \ninjured or disabled and then to serve out their 20 years, only to come \nto the realization that they can receive their retirement but they \ncan't receive their full disability is a very unfair situation, \nsomething for which our veterans most certainly deserve our better \nattention.\n  As we allocate our resources to strengthen our military, not only do \nwe need smarter weapons, but we need to keep our promises to our men \nand women in uniform. We need to keep our promises about health care--\nyou take care of us now, we will take care of you in your senior years. \nWe are doing a better job of that by stepping up with the TRICARE and \nhealth benefits. But this concurrent receipt issue is where the rubber \nhits the road and trying to get some sort of commitment to helping our \nveterans who are disabled on the battlefield or injured on the \nbattlefield, that disability then is subsequent to that injury, to \nallow them and their families to take the full benefit of their \nretirement as well as their disability seems to me in the scheme of \nwhat we have been talking about: Investing in our military, trying to \nkeep up their morale, keep up our promises,\n\n[[Page S10548]]\n\nand live up to our promises to our men and women in uniform as to what \nwe should be doing.\n  I am hopeful this situation will resolve itself to the benefit of \nveterans. I, for one, am prepared to stay here and work toward that \nend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10548-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JOHN BREAUX\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to address a subject on which \nthere is no disagreement. The President would agree, as would Senate \nDemocrats and Republicans and many Members of Congress; that is, to \ncongratulate the senior Senator from Louisiana, John Breaux, on 30 \nyears of service in the Congress.\n  We celebrated that momentous anniversary this past Saturday. He \nreceived, of course, many well wishes from his many friends and \nsupporters in Louisiana and around the Nation.\n  I know his family is very proud. I want to say for a minute how proud \nI am of his service to our State of Louisiana. Thirty years ago, \nSenator John Breaux, then a Congressman, came to Washington as a young \nlawyer from a small town, the city of Crowley. He was elected to the \nHouse of Representatives at a very young age. In fact, when he got \nhere, he was the youngest Member of Congress. He has served our State \nadmirably ever since. Now he is in his third term in the U.S. Senate, \nand I have every hope he will run again and have no doubt he will be \nreelected.\n  John likes to say he started campaigning in nursery school. Those of \nus who know him well would almost believe that. That is probably no \nstretch. He said he was going to city council meetings with his \ngrandfather when he was 7 years old. In high school he was a popular \nathlete who played hard but was always fair to his teammates as well as \nhis opponents. He learned the lessons on those athletic fields of hard \nwork, teamwork, and leadership, which serve him well. Frankly, it is so \nobvious to all of us who know him and his affable manner, his very \napproachable way, always with a kind word to say, always a joke, and \nalways something to lighten up a discussion at the appropriate time. \nThose traits have served him well as an outstanding Congressman and \nSenator.\n  In addition, because none of us come here on our own, he has come \nhere as a husband, a father, and now as a grandfather. His wife, Lois, \nhas truly been a tremendous partner, at great sacrifice to herself and \nher family. John and Lois brought their Cajun roots to our Nation's \ncapital, and we are proud of that. He has never lost sight of who he is \nor where he has come from. We know him at home in many ways, but in \nWashington he is known as a strong, vocal, and effective advocate for \nagriculture. His hometown sits right in the heart of rice country, in \nCrowley, LA, and in the heart of, in many ways, sugarcane country in \nsouth Louisiana; and he is familiar with all of our row crops, cattle, \nand other aquaculture and agricultural commodities.\n  He is a strong and effective advocate of energy policy for the \nNation, and his voice has been one that has brought us to the center, \nwith a balanced approach on our energy policy. In addition, on our \nhealth care industry and issues, he has been particularly noted as a \nleader. As a member of the Finance Committee, there is not an important \ncompromise that is developed on that committee--or outside of that \nCommittee, for that matter--that he is not part and parcel of, which is \na great strength as a Senator, particularly in these times when our \nparties seem to have a hard time coming together and finding middle \nground and working out a compromise. Senator Breaux brings so much \neffort in that regard and so much help.\n  To mention a few things--and after his 30 years, I could stay here \nall night and I could talk for hours. I will highlight a few of the \nthings that would not have passed without his able help and assistance: \nthe Welfare Reform Act, many health insurance reform bills, the \nbalanced budget amendment, and tax cut packages that have passed here. \nHe chaired the Special Committee on Aging and to that committee has \nbrought a tremendous amount of passion on the issues of Social Security \nand Medicare, which have served this Nation well.\n  I will conclude by saying we have all been blessed by his leadership \nand his talent. He has used it to help Louisiana to grow and expand \neconomically. Mr. President, he has had a tremendous impact on the \nNation at large. He has fought for businesses, schools, workers, \nstudents, and opportunities for all. He is a founder of the DLC, of the \nnew Democratic Network.\n  I could not have a better partner in the U.S. Senate than John \nBreaux. He is a mentor, a friend, and a partner in helping to \nstrengthen our State. I wanted to spend a few moments to acknowledge \nthe 30th anniversary and wish him 30 more years. He is in great health. \nHe plays tennis regularly, with Democrats and Republicans alike, and \nbeats us all on the court. He wins many of his battles on the Senate \nfloor as well.\n  Again, I congratulate Senator John Breaux.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10548-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10548-S10549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RESERVISTS AND GUARD PAID PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will now address the Reservists and \nGuard Paid Protection Act, which I introduced last week. I'm looking \nforward to working diligently in the months and years ahead--hopefully, \nit won't take years--to pass this bill. I think it is a bill we \nprobably should have addressed some years ago. I will speak to what the \nbill does.\n  The Reservists and Guard Paid Protection Act attempts to put into law \na tax credit for employers who voluntarily--because it is not \nmandatory--pay their reservists and maintain their salary level when \nthey are called up to represent us, to fight for us, to stand in harm's \nway, to preserve our freedom, whether it be in Afghanistan, Bosnia, or \nIraq, or anyplace our flag needs to continue to wave.\n  Mr. President, as you might know--and I am certain most people in \nAmerica don't realize--when our reservists are called up, their salary \nis cut. When our reservists are called up to defend us--because the \nPresident, our Commander in Chief, and this Congress have authorized us \nto call on them, to call on their lives, their health, and strength to \ndefend us--they, in most instances, take a pay cut. Why? Because their \nsalaries are generally higher in the civilian sector than we are able \nto compensate them.\n  No soldier works for a paycheck, I realize that. If they did, we \nwould not have any soldiers, because their paychecks are not what they \nneed to be. They are patriotic and they believe in our Nation and they \nwant to do their part. For that, they should be commended.\n  This Reservists and Guard Protection Act gives their employers, if \nthey voluntarily keep their salaries at the level they were before they \nwere called up to serve, a 50 percent tax credit. So it helps the \nemployer, who also is making a sacrifice, might I say, in the new \nsystem we have on relying more on reservists and guardsmen. The \nemployers themselves are, of course, by law mandated to keep that job \nopen so when the Reservists come back, they have a job. They are not \nmandated--and should not be--to pick up the tab for their salary, but \nwe can help, and the cost is really minimal compared to the benefits \nthat would result.\n  In addition, this bill also would mandate the Federal Government \nwould maintain, for those reservists who are Federal employees--and we \nhave a good percentage--not a majority, but a number of our Federal \nemployees who might work at Treasury during the day, but are weekend \nwarriors, and now they are full-time warriors because they have been \ncalled up--this bill would mandate the Federal Government simply \nmaintain their pay at their regular level. Instead of taking the \npaycheck and sending part of it back to the Treasury while they defend \nus, they would be allowed to keep that paycheck, which would make a \ntremendous amount of sense. I know it would mean a tremendous amount to \nthe spouses and family members at home, who have to keep the lights on, \npay the mortgage, pay the rent, or pay the car payment monthly, food \nbills, et cetera. Just because one person in the family--one of the \nbreadwinners, and in some cases it may be the sole breadwinner--has \nbeen called up to go to war, the family bills don't stop coming. They \nneed to be paid.\n  So anything we can do to keep our reservists' and our guardsmen's pay\n\n[[Page S10549]]\n\nwhere it was so they are not taking a cut to defend us, I think would \nbe appropriate at this time. Basically, that is what this bill does.\n  Let me make another point before I close.\n  Since 1991, the U.S. military has significantly scaled down its \nactive troops because we came to the end of the cold war and we thought \nwe could scale back our active troops. Now we are scaling up, of \ncourse, to meet these new threats, and into the foreseeable future, by \ncalling on our Reserves more and more. In fact, they represented 40 to \n50 percent of our troop force in Desert Storm. We have called on them \nin somewhat a disproportionate way to defend us in Bosnia, Afghanistan, \nand no doubt, if we go to Iraq, our active force will be perhaps \n100,000, if not 200,000, in number, and many of them will be \nreservists.\n  Gone are the cold war days when we had massive military personnel \npositioned all over the world. Now we are relying on a leaner force. \nThe reservists have become a part of that leaner force because we need \nflexibility in putting our force together to serve a great purpose.\n  In addition, with the new war--and you know, Mr. President, because \nyou serve on the Armed Services Committee and the Emerging Threats \nSubcommittee which I chair, you are familiar with the fact we are going \nto need new skill sets in our armed services--linguists, cultural \nexperts, historians. We are going to need different skill sets, highly \ntechnical individuals--public relations people, individuals who have \nskills about setting up civil authorities. So our new Army, Navy, Air \nForce, and Marines have to be a group of men and women who are highly \ntrained in specialized skills.\n  Sometimes we can get those specialized skills from those on active \nduty, but it is smarter, more economical, and actually more effective \nif we are able to pull certain types of skills out of the civilian \nforce when needed to apply them to that specific goal or objective. \nThat is the way this new military is going to be designed for the \nfuture. It is different from the First World War, different from the \nSecond World War, different than the cold war strategy. With a new \nstrategy and new weapons, we are asking the reservists to do more. \nLet's not ask them to do more with less. Let's not ask them to do more \nand cut their pay. Let's do right by our reservists by supporting them. \nThey are weekend warriors, but now they are simply warriors. Our \nbenefits to them and our pay systems should reflect this new demand on \ntheir schedules.\n  OPTEMPO is up. Our conflicts and our challenges are right before us, \nand we need to respond.\n  I am hoping we will gain support for this act. I look forward to \ndebating and presenting it to the committee, but I think this is the \nleast we can do to support a segment of our national security force \nthat is so important and so crucial for us to win the war on terrorism, \nto establish the peace around the world, so this economy, and economies \naround the world, can grow and people truly can live in peace and \nprosperity. These are the people who are on the front line making that \nhappen.\n  This is a very important bill. I hope we will gain a lot of support \nfor it as the months and weeks unfold.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10549-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10549-S10553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN E.

Ambrose;\n       (2) expresses its condolences to Stephen Ambrose's wife and \n     5 children;\n       (3) salutes the excellence of Stephen Ambrose at capturing \n     the greatness of the American spirit in words; and\n       (4) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of Stephen \n     Ambrose.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this resolution is to honor--I am not \nsure words can actually do appropriate justice--a great American who \npassed away this last weekend. That American is Stephen Ambrose, the \nauthor of a number of books, a man who helped our Nation understand the \ndynamics of war, the spectacular strengths of the American infantry men \nand women in uniform.\n  He passed away quite a young man in his midsixties. He was a \nprofessor of history, known by many of us personally, and was a \npersonal friend of the Senator from Alaska. I submit for the Record \nthis resolution, to have it appear in the Congressional Record to honor \na great American, someone Louisiana has lost and the Nation has lost. I \nam not sure we can ever replace him.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Louisiana allow me to \nbe a cosponsor of this resolution.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Louisiana, I love to \nread. I have very few extracurricular activities outside the Senate, \nbut one is reading. I have received so much pleasure from ``Undaunted \nCourage,'' the great book about the Lewis and Clark expedition, which \nchanged my view of our country. Of course, the work he did on World War \nII is something that will forever be in my mind and the mind of anyone \nwho knows anything or cares about the history of this country. And to \nhave the pleasure of being able to talk with him on a number of \noccasions when he came to speak to groups of Senators, I consider one \nof the pleasures of this job.\n  I compliment the Senator from Louisiana for submitting this \nresolution. It is a resolution I will remember as having been a part of \nbecause he allowed me to have so much pleasure in traveling to places \nin my mind's eye I would never be able to reach but for his great \nability to write the English language.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator, and I am pleased to have him \ncosponsor this resolution. It has been said Stephen Ambrose was not a \nhistorian's historian, but he was a student's historian. He was truly \nan exceptional teacher. In my mind, when I think of an exceptional \nteacher, it is not someone who just communicates facts but someone who \nteaches in a way that inspires one to be better, to help one understand \nthe context in which one lives. He was not an exceptional teacher just \nfor the brightest kids in the class but for every kid in the class.\n  He taught--I used to say he taught at UNO--at the University of New \nOrleans, and kids would say their whole life was changed hearing him \nlecture. He lectured in the Senate, which changed many of our lives and \noutlooks.\n  He was an extraordinary man and left us way too soon. He left a \nnumber of works and disciples, if you will, of his work. He certainly \nwill live on, and we were blessed to know him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n[[Page S10550]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from \nAlaska, who is standing to be recognized, I have a major speech I wish \nto make. If the Senator has a few remarks, I will certainly defer to \nlet him go first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my intention to make some remarks \nas a cosponsor of the Ambrose resolution, not to exceed 10 or 12 \nminutes at the most.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe recognized upon the conclusion of the Senator's remarks, and I defer \nto the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy, and \nI thank Senator Landrieu for submitting this Ambrose resolution.\n  I thought Stephen Ambrose's book ``Undaunted Courage'' was one of the \nbest books I ever read in my life. A few years back, my secretary said \nStephen Ambrose wanted to come talk to me. Of course, being sort of a \nprovincial type, I got out my book and had it on my desk ready for him \nto autograph when he arrived.\n  We talked about his dream. He had a dream of a museum for World War \nII. He talked with me at length about that. As a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, he was openly seeking money from the \ntaxpayers of the United States for this museum. It was my privilege to \nconvince the Congress to aid him in that effort. It is in New Orleans, \nand I say to any American who wants to understand World War II, they \nshould go to New Orleans and see this marvelous museum.\n  It was my privilege to years later go through the museum with him the \nday before it opened. It is a fantastic living memorial to those others \nhave called our greatest generation.\n  I happen to be one of that generation, one significantly honored by \nthe fact I never suffered a scratch or had a crash or did anything I \ndid not really enjoy in World War II. Being a pilot was my dream, and I \nwas a pilot. We talked at length about that. As a matter of fact, \nStephen Ambrose and I talked about a book he was going to write. He did \nwrite about the squadron of which former Senator George McGovern was a \npart.\n  I am here today to try to tell the Senate about a person I learned to \nlove. He was not only a distinguished author, he was a man's man.\n\n  He came to Alaska probably three or four times in the last 5 or 6 \nyears to go fishing, and we have had time where we sat around and \ntalked. I tried to talk to him about smoking so many cigarettes, and \nunfortunately I think that is what caught up with him.\n  He really understood America. He told me of how he wrote that book \n``Undaunted Courage''; how he took his boys and went down the trail \nthat Lewis and Clark took. They camped out through the summertime \nseveral summers in a row. He told me how he had lived the history. I \nremember him telling me he felt that book.\n  He has now become the person who has been the chronicler of the \nEisenhower period of our history. I think he wrote nine different books \nabout Eisenhower's participation. He was called by President Eisenhower \nto be his official biographer. He told me personally about that and how \nhe had not expected that.\n  He has now completed his life, unfortunately early. He has left a \nmark for historians to envy because he was a popular historian. I \nchallenge anyone to read one of his books and not want to read the next \none written by Steve Ambrose. For instance, he wrote his own biography.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is one of the most interesting biographies a person \ncould read because he personally wrote it. It is sort of a roaming \nhistory about a man who enjoyed life.\n  His books about World War II, of course, will live in history. Of all \nof them, I enjoyed ``Band of Brothers'' more than any others because \nthat was made into the series I hope many in the Senate had an \nopportunity to see.\n  I have gotten copies of his books and given them to so many friends \nbecause they represent to me an understanding of the Eisenhower period. \nI truly believe those of us who served in World War II worshiped our \nPresident then, and he showed that worship when he wrote about \nEisenhower. He had the honor to go through all of the Eisenhower \npapers. He edited and issued five different volumes of the Eisenhower \npapers. If one wants to know the period of World War II and the time \nthat has followed in terms of people who reviewed the history of World \nWar II, they have to turn to one of Steve Ambrose's books, and think \nabout some of them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Associated Press' list of the 39 \nbooks that Steve Ambrose wrote in his lifetime appear following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2).\n  Mr. STEVENS. Think of these things he wrote about: ``Eisenhower and \nthe German POWs: Facts Against Falsehood''; ``Nixon: The Ruin and \nRecovery of a Politician''; ``Eisenhower: Soldier and President''; \n``Nixon: The Triumph of a Politician''; ``Nixon: The Education of a \nPolitician''; ``Pegasus Bridge''; ``Eisenhower: The President''; \n``Eisenhower: Soldier, General of the Army, President-Elect''; ``Milton \nEisenhower''; ``Ike's Spies: Eisenhower and the Espionage \nEstablishment''; ``Crazy Horse and Custer: The Parallel Lives of Two \nAmerican Warriors''; ``General Ike: Abilene to Berlin''; ``The Military \nin American Society''; ``The Supreme Commander: The War Years of \nGeneral Dwight D. Eisenhower''; and ``The Papers of Dwight D. \nEisenhower.''\n\n  He wrote on Eisenhower in Berlin. Before he even got to the \nEisenhower books he wrote ``Duty, Honor, Country: A History of West \nPoint.'' He also had a series of books about Lincoln, ``Halleck, \nLincoln's Chief of Staff,'' the one he personally gave me, his own \n``Wisconsin Boy in Dixie.''\n  For those of us who are in the Senate, I hope they have read one of \nthe last books he wrote, and that is ``The Wild Blue,'' which is really \nthe story of George McGovern and the B-24 squadron in World War II. I \nthink that reads better than any of the Ambrose books, particularly \nbecause those of us who knew George could understand him even more as a \nSenator once we realized what he went through as a bomber pilot.\n  I thank Ms. Landrieu for submitting this resolution because I think \nthe country should honor Stephen Ambrose. I know President Clinton \nhonored him in 1999 with the National Humanities Medal, but very \nclearly this man has left his mark on our country. Americans for \ncenturies to come will know more about the period in which some of us \nhave lived because Steve Ambrose dedicated his life to writing history.\n  I send my thoughts and my best to Moira, his wife, who traveled with \nhim at times to Alaska. I shall miss him. He was scheduled to come up \nagain this year and go fishing with me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that another item from Stephen Ambrose's \nhistory be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 3).\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator for yielding to me. I commend all of \nthe Ambrose books to anyone who wants to understand the period of World \nWar II. He was an author and a great personal friend.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       I was born in 1936 and grew up in Whitewater, Wisconsin, a \n     small town where my father was the M.D. My high school had \n     only 300 students but was good enough to offer two yeas of \n     Latin, which taught me the centrality of verbs--placement, \n     form, tense.\n       At the University of Wisconsin, I started as a pre-med, but \n     after a course on American history with William B. \n     Hesseltine, I switched my major. He was a great teacher of \n     writing, with firm rules such as abandon chronology at your \n     peril; use the active voice; avoid adverbs whenever possible; \n     be frugal with adjectives, as they are but the salt and \n     pepper for the meat (nouns).\n       On to L.S.U., where I studied for M.A. under T. Harry \n     Williams, another fine historian who stressed the importance \n     of writing well. After getting my M.A. degree in 1958, I \n     returned to Wisconsin to do my Ph.D. work under Hesseltine.\n\n[[Page S10551]]\n\n       Funny thing, Harry Williams was a much better writer than \n     Hesseltine, but Hesseltine was the better teacher of writing. \n     We graduate students once asked him: ``How can you demand so \n     much from us when your own books are not all that well \n     written,'' as we confronted him with a review of one of his \n     books that praised his research and historical understanding \n     but deplored his writing. Hesseltine laughed and replied, \n     ``My dear boys, You have a better teacher than I did.''\n       From 1960 to 1995 I was a full-time teacher (University of \n     New Orleans, Rutgers, Kansas State, Naval War College, U.C. \n     Berkeley, a number of European schools, among others), \n     something that has been invaluable to my writing. There is \n     nothing like standing before 50 students at 8 a.m. to start \n     talking about an event that occurred 100 years ago, because \n     the look on their faces is a chellenge--``let's see you keep \n     me awake.'' You learn what works and what doesn't in a hurry.\n       Teaching and writing are one to me-- in each case I am \n     telling a story. As I sit at my computer, or sand at the \n     podium, I think of myself as sitting around the campfire \n     after a day on the trail, telling stories that I hope will \n     have the members of the audience, or the readers, leaning \n     forward just a bit, wanting to know what happens next.\n       Some of the rules of writing I've developed on my own \n     include: never try to write about a battle until you have \n     walked the ground; when you write about politicians, keep in \n     mind that somebody has to do it; you are a story-teller, not \n     God, so your job is not to pass judgments but explain, \n     illustrate, inform and entertain.\n       The idea for a book comes in a variety of ways. I started \n     as a Civil War historian because Hesseltine taught the Civil \n     War. I wrote about Eisenhower because he asked me to become \n     his biographer, on the basis of a book I had done on Henry \n     Halleck, Lincoln's Chief of Staff. I never wanted to write \n     about Nixon but my editor (Alice Mayhew at Simon and \n     Schuster) made me do it by saying. ``Where else can you find \n     a greater challenge?'' I did Crazy Horse and Custer because I \n     took my family camping in the Black Hills of South Dakota and \n     got hooked on the country, and the topic brought me back to \n     the Black Hills many times. I did Meriwether Lewis to have an \n     excuse to keep returning to Montana, thus covering even more \n     of the American West.\n       My World War II books flowed out of the association with \n     Eisenhower, along with my feelings toward the GIs. I was ten \n     years old when the war ended. I thought the returning \n     veterans were giants who had saved the world from barbarism. \n     I still think so. I remain a hero worshiper. Over the decades \n     I've interviewed thousands of veterans. It is a privilege to \n     hear their stories, then write them up.\n       What drives me is curiosity. I want to know how this or \n     that was done--Lewis and Clark getting to the Pacific; the \n     GIs on D-Day; Crazy Horse's Victory over George Custer at the \n     Little Big Horn; the making of an elite company in the 101st \n     Airborne, and so on. And I've found that if I want to know, \n     I've got to do the research and then write it up myself. For \n     me, the act of writing is the act of learning.\n       I'm blessing to have Moira Buckley Ambrose as my wife. She \n     was an English Lit major and school teacher; she is an avid \n     reader; she has a great ear. At the end of each writing day, \n     she sits with me and I read aloud what I've done. After more \n     than three decades of this, I still can't dispense with \n     requiring her first of all to say, ``That's good, that's \n     great, way to go.'' But then we get to work. We make the \n     changes. This reading aloud business is critical to me--I've \n     developed an ear of my own, so I can hear myself read--as it \n     reveals awkward passages better than anything else. If I \n     can't read it smoothly, it needs fixing.\n       Hesseltine used to tell his students that the act of \n     writing is the art of applying the seat of the pants to the \n     seat of a chair. It is a monk's existence, the loneliest job \n     in the world. As Moira and I have five kids (at one time all \n     teens together; the phone in the evening can be imagined) I \n     started going to bed at eight to get up at four and have \n     three quiet hours for writing before the teaching day began. \n     The kids grew up and moved out and I retired in May, 1995, \n     but I keep to the habit.\n       I'm sometimes asked which of my books is my own favorite. \n     My answer is, whatever one I'm working on. Right now (Winter \n     1999) a book on World War II in the Pacific as well as a book \n     on the 15th Air Force and the B-24 Liberators they flew. I \n     think the greatest achievement of the American Republic in \n     the 18th Century was the army at Valley Forge; in the 19th \n     Century it was the Army of the Potomac; in the 20th Century, \n     it was the U.S. military in WWII. I want to know how we beat \n     the Japanese in the Pacific and how our airforce helped us \n     beat the Germans. To do a book of this scope is daunting but \n     rewarding. I get paid for interviewing the old soldiers and \n     reading their private memoirs. My job is to pick out the best \n     one of every fifty or so stories and pass it along to \n     readers, along with commentary on what it illustrates and \n     teaches. It is a wonderful way to make a living.\n       My experiences with the military have been as an observer. \n     The only time I wore a uniform was in naval ROTC as a \n     freshman at the University of Wisconsin, and in army ROTC as \n     a sophomore. I was in second grade when the United States \n     entered World War II, in sixth grade when the war ended. When \n     I graduated from high school, in 1953, I expected to go into \n     the army, but within a month the Korean War ended and I went \n     to college instead. Upon graduation in 1957, I went straight \n     to graduate school. By the time America was again at war, in \n     1964, I was twenty-eight years old and the father of five \n     children. So I never served.\n       But I have admired and respected the men who did fight \n     since my childhood. When I was in grade school World War II \n     dominated my life. My father was a navy doctor in the \n     Pacific. My mother worked in a pea cannery beside German POWs \n     (Afrika Korps troops captured in Tunisia in May 1943). Along \n     with my brothers--Harry, two years older, and Bill, two Years \n     younger--I went to the movies three times a week (ten cents \n     six nights a week, twenty-five cents on Saturday night), not \n     to see the films, which were generally Clinkers, but to see \n     the newsreels which were almost exclusively about the \n     fighting in North Africa, Europe, and the Pacific. We played \n     at war constantly. ``Japs'' vs. Marines, GIs vs. ``Krauts''.\n       In high school I got hooked on Napoleon. I read various \n     biographies and studied his campaigns. As a seventeen-year-\n     old freshman in naval ROTC, I took a course on naval history, \n     starting with the Greeks and ending with World War II (in one \n     semester!). My instructor had been a submarine skipper in the \n     Pacific and we all worshipped him. More important, he was a \n     gifted teacher who loved the navy and history. Although I was \n     a premed student with plans to take up my father's practice \n     in Whitewater, Wisconsin, I found the history course to be \n     far more interesting than chemistry of physics. But in the \n     second semester of naval ROTC, the required course was \n     gunnery. Although I was an avid hunter and thoroughly \n     familiar with shotguns and rifles, the workings of the five \n     inch cannon baffled me. So in my sophomore year I switched to \n     army ROTC.\n       Also that year, I took a course entitled ``Representative \n     Americans'' taught by Professor William B. Hesseltine. In his \n     first lecture he announced that in this course we would not \n     be writing term papers that summarized the conclusions of \n     three or four books; instead we would be doing original \n     research on nineteenth-century Wisconsin politicians, \n     professional and business leaders, for the purpose of putting \n     together a dictionary of Wisconsin biography that would be \n     deposited in the state historical society. We would, \n     Hesseltine told us, be contributing to the world's knowledge.\n       The words caught me up. I had never imagined I could do \n     such things as contribute to the world's knowledge. Forty-\n     five years later, the phrase continues to resonate with me. \n     It changed my life. At the conclusion of the lecture--on \n     General Washington--I went up to him and asked how I could do \n     what he did for a living. He laughed and said to stick \n     around, he would show me. I went straight to the registrar's \n     office and changed my major from premed to history.

Ambrose, the military historian and biographer \n     whose books recounting the combat feats of American soldiers \n     and airmen fueled a national fascination with the generation \n     that fought World War II, died yesterday at a hospital in Bay \n     St. Louis, Miss. Mr. Ambrose, who lived in Bay St. Louis and \n     Helena, Mont., was 66.\n       The cause was lung cancer, which was diagnosed last April, \n     his son Barry said. ``Until I was 60 years old, I lived on a \n     professor's salary and I wrote books,'' Mr. Ambrose recalled \n     in November 1999. ``We did all right. We even managed to buy \n     some mutual funds for our grandchildren. I never in this \n     world expected what happened.''\n       Mr. Ambrose, known previously for multivolume biographies \n     of Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard M. Nixon, emerged as a \n     best-selling author during the past decade. He was also an \n     adviser for films depicting heroic exploits, a highly paid \n     lecturer and an organizer of tours to historic sites.\n       His ascension to wealth and fame began with his book ``D-\n     Day, June 6, 1944: The Climatic Battle of World War II,'' \n     marking the 50th anniversary of the Normandy invasion. \n     Drawing upon combat veterans' remembrances collected by the \n     Eisenhower Center in New Orleans, which Mr. Ambrose founded, \n     it became a best seller.\n       ``The descriptions of individual ordeals on the bloody \n     beach of Omaha make this book outstanding,'' Raleigh \n     Trevelyan wrote in The New York Times Book Review.\n       Soon Mr. Ambrose was producing at least a book a year and \n     becoming a star at Simon & Schuster, which published all his \n     best-known books.\n       But earlier this year Mr. Ambrose was accused of ethical \n     lapses for having employed some narrative passages in his \n     books that closely paralleled previously published accounts. \n     The criticism came at a time of heightened scrutiny of \n     scholarly integrity. The Pulitzer Prize-winning historian \n     Doris Kearns Goodwin acknowledged in January 2002 that her \n     published, Simon & Schuster, paid another author in 1987 to \n     settle plagiarism accusations concerning her book ``The \n     Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys.'' In August 2001, the historian \n     Joseph J. Ellis, also a Pulitzer Prize winner, was suspended \n     for one year from his teaching duties at Mount Holyoke \n     College for falsely telling his students and others that he \n     had served with the military in Vietnam.\n       Mr. Ambrose said that his copying from other writers' works \n     represented only a few pages among the thousands he had \n     written and that he had identified the sources by \n     providing footnotes. He did concede that he should have \n     placed quotation marks around such material and said he \n     would do so in future editions. He denied engaging in \n     plagiarism and suggested that jealousy among academic \n     historians played a part in the criticism.\n       ``Any book with more than five readers is automatically \n     popularized and to be scorned,'' Mr. Ambrose said in an \n     interview with The Los Angeles Times in April 2002. ``I did \n     my graduate work like anybody else, and I kind of had that \n     attitude myself. The problem with my colleagues is they never \n     grew out of it.''\n       Two years after his D-Day book was published, Mr. Ambrose \n     had another best seller, ``Undaunted Courage,'' the story of \n     Lewis and Clark's exploration of the West. He reported having \n     earned more than $4 million from it.\n       In 1997, his ``Citizen Soldiers'' chronicled combat from D-\n     Day to Germany's surrender. In 1998, Mr. Ambrose wrote ``The \n     Victors,'' a history of the war in Europe that drew on his \n     earlier books. In 1999, be brought out ``Comrades: Brothers, \n     Fathers, Heroes, Sons, Pals,'' an account of his own family \n     relationships and those of historical figures. In 2000, he \n     recounted the building of the transcontinental railroad in \n     ``Nothing Like It in the World.'' In 2001, he had ``The Wild \n     Blue,'' the story of B-24 bomber crewmen in World War II's \n     European theater.\n       Mr. Ambrose's most recent book was ``The Mississippi and \n     the Making of a Nation,'' with Douglas G. Brinkley and the \n     photographer Sam Abell, published this fall by National \n     Geographic. After learning he had cancer, Mr. Ambrose wrote \n     ``To America: Personal Reflections of an Historian,'' which \n     is to be published by Simon & Schuster later this year.\n       Mr. Ambrose was also a commentator for the Ken Burns \n     documentary ``Lewis & Clark: The Journey of the Corps of \n     Discovery,'' broadcast on PBS in 1997. He served as \n     consultant for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' the 1998 movie \n     acclaimed for its searing depiction of combat on D-Day. His \n     book ``Band of Brothers,'' the account of an American \n     paratrooper company in World War II, published in 1992, was \n     the basis for an HBO mini-series in 2001.\n       He founded the National D-Day Museum in 2000 in New Orleans \n     and was president of Stephen Ambrose Historical Tours.\n       In August 2001, The Wall Street Journal estimated that the \n     Ambrose family company was bringing in $3 million in revenue \n     annually. It said that Mr. Ambrose reported having donated \n     about $5 million over the previous five years to causes \n     including the Eisenhower Center and the National D-Day \n     Museum.\n       Stephen Edward Ambrose was born on Jan. 10, 1936, in \n     Decatur, Ill., and grew up in Whitewater, Wis., the son of a \n     physician who served in the Navy during World War II. As a \n     youngster, he was enthralled by combat newsreels.\n       He was a pre-med student at the University of Wisconsin in \n     the mid-1950's but was inspired by one of his professors, \n     William B. Heseltine, to become a historian.\n       ``He was a hero worshiper, and he got us to worship with \n     him,'' Mr. Ambrose told The Baton Rouge Sunday Advocate many \n     years later. ``Oh, if you could hear him talk about George \n     Washington.''\n       After obtaining his bachelor's degree from Wisconsin, Mr. \n     Ambrose earned a master's degree in history at Louisiana \n     State and a doctorate in history from Wisconsin. He went on \n     to interview numerous combat veterans, but the only time he \n     wore a military uniform was in Navy and Army R.O.T.C. at \n     Wisconsin.\n       In 1964, Eisenhower, having admired Mr. Ambrose's biography \n     of Gen. Henry Halleck, Lincoln's chief of staff, asked him to \n     help edit his official papers. That led to Mr. Ambrose's two-\n     volume biography of Eisenhower.\n       The first volume, ``Eisenhower: Soldier, General of the \n     Army, President-Elect, 1890-1952'' (Simon & Schuster, 1983), \n     was described by Drew Middleton in the New York Times Book \n     Review as ``the most complete and objective work yet on the \n     general who became president.''\n       Mr. Ambrose also wrote a three-volume biography of Richard \n     M. Nixon, published in the late 1980's and early 90's.\n       He wrote or edited some 35 books and said that he often \n     arose at 4 in the morning and concluded his day's writing by \n     reading aloud for a critique from his wife, Moira, a former \n     high school teacher. His son Hugh, who was also his agent, \n     and other family members helped with his research in recent \n     years.\n       When he was confronted with instances of having copied from \n     others--``The Wild Blue'' had passages that closely resembled \n     material in several other books--a question arose as to \n     whether he was too prolific.\n       ``Nobody can write as many books as he has--many of them \n     were well-written books--without the sloppiness that comes \n     with speed and the constant pressure to produce,'' said Eric \n     Foner, a history professor at Columbia University. ``It is \n     the unfortunate downside of doing too much too fast.''\n       David Rosenthal, the publisher of Simon & Schuster, said of \n     Mr. Ambrose's pace, ``We welcome that he is prolific.'' He \n     added, ``He works at a schedule that he sets, and we \n     encourage the amount of his output because there is a \n     readership that wants it.''\n       George McGovern, the former senator, whose experiences as a \n     bomber pilot were recounted in ``The Wild Blue,'' said \n     yesterday, ``He probably reached more readers than any other \n     historian in our national history.''\n       Mr. Ambrose retired from college teaching in 1995, having \n     spent most of his career at the University of New Orleans. He \n     received the National Humanities Medal in 1998.\n       In addition to his wife and his sons Barry, of Moiese, \n     Mont., and Hugh, of New Orleans, he is survived by another \n     son, Andy, of New Orleans; two daughters, Grace Ambrose of \n     Wappingers Falls, N.Y., and Stephenie Tubbs of Helena; five \n     grandchildren; and two brothers, Harry, of Virginia, and \n     William, of Maine.\n       In reflecting on his writing and on his life, Mr. Ambrose \n     customarily paid tribute to the American soldiers of World \n     War II, the object of his admiration for so long.\n       ``I was 10 years old when the war ended,'' he said. ``I \n     thought the returning veterans were giants who had saved the \n     world from barbarism. I still think so. I remain a hero \n     worshiper.''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, before the No. 2 Democrat \nretires from the Chamber, I want to congratulate him. He is a tireless \nworker. He is the consummate consensus builder. He is someone who in \nthe midst of chaos and fracas calms the waters with the soothing balm \nthat gets reasonable people to suddenly understand they can come \ntogether.\n  This agreement on the budget resolution, which contains the \nenforcement provisions of the Budget Act, is another testimony to his \nskill in negotiating, as he does so ably, with the Chairman and the \nranking Members. So I am delighted. It is fitting this agreement on a \nbudget enforcement provision has been agreed to, because of the \ncondition of our economy.\n\n  The stock market today has gone down another 220 points. Stocks \nstumbled, slamming the brakes on any kind of rally we might have \nthought was occurring over the last few days. Sales outlook was weak, \nthere were disappointing earnings, and it has brought profit jitters \nback into the market.\n  Is it any wonder investors, large investors such as pension funds or \nsmall investors such as the Presiding Officer and myself, with our own \nlittle hard-earned savings that we invest in the stock market, all \nacross this land, indeed, have jitters because of the uncertainty of \nthe economy? As a matter of fact, in the last 2 years, stock market \nwealth has been down 35 percent for a $5.7 trillion loss in that 2 \nyears.\n  If anyone doubts this, in January of 2001, all the stock markets had \na combined asset value of $16.4 trillion. In September of 2002, that \nvalue went down to $10.7 trillion, a loss of $5.7 trillion. Is it any \nwonder that reduction in stock market value, which is huge--35 percent \nin a year and two-thirds--is a reflection of the feeling of uncertainty \npeople have toward the economy, a slumping economy?\n  It is one thing that certainly 2 million jobs have been lost since \nJanuary of 2001. In January of 2001, private sector jobs were at 111 \nmillion. In September of 2002, a year and two-thirds later, private \nsector jobs were down to 109.6 million jobs--2 million jobs lost, \nanother indicator of the slumping economy.\n  It is not as if we did not have a warning. Early last year it became \nclear our economy was slowing down. During our Budget Committee \nhearings on the topic, almost every economic analyst said responsible \ntax cuts could help solve the problem. They said the best way to \nstabilize the economy was to get money into the hands of the people who \nwould spend it, those with low-to-moderate incomes. Above all else, we \nwere told that whatever we did, we should not pass any tax package that \nwould cause long-term fiscal harm.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, we tried to heed those warnings. Last \nyear, I supported a tax cut to provide immediate tax relief for all \nfamilies. That tax cut would have made sure every taxpayer, including \nthose who pay only payroll taxes--there are a vast number of Americans \nwho do not pay income tax because they do not have enough income--that \nmonthly payroll tax is deducted from their pay. The tax cut would have \nmade sure that every taxpayer would also get a tax cut.\n  It would have also reduced the 15-percent income tax rate paid by all \nincome-tax payers. It would have reduced that to 10 percent and to a \npermanent reduction. It would have been fair. It would have been \nfiscally responsible, and it would have been economically stimulative. \nBut the final version of last year's tax cut was enacted by this \nChamber. This Senator did not vote for it, and I did not vote for it \nbecause it did not meet the criteria that the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds would not be touched now or in the future.\n  I remember when I was sworn in as a freshman to the Senate, the talk \nwas so uplifting and upbeat about how we had a surplus that was \nprojected for 10 years and that we were not going to have to invade the \nSocial Security trust fund to pay bills; indeed, that we were going to \nfence it off. We promised that. We were going to fence off the Social \nSecurity trust fund so that by it remaining untouched, its surpluses \nover the next decade would have paid down most of the national debt, a \ndebt that averages out in the range of about $200 billion to $250 \nbillion a year we pay in interest on the national debt. Just think what \nthat savings on interest payments could provide if we had followed \nthrough on the promises and paid down that national debt, what that \nwould have meant to the economy as another indicator that we were \ngetting our fiscal house in order.\n\n  The final version of last year's tax cut did not meet that criteria \nof walling off Social Security trust funds.\n\n[[Page S10554]]\n\nBecause of the fiscally irresponsible way the bill was drafted, with \ngimmicks such as changing the beginning and ending dates of key tax \nprovisions, because of those gimmicks the bill amounted to flawed \npublic policy that would, in fact, cost our country much more than the \n$1.35 trillion at which that tax bill was advertised. The true cost of \nthat tax bill which advertised at $1.35 trillion, and allowed by the \nbudget resolution, over a 10-year period is closer to $2 trillion \ninstead of $1.35 trillion. Now we know. The administration-supported \ntax cut plan that we passed last year has a cost that explodes to $250 \nbillion in deficit in the year 2011 alone.\n  Now, after going from record surpluses to real deficits, we are \nseeing just how bad that decision was last year. Now we are \nexperiencing the worse market decline since the 1930s, as evidenced by \nthe slumping stock market and again the 220-point loss today in the Dow \nJones Industrial Average.\n  The Standard & Poors 500 stock index has lost nearly half of its \nvalue. In the last 2 years, Americans have seen the markets lose $5.7 \ntrillion in value. That amounts to $9.5 billion a day in losses in \nvalue on the stock market.\n  Homeowners now are having such a hard time paying bills. Home \nforeclosure rates have reached the highest rate in 30 years. That is \nanother indicator. The poverty rate has reached an increased mark for \nthe first time in 8 years and 1.3 million more Americans are now \nfalling into poverty. Median household incomes have fallen for the \nfirst time in a decade.\n\n  Another indicator is consumer confidence. Consumer confidence and \nconsumer spending have both fallen. Retail sales just took their worst \ndrop since November of last year, and consumer sentiment has dropped to \nlevels last seen in the fall almost a decade ago, 1993.\n  Look at another indicator. The number of Americans without health \ninsurance rose by almost 1.5 million, to 41.2 million. In a nation of \nplenty, in a nation where we pride ourselves on the best health care in \nthe world, there are 41 million people who do not have health \ninsurance. Not only are the low and middle-income class families losing \nincome, but because of the escalating price of health care premiums and \nprescription drug costs, they are now also losing their health \ninsurance.\n  I thank the previous Presiding Officer, my colleague from Minnesota, \nfor his personal interest. He is a soul brother in what I am saying, \nand I appreciate it so much. In my immediate past government job before \nhaving the privilege of coming to the Senate, I was the elected \ninsurance commissioner of Florida. I can see the trends of the rising \nhealth insurance premiums. There are a lot of factors on that. But I \nwill tell you, the economy is one big factor. Where it crunches the \nlittle guy, where it crunches those in the middle-income and lower \nlevels of income who do not have the beneficence of having the \nGovernment provide their health care through the Medicaid Program, \nwhere it crunches the little guy is in declining incomes in a slumping \neconomy at the same time of rising health insurance premiums; it gets \nto the point they cannot afford it. That includes the rising cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  Interestingly, we can get 52 votes in this Senate, a majority--plus \n2--to modernize Medicare with a prescription drug benefit--but we can't \nget the 60 votes required to cut off the filibuster.\n  Because of the slumping economy, Americans are faced with growing \nuncertainty over job security. With corporate scandals, a slumping \nstock market, a growing national debt and various forms of economic \nturbulence related to September 11, it is no surprise that unemployment \nis rising at a staggering rate. We have recently seen an increase in \nthe number of 60 to 70-year-olds in the workforce. They are trying to \nmake ends meet.\n  In the last 2 years, unemployment has jumped by 1.5 percent. More \nthan 2 million people, as I said earlier, have lost jobs in the last \nyear and two quarters, and many who have lost their jobs are having \ntrouble finding new work.\n  In my Orlando office we have a bright college intern. This is a \ncollege graduate from one of our State universities who cannot get a \njob. While this college graduate is biding his time, he has very \ngraciously come to offer his services as an intern in one of our \nFlorida offices.\n  Many who have lost their jobs, clearly are having trouble finding new \nwork. A million and a half people have been unemployed for over 6 \nmonths. Now they are also losing their unemployment insurance.\n  Last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in the \nprevious month, manufacturing lost 68,000 jobs; retail businesses lost \n55,000 jobs. Last month, over 8 million Americans were unemployed; over \n2 million more, as we said, above January of 2001 figures. Two million \nfewer people are working to support their families and contribute to \nthe economy. They are gone--two million taxpayers, two million people \nforced to find other work because they lost their jobs.\n\n  In a slumping economy, it is no easy task to find new employment, as \nthat college graduate has found. People are now spending over 17 weeks \nunemployed compared to an average of 12 weeks a year and a half ago.\n  The unemployment rate is rising--5.6 percent last month compared to \n3.8 percent back in January of 2001, when the three Senators I see on \nthe floor were sworn in. It is a little over a year and a half ago. The \neconomy is failing, and we are arguing about the merits of extending \nunemployment compensation for American families. That is what some of \nthe argument concerns. But instead of focusing on how to get the \neconomy going again, this administration is proposing new tax cuts for \nthe wealthy and extending those for the wealthy that were passed last \nyear.\n  New tax cuts in the year 2011 will have no immediate effect on our \neconomy. In fact, adding an additional $4 trillion in debt during the \nnext decade will only hurt our economy in the short term by pushing up \ninterest rates. What we ought to focus on is the slumping economy now \nand how to correct it.\n  Right now, most Americans are distracted with thinking about the war \nin Iraq and thinking about a war that is ongoing against terrorism. \nThese are life-and-death matters. These are the gravest concerns of the \nNation and should have our utmost attention, as it has had over the \nlast couple of months. But we also must pay attention to our bottom \nline and to the economic security and the fundamental financial \nstrength of America.\n  To have military strength we need an undergirding of moral, and \neconomic strength. With projected huge deficits projected all over the \nrest of this decade, can we really afford to dig an even deeper hole in \nthe next decade right at the time when the baby boomers are going to \nstart retiring and demanding more in terms of retirement and Social \nSecurity and Medicare?\n  Last year's administration spending and tax cut plan has resulted in \ntoday's collision course of more deficits, more debt, more economic \ninsecurity, higher interest rates, lower economic growth, and lower \nemployment. There is no way to sugar-coat that. You may as well say it \nlike it is. To anybody who says, ``Oh, why didn't you support the tax \ncuts,'' I say I did. I supported a tax cut up to $1.2 trillion over a \ndecade. But what we said at that time was that is a responsible, \nbalanced approach. A $2 trillion tax cut, particularly skewed to the \nlatter end of the decade, is not a responsible way to rejuvenate our \neconomy.\n  All of this is occurring right under our noses. Yet it doesn't seem \nas if there are a lot of folks in this Chamber, nor down there on \nPennsylvania Avenue, who are paying much attention.\n  I appreciate this ongoing dialog that we have had, but there seems to \nbe a war coming in the Middle East. So we better be paying attention to \nother battles. We must do something to reinvigorate our economy. We \nmust pay attention to our Government's bottom line. We must not \ncontinue to raise the debt for our grandchildren.\n  One of the things we can do in a slumping economy is get with the \nappropriate kind of tax cuts, and we can stimulate the economy by \ngetting dollars into the pockets of people so they can go out and spend \nit. That could start rejuvenating the economy. We have a Christmas \nseason coming up. It is going to be critical for retailers. We can do \nthat with a responsible tax cut.\n\n[[Page S10555]]\n\n  We could also do that by extending unemployment benefits. The \nunemployment insurance system was designed to provide aid when it is \nneeded most. When the economy is healthy, unemployment insurance \nrevenue rises because taxes are being paid. Program spending falls \nbecause there are fewer unemployed.\n  Conversely, in a recession, unemployment insurance revenues fall \nwhile spending rises, helping to stimulate the economy.\n  But the problem now is that American families in this economic \ndecline which has existed over many months are exhausting their \nbenefits, and they need our support. The unemployment insurance program \nwas designed exactly for the situation we are in today. This is the \nrainy day for which unemployment insurance saves. If we would extend \nthose benefits from the required number of weeks that are under law \nnow, it would amount to an economic stimulus in the most direct way, \nallowing families to continue functioning while they search for jobs in \nthis poor economy.\n  In the 1980s, when I had the privilege of being at the other end of \nthe Capitol in the House of Representatives, Democrats and Republicans \ncame together to agree to extend unemployment insurance--three times. \nThat is what we need to do today for some economic stimulus.\n  What we need to do is provide immediate fiscal relief for States. We \nheard the Senator from West Virginia talking about the plight of the \nStates. They have this huge additional drain on these Medicaid funds. \nStates have diminished revenues. States need some assistance from the \nFederal Government on Medicaid, which is health care for the poor. \nRight now States are facing severe budget shortfalls, and many of them \nare finding themselves forced to cut bedrock services such as \neducation, health care, and transportation. So the States need \nassistance with these and other crucial programs.\n  What we need to do is to provide a strong bill to protect pensions. \nWe have heard these heartrending stories about the people of the Enron \nCorporation and other corporations such as WorldCom. They have been \nsaving and playing by the rules. They have been working hard and \nsaving. Where have they been saving? They were saving in their \ncorporate pension plan. They had a retirement system.\n  We had several Floridians come up here because Enron had many \nemployees of the Florida Gas Company in the Orlando area with \nheadquarters in Winter Park. We had a number of those employees come up \nhere and tell how they had their entire life savings, and now--instead \nof having their nest egg of about $750,000--because of the scandals in \nthat Enron Corporation, and because those pensioners were not \nprotected, they had less than $20,000 of retirement left out of \n$750,000.\n  We need a plan that allows workers to hold employers accountable and \nhelp workers get their money back. If people responsible for protecting \ntheir investments abuse that trust, as we have seen over and over again \nin the scandals that erupted last fall and that were played out in \nfront of the committees of this Senate--we need to make it easier for \nworkers to sell their company stock in those pension plans and \ndiversify their holdings.\n  Most importantly, what we need to do is have a serious debate about \nhow best to get our economy moving again. We need to think outside the \nbox and look at some fresh ideas such as those presented at last week's \nbipartisan economic forum.\n  What we need to do is get this economy moving again. That is what we \nneed to do. What we need to do is focus on the needs of constituents \nwho elected us to serve here in this Chamber and to make decisions for \nthem, and to protect them in these many ways that I have tried to \nenumerate in these remarks. What we need to do is focus our attention \nand our resources on the American working family members.\n  It is a time of partisan politics. We are just before an election. I \nguess my only disappointment in Washington in a job that I dearly \nlove--I love the work. I love the people, I love these Senators, and \nthey know I do. It is with a spring in my step that I come to work \nevery day. My only disappointment is that this place gets too \nexcessively partisan, and it gets too excessively ideologically rigid \nand extreme.\n  So when the time comes, as the Good Book says, ``Come, let us reason \ntogether,'' there is a poisoned atmosphere and there is a rigidity and \nextremism so that it is hard to reach out and bring people together.\n  In a slumping economy, you have to be able to reach out and bring \npeople together. You have to be able to have Senators not insist that \nit is their way or the highway, but yet they have to recognize there \nare many people in this vast, broad, beautiful, complicated, and very \ndiverse country who need to be represented instead of just that \nparticular Senator's point of view. That is why our title is United \nStates Senator--to represent the entire country and to represent all \nthe people.\n  I hope as we wind down in the closing days of this session, as we \naddress some of these major economic problems, that we will consider it \nin the spirit of building a consensus to solve these problems.\n  Thank you, Madam President, for the privilege of addressing the \nSenate.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I certainly yield to a good friend, my \ncolleague, my wonderful companion as a freshman, the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Senator from Florida.\n  I want to be sure I heard the Senator correctly.\n  First, I heard the Senator say earlier that the stock market dropped \nby 35 percent from January of 2001 to the present time. Is that \ncorrect? I was doing some mathematics here. Someone had holdings of \n$50,000 in January of 2001, and those holdings are now worth only \n$32,500; $17,500 of that would be lost.\n  Does the Senate recall the tax package which I opposed as being \nskewed unfairly to the rich and giving a few hundred dollars in rebates \nto the average taxpayer? I was thinking to myself: Whatever that amount \nis, to lose $17,500 out of a $50,000 retirement savings in a 401(k) or \nan IRA, it seems to me, is a pretty bad economic deal for most \nAmericans.\n  Does the Senator concur or is my math that bad?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator is absolutely right. And if you \njust put it in round terms of someone with a nest egg of $100,000 a \nyear and two-thirds ago, in January of 2001, that is only worth $65,000 \ntoday. They have lost $35,000 of value in their retirement portfolio, \nmirroring the stock market wealth, the total stock market wealth down \n35 percent between January of 2001 and September of 2002. It is a sad \ncommentary.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I appreciate the Senator going back to that point in time \nwhen the two of us and the Presiding Officer were sworn in here. I \nrecall, for myself, the excitement I felt back then of the \nopportunities we had because the surpluses projected for the next \ndecade, at that time, were $5.4 trillion.\n  I wonder if the Senator recalls, as I can, the anticipation of all \nthe good things we could do on behalf of the people of Minnesota, \nFlorida, and the rest of the country.\n  In my campaign, I made a promise of prescription drug coverage for \nevery senior in Minnesota and sent busloads of seniors at the time up \nto Canada where they could get prescription drugs for half or less than \nhalf the cost of those same drugs in the United States.\n  I recall saying back then the solution was not to bus every senior \nfrom Minnesota to Canada--and I think that would have been more \nproblematic to travel from Florida to Canada--but the solution was to \nprovide the kind of coverage here from our Government that the Canadian \nGovernment provides.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Florida recalls other instances of the \nkinds of hopes and dreams we shared back then as a freshmen group of \nSenators as to what we could do for this country, and if you can think, \nas I can, back to the days when we were talking about surpluses for 10 \nyears rather than deficits.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. We had hopes and dreams. Indeed, we had \nrealistic plans, if we had been conservative in our approach, if we had \nbeen balanced in our approach with that projected surplus.\n  First of all, we said: Those economic projections for a surplus are \nway too\n\n[[Page S10556]]\n\nrosy. Let's be conservative in our planning. Let's scale back that \nprojected surplus so we can be conservative in what we plan for the \nsurplus.\n  Then we said: Let's be balanced. Let's have a substantial tax cut \nthat would be about a third of the surplus, and let's take another \nthird of the surplus and reserve that third, over the next decade, for \nthe spending increases that need to occur, such as the Senator talked \nabout, which is modernizing Medicare with a prescription drug benefit.\n  We knew, for example, defense expenditures were going to go up and, \ntherefore, there needed to be some spending increases there, and you \ncould go on down a host of other items.\n  Clearly, education was one of the major ones. We wanted to take a \ngood part of that surplus, projected over 10 years, and invest that in \neducation back to the States and local governments that run the \neducational systems.\n  Then what we said was, to balance it out, the remaining third of that \nsurplus we did not want to do anything with. We wanted that to be the \nsurplus from the Social Security trust fund that was not going to be \ntouched. That part of the surplus was going to pay down the national \ndebt over the next 10 years.\n\n  That balanced approach of a third, a third, and a third was going to \nget our fiscal house in order, was going to revive the confidence of \nthe American investor in American companies because the economy was \ngoing to be stable. We were not going to have all these dire economic \nfacts we have recited tonight that would not have occurred if we had \nbeen balanced in our approach.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I am glad the Senator brought up the balanced approach \nand, earlier, the Social Security surpluses. Of course, the Senator \nfrom Florida has a great many senior citizens in his State, and I have \na quite a number in mine. I would have even more if not so many of them \nwould move to Florida and enjoy your better climate.\n  But as I recall, President Clinton, when he departed office, had left \nnot only a balanced budget for the first time in this country in almost \n30 years, but he had actually balanced the non-Social Security part of \nthe budget. So as the Senator said, the surpluses were accumulating in \nthe Social Security trust fund year by year that would pay down, I \nbelieve it was, over $3 trillion of debt that would put our fiscal \nhouse in order, that would be ready for the baby boom retirement years.\n  What happened to all of that financial responsibility in such a short \ntime? Does the Senator recall? Where did all that money go?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Two-thirds of that projected surplus vanished \nprimarily because of the overeager, rosy, incorrect economic \nprojections of a budget surplus, plus absorbing so much more of the \nexisting surplus from a tax cut that exceeded that balanced approach I \ntalked about.\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator brought up earlier today, along with the \nSenator from West Virginia, this terrible dilemma we face in the \nSenate, that we cannot get a conference agreement with the House on \nconcurrent receipt for our veterans, for those who have served this \ncountry, for those who have suffered injuries, disabilities, and the \nlike.\n  I believe the Senator was referring--maybe he could refresh my \nmemory--to the conference committee gathering this afternoon; we both \nserve on the Armed Services Committee. I could not attend, but the \nSenator, as I understood correctly, said the House conferees did not \neven attend the gathering.\n  They did pass in the House by over 400 votes support for the Senate \nposition. But the White House, if I recall correctly, has now said the \nPresident will veto the Defense authorization bill because it includes \nconcurrent receipt because it costs too much money.\n  Back when this $2 trillion tax cut was being discussed, this Senator \ndoes not recall any real concern being expressed that we could not \nafford it, and I hear now, over and over again, we cannot do \nprescription drug coverage. We cannot even do Medicare reimbursement \nequalization. We cannot do concurrent receipt for our veterans. We \ncannot afford to do anything for benefits for people, such as extending \nunemployment benefits, as the Senator pointed out, because we don't \nhave the money. But back when it was tax cuts for the wealthy, we \nseemed to have all the money we needed.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator is correct. It is a sad commentary \nall these things that were promised to veterans--that everybody was so \neager, elbowing one another aside to try to get to the front of the \nline to support--through such things as concurrent receipt, eager to \nget to the front of the line to support a prescription drug benefit for \nMedicare seniors--have all been cast aside. Yet I cannot believe what I \nam seeing on the television when I go home. I see all these TV \nadvertisements about how all these people who have blocked a \nprescription drug benefit to modernize Medicare say they have voted for \none. Well, they voted for one. They voted for a version that was a \nsubsidy from the Federal Government to insurance companies supposedly \nto provide prescription drug benefits. But in every State where a \nsimilar law has been passed to get insurance companies to provide a \nprescription drug benefit, the insurance companies will not do it \nbecause they cannot make money on it and, therefore, the senior \ncitizens are the ones who suffer because they do not get the \nprescription drug benefit.\n  So isn't it interesting they always want to run to the front of the \nline and talk about how they are for all of these things, but when it \ncomes to doing it, where are the votes, particularly in a body such as \nthe Senate, in which in order to pass anything you have to get 60 of \n100 Senators because of our rules to cut off debate?\n  Mr. DAYTON. If I may indulge the Senator for just another minute, the \nSenator from Florida, being a former insurance commissioner and having \nsuch a large senior population, I wonder if he could explain the point \nhe just made about how the insurance companies themselves don't want to \nprovide the kind of coverage that some of our colleagues claim would be \nthe solution to this problem.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Since our colleague from Nevada has joined us, \nI will use his State as an example. About 4 years ago, the State of \nNevada passed a prescription drug benefit that was very similar to the \none that has been sponsored by the White House and that, in fact, has \npassed the House of Representatives. It is a subsidy to insurance \ncompanies to provide a prescription drug benefit.\n  In the case of the bill here, it is a Federal subsidy. In the case of \nNevada, it was a State subsidy. But the fact is, not one insurance \ncompany stepped forward in Nevada, after the passage of that law, to \noffer a prescription drug benefit because the insurance companies want \nto make money. They realized they could not make money.\n  Sure, we are having a problem with escalating costs of prescription \ndrugs, and we should deal with that, too. The question is, Are we going \nto fulfill our promise to provide a legitimate and workable \nprescription drug benefit to senior citizens on Medicare? We have \noffered that, and we have only gotten 52 votes here. We have to get 60 \nto cut off debate. We need eight more Senators, and then that thing \nwill pass and pass overwhelmingly.\n  But you see what is being blocked right now. And then people back \nhome claim credit for voting for a version that really is not going to \nbe a workable version, as experienced in the laboratories that we see \nout in our States.\n  Mr. DAYTON. The people who watch us debate must wonder about the \nmathematics of the Congress. The Senator from Nevada, who is a champion \nof the concurrent receipts legislation, sees it passed by the Senate \nand then by over 400 votes in the House. And then it does seem strange \nthat these matters just can't quite make it through the rest of the \nprocess to become law.\n  This Senator holds out hope that the administration, which is going \nto be visiting my home State of Minnesota--we have not seen such an \ninterest by an administration in our State, in my own recollection--\nwill come in and seize the opportunity to support two things that would \nbe of great benefit to my State. One would be disaster assistance for \nour farmers who have now suffered the second year in a row, and another \nwould be the support for concurrent receipt for our veterans. It would \nseem a fitting way to recognize the kind of suffering some are still \ngoing through\n\n[[Page S10557]]\n\nand also the kind of contributions that have been made, once again, to \nsee that there would be the same enthusiasm for fitting within this \nbudget framework some of the benefits we would like to provide for our \ncitizens, the same as we provide for the very wealthiest corporate \nexecutives who seem to be doing very well despite the difficult \neconomic times.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida for bringing these matters to the \nSenate this evening. It was an excellent discussion. I look forward to \nour continuing it again soon.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank my distinguished colleague. It is \nalways a pleasure to hear from him. I appreciate his undergirding of my \ncomments this evening.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 123\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Public \n     Law 107-229 is further amended by striking the date specified \n     in section 107(c) and inserting in lieu thereof ``November \n     22, 2002''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we all know, Congress has not yet \ncompleted action on 11 appropriations bills. These bills fund such \nimportant domestic priorities as homeland security, education, and \nveterans medical care.\n  In order to keep these important functions of Government up and \nrunning, we have already worked with the House to pass two continuing \nresolutions, the last of which expires on Friday.\n  The House of Representatives has just passed and sent to the Senate a \nthird continuing resolution. House Republicans are now proposing that \nwe leave town and let the Government run on autopilot until November \n22.\n  Why November 22? By picking a Friday a week before Thanksgiving, \nHouse Republicans are signaling they are not serious about completing \nthe appropriations bills in November either. It will be extraordinarily \ndifficult, in the several days before Thanksgiving, for us to get all \nthe parties together to settle all the issues that have been insoluble \nfor the past several months.\n  The House Republican proposal seems designed to be an auto-pilot \nuntil next year, a recipe for a CR that starves basic Government \nprograms essential to the health and well-being of millions of \nAmericans. Indeed, several leading Republicans have indicated this is \nreally their preference.\n  Senators should not be under any illusion: a long-term CR will do \njust that. It will starve vital functions of Government. And you don't \nhave to take my word for it. According to Representative Bill Young, \nthe Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, a long-\nterm CR, ``would have disastrous impacts on the war on terror, homeland \nsecurity, and other important Government responsibilities.''\n  Chairman Young wrote that sentence in a memo he sent to Speaker \nHastert. The memo went even further, detailing the impact of a CR on a \nhost of important domestic programs. Here is a sampling of what \nChairman Young said will be cut: FBI, funding to hire additional agents \nto fight terrorism and to continue information technology upgrades \nwould be denied; bioterrorism, no funding for President's $800 million \ninitiative to increase funding for new basic bioterror research, to \ndevelop and test a new improved anthrax vaccine, and to assist \nuniversities and research institutions; first responders, no funding \nfor President's $3.5 billion initiative to provide assistance to local \nlaw enforcement, fire departments, and emergency response teams; SEC/\ncorporate responsibility, insufficient funding to support current \nstaffing requirements let alone significant staff increases needed to \nmonitor corporate behavior; veterans medical care, long-term CR would \nleave veterans medical health care system at least $2.5 billion short \nof expected requirements; firefighting, $1.5 billion taken from other \nInterior Department programs to pay for firefighting costs will not be \nreplaced; Pell grants, a freeze in this program will result in a \nshortfall of over $900 million; Medicare claims, no funding for the \nPresident's $143 million increase to ensure that the growing number of \nclaims are processed in a timely manner; Special Supplemental Feeding \nProgram for WIC, funding would be reduced by $114 million below current \nlevels, meaning less will be available for families that depend on this \nprogram; Social Security claims, no funding for the President's \nincrease to process and pay benefits to millions of Social Security \nrecipients.\n  In addition to the program cuts listed by Chairman Young, the House \nCR omits assistance for thousands of farmers all over this country who \nare confronting the worst drought in more than 50 years.\n  This is the wrong way to do business. We should be completing our \nwork on the bipartisan appropriations bills, not cutting education, \nveterans affairs, homeland security and other important priorities.\n  Each of these bills properly funds key priorities. And, most \nimportantly, each enjoyed the unanimous support of the Democrats and \nthe Republicans on the Committee.\n  There is no reason why the full Senate cannot do the same. Passage of \nthese bills would fund Government for a year, with no need for any more \nstopgap, starvation diet CRs.\n  Regretfully, our Republican colleagues in the House have refused all \nyear to consider appropriate funding levels for crucial functions of \nGovernment, even though all Senators on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, Democrats and Republicans, were able to agree on all 13 \nbills.\n  The difference between the aggregate total of spending for the \nbipartisan Senate bills and the aggregate total proposed by the House \nRepublican budget resolution is roughly $9 billion in budget authority. \nThat's a tiny fraction of the $5.6 trillion 10-year surplus that's been \nsquandered since the current administration came to office.\n  To hold up funding for all the non-defense areas of Government in \norder to claim credit for fiscal responsibility over such a tiny \nproportion of overall spending is the height of irresponsibility.\n  Unfortunately, it is crystal clear that is precisely what our \nRepublican colleagues would like to see happen. They want to run the \nGovernment on a starvation diet into next year. Because the House \nresolution is now the only way to keep the Government operating, it \nwill be passed by voice vote. But I want to be very clear that, if \nthere had been a recorded vote on this measure, I would have voted no.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, basically what we have just done is pass a \ncontinuing resolution until November 22. This is done with some \ntrepidation and really with the complete understanding that this is not \nthe right way to run Government. It would have been so much better had \nwe been able to pass our appropriations bills. We have not been able to \ndo that. We have 13 appropriations bills we should pass every year. I \ndon't have the exact number, but I think following the passage of the \nDefense appropriations bill, we have\n\n[[Page S10558]]\n\npassed four bills, maybe only three, leaving tremendous work that \nshould have been done in committee.\n  We have tried on a number of occasions to offer consent resolutions \nthat we could pass the appropriations bills. Senator Byrd wanted to ask \nunanimous consent that we pass them all at once. They passed the \nAppropriations Committee unanimously; that is, Democrats and \nRepublicans approved these bills. So it is just a shame.\n  In fact, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, a \nRepublican, sent a resolution to Speaker Hastert, which has been \naround. Other people have seen it. It is not very private. It is one of \nthose things here in Washington that is about as private as going to \nTysons Corner shopping--not very private. It is a memo to the Speaker \nfrom the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Among other things, he says:\n\n       A long-term continuing resolution (CR) that funds \n     government operations at FY02 levels would have a disastrous \n     impact on the war on terror, homeland security, and other \n     important government responsibilities.\n\n  He sets out, in a four-page memorandum, all the things that would be \nhurt. He does list those, including Social Security, Pell grants, \nMedicare claims, a large number of items. And he leaves out a number of \nthem that I personally believe and many Democrats believe are as \nimportant as those he lists in this memorandum that should be passed.\n  Had this matter come before the Senate and there had been a rollcall \nvote, there is no question that a significant number of Democrats would \nhave voted in opposition. That is the way things worked out. We could \nnot be responsible for shutting down Government, because that is what \nit would have amounted to.\n  We are doing this reluctantly. I hope that when we come back, \nChairman Young prevails and at that time we can sit down and pass the \nappropriations bills. It is important to every State in the Union that \nwe do this.\n  There is a tremendous need to do things such as Government setup, \nsuch as pass the yearly appropriations bills. This is not the right way \nto fund Government.\n  Some have said, including Senator Pat Moynihan, that this is a plan. \nThese programs that they want to hurt, they can't do it head on, they \ncan't do it directly, so they do it indirectly.\n  I am glad that Government is going to be funded. We went through the \nGingrich years where he and his compatriots shut down the Government. \nWe are not going to do that. We are going to act responsibly. That is \nwhy we allowed this measure to go forward. But we do it with concern, \nreservation, and, as I have indicated, with trepidation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the memorandum from \nChairman Young and Speaker Hastert to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Speaker Hastert.\n     From: Chairman C.W. Bill Young.\n     Re: Impacts of a Long-term Continuing Resolution.\n     Date: October 3, 2002.\n       Pursuant to my October 1st correspondence regarding the \n     state of the appropriations process, I want to provide you \n     with further analysis of the potential impacts of a long-term \n     continuing resolution (CR). These projections assume a \n     current-rate CR excluding one time expenditures that extends \n     through February or March.\n       A long-term continuing resolution (CR) that funds \n     government operations at FY02 levels would have disastrous \n     impacts on the war on terror, homeland security, and other \n     important government responsibilities. It would also be \n     fiscally irresponsible. It would fund low-priority programs \n     the President has proposed to eliminate.\n       Homeland Security--The President has proposed a nearly $40 \n     billion increase for homeland security in his FY03 budget. \n     None of these funds would be provided under a long-term CR. \n     Assuming Congress completes work on creating a Department of \n     Homeland Security, a long-term CR would leave this new agency \n     with very little resources to carry out its new mission.\n       Projects--A long-term CR ensures that no Member of Congress \n     would receive a single project. The Committee has received \n     tens of thousands of requests for billions of dollars from \n     almost every Member of Congress.\n       War Supplemental--It is likely that the first item Congress \n     will consider when we reconvene after the election is a major \n     supplemental to fund possible military operations in Iraq. It \n     would be highly problematic to expect the Congress to \n     complete work on 11 spending bills while working on an urgent \n     war supplemental.\n\n\n               Homeland security impacts of long-term CR\n\n       FBI--We would not have sufficient funding to hire \n     additional agents to fight terrorism and to continue IT \n     upgrades that will help the FBI ``connect the dots'' through \n     data mining proposals and other information infrastructure \n     enhancements.\n       TSA--Efforts to improve aviation, maritime and land \n     security would be seriously curtailed. Port, cargo, and \n     trucking security would seriously deteriorate. If emergency \n     funds are excluded from the CR calculation (which is \n     historically the case), TSA would be under an annual rate of \n     $1.5 billion for the life of a long-term CR. This would be \n     only 28% of their FY03 budget request ($5.3 billion). At this \n     level, it is unlikely TSA could maintain their current \n     workforce of 32,000 screeners as well as air marshals. TSA \n     would likely face personnel RIF's. Most airports would not be \n     able to meet the deadlines for security improvements \n     established by Congress last December.\n       Coast Guard--The Coast Guard is requesting a large ($500 \n     million) budget increase in FY03, and much of this is to hire \n     additional security personnel, such as Maritime Safety and \n     Security Teams to patrol harbors and respond to suspicious \n     activity. It also includes funds to expand the sea marshal \n     program, which escorts DoD and high-risk commercial ships \n     into port. Under the FY02 level, these safety expenses would \n     be deferred, or would require diversion of funds from other \n     critical missions such as drug interdiction or search and \n     rescue. Coast Guard ``deepwater'' program is slated to expand \n     from $500 million in FY02 to $725 million in FY03. The \n     contract was just signed this past June. Under a long-term \n     CR, the effort will have to be scaled back due to lack of \n     funding. This will impact shipyards, design companies, \n     aircraft manufacturers, and integration companies, all around \n     the country.\n       Bioterrorism--President has proposed a nearly $800 million \n     increase for new, basic bioterror research, $250 million to \n     develop and test a new improved anthrax vaccine, and $150 \n     million to assist universities and research institutions in \n     upgrading research facilities to conduct secure, \n     comprehensive research on biolgogical agents. None of these \n     important initiatives to combat, study and prevent bio-\n     terrorism would be funded under a long-term CR.\n       Border Patrol/INS--Efforts to deploy any additional Border \n     Patrol agents and immigration inspectors at land ports-of-\n     entry along both the northern and southern borders would be \n     stalled. Likewise, construction projects that are necessary \n     to house these additional Border Patrol agents would be \n     delayed. No funding would be available to continue planning \n     and implementation of the INS' Entry Exit system, a program \n     designed to facilitate more secure and controlled access to \n     this country by non-U.S. citizens.\n       First Responders--The President has proposed a new \n     initiative to provide $3.5 billion in assistance to local law \n     enforcement, fire departments and emergency response teams \n     across the Nation. No funds would be provided for this \n     program, one of the highest domestic security priorities for \n     the President and his Homeland Security advisor, Tom Ridge.\n       Hospital preparedness--We would not have sufficient funds \n     to assist hospitals in making the necessary infrastructure \n     improvements and expansions so that they are prepared to \n     respond to bio-terrorism emergencies.\n       Diplomatic security--We would not have the funds to hire \n     additional State Department security staff for deployment \n     overseas, or to carry out needed technical and physical \n     security upgrades.\n       Office of Homeland Security--The Office of Homeland \n     Security was funded through the $20 billion supplemental. \n     Under a clean CR, this office would not be funded.\n\n\n                  Programmatic Impacts of Long-term CR\n\n       SEC/Corporate Responsibility--We would not be able to fund \n     current staffing requirements, let alone support significant \n     staff increases needed to fight corporate fraud and protect \n     investors.\n       Veterans--The veterans medical care system will likely be \n     at least $2.5 billion short of expected requirements. \n     Veterans would be deprived of significant increases in \n     medical care proposed by the President and the House budget \n     resolution.\n       NIH--We would not be able to scale-up significantly Federal \n     support for bio-preparedness research and development as \n     proposed by the President. Anthrax vaccine research and \n     development also would be slowed. It would forgo the nearly \n     $4 billion proposed for the National Institutes of Health \n     which is consistent with Congress commitment to double \n     funding for NIH over a set period of time.\n       Foreign Operations--Afghanistan reconstruction, including \n     the famous Presidential ring road, would stall, increasing \n     chances that unrest and killings would resume there as the \n     Iraq matter comes to a head. It will severely cut the U.S. \n     contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis \n     and Malaria and reduce by 30% funds for Plan Colombia.\n       Firefighting--Interior has already spent $1.5 billion on \n     firefighting above what provided in FY02. This has come at \n     the expense of other programs including Member\n\n[[Page S10559]]\n\n     projects. These bills would not be paid under a long-term CR.\n       Pay--All agencies would have to absorb Federal employee pay \n     increases due in January. This will make it much more \n     difficult for agencies to operate under a current rate and \n     result in widespread layoffs and furloughs.\n       Pell Grants--A freeze in the Pell program will result in \n     the accumulation of a significant shortfall. There will be a \n     shortfall of over $900 million, even when factoring in the $1 \n     billion supplemental appropriation provided to the program in \n     fiscal year 2002.\n       DEA--We would be unable to hire new agents in response to \n     FBI restructuring, which shifted 400 FBI drug agents to \n     counter-terrorism. We have proposed to hire hundreds of new \n     agents to fight the war on drugs. Not a single new agent \n     would be hired under a long term CR leaving a significant gap \n     in the federal government's drug enforcement capabilities.\n       GSA Construction--No new starts for any GSA line-item \n     construction ($630 million); would delay $300 million for 11 \n     courthouse construction projects, $30 million for 6 border \n     station construction projects, and $300 million for 5 other \n     construction projects, including funds for consolidating Food \n     and Drug Administration facilities, a major Census building, \n     and the US mission to the UN in New York. Projects would \n     become more expensive due to inflation.\n       Campaign Finance Reform--No funding for implementation of \n     the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act making it difficult for \n     the Federal Elections Commission to implement the reforms \n     signed into law by the President.\n       Federal Prisons--Insufficient activation funds to four \n     Federal prisons that are scheduled to open in FY 2003, \n     exacerbating the already overcrowded conditions in the \n     Federal prison system.\n       Medicare claims--We would not be able to provide additional \n     funding, as proposed by the President, to handle the \n     increased Medicare claims volume in a timely manner. The \n     President proposed a $143 million increase to adequately \n     process the growing number of claims. A long term CR would \n     significantly slow down the claims process and unnecessarily \n     inconvenience Senior Citizens who depend on Medicare.\n       Yucca Mountain--A CR at the FY2002 enacted level of $375M \n     would significantly cut DOE's nuclear waste repository \n     program by over $200 million. This would cause real delays in \n     the scheduled opening of the facility.\n       The Special Supplemental Feeding Program for Women, \n     Infants, and Children (WIC) would be reduced $114 million \n     from current levels. This would result in less assistance \n     being available for families who depend on this important \n     program, especially in uncertain economic times.\n       The Food and Drug Administration would be reduced by $138 \n     million which would result in immediate furloughs and RIFs \n     among newly hired employees responsible for enhanced \n     availability of drugs and vaccines, and for increased food \n     safety activities (primarily surveillance of imported food \n     products, an identified vulnerability).\n       Social Security--The President also asked for a significant \n     increase in funds to process and pay benefits to the millions \n     of Social Security recipients.\n\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my understanding is we are in a period of \nmorning business. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10559-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MISSING CHILDREN'S ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe Missing Children's Assistance Act and to urge its prompt \nconsideration by this body.\n  The Justice Department recently reported that in 1999, 797,500 \nchildren were reported missing to police or to missing children's \nagencies. That is equivalent to a startling 11.4 children per 1,000 in \nthe U.S. population. There were 58,200 children who were victims of a \nnon-family abduction in 1999. One hundred fifteen of these children \nwere taken in a manner that we would think of as a stereotypical \nkidnapping, and tragically, in half of these cases, the child victim \nwas sexually assaulted by the perpetrator. These statistics are \nunacceptable. As a Nation we should strive every day to eliminate the \nscourge of abducted children.\n  That's exactly what the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren is all about. Since it was established in 1984, the Center has \nserved as a resource to parents, children, law enforcement, schools, \nand the community to assist in the recovery of America's abducted \nchildren. It has worked on over 73,000 cases of missing and exploited \nchildren and successfully returned more than 48,000 of these children \nto their families. The Center is constantly striving to raise the \nNation's awareness of preventative measures that can be taken to keep \nour children safe from abduction, sexual exploitation, and molestation. \nThese notable endeavors have contributed to a substantial increase in \nnation's recovery rate of missing children from a dismal 61 percent in \nthe 1980s to 91 percent today.\n  For these reasons, I rise today with the Senator from Utah and the \nSenator from Vermont to introduce the Missing Children's Assistance \nAct. This act will expand the ability of the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children to protect our children by doubling the \nFederal contribution to the Center to $20 million a year and by \nensuring that Congress will continue to support the Center's noteworthy \nefforts through 2006. The act also authorizes the creation of a \nCyberTipline. As technology continues to transform and modernize our \nlives, we must make provisions to insure that our children will be safe \nfrom perpetrators who prey on children through the Internet. The \nCyberTipline will provide a forum for individuals to contribute tips \nand suspicions of Internet-related and other types of sexual \nimpropriety directed towards minors to the authorities. It will allow \nthose wary of contacting law enforcement a safe place to do so, while \nmaking it possible for law enforcement and missing children agencies to \nsend email alerts to thousands of individuals instantaneously.\n  In the end, I believe that this act will make the Nation a safer \nplace for our children. The National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren has done a tremendous job of raising the nation's awareness of \nchild abduction, and this act will make it possible for the Center to \ncontinue with these endeavors. I urge support for the Missing \nChildren's Assistance Act. It is fundamental that our children's safety \nremain at forefront of our national agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10559-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BANKRUPTCY CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, recently, the Prosecutor for the Special \nCourt for Sierra Leone briefed the staff of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee. He spoke about his efforts to prosecute those responsible \nfor the horrific crimes that were committed there and to help this \nnation emerge from a tragic episode in its history.\n  Whenever something like this occurs, the question that first comes to \nmind is why did it happen? Was it a political struggle? Was it because \nof religious extremism or ethnic hatred? Unlike Yugoslavia or Rwanda, \nmost experts believe that the driving force behind this brutal conflict \nwas control of resources, especially diamonds.\n  The problems associated with conflict diamonds in Sierra Leone are \nnot confined to West Africa. They also have an impact in the United \nStates. According to the Washington Post, al Qaeda reaped millions of \ndollars from the illicit sale of diamonds, and law enforcement \nofficials have said that in order to cut off al Qaeda funds, you have \nto cut off the diamond pipeline.\n  With all that is happening in the world, it may be understandable \nthat the issue of conflict diamonds is not front page news. However, we \nare starting to make some progress on this important issue.\n\n[[Page S10560]]\n\n  The Administration has been working to help create an international \nregime aimed at stopping the trade in conflict diamonds. Initiated by a \ngroup of African nations, the Kimberly process has the support of a \ndiverse group of non-governmental organizations and the diamond \nindustry.\n  In March 2002, the last full session of the Kimberly process was \ncompleted and has now reached a point where the individual countries \ninvolved need to pass implementing legislation. In the United States, \nsome modest legislation may be enacted before the end of this year.\n  While I am glad that Congress may pass something on conflict diamonds \nthis year, there must be a serious effort next year to get stronger \nlegislation signed into law.\n  Senator Durbin has introduced important implementing legislation, and \nhe is working with the administration, a bipartisan group of Senators, \nincluding Senators DeWine and Bingaman, and a range of non-governmental \norganizations such as Oxfam and Catholic Relief Services to come up \nwith effective legislation that we can all support.\n  I am encouraged that the administration is consulting with Congress \nand has named Ambassador Bindenagle, a career diplomat with experience \nin complex negotiations, to lead this effort.\n  But, there must be more than an exchange of views on this issue. The \nadministration must also seriously consider Congressional proposals to \nmove beyond the Kimberly process.\n  For example, a major flaw in the Kimberly process is that it does not \ncover polished diamonds. This is important for two reasons. Polished \ndiamonds contribute significantly to the problems associated with the \nillicit trade in diamonds, and the United States is far and away the \nworld's largest market for these types of diamonds. Clearly, this is an \narea where the United States needs to show leadership.\n  As chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, I will do what I \ncan to ensure that resources are available for developing countries \nthat want to enhance their capacity to implement Kimberly.\n  I look forward to working with the administration to make substantial \nprogress on this issue next year. It will not be easy, but it can be \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10560-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DRIVER'S LICENSE FRAUD PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to have joined Senator Durbin \nin introducing the Driver's License Fraud Prevention Act.\n  Today's patchwork of State laws, regulations, and procedures for the \nissuance of driver's licenses makes it all too easy for problem drivers \nand criminals to obtain multiple licenses to hide traffic convictions \nand other criminal activity. The extent of the problem became painfully \nclear following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when we \nlearned that a number of the terrorists had obtained State-issued \ndriver's licenses or identification cards using fraudulent documents.\n  Almost half the States have taken action since the terrorist attacks \nto tighten licensing procedures and I am encouraged that the National \nGovernors Association has formed a homeland security task force that, \namong other things, will be working to determine the best way for \nStates to strengthen their driver's license standards and authority. \nHowever, Senator Durbin and I believe there is a legitimate role for \nthe Federal Government to play in leading and coordinating State \nefforts to improve driver's license security. In addition, because of \nthe estimated costs and coordination required to improve driver's \nlicense security, the States cannot resolve the issue on their own.\n  The proposal we introduced would require the Department of \nTransportation, DOT, to work in consultation with the States to \nestablish minimum standards for proof of identity by driver's license \napplicants. Currently, personnel in departments of motor vehicles are \ncalled upon to perform the difficult task of verifying numerous \ndifferent types of birth certificates, licenses from other States, \nproof of residency, and other documents. Only 18 States verify an \napplicant's social security number with the Social Security \nAdministration and there is no system today to verify the validity of a \ndriver's license being surrendered to obtain a license in another \nState.\n  This legislation would also require DOT, in consultation with the \nStates, to establish minimum standards for the license itself to make \nit more tamper-proof and less susceptible to counterfeiting. DOT would \nalso be directed to complete a study of the feasibility, costs, \nbenefits and impact on personal privacy of using a biometric identifier \non driver's licenses. The intent is not to create a national driver's \nlicense or identification card, but to improve the security of State-\nissued licenses through the use of digital photographs, holograms and \nother devices.\n  In addition, the bill would use the existing database for commercial \nmotor vehicle drivers as the platform for creating a driver record \ninformation system on all licensed drivers. The new system, like the \ncurrent one, would be a pointer system to State records, rather than a \nnational database of information on drivers. It is this new system that \nwould help States verify the validity of licenses previously held, \ndetermine whether an individual holds more than one license, and \nprovide information on the individual's driving record. Further, the \nbill would prohibit the disclosure or display of an individual's social \nsecurity number of a driver's license, increase criminal penalties for \nfraudulently issuing, obtaining or facilitating the issuance of \nfraudulent licenses, and call for the timely posting of convictions \nincurred in any State on the driver's license.\n  Driver's licenses are used by minors to purchase alcohol and \ncigarettes, by criminals involved in identity theft, and for many other \nillegal purposes. Improving the security of the license is a matter of \ncommon sense.\n  I am confident that this legislation will provoke meaningful and \nlively debate, as well as more ideas about how to approach driver's \nlicense security. It may not be possible, given the press of other \nbusiness, for the bill to be passed this year.

Let me first ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record ``The Filmmaker Who Told America's Story'' \nby Phil McCombs that appeared in the Washington Post last week.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [Washington Post, Oct. 10, 2002]\n\n                 The Filmmaker Who Told America's Story\n\n                           (By Phil McCombs)\n\n       He raced against death, and won.\n       Oh, how Charles Guggenheim would have not liked putting it \n     so directly!\n       The great film documentarian, who died at Georgetown \n     University Hospital yesterday of pancreatic cancer at 78, \n     left a life's work of subtle, passionate cinematic hymns to \n     what he called, in a last message to friends, ``the essential \n     American journey.''\n       His final film, finished just weeks ago, limns a shocking \n     episode of that journey--the ``selection'' by Nazis of 350 \n     U.S. troops captured in the Battle of the Bulge in 1944 for \n     deportation to a concentration camp because they were Jews or \n     ``looked Jewish.''\n       Guggenheim, the son of a well-to-do German Jewish furniture \n     merchant in Cincinnati, easily might have been one of them. \n     His unit was decimated in the battle, but he'd been left \n     behind in the States with a life-threatening infection.\n       For more than half a century, as hints and incomplete \n     versions of the story surfaced, it gnawed at him. A few years \n     ago, he began searching for survivors--and found them.\n       Early this year, just as Guggenheim was working on the \n     ``death march'' sequence, his cancer was diagnosed.\n       For the next six months, he'd work all week on the film, \n     have chemotherapy on Friday, sleep through the weekend and be \n     back on the job Monday.\n       A few weeks ago, as he and his daughter, Grace--producer of \n     this and many of his films--were ``mixing'' the final \n     version, he began suffering painful attacks. The cancer had \n     invaded his stomach.\n       ``He'd have to lie on the couch while we worked,'' Grace \n     Guggenheim recalled.\n       By then, her father was thin and drawn--not unlike his \n     former comrades after they were liberated by U.S. forces \n     following months of slave labor in a satellite camp of \n     Buchenwald.\n       ``Does it occur to you,'' Guggenheim's old friend, \n     historian David McCullough, asked\n\n[[Page S10561]]\n\n     him in an interview last month, ``that maybe you were spared \n     to make this film?''\n       ``Well,'' Guggenheim answered, ``I felt a deep obligation \n     more after I met the [survivors] than I did before. . . . I \n     said, `I owe them something.' '' Thoughts of his old comrades \n     courage, he added, were a ``source of strength for me'' as he \n     persevered in his battle with cancer to finish the film.\n       Just as ``Berga: Soldiers of Another War'' was done, \n     Guggenheim's strength evaporated. He began staying home, \n     sleeping most of the time as his wife, Marion--his steadfast \n     supporter for half a century--tended to him.\n       When I visited a few days after McCullough, Guggenheim was \n     weak but still very much himself--that enormous charm, the \n     bright sense of humor, that smile of his that sparkled like \n     the sun.\n       He worried that ``Berga'' was being discussed in the media \n     too soon, since it's not due for release until next April. \n     But he was sure of one thing.\n       ``This film will hit you right in the gut.''\n\n\n                        Starring Everyday People\n\n       Guggenheim was a giant.\n       In a career that spanned almost six decades, he received 12 \n     Academy Award nominations and four Oscars for his \n     documentaries--a feat matched only by Walt Disney.\n       Yet acclaim never sullied this modest, friendly man who \n     lived a quiet family life in Washington. Though many of his \n     friends were powerful figures, ``he can sort of take it or \n     leave it,'' as former Missouri representative Jim Symington \n     once said. ``He's an artist.''\n       Understatement was Guggenheim's signature--but it mounts in \n     his films until, often, you can't help but cry.\n       In ``The Shadow of Hate'' (1995), his wrenching study of \n     bigotry, a dead African American male is shown, hanging from \n     a branch, in a long-faded archival photo.\n       Guggenheim's camera pans the white crowd, posing under the \n     lynching tree; stops at a little girl in a pretty dress; \n     slowly zooms in.\n       She has a shy smile.\n       Yet his outrage at injustice (``Nine From Little Rock,'' on \n     the 1957 school integration crisis; ``The Johnstown Flood,'' \n     about neglect of a dam by wealthy industrialists that led to \n     2,200 deaths in 1889; and ``A Time for Justice,'' on the \n     civil rights movement, all won Academy Awards) merely \n     underscored his fierce love of America.\n       ``The truth is, we're living in wonderful times and a \n     wonderful place,'' he once told a filmmakers' organization \n     that had given him an award. ``This country provides more \n     possibility to learn about oneself, and what the journey of \n     humanity has been, than any other place.\n       ``There are great stories in what is very common.''\n       He crafted celebratory documentaries on presidents Truman, \n     Kennedy and Johnson; on U.S. fighting men in the Normandy \n     invasion (``D-Day Remembered''); on workers constructing \n     iconic American symbols (``Monument to the Dream,'' on the \n     building of the 660-foot Gateway Arch in St. Louis, ``The \n     Making of Liberty,'' on refurbishing the Statue of Liberty); \n     on the immigrants who passed through Ellis Island (``Island \n     of Hope/Island of Tears''); and on American politics \n     (``Robert Kennedy Remembered'' won an Oscar in 1968).\n       Guggenheim was awed by the spiritual depth and gritty \n     determination of everyday people--the patriotism of Japanese \n     Americans interned in a camp; workers at the Arch who proudly \n     brought their families on Sundays to show what they'd \n     accomplished; frightened troops riding the launches into \n     Normandy, ready to offer up their lives.\n       I remember seeing Guggenheim at the July 4 festivities at \n     the National Archives on the Mall last year. He could have \n     sat with the dignitaries on a dais above the crowd but chose \n     to stand at a spot down below where he could watch the faces \n     of the people.\n       ``Look at them!'' he marveled. ``They'll wait in line all \n     day just for a chance to see the Constitution and Declaration \n     of Independence.''\n       Born dyslexic, he had a gift for hearing the nuances of \n     common speech. In his films, he lets the voices of \n     participants carry the stories whenever possible.\n       ``It was over. I mean, it was quiet, as if nothing had \n     happened,'' says the haunting voice of a former GI in ``D-Day \n     Remembered.'' ``The beach was not any general's business. \n     They had no say, none what-some-ever.''\n       ``I cry when I hear that,'' Guggenheim once confided.\n       And these, from the liberation sequence in ``Berga'':\n       Sanford Lubinsky: ``It got quiet. And then we heard that \n     firing start up again.''\n       Edward Slotkin: ``And we look out the front . . .''\n       Leo Zaccaria: ``And up the road comes this tank. American \n     tank.''\n       Lubinsky: ``When I saw that American flag coming down that \n     road, nothing looked so beautiful in all our born days. That \n     American flag, our flag, sure looked beautiful. It's a very \n     beautiful thing when you haven't seen it for a long while. \n     It's a beauty!''\n       The narrations Guggenheim wrote in support of the voices \n     were spare, existential.\n       ``The sea was welcoming,'' narrates a deep-voiced \n     McCullough in the D-Day film, ``as if it were paying its \n     respects to the men who had fallen, who out of a nation of \n     millions had been selected, for reasons known only to fate, \n     to represent us on the beach that day.''\n       Guggenheim had a second hat, too. He was a founding father \n     of the televised political campaign commercial.\n       As a young independent filmmaker in St. Louis in 1956, he'd \n     accepted an offer to run presidential candidate Adlai \n     Stevenson's TV campaign--Guggenheim needed the money--and \n     then gone on to work for other candidates.\n       His client list amounted to a veritable political lexicon, \n     including Kennedy, Gore Sr., Symington, McGovern, Moss, \n     Shapp, Brown, Hays, Brademas, Ribicoff, Metzenbaum, Goldberg, \n     Mondale, Pell, Bayh, Church, Biden, Danforth, Hollings.\n       Eventually, Guggenheim became disillusioned with what was \n     evolving into a somewhat infamous institution.\n       ``If you play a piano in a house of ill repute,'' he told \n     PBS's ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer'' a few years ago, ``it \n     doesn't make any difference how well you play the piano.''\n       By the late '80s, he'd turned full time to his beloved \n     documentaries.\n       ``Why have you stayed with this . . . art form of yours all \n     these years?'' McCullough asked in the interview last month. \n     ``What . . . makes you want to get up out of bed in the \n     morning?''\n       ``I just feel compelled to say something, if I feel \n     strongly about it,'' Guggenheim replied. ``And I think it was \n     . . . [director] David Lean [who] said that the greatest \n     moment in making films, and probably the most satisfying \n     moment in film, is getting a story you're in love with.\n       ``So you search for those things.''\n       Last week, as Guggenheim lay dying, ``Berga'' was screened \n     for the board of the Foundation for the National Archives, a \n     nonprofit advisory and fund-raising group of which Guggenheim \n     was president. For most of his films, the archives was a \n     primary source.\n       Grace Guggenheim read a message to the group dictated by \n     her dad from the hospital.\n       ``Many people know about the Constitution and the \n     Declaration of Independence,'' he'd said, ``but few know the \n     treasures held in the millions of feet of film, in the \n     countless maps and pictures and letters . . .\n       ``Story after story is revealed from the work that is \n     accomplished every day at the archives--the incomparable \n     truths, all telling and retelling what is the essential \n     American journey.''\n       The guests filed into the theater, the lights went down.\n       A long-faded archival photo appeared on the screen, the \n     camera panning slowly across it--fresh-faced American GIs of \n     World War II, in formation.\n       Then the narrator's voice--clear, strong:\n       ``This picture was taken over 50 years ago. World War II. \n     My company. I'm in there someplace. I can remember their \n     faces just like yesterday. And they went overseas, and I \n     didn't, and some of them didn't come back.\n       ``And I've been thinking about it for 50 years, wondering \n     why it didn't happen to me.\n       ``That's why I had to tell this story.''\n\n\n                        that guy from st. louis\n\n       Heavily medicated in the hospital last week, Guggenheim \n     still had glorious moments with Marion, Grace and his sons, \n     Davis and Jonathan, both in film work.\n       ``One day he had a resurrection of being alert,'' Grace \n     said. ``He hugged us all and said, `I just want to live with \n     you!' ''\n       ``He charmed the doctors and hospital staff. He wanted to \n     show them the film and tell them, `This is what you helped me \n     make.' ''\n       Through his window, ``he could look out and see a big \n     American flag.''\n       They reminisced: How Davis practically had to order his \n     reticent father to narrate ``Berga'' in the first person . . \n     . how everything had gone so perfectly filming on location in \n     Germany, snow just when they needed it.\n       Then, a letter arrived from Guggenheim's old friend, \n     producer George Stevens Jr., and Grace read it to her father.\n       In 1962, Stevens recalled, he'd just arrived from Hollywood \n     to do documentaries for Edward R. Murrow's U.S. Information \n     Agency when word came that a young filmmaker from St. Louis \n     had seen a USIA film so bad it made him ``ashamed to be an \n     American.''\n       ``Find me that guy from St. Louis!'' Stevens had ordered.\n       ``You possessed then and ever since,'' Stevens wrote, ``an \n     absolute true compass when it came to the integrity of your \n     work--and our fights to keep the films we made from being \n     dumbed down or made prosaic . . . were stimulating.\n       ``I remember `United in Progress' and the beautiful footage \n     you shot of President Kennedy in Costa Rica . . . our venture \n     to LBJ's ranch for `The President's Country' . . . and, too, \n     when I took you [in 1964] to meet Bob Kennedy . . . and my \n     good fortune in having you at my side to start the Kennedy \n     Center Honors--it was just a little scheme back then . . .\n       ``I cherish those memories, Charles.''\n       A long, long row of candles.\n\n\n                           The Master's Voice\n\n       In the closing sequence of ``Berga,'' Guggenheim--knowing \n     his time was short--offers a powerful, transcendent final \n     message:\n       Milton Stolon (survivor): ``Ah, it's no good to remember. . \n     . . But you have to remember because people, people forget \n     what went on.''\n       Then old photos of the survivors returning home to their \n     families flash on the screen--one after another, with their \n     wives and sweethearts and kids.\n\n[[Page S10562]]\n\n       The final shot: a joyful GI, the camera panning down to his \n     smiling little girl sitting on a tricycle.\n       And Guggenheim's clear voice-over:\n       ``These are just a few of the faces in my story, but there \n     are millions of faces, and millions of stories.\n       ``That have never been told. And deserve to be.\n       ``You should remember that.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The great advantage of serving in the U.S. Senate is \nthe exposure to your colleagues in the Senate, all who are talented, \nand the exposure to various individuals in Washington involved in the \nissues. The principal issue for one serving in the U.S. Senate is \nreelection. That's how I met Charles Guggenheim.\n  It was 30 years ago. Charles had the reputation of producing the best \ncandidate films and after handling me, remarkably, he retained that \nreputation. My staff had just contacted him when they came back to me \nand surprised me with the request that Charles wanted to follow me when \nI went home that weekend. I said let's wait, it's too early for \nfilming. The answer was no, it's not for filming, Mr. Guggenheim wants \nto travel with you to see if he likes you. I said fair enough. I want \nto see if I like him. I will never forget that weekend. After reciting \nthe Pledge of Allegiance at the Rotary Club, the Realtors, the tobacco \nbarn, the Democratic Party rally, and nine other times, I thought I may \nlose Charles. But he stuck with me. I learned to love him.\n  There are two kinds of geniuses in this world: the intellectual and \nthe sensitive. The intellectual is the type who goes through a magazine \njust turning the pages and catching up in the back part with the story, \nremembering it all. Or the type that reads a book in a couple of \nevenings. But then there is the sentimental genius. They feel the \nwords. You tell me that a friend is sick and I feel sorry for him. You \ntell Charles a friend is sick and he starts feeling bad. No one could \nread people better. He would have me do one take over and over and over \njust to make sure the light was right, or the sound was exact, very \nsensitive to the environment and feelings of those around him. No doubt \nthis made him an Oscar winner four times and a nominee twelve times. \nBut this search for the authentic also made him give up on us \npoliticians 20 years ago. The political short was no more the positive \nattributes of the candidate depicting his record in a colorful way, but \nthe framing of the opponent with a half-truth, with a negative spin \nthat meets the poll. Outrageous hypocrisy. Charles would have none of \nit and he turned exclusively to documentaries.\n  Charles' brilliance was in telling the story so that you were there \nin the historic moment. I watched him in his work. We would meet at \n6:30 in the morning two or three times a week at Ali Rosenberg's St. \nAlbans for tennis. Ali didn't let us start until just before 7:00 so \nthe three of us would chat about the events of the day. Charles had the \nkeenest wit about the political happenings in Washington and, talking \nalong, I realized his genius. It wasn't just the sensitivity, but the \nhistorian. For the D-Day film he searched the Pentagon archives for 2 \nyears finding things that the military historians had no idea of. Then, \nto give life to the depiction, he searched to identify the exact \noutfit, down to the platoon or squad. Then he found a member of that \nplatoon or squad still living to narrate the scene. For another 2 years \nhe looked for Jewish POWs for his most recent film. He was mainly \nconcerned about his own outfit from which he was separated. They were \ncaptured in the Battle of the Bulge; the Jewish prisoners separated and \ninflicted with torture and death. He wanted to tell this story of the \nPOW Holocaust that had never been told. He was tickled that the weather \nwas kind, just right for his takes at the prison camps in Germany. He \nsmiled at his luck. And then the cancer hit. He struggled this year to \nfinish the course. Amazing Grace, his beautiful daughter, worked with \nhim to complete the film. In this city of families split asunder, the \nGuggenheims have shone as a star of cohesion. Jonathan worked as a \nSenate Page and now produces on the West coast. Davis has just \ncompleted a cameo production on education. And that gracious lovable \nMarion continues to worry about everybody except herself. Charles was \nparticularly proud when he went west for his last nomination. His \ndaughter-in-law, Elizabeth Shue, won an Oscar. Knowing Charles, the \nsensitive, the authentic, his was not to receive Oscars but to render \nto others in his film. But surely, if he had one to give, it would be \nto Marion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10562-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10562-S10563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR PHIL GRAMM\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Texas \nSenator Phil Gramm, highly respected on both sides of the aisle for his \ntremendous intellect, deep convictions and relentless tenacity, he will \nlong be remembered in the U.S. Senate.\n  I have known Senator Gramm and his lovely wife Wendy for many years. \nI first served with Senator Gramm in the House of Representatives in \n1978 where we both served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \nAs conservative southern Democrats we had much in common and found \nourselves on the same side of most issues, although not always on the \nsame side as our party. Indeed, while we both came to Congress as \nDemocrats, we later found our ideology and values best reflected in the \nbeliefs of the Republican Party. Senator Gramm finding the light a \nlittle more quickly than I did. However, when I finally made my \ndecision to switch from the Democrat to Republican Party, it was more \nthan symbolic that I stood between two great men who represented the \nheart of the Republican Party in the U.S. Senate, Bob Dole and Phil \nGramm.\n  When I switched parties in 1994, Senator Gramm said of my ability to \nhelp deliver the message of the Republican party: ``There are no \ngreater zealots than converts.'' This certainly applied to me at the \ntime, and it still applies today. I think he spoke from what he knew to \nbe true himself. As someone who values freedom above all else, his life \nhas been a perfect model of what he preaches every day, and his \nlifetime achievements testify to that fact.\n  Senator Gramm embodies what can be achieved in America through hard \nwork, education and determination. He grew up in modest means in \nGeorgia, helping to contribute to the families' finances by working \ndelivering newspapers. The strong work ethic instilled in him by his \nupbringing led Senator Gramm to the University of Georgia where he \nreceived his PhD in Economics in 1967. Senator Gramm then moved to \nTexas, where he met and married his wife, Wendy Lee, who was also an \neconomics PhD.\n  Elected to serve in the House of Representatives from the 6th \ndistrict of Texas in 1978, Senator Gramm quickly developed a reputation \nas a conservative Democrat who was committed to fiscal responsibility. \nThrough his position on the Budget Committee, Senator Gramm helped to \ncraft bipartisan legislation which laid the foundation for Ronald \nReagan's 1981 tax cuts and defense buildup. In 1983, Phil Gramm \ndisplayed the courage of his convictions by resigning from the \nDemocratic party to run as a Republican. His re-election was a success, \nmaking him not only the first Republican in the history of the 6th \nDistrict of Texas, but the only member of Congress in the 20th Century \nto resign from Congress and successfully seek re-election as a member \nof another party.\n  When John Tower announced his retirement from the Senate in 1984, \nSenator Gramm seized the opportunity, and won an overwhelming victory \nin the general election. Senator Gramm wasted no time becoming actively \ninvolved within the Senate. One of his first initiatives, the Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings Deficit Control Act of 1985, required automatic budget \ncuts if the deficit was not reduced to specific levels. Together with a \nrapidly growing economy, this legislation was credited with producing \nthe first balanced budget in twenty five years. Since then, Senator \nGramm has established a long record of initiatives and achievements \nduring his tenure in the Senate, which included negotiating the final \npackage of budget cuts, spending caps and tax increases at the 1990 \nbudget summit, pressing for balanced budget amendments, the exposure \nand elimination of budget gimmickry, electricity deregulation and \nimproving the relationship and cooperation between the United States \nand Mexico.\n  Senator Gramm took the gavel of the Banking, Housing and Urban \nAffairs Committee in January of 1999. It was from this post, that he \nworked to repeal the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which\n\n[[Page S10563]]\n\nseparated banks from investment banking and commercial firms. Through a \nlot of hard work, dogged tenacity and a little compromise, Senator \nGramm shepherded the bill through the committee and out of the Senate. \nThe result was that in 1999 financial services deregulation was passed \nand signed into law, which may have been the biggest legislative \nachievement of the 106th Congress.\n  Senator Gramm has the ability to do something that not many people \ncan do. He can take very complex issues and break them down into their \nmost basic elements, so that just about anybody can understand them. \nThe intricacies of the budget process, the solvency of Social Security, \nthe implications of national health care, are all brought down to \nkitchen table common sense. This is an amazing gift, and a formidable \none for anyone who stands on the other side of an issue from him. There \nis simply no rhetoric to hide behind in a debate with Senator Gramm. He \nis not afraid to fight or to lose, and so he rarely loses.\n  Senator Gramm's absence from the U.S. Senate will truly leave a \nsubstantial void. I will certainly miss his expertise on the Senate \nBanking Committee and the broad policy experience that he brings to \nevery debate. I would like to extend my sincere best wishes to Senator \nGramm on his retirement from the Senate and wish him luck in his new \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10563-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10563-S10564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF ENRON SCANDAL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one year ago today, the public first began \nto learn of the accounting frauds that led to the collapse of Enron \nCorporation. For the first time, investors learned of special purpose \nentities used to make Enron's financial condition look better than it \nwas and of partnerships run by Enron's chief financial officer. One \nyear ago today, the press first reported the $1 billion loss in Enron's \nshareholder equity and a $700 million loss in earnings. Less than 2 \nmonths later, Enron's reputation as a well-run company and a good \ninvestment morphed into that of a bankrupt operation with billions in \nunpaid debt.\n  As the scandal unfolded, Enron's employees lost their jobs and their \npensions. Its stockholders lost their shirts. Its accounting firm lost \nits credibility and its ability to operate as an auditor. About the \nonly ones to walk away from Enron's fall intact were a number of \nexecutives who pocketed millions of dollars in compensation despite the \ncompany's collapse. Other executives are now beginning to pay the piper \nfor their misdeeds.\n  Of course, Enron was only the beginning. Within 6 months, the press \nwas inundated with reports of multi-billion-dollar accounting frauds at \nother major publicly traded corporations in the United States. We \nlearned that Worldcom had misreported $3 billion in expenses, a figure \nwhich has since doubled to more than $7 billion. We learned that \nAdelphia had made billions of dollars in unsecured loans to corporate \ninsiders, especially members of the Rigas family. We learned that Tyco \nhad made not only unreported loans to corporate executives and \ndirectors, but its CEO appears to have cheated on his taxes. The list \nof companies associated with accounting frauds or other corporate \nmisconduct kept increasing, shaking not only Wall Street, but also Main \nStreet where more than half of U.S. households are directly or \nindirectly invested in the stock market.\n  The result is that, today, investor confidence in U.S. financial \nstatements and the U.S. accounting profession lies in tatters. The \nstock market itself has compiled its worst record in years.\n  The breadth and depth of this corporate misconduct galvanized \nCongress. Over the past year, we conducted detailed investigations into \nwhat happened. We subpoenaed documents. We held hearings. We issued \nreports. And during the summer, we enacted into law the Sarbanes-Oxley \nAct, a corporate reform law which calls for a host of changes in the \nway U.S. business operates, including overhauling accounting oversight, \nrestoring auditor integrity, and strengthening investor protections. \nThis legislation was a strong response to the corporate scandals, but \nthe work is far from over.\n  Enron's 1-year anniversary is a good time to recall what still needs \nto be done.\n  First, the SEC needs to implement the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The most \nimportant next step here is naming the members of the new Public \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board. This Board is charged with \nstrengthening auditor ethics, disciplinary proceedings, and conflict of \ninterest prohibitions to restore confidence in the U.S. accounting \nprofession. This work will require a frank acknowledgment of past \nproblems, a fresh examination of what works and what has failed, and a \nwillingness to break from past practice to increase investor \nprotections.\n  Some impressive candidates have stepped forward to express their \nwillingness to serve on this board. One terrific candidate is John H. \nBiggs who is about to retire from his post as chairman and CEO of TIAA-\nCREF. Mr. Biggs has the stature, expertise, and backbone needed to lead \nthis board. He is the right man at the right moment to restore \nintegrity to U.S. financial statements and the U.S. accounting \nprofession, and the SEC ought to immediately accept his offer to serve \nthe public as a member of this important new board.\n  The SEC also has a host of important regulations to issue over the \ncoming year--a task that will require continued congressional \noversight. One of the most important is the requirement that companies \ndisclose all material off-the-books transactions, arrangements, \nobligations and relationships. While the Financial Accounting Standards \nBoard, or FASB, has issued a proposal to strengthen accounting rules \nregarding special purpose entities, that addresses only a portion of \nthe problem and the SEC can and must do much more to strengthen \ndisclosure.\n  The SEC must also set up the policies and procedures necessary to \nidentify and administratively bar those persons who are substantially \nunfit to serve as officers or directors of public companies. Too many \nofficers and directors have turned their eyes away from misconduct, \nfailed to ask tough questions, or allowed fraudulent or questionable \nactivities to continue unchecked at the companies that are now the \nsubject of legal proceedings. We need stronger leadership in corporate \nAmerica and to eliminate those unwilling or unable to act as \nfiduciaries for investors.\n  These are just two of the many pressing regulatory issues facing the \nSEC in implementing the Sarbanes-Oxley reform law. But it will take \nmore than Sarbanes-Oxley to end corporate misconduct and restore \ninvestor confidence in U.S. markets. The list of unfinished business \nincludes at least the following items.\n  First, Congress needs to recognize that the SEC is outgunned and \noutspent and give the SEC the resources it needs to police financial \nstatements and detect and punish corporate misdeeds.\n  Second, we need to give the SEC new civil enforcement authority to \nimpose administrative fines on company officers, directors, auditors, \nlawyers, and others who violate federal securities laws. Right now, the \nonly wrongdoers the SEC can fine in administrative proceedings are \nbroker-dealers and investment advisers. My amendment to broaden its \nauthority to fine other violators of the securities laws never received \na vote during consideration of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. I intend to keep \ntrying until that vote takes place.\n  Another festering problem involves stock options. Stock option abuses \nhave not stopped, and dishonest accounting of stock option expenses \ncontinues. That means that Congress still needs to set a deadline for \nFASB to take appropriate action on the issue of expensing stock \noptions. Over 120 publicly traded companies have announced their \nintention--on a voluntary basis--to begin expensing options. That is a \nhuge and welcome change from past practice. But many other public \ncompanies have indicated they have no intention of expensing options \nuntil required to do so. It is time to level the playing field in favor \nof honest accounting of stock options.\n  Still another continuing problem involves so-called corporate \ninversions, when U.S. companies pretend to move their headquarters to \nan offshore tax haven in order to avoid paying their fair share of \ntaxes. These offshore shenanigans are not only unpatriotic, they are \nunfair to the taxpayers who have to\n\n[[Page S10564]]\n\npick up the slack and pay for this country's military, security, law \nenforcement, and other needs, many of which benefit the companies \navoiding their fair share of taxes. I plan to spend a significant \namount of time over the next year looking at issues related to offshore \ntax evasion and corporate nonpayment of tax.\n  A few years ago, this country had billions of dollars in surplus and \na growing economy. But that is over. One contributing cause is the \ncorporate scandals over the last year. Those arguing for tepid reforms \nor the status quo will not provide the leadership needed to end the \ncorporate misconduct and investor fears now plaguing U.S. markets. We \nneed not only to complete the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley law, \nbut also to move ahead with additional measures needed to restore \ninvestor faith in U.S. business. The one-year anniversary of the Enron \nscandal is a good time to renew the call for that unfinished business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10564-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 15, \n2001 in San Francisco, CA.

Mr. President, I want to add my voice to the growing \nchorus in Washington condemning the State Peace and Development \nCouncil's brutal and inhumane treatment of the people of Burma--\nincluding refugees and internally displaced persons.\n  We recently heard from the senior Senator from Kentucky, Senator \nMcConnell, who has been a consistent, strong voice for human rights and \ndemocracy in Burma. He spoke of the many abuses committed by the SPDC \nand his concerns that the SPDC's proclaimed interest for reconciliation \nwith the legitimate leaders of Burma--led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and \nthe National League for Democracy--ring hollow.\n  I am in complete agreement with his assessment.\n  It is past time for the SPDC and its armed forces to respect the \nhuman rights and dignity of the people of Burma and to punish those in \nthe military who are responsible for killing and injuring innocent men, \nwomen and children.\n  I was appalled to learn this week that Burma Army Column Commander \nKhin Mau Kyi, who is reportedly responsible for burning churches and \nvillages and torturing pastors and Buddhist monks, said. ``I don't \nrespect any religion, my religion is the trigger of my gun.''\n  Mr. President, Khin Mau Kyi's so-called ``religion'' is, according to \ninformation I have received, responsible for the murder of the \nfollowing people at Htee Law Belh on April 28, 2002: Saw Hto Paw, Naw \nHsar Kay, Naw Kri Htoo, Naw Ble Po, 5 years old, Daw Htwe Ye, Naw Mu \nTha, Mu Pwat Pwat, 7 year old, Saw Ka Pru Moo, Naw Plah, 5 years old, \nNaw Dah Baw 2 years old, and Naw Pi Lay and her infant.\n  The State Department should publicly condemn the SPDC for these \natrocities, and call on the SPDC to investigate these crimes and bring \nthose responsible to justice. Unfortunately, there is no reason to \nbelieve the SPDC will act against its own officers.\n  We and the international community should do our utmost to provide \nassistance to the SPDC's victims. In the days to come, I will confer \nwith my friend from Kentucky on appropriate actions we can take to help \nrefugees and internally displaced persons in Burma, including \nengagement with Thailand to ensure that Burmese fleeing SPDC abuses can \nenter into Thailand, that international journalists are given free and \nunfettered access to refugee camps and ethnic minorities, and the UN \nHigh Commissioner For Refugees is allowed to provide a safe haven for \nthose fleeing SPDC oppression.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10564-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE TUSKEGEE AIRMEN 17TH ANNUAL SALUTE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this weekend hundreds of individuals from \nthroughout the Nation will be gathering in my hometown of Detroit, MI, \nto honor, remember, and pay tribute to one of the most illustrious and \nfeared U.S. Army units in the Second World War, the Tuskegee Airmen. \nThese individuals will be gathering for the Tuskegee Airmen National \nHistorical Museum's 17th Annual Salute Reception and Dinner.\n  The story of the Tuskegee Airmen is unique in many ways but starts \nwith similarities to the story of so many members of the ``Greatest \nGeneration'' who fought in the Second World War. It is a story of young \nmen who answered the call of duty and fought to defend our Nation with \ncourage, pride, and zeal against the forces of tyranny and oppression. \nThese men have earned our Nation's enduring respect for their actions \nand deeds in defense of the United States.\n  But of course their story is also unique. In addition to being one of \nthe most successful air combat units in the Second World War, the \nTuskegee Airmen, whose pilots trained at the Tuskegee Army Air Field in \nTuskegee, AL, overcame a pattern of rigid segregation and prejudice \nthat questioned their ability to serve as Airmen and prevented them \nfrom training and working with their white counterparts.\n  Led by the recently departed General Benjamin O. Davis, the first \nblack general in the Air Force, the Tuskegee Airmen flew over 15,500 \nsorties, completed over 1,500 combat missions, and downed over 260 \nenemy aircraft. They even sunk an enemy destroyer. Amazingly, no bomber \nescorted by the Tuskegee Airmen was ever downed. But 66 Tuskegee pilots \nflying escort did make the supreme sacrifice for our Nation and another \n32 were taken as prisoners of war. Collectively, these actions won the \nTuskegee Airmen 3 Presidential Citations, 95 distinguished Flying \nCrosses, 8 Purple Hearts and 14 Bronze Stars.\n  Upon returning home from war, these Airmen found a society still \ndeeply segregated. The Tuskegee Airmen themselves remained segregated \nfrom the larger military and were unable to provide their skills and \naptitude to other units that were in dire need of qualified airmen. It \nwas not until President Truman issued Executive Order 9981 that \nsegregation was ended in the United States Armed Services. This \nExecutive Order played a vital role in the subsequent integration of \nour Nation. The valor and dedication of the Tuskegee Airmen played a \nvital role in changing our Nation's attitude toward integration and \nracial diversity.\n  In recent years, our Nation has rightly sought to honor those who \nserved in the Second World War and to recognize the challenges faced \nand overcome by the Tuskegee Airmen. I know my Senate colleagues join \nme in commending the Tuskegee Airmen for their willingness, to \nparaphrase Philip Handleman, an aviation historian from Oakland County, \nMI, to fight two wars at the same time: one war against the forces of \ntotalitarianism abroad and the other against the forces of intolerance \nand prejudice at home, and to have the determination to win them both.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10564-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10564-S10565]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE ALL-CALIFORNIA WORLD SERIES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend and \ncongratulate the two teams from California who will compete for the \n2002 World Series Championship: the National League Champion San \nFrancisco Giants, and the American League Champion Anaheim Angels.\n\n[[Page S10565]]\n\n  This will be the fourth All-California World Series--following the \n1974 and 1988 Los Angeles Dodgers-Oakland Athletics match-ups and the \n1989 ``Bay Bridge Series'' between the Giants and the Athletics--and I \nam confident it will go down in history as one of the best.\n  Both teams have beaten the odds and overcome huge obstacles to \nadvance to the fall classic. In fact, this will be the first World \nSeries between two wild-card teams.\n  My hometown team, the Giants, won the National League Wild Card with \na 95 and 66 record, edging another California team, the Los Angeles \nDodgers, by 3\\1/2\\ games. They then defeated the heavily favored \nAtlanta Braves in the National League Divisional Series 3 games to 2, \nbefore finishing off a tough and determined St. Louis Cardinals team 4 \ngames to 1, to win their third National League Pennant since moving to \nSan Francisco in 1958.\n  The Anaheim Angels overcame a 6 and 14 start to win the American \nLeague Wild Card with a 99 and 63 record, just 4 games behind yet \nanother California team, the Oakland Athletics. They upset the New York \nYankees in the American League Divisional Series 3 games to 1 and \ndefeated the Minnesota Twins 4 games to 1, to win the first American \nLeague Pennant in the 42-year history of the Angels organization. I \nonly wish Gene Autry had lived to see his beloved team succeed with \nsuch brilliance.\n  The Giants and Angels epitomize the word ``team.'' Each has its share \nof All-Stars, but they have advanced to the final round because of the \ndedication and hard work of each player.\n  Everyone knows the Giants are led by four-time National League Most \nValuable Player, newest member of the 600 Home Run club and 2002 \nNational League Batting Champion, Barry Bonds. But Barry would be the \nfirst to say that the Giants would not be where they are without the \ncontributions of players such as National League Championship Series \nMost Valuable Player Benito Santiago, David Bell, Jeff Kent, J.T. Snow, \nand pitchers Russ Ortiz, Jason Schmidt, Kirk Rueter and Rob Nenn. The \nlist goes on.\n  And, what Giants fan will ever forget Kenny Lofton, a center-fielder \nacquired in a mid-season trade, who drove in the winning run in game 5 \nof the National League Championship Series with a two-out base-hit?\n  The Angels got to the World Series by hitting .320 as a team in the \npostseason and scoring 60 runs in 9 games. They are led by David \nEckstein, Garret Anderson, Troy Glaus, Tim Salmon, and pitchers Troy \nPercival, Jarrod Washburn, and 20-year-old rookie, Felix Rodriguez.\n  American League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Adam Kennedy \nmade history by becoming only the fifth player--following the likes of \nHall of Famers Babe Ruth, Reggie Jackson, and George Brett--to hit \nthree home runs in a playoff game in the deciding game 5 of the \nAmerican League Championship Series.\n  Every great team has a great manager and the Giants and the Angels \nhave two of the best: three-time National League Manager of the Year \nDusty Baker and Mike Scioscia, who has led the Angels to a World Series \nin only his third year as manager. Former teammates on the Los Angeles \nDodgers, both set high standards for their teams, stuck with them \nthrough thick and thin, and provided the leadership for success.\n  Finally I want to pay tribute to the front office staffs of both \norganizations: President and managing partner Peter Magowan, executive \nvice-president and chief operating officer Larry Baer, and general \nmanager Brian Sabean of the Giants and chairman and CEO of the Walt \nDisney Company Michael Eisner and general manager Bill Stoneman of the \nAngels. Not only have they built championship franchises, but they have \nestablished the Giants and Angels as class organizations.\n  Normally, the Senators from the States of the teams represented in \nthe World Series place a friendly wager on the outcome. This year, \nSenator Boxer and I will simply take pleasure in watching two \nCalifornia teams battle for the title.\n  From Edison Field to Pacific Bell Park, each game will showcase a \ndifferent part of California and the great fans of both teams. The \nGiants and the Angels have done California proud and may the best team \nwin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10565-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10565-S10566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                THE ROMA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the situation of the Roma \npeople in Serbia and Montenegro, which together make up the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia, FRY.\n  I am among those who believe that the United States should continue \nto strongly support the development of democratic institutions and \nreconciliation among ethnic groups throughout the FRY and Senator \nMcConnell and I have tried to do that in the fiscal year 2003 Foreign \nOperations spending bill.\n  As in the past, we have provided funds to support democratic \nreformers in the FRY, as they continue to work to overcome the hatred \nand destruction caused by Slobodan Milosevic.\n  The United States is dedicated to ensuring that Serbia develops a \nsolid commitment to peace, the rule of law, and to protecting the \nrights and well-being of its minority communities. That is why the \nfunding level for Serbia--and indeed throughout the Balkans--\nrecommended by the Committee on Appropriations is above what the \nPresident requested in his Fiscal Year 2003 budget.\n  Our law requires that the President certify to the Committee on \nAppropriations that the FRY is continuing to cooperate with the War \nCrimes Tribunal. He must also certify that the FRY is implementing \npolicies which reflect a commitment to the rule of law, a commitment to \nend support for separate Republika Srpska institutions, and a \ncommitment to ensure and protect the rights of minority groups.\n  Progress toward those goals has been made. But it has been slow, and \nthe FRY has an inconsistent record of compliance with our law.\n  I recognize that the process of reform is difficult. Breaking down \nold hatreds can take generations. I have been very disappointed that \neven the reformers in positions of authority have not done more to \nsupport the Tribunal, and to expose the truth about Milosevic's crimes. \nHowever, even their inconsistent efforts are resisted at every turn by \npowerful nationalists who are far less committed to justice.\n  That political dynamic is the cause of much friction within the FRY, \nand is the cause of continuing difficulties between Serbia and the \ninternational community.\n  It is my hope, and I think I speak for everyone here, that the \nBalkans will eventually become a stable, peaceful, and tolerant region \nin which Serbia is the leading force for trade and democracy. Such a \nhope will become a reality only if our commitment to it remains strong.\n  As the world's attention has shifted toward Afghanistan and a \npossible war with Iraq, it is important that our concerns for the FRY \nare not drowned out by events elsewhere.\n  In addition to ensuring FRY compliance with the Tribunal, there is \nstill serious work to be done on behalf of minority groups there.\n  In particular, a higher level of attention must be focused on the \nplight of the Roma people, whose history is one of discrimination and \nsuffering.\n  The Roma are an ethnic group that traces their heritage back about \none thousand years to the north of India. They first settled in Eastern \nEurope in the 14th Century. Today, Roma reside in all parts of Europe.\n  Over the centuries, the Roma have been the victims of murderous \nviolence and debilitating discrimination that has poisoned their \nrelations with their host nations, stunted their growth as a community, \nand perpetuated a vicious cycle of poverty, unemployment, sickness, and \nevery form of social ostracism.\n  It is a cycle that has sentenced the Roma to shorter lives, lower \nliteracy rates, and often horrid living conditions--living conditions \nthat are far below those of the general populations of their host \nnations.\n  I read in a recent publication that in England, during the time of \nElizabeth I, there was a law which made it illegal to be a Roma person, \nand under that law one could be put to death simply for being born to \nRoma parents. Also during that time, in Switzerland, it was legal to \nhunt Roma for sport.\n\n  During the Second World War, the Roma were among the first ethnic \ngroups targeted for eradication by Hitler. Until the 1970s, in other \nparts of\n\n[[Page S10566]]\n\nEurope, policies have resulted in separating Romani children from their \nparents so they could be raised by non-Roma families.\n  The last decade has been no kinder to the Roma. During the Balkan \nwars of the 1990s, the Roma were severely victimized. And the abuse of \nthe Roma continues now during peacetime.\n  The FRY has officially registered the Roma as a minority group, and \nhas mandated that more Romani language programs appear on state \ntelevision. These are important steps and are to be commended.\n  Much progress toward equitable and lawful treatment of the Roma, \nhowever, is yet to be made by the FRY, where the Roma are reportedly \nsubject to frequent police brutality.\n  They often live in illegal settlements on the outskirts of towns, \nwithout electricity, running water, or sanitation.\n  International nongovernmental organizations willing to assist the \nRoma in constructing more permanent housing have been forced to cancel \ntheir projects, because the FRY and local authorities denied them the \nnecessary land.\n  Roma in the FRY are also the targets of humiliating social \ndiscrimination. They are frequently denied access to privately owned \nrestaurants and sports facilities. Roma do not receive adequate \neducation, health care, or equitable access to public goods and \nservices. In many FRY communities they are treated as a public \nnuisance.\n  Very little effort is made by state prosecutors to pursue cases of \ndiscrimination against Roma in the courts, partially due to widespread \napathy for the Roma and partially because of weak legislation \nprotecting the rights of minorities.\n  The Roma experience is one of suffering. Their's is a life of \nwaiting, and one of hope lost as the tide of history threatens to sweep \nthem aside.\n  As with its cooperation with the Hague Tribunal, the FRY's respect \nfor the rights of the Roma must be closely monitored and verified. The \nPresident's certification to the Committee on Appropriations concerning \nfunds appropriated for the FY should address both issues.\n  Continuing progress by the FRY in ensuring the safety and dignity of \nall its citizens, including the Roma, is the intent of our law and \nessential to the future stability of the former Yugoslavia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10566-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CAB CALLOWAY SCHOOL OF THE ARTS\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we often talk about how best to \nencourage the talents of our young citizens. In my home town of \nWilmington, DE, there is a school that fulfills that mission literally, \nand with great success--the Cab Calloway School of the Arts, which will \ncelebrate its 10th anniversary at a ceremony on Friday, November 22, \n2002.\n  Cab Calloway students have performed in prestigious venues from New \nYork City to Washington, DC. Our colleague, Senator Clinton, has been \nin their audience, as have Secretary of State Powell and members of the \nNational Governors Association. They have earned recognition in the \nNational Shakespeare Competition, the Delaware Theatre Company's Young \nPlaywright's Festival, and various vocal and band competitions.\n  In the visual arts, Cab Calloway students have won repeatedly in \nDelaware's Youth in Art Month Flag Competition, and their work has been \nincluded in the Delaware Foundation for the Visual Arts Calendar. When \nartists were invited to decorate downtown Wilmington with dinosaurs \nthis past spring, a Cab Calloway student designed and made sculpture \nwas in the display. Visual arts students have also worked with the \nMarch of Dimes to create educational materials, and they have been \nhonored with Regional Scholastic Art Awards.\n  That would be impressive as the whole story, but it is just one \nchapter. Cab Calloway students have excelled academically, earning as \nmany honors for their work in the classroom as for their talents on the \nstage or in the studio. The school has been recognized for its \ninnovative programs, and it proudly boasts the best attendance record \namong all secondary schools in the district.\n  For a decade, Cab Calloway has given many of our State's most \ntalented young citizens a chance to excel as student-artists. It is a \ntrue success story in public education, and we in Delaware are very \nproud to congratulate the administration, faculty, students and their \nfamilies, as we all join to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Cab \nCalloway School of the Arts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10566-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RANDY ATCHER\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today among my fellow \ncolleagues to honor and pay tribute to one of Kentucky' finest \nindividuals. Last Wednesday, at the age of 83, Randy Atcher passed away \nin his bed at the Audubon Hospital in Louisville, KY. He had been \nsuffering from lung cancer for many years. He will be missed and \nmourned by all.\n  Randy Atcher was born in Tip Top, KY in 1918 and from very early on, \npeople could see that he was headed for big things. Randy grew up in a \nfamily of entertainers and musicians. His father played the fiddle, his \nmother the piano, his brother Bob the mandolin, his brother Raymond the \nbass and finally his brother Francis played the guitar. At age 13, \nRandy and his brother Bob were playing their catchy country tunes for \nWLAP radio in Louisville. Before Randy was even out of high school, he \nand Bob had a successful morning show on WHAS radio which aired from 8 \nto 8:15 Monday through Friday. He always finished the show with just \nenough time to beat the bell for his first class.\n  After graduating from high school, Randy and Bob hit the road \nrunning, showcasing their musical talents all across the Commonwealth. \nHowever, this seemingly endless road adventure came to an abrupt halt \nwhen, in 1941, the Japanese maliciously and without warning bombed \nPearl Harbor. Shortly thereafter, Randy joined the Army Air Corps, \nserving in such places as Australia, the Philippines and Okinanwa. \nWhile in the South Pacific, Randy purchased a guitar and played his \ntunes for his fellow soldiers, bringing a little happiness and laughter \ninto a very dark and frightening place and time.\n  After the war ended, Randy picked up right where he left off in 1941. \nHe traveled around the country and worked for radio stations in places \nlike Chicago. In 1946, Randy returned to Louisville and remained there \nfor the rest of his days.\n  Randy Atcher's big break came in 1950 when his old friends at WHAS \ncame to him with an idea for a daily TV show for Kentucky's children. \nThe show, T-Bar-V, was an instant success and was on the air from March \n28, 1950 until June 26, 1970. Many Kentucky children grew up watching \nthis show and learning from the lessons it taught. In many ways, Randy \nAtcher became an integral part of many Kentucky families. He taught the \nchildren to save their money and to respect their elders. His warmth \nand sincerity were felt by all that tuned in. Throughout its 20 years \non television, T-Bar-V celebrated 153,000 children's birthdays. When \nthe show ended, many children felt as if they had lost their best \nfriend.\n  Even after the show ended however, Randy couldn't keep the performer \nin him quiet. He sang his songs and entertained children at schools and \nthe elderly at nursing homes. He was on the board of the Muscular \nDystrophy Association and the Dream Factory, a group that grants the \nwishes of gravely ill children. He also recorded books on tape for the \nblind.\n  I ask that my fellow colleagues join me in honoring Randy Atcher. He \ndevoted his entire life to bringing happiness to the lives of others. \nHe represented a code of morality that seems almost lost today. I \nbelieve we all can learn from his example of caring for and serving \nothers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10566-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10566-S10567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO THE HON.

Martinez, \nDeputy Majority Leader of the Connecticut General Assembly, who lost \nhis life on October 10 in a tragic automobile accident. Mr. Martinez \nserved New Haven's 95th Assembly District where he served on the\n\n[[Page S10567]]\n\nFinance, Revenue & Bonding Committee and the Judiciary Committee. He \nleaves behind a career of compassionate public service, particularly to \nthe underprivileged.\n  Mr. Martinez was born in 1953 in the City of New York to Puerto Rican \nparents. His family has resided in the City of New Haven for 39 years.\n  From 1991 to 1997, Mr. Martinez developed and served as Project \nDirector of the Hill Health Center/Grant Street Partnership, a \nSubstance Abuse Intensive Day Treatment Program for women and men.\n  Mr. Martinez worked for 15 years with the homeless and substance \nabusing population. He was very active on both local and state-wide \nlevel community service boards and commission, including the Community \nAction Agency in New Haven, LULAC Headstart, Community Partners In \nAction, Latino Youth, Inc., New Haven Parking Authority Commission and \nChildren Center in Hamden.\n  Mr. Martinez was also President of the National Hispanic Caucus of \nState Legislators, and a member of the Council of State Governments/\nERC, the National Criminal Justice Task Force/CSG, the Fighting Back \nTreatment Intervention Committee and the Connecticut Hispanic Addiction \nCommission, CHAC.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with the Martinez family, and the people \nof Connecticut, who will all feel this great loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10567-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO DOTTY VATTES ON HER RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Dorothy Vattes upon her retirement from service with the \nFederal Government.\n  Dotty has been a member of my staff for 18 years as a senior \ncaseworker and immigration specialist. She has been a trusted friend \nand outstanding employee. She is committed to the people of New \nHampshire, and has helped hundreds of citizens with problems they may \nhave had with the Federal Government. She has helped re-unite families, \nhelped seniors receive the benefits they deserve, and has exhibited \ntireless devotion to serving the people.\n  Dorothy Burnham Vattes, was born in Manchester, NH. She has been \nmarried for 41 years to John, also a good friend. They have four \nchildren, Wendy, Lori, Mark and Shane. I have seen her children grow \ninto wonderful, responsible, adults--most of them also work in \nGovernment service. Her son Mark, who also works on my staff, and his \nwife Kathy, gave Dotty her greatest joy last year--a grandson, \nBenjamin.\n  Dotty began work in the 1960s, which was followed by a career as a \nlegal secretary. She stayed at home to raise her family for 7 years, \nbut returned to work in a law firm until 1981 when she began her career \nin public service. She worked for Senator Gordon Humphrey, who held \nthis seat before me, and then came to work for my office when I was \nelected to the House in 1984.\n  Dotty's retirement will enable her to spend the time doing what she \nenjoys: traveling, crafts, and community activities like the Manchester \nFederated Republican Women's Club and the National Association of \nRetired Federal Employees, NARFE. She and her husband will spend \nwinters at their home in Florida, and summers back in New Hampshire.\n  Dotty's service to the people of New Hampshire will be missed by all \nof those whose lives she touched. Her commitment, devotion, and the \nspecial way in which she helped so many, will not be forgotten. I \ncommend her on her years of service, and her excellence as a valuable \nmember of my staff. Best wishes, Dotty, for a wonderful \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10567-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR CRAIG THOMAS\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Craig Thomas, who this weekend will be \nhonored with the Distinguished Alumni Award from his alma mater, the \nUniversity of Wyoming. I know how much Craig loves the Cowboys and the \nUniversity, so this is a special honor indeed, and one all of us are \nproud that he has achieved. Senator Thomas graduated from the UW in \n1954 with a Bachelors degree in Agriculture.\n  As a student from Wapiti, WY, Senator Thomas wanted to pursue a \ncareer as a veterinarian, but his 4-H experience steered him toward \nanimal production. Aside from his studies, he also took an interest in \nwrestling, and as I understand it he was even good enough to earn a \nwrestling scholarship. If you ask him, he will tell you that his \nparticipation on the UW wrestling team was one of the biggest \ninfluences during his college career and that it taught him discipline \nand sportsmanship. There's no doubt it gave him a strong will to \nsucceed.\n  Ultimately, it was those special years as a University of Wyoming \nCowboy, or Pokes as we call them, that helped shape the life of the man \nwho has served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and is \nnow in his second term in the U.S. Senate. Despite his busy schedule, \nCraig continues to give his time and energy to the university, serving \nseveral terms on the College of Agriculture's Advisory Board and \nearning an Outstanding Alumni Award in 1995.\n  This is not the first time my friend has been recognized for his \ndedication to community and learning. After serving two years as \npresident of the Wyoming State 4-H Foundation, and serving on its board \nfor 10 years, Craig was inducted in April into the National 4-H Hall of \nFame. This past August, he took first place at the State Fair during an \nhonorary 4-H steer showmanship class, and he always is a welcome face \nfor 4-H participants who come to Washington, DC, for the national \ntrips. These awards are a testament to his deep roots and the \nconnection he still has to our great state and the people who make it \nwork.\n  I believe the University of Wyoming selected an exemplary recipient \nfor this award and I know he is both humbled and proud for the \nrecognition. Craig is being honored not only because of what he did at \nUW, but for what he continues to do, he is a forceful advocate for the \nUniversity here in Washington. The benefits of his labor on their \nbehalf can be seen everywhere around campus.\n  Let me again say congratulations to my colleague and also to the \nUniversity for recognizing someone so deserving of the distinguished \nAlumni Award. Craig, your hard work and dedication to the University of \nWyoming have not gone unnoticed. Your on-going legacy will continue to \nbe felt by many students and graduates to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10567-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10567-S10568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNITION OF ROBERT PORE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Before coming to Huron, Robert worked a variety of \npositions for several newspapers. He was a regional editor for the \nMcCook Daily Gazette in McCook, NE for three years; managing editor for \nthe Hope, Arkansas newspaper; regional director editor of the Le Mars \nDaily Sentinel in Le Mars, IA; and publisher of the Hillsboro Banner in \nHillsboro, ND. He will be ending his South Dakota career on Friday, \nOctober 18 after 10 years as the lead agriculture reporter for the \nHuron Daily Plainsman.\n  Robert earned the respect and admiration of all those who had the \nopportunity to work with him. His love for South Dakota and passion for \nagriculture set him apart from other outstanding agriculture reporters \nin the state. Robert's friendly demeanor and wealth of knowledge helped \nhim develop close relationships with various agriculture groups and \nstate and federal officials. These relationships allowed Robert unique \ninsight and access to news affecting South Dakota's agriculture \ncommunity.\n  Robert and his wife Bette, a former editor at the Huron Daily \nPlainsman, will be greatly missed by the people of Huron for their \nyears of valuable community service. On the occasion of his retirement, \nI want to congratulate Robert Pore for his tireless dedication to the \nHuron Daily Plainsman and commitment to quality journalism. The lives \nof countless people have been enormously enhanced by Robert's skilled \nreporting. His achievements will serve as a model for other talented\n\n[[Page S10568]]\n\nreporters throughout our state to emulate.\n  I wish Robert Pore the best on all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10568-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN RECOGNITION OF ERICA AND SAMUEL BRASHER\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

Erica \nBrasher, who is 15, and Samuel Brasher, who is 12, spent 2 weeks in \nWashington and Northern Virginia traveling to the many historical sites \nlocated throughout the area. Most importantly, they were chosen for the \nhonor of raising the flag at Mount Vernon on the Fourth of July. For \nthis distinction, they received special citations which commemorated \nthe annual celebration. Erica and Samuel Brasher's trip also included \nvisits to Williamsburg, Harper's Ferry, and the many museums and \nmonuments located in Washington, D.C. Upon their return home, a \nterrific account of Erica and Samuel's trip was written in their local \nnewspaper, the Shelby County Reporter.\n  Erica and Samuel Brasher are both grandchildren of Howard and Pattie \nBrasher of Shelby County. Samuel is also the grandson of Tom and \nChestine Cardin of Columbiana. Erica is also the granddaughter of \nCorinne Williams and the late Bob Williams of Shelby and the daughter \nof the late Martha Williams-Brasher.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to an \n     independent review and analysis of generic drugs; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 293\n\n       Whereas, the United States Food and Drug Administration \n     (FDA) is a vital agency responsible for ensuring safety in \n     foods and medicines. The work it undertakes has a direct \n     impact on each citizen. The FDA oversees the approval of \n     drugs for the market and provides information to the health \n     care network; and\n       Whereas, a key component of our health care resources is \n     the availability of generic drugs, which can offer a less \n     costly means of treatment. The use of this option, however, \n     is only as good as the level of assurance that a generic drug \n     is as safe as possible. The FDA considers generic drugs \n     submitted for approval through its Office of Generic Drugs; \n     and\n       Whereas, in spite of repeated assurances from the FDA and \n     pharmaceutical companies that generic drugs are safe and are \n     identical in the ingredients to their brand-name \n     counterparts, there have been concerns over the safety of \n     some generic drugs. Any concern must be investigated \n     thoroughly to ensure that all standards of ingredients, \n     preparation, and packaging are met. We must do all we can to \n     ensure the highest standards for all prescription \n     medications. Most importantly, there can be no doubt that the \n     review of submitted medications is completely unaffected by \n     criteria other than scientific evidence and the impact of the \n     drugs in question on patients. Citizens as well as health \n     care providers must have faith in the independence and \n     reliability of all tests and determinations; Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States and the Food \n     and Drug Administration to provide for an independent review \n     and analysis of generic drugs submitted for approval; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the Food and Drug \n     Administration.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-355. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to \n     Medicare home health benefits and home health providers; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 576\n\n       Whereas, there are 321 Medicare-certified agencies in \n     Pennsylvania providing critical care each year in the homes \n     of nearly half a million Pennsylvanians; and\n       Whereas, home health patients receiving Medicare services \n     are typically the sickest, frailest and most vulnerable of \n     Pennsylvania's elderly population; and\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States in 1997 sought \n     to cut growth in the Medicare home health benefit by $16.2 \n     billion over five years but resulted in cutting more than $72 \n     billion; and\n       Whereas, nearly one million fewer Medicare beneficiaries \n     qualify for Medicare-reimbursed home care than in 1997; and\n       Whereas, additional cuts in the Medicare home health \n     benefit would force many low-cost, efficient agencies in \n     Pennsylvania which are struggling under the current system to \n     go out of business, thereby harming access to Medicare \n     beneficiaries; and\n       Whereas, total elimination of the 15% cut has been \n     postponed for the past two years; and\n       Whereas, the impending 15% cut is making it difficult for \n     home health agencies to secure lines of credit and is \n     discouraging investment in advanced technologies and staff \n     benefits; and\n       Whereas, sixty-five members of the United States Senate \n     have joined in a bipartisan letter that recommends the \n     elimination of the 15% cut; and\n       Whereas, one hundred thirteen members of the United States \n     House of Representatives have joined in a bipartisan letter \n     that recommends the elimination of the 15% cut; and\n       Whereas, the Budget Committee of the United States Senate \n     has voted to set aside the funds necessary to do away with \n     the 15% cut; and\n       Whereas, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), \n     the group established by the Congress to advise on Medicare \n     policy, has called upon the Congress to permanently eliminate \n     the 15% cut in the Medicare home health benefit; and\n       Whereas, MedPAC has reported that there are three factors \n     that can lead to a cost increase for rural home health \n     providers; travel, volume of services and lack of \n     sophisticated management and patient care procedures; and\n       Whereas, Medicare home health services are delivered to a \n     large rural population in Pennsylvania which often lives \n     miles apart, increasing the cost of providing home health \n     services: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the Congress to permanently \n     eliminate the 15% cut in the Medicare home health benefit AND \n     EXTEND THE 10% RURAL ADD-ON TO MEDICARE HOME HEALTH \n     PROVIDERS; And be it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representative urge the \n     President to support the Congress in eliminating the 15% cut \n     in the Medicare home health benefit AND EXTEND THE 10% RURAL \n     ADD-ON TO MEDICARE HOME HEALTH PROVIDERS; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the Vice President of the \n     United States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-356. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of California relative to home health care; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 49\n\n       Whereas, California's home health care industry has \n     suffered a loss of over one-third of licensed home health \n     agencies since 1998; and\n\n[[Page S10570]]\n\n       Whereas, the Medicare home health care benefit started in \n     1966 and has provided Medicare home health care insurance \n     coverage to hundreds of thousands of homebound Medicare \n     beneficiaries who need care on a part-time or intermittent \n     basis; and\n       Whereas, Medicare home health care users are older, sicker, \n     poorer, and more disabled than the Medicare population \n     generally, with 26 percent over 85 years of age; and\n       Whereas, in 1980, Congress changed the home health care \n     benefit by expanding access to care for beneficiaries without \n     a prior hospitalization and by eliminating visit limits; and\n       Whereas, in 1981 restrictive administrative interpretations \n     of part-time or intermittent care limited spending by denying \n     access to this medically fragile population. As a result of \n     the restrictions, a class action lawsuit was filed that \n     resulted in a 1988 ruling that overturned the restrictions. \n     Duggan v. Bowen (D.C. 1988) 691 F. Supp. 1487. As a result, \n     utilization of home health services grew; and\n       Whereas, the growth continued until Congress passed the \n     1997 Balanced Budget Act to restrict spending; and\n       Whereas, an interim payment system (IPS) was implemented in \n     fiscal years 1998-2000 to immediately control spending; and\n       Whereas, the IPS system dramatically reduced reimbursement \n     rates, which fell below 1993 payment limits and resulted in \n     284 closures of California home health care agencies during \n     1998-99; and\n       Whereas, a new system, the prospective payment system \n     (PPS), was implemented to cease the IPS unprecedented \n     reductions in payments; and\n       Whereas, PPS could not correct the 49 percent cut in home \n     health care outlays with further declines expected through \n     2002; and\n       Whereas, during IPS implementation and before PPS, a new \n     national standard patient assessment system, the Outcomes and \n     Assessment Information Set (OASIS), was required for all \n     Medicare providers in 1999 and provided burdensome reporting \n     requirements; and\n       Whereas, the implementation of IPS, PPS, and OASIS \n     collection has resulted in a 36-percent reduction in the \n     number of participating home health care providers, closure \n     of over 340 licensed home health agencies, and reduced access \n     to care for medically fragile Californians; and\n       Whereas, the 1997 Balanced Budget Act has already reduced \n     utilization and home health care spending significantly below \n     the intended savings that were anticipated due to that act; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Congressional Budget Office projected home \n     health expenditure reductions of $16.2 billion over five \n     years (fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 2002), actual \n     reductions from fiscal year 1998 to fiscal year 2000 were \n     $35.8 billion, and current projected reductions for fiscal \n     years 2001 and 2002 are an additional $35.3 billion resulting \n     in $71.1 billion; and\n       Whereas, California is undergoing an anticipated $20 \n     billion budget deficit, which could result in Medi-Cal \n     reducing current reimbursement rates to 2000 levels, \n     resulting in a double rate reduction guaranteed to devastate \n     the 629 Medicare certified home health care agencies \n     operating California; and\n       Whereas, the proposed 15 percent cut in home health care \n     reimbursement rates will negatively affect access to care, \n     and leave thousands without a home health care agency that \n     can service their medical needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California hereby respectfully memorializes the President and \n     the Congress of the United States to enact legislation that \n     contains steps to ensure that Medicare home health care \n     recipients are guaranteed the best care, and that home health \n     providers, who have undergone multiple regulation and \n     administrative changes at the hands of the federal government \n     since the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, are not further harmed; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature opposes the 15 percent cut \n     in home health payments scheduled for October 1, 2002; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the Minority Leader of the House of \n     Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, the \n     Minority Leader of the Senate, to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States, and to the President's commission to eliminate the \n     pending additional 15 percent cut in home health payments \n     scheduled for October 1, 2002.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-357. A resolution adopted by the Legislative of Guam \n     relative to supporting efforts for a Constitutional amendment \n     to limit the authority of the federal court system to \n     appropriate money through judicial orders; to the Committee \n     on Finance.\n\n                         Resolution No. 6 (LS)\n\n       Whereas, concerns among state legislatures across the \n     Nation have been raised relative to incursions by the Federal \n     Judicial Branch into areas are clearly defined as powers of \n     the Legislative Branch of government, more specifically, \n     instance where members of the Federal judiciary have \n     exercised the power to levy or increase taxes; and\n       Whereas, it is incumbent on all Legislative Branches of \n     government, from the U.S. Congress to each state \n     jurisdiction, to insure that the Separation of Powers \n     Doctrine, its spirit, intent and integrity are inviolate; and\n       Whereas, the Judicial Branch of the Federal Government has \n     ignored constitutional restrictions on its powers to levy or \n     increase taxes, a power clearly reserved and limited to the \n     Legislative Branch; and\n       Whereas, the only resolution to this threat to the \n     integrity of and challenge to the Separation of Powers \n     Doctrine, must emanate from the U.S. Congress in the form of \n     a Constitutional amendment: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That I Mina'Bente Sais Na Liheslatuan Guahan does \n     hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, call upon the U.S. \n     Congress to initiate the adoption of an amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States which would more clearly \n     define and state the restriction upon the power of the \n     Judicial Branch of the Federal Government to levy or increase \n     taxes in any manner, means or form; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Mina'Bente Sais Na Liheslaturan Guahan does \n     hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, suggest that the \n     form of the amendment to the United Constitutional shall \n     read: ``Neither the Supreme Court nor any inferior court of \n     the United States shall have the power to instruct or order a \n     state or political subdivision thereof, or any official of \n     such state or political subdivision, to levy or increase \n     taxes''; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Speaker certify, and the Legislative \n     Secretary attests to, the adoption hereof and that copies of \n     the same be thereafter transmitted to the Honorable George W. \n     Bush, President of the United States of America; to the \n     Honorable Richard B.

A bill to ensure that a public safety officer who suffers a \nfatal heart attack or stroke while on duty shall be presumed to have \ndied in the line of duty for purposes of public safety officer survivor \nbenefits; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Jeffords and \nCollins to introduce the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act of \n2002. Our bipartisan legislation will improve the Department of \nJustice's Public Safety Officers' Benefits, PSOB, Program by allowing \nfamilies of public safety officers who suffer fatal heart attacks or \nstrokes to qualify for Federal survivor benefits.\n  Public safety officers are among our most brave and dedicated public \nservants. I applaud the efforts of all members of fire, law \nenforcement, and rescue organizations nationwide who are the first to \nrespond to more than 1.6 million emergency calls annually, whether \nthose calls involve a crime, fire, medical emergency, spill of \nhazardous materials, natural disaster, act of terrorism, or \ntransportation accident, without reservation. They act with an \nunwavering commitment to the safety and protection of their fellow \ncitizens, and are forever willing to selflessly sacrifice their own \nlives to provide safe and reliable emergency services to their \ncommunities. Sadly, this dedication to service can result in tragedy, \nas was evident by the bravery displayed on September 11th.\n  In the days and months since September 11th, I have been particularly \ntouched by the stories of unselfish sacrifices made by scores of New \nYork City first responders who bravely entered the World Trade Center \nthat day with the singular goal of saving lives. More than one hundred \nfirefighters in America lose their lives every year and thousands are \ninjured in the line of duty. While PSOB benefits can never be a \nsubstitute for the loss of a loved one, the families of all our fallen \nheroes deserve to collect these funds.\n  The PSOB Program provides a one-time financial benefit to the \neligible survivors of federal, state, and local public safety officers \nwhose deaths are the direct and proximate result of a traumatic injury \nsustained in the line of duty. Last year, Congress improved the PSOB \nProgram by streamlining the process for families of public safety \nofficers killed or injured in connection with prevention, \ninvestigation, rescue or recovery efforts related to a terrorist \nattack. We also retroactively increased the total benefits available by \n$100,000 as part of the USA PATRIOT Act. The PSOB Program now provides \napproximately $250,000 in benefits to the families of law enforcement \nofficers, firemen, emergency response squad members, and ambulance crew \nmembers who are killed in the line of duty. Unfortunately, the issue of \nincluding heart attack and stroke victims in the PSOB Program was not \naddressed at that time.\n  The PSOB Program does not cover deaths resulting from occupational \nillness or pulmonary or heart disease unless a traumatic injury is a \nsubstantial factor to the death. However, if toxicology reports \ndemonstrate a carbon monoxide level of 10 percent or greater, 15 \npercent or greater for the smoker, at the onset of a heart attack \nbenefits are paid. The PSOB Program has developed a formula that \naddresses oxygen therapy provided to the victim prior to the death.\n  Heart attack and cardiac related deaths account for almost half of \nall firefighter fatalities, between 45-50 deaths, and an average of 13 \npolice officer deaths each year. Yet the families of these fallen \nheroes are rarely eligible to receive PSOB benefits. In January 1978, \nspecial Deputy Sheriff Bernard Demag of the Chittenden County Sheriff's \nOffice suffered a fatal heart attack within two hours of his chase and \napprehension of an escaped juvenile whom he had been transporting. Mr. \nDemag's family spent nearly two decades fighting in court for workers' \ncompensation death benefits all to no avail. Clearly, we should be \ntreating surviving family members with more decency and respect.\n  Public safety is dangerous, exhausting, and stressful work. A first \nresponder's chances of suffering a heart attack or stroke greatly \nincrease when he or she puts on heavy equipment and rushes into a \nburning building to fight a fire and save lives. The families of these \nbrave public servants deserve to participate in the PSOB Program if \ntheir loved ones die of a heart attack or other cardiac related \nailments while selflessly protecting us from harm.\n  First responders across the country now face a new series of \nchallenges as they respond to over 1.6 million emergency calls this \nyear, from responding to fires and hazardous material spills to \nproviding emergency medical services to reacting to weapons of mass \ndestruction. They do this with an unwavering commitment to the safety \nof their fellow citizens, and are forever willing to selflessly \nsacrifice their own lives to protect the lives and property of their \nfellow citizens. It is time for Congress to show its support and \nappreciation for these extraordinarily brave and heroic public safety \nofficers. We should quickly work to pass the Hometown Heroes Survivors \nBenefit Act.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Leahy \nand Collins in introducing the Senate counterpart of the Hometown \nHeroes Survivors Benefits Act of 2002. This legislation closes a gap in \nthe survivor benefits the Federal Government provides to the families \nof public safety officers who die in the line of duty.\n  These public safety officers are the people that keep our streets \nsafe, help to fight fires, and respond to emergency calls. The Federal \nGovernment has rightfully created a one-time financial benefit for the \nfamilies of public safety officers who die in the line of duty to \nrecognize the sacrifice and importance of public safety officers in our \nsociety.\n  Unfortunately, due to a technicality in the law some families of \npublic safety officers that die of a heart attack or stroke are being \ndenied this important financial benefit. This is unacceptable and we \nneed to make sure that we enact this legislation to ensure that the \nfamilies of these public safety officers are covered.\n  Many years ago I was a volunteer firefighter in my small town of \nShrewsbury, VT. It was a very demanding, stressful, and exhausting job. \nEvery year almost half the firefighter fatalities in the United States \nare from heart attack or cardiac related reasons. Not all of these \ndeaths occur while fighting the fire, but are related to their \nunselfish dedication to the task at hand.\n  This legislation would provide that a public safety officer who dies \nas the result of a heart attack or stroke suffered while on duty or \nwithin 24 hours after participating in a training exercise or \nresponding to an emergency situation shall be presumed to have died as \nthe direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the \nline of duty for purposes of survivor benefits. These public safety \nofficers are out there everyday ensuring our safety; Congress needs to \nensure that the surviving families receive this important financial \nbenefit.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in recognizing the heroism and \nsacrifice of public safety officers by co-sponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 3116. A bill to permanently eliminate a procedure under which the \nBureau of alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms\n\n[[Page S10574]]\n\ncan waive prohibitions on the possession of firearms and explosives by \nconvicted felons, drug offenders, and other disqualified individuals; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important gun \ncontrol legislation that would shut down permanently the guns for \nfelons program.\n  For too many years the Federal Government spent millions of dollars a \nyear to restore the gun privileges of convicted felons. Fortunately, \nfor the last ten years, Congress has seen fit to defund the program, \nthrough annual funding restrictions.\n  Congress was right to defund a program that, according to the \nViolence Policy Center, restored gun privileges for thousands of \nconvicted felons, at a cost of millions of dollars to the taxpayer. As \nthe Violence Policy Center demonstrated, a number of these felons went \non to commit violent crimes.\n  I believe strongly that we must do all we can to keep guns out of \ncriminals' hands. I am pleased that every year Congress has renewed the \nfunding ban, which prohibits ATF from processing firearms applications \nfrom convicted felons. Indeed, by introducing this legislation today, I \ndo not in any way intend to imply that the annual funding bans are not \nsufficient to shut down the guns for felons program.\n  Today the Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a case that could \njeopardize our efforts to ensure that convicted felons do not have \naccess to guns by possibly giving Federal judges the power to rearm \nthose felons regardless of the Congressional funding ban. I have been \nactive in pushing for the funding ban, and it certainly was not my \nintention, nor do I believe it was anyone else's intention, to give \njudges power to unilaterally give felons their firearm privileges back. \nIt is hard enough for ATF, after conducting an intensive investigation, \nto make judgments about an individual felon; for a court to do it on \nits own is completely inappropriate. To put it simply, courts will lack \nthe resources to make an informed judgment in this regard. In any case, \nCongress' intent, and the appropriate rule, is that felons should be \nprohibited from owning guns period. Enacting my legislation will \neliminate the guns for felons program permanently and prevent the need \nfor Congress to revisit this issue every year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 3117. A bill to extend the cooling off period in the labor dispute \nbetween the Pacific Maritime Association and the International \nLongshore and Warehouse Union; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, last year our Nation's economy was briefly \nheld hostage by an attack on American soil. We have overcome that \nchallenge and are now charging ahead in the right direction.\n  It is this kind of American resolve that has built this Nation into \nthe thriving world power it is today.\n  However, recent developments on the West Coast have created a \ndifferent kind of crisis but no less damaging to America's economy.\n  On Sunday, September 29, the Pacific Maritime Association, PMA, \nlocked out workers in twenty-nine West Coast ports for more than a week \nin response to a reported work-slow down by members of the \nInternational Longshore and Warehouse Union, ILWU.\n  Last week, President Bush invoked the Taft-Hartley Act that ended the \nlock out allowing workers to go back to work and negotiators to work \nthrough these problems over the course of an 80-day cooling-off period.\n  I applaud the President's action. However, I am concerned about \nconflicting messages being sent by the ILWU and the PMA. More \nimportantly, I am concerned about the lack of interest either party, \nmanagement or labor, has regarding the economic fate of America's \nworkers and America's agricultural economy.\n  The economic impact of this labor dispute has temporarily crippled \nour Nation's economy. This dispute has threatened America's national \nhealth and safety. In many economic sectors, jobs were lost, workers \nwere sent home and Americans will temporarily pay higher prices for \nconsumer goods.\n  However, once the President made his intention known to invoke Taft-\nHartley, the AFL-CIO issued an Oct. 7 press release charging the \nPresident's action: ``preempts the collective bargaining process and \nundermines the rights of workers with union representation to negotiate \non equal footing with their employers''.\n  Neither side in a collective bargaining negotiating process should be \nable to leverage the nation's economy in an attempt to control the \ndebate. Doing so is a very selfish act. And criticizing the President \nfor his action is a very shortsighted approach to these negotiations.\n  The ILWU claims they want to go back to work. Due to the only \nrecourse available on behalf of the American economy, they are, today, \nback at work.\n  I question the AFL-CIO's interest in the American economy. Does the \nAFL-CIO not recognize the impact this labor disruption has on the \nnation's economy? At stake are thousands of jobs and millions of \ndollars in commerce. Let me clarify that impact and put a Montana stamp \non it.\n  Exports are critical to the American economy. American exporters ship \ntheir products overseas, including agricultural exports such as wheat, \ncorn, soybeans, and pork products, and manufactured goods of all shapes \nand sizes.\n  West Coast ports are crucial to U.S. trade, handling over $300 \nbillion in trade each year. These ports handle more than half of \nall containerized imports and exports.\n\n  West Coast ports handle 25 percent of all U.S. grain exports, 40 \npercent of all wheat, 14 percent of all corn, and seven percent of all \nsoybeans exports.\n  Sixty-five percent of all U.S. containerized food trade moved through \nthese ports in 2001. During the lockout, the dispute was estimated to \nhave cost the America's economy $2 billion a day.\n  Trade with Asia is particularly affected. Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong \nKong, China, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, India, and Malaysia \nare the top 10 destinations for containerized U.S. agriculture \nproducts. Together, these nations receive 85 percent of all \nagricultural shipments from the West Coast.\n  If these countries cannot count on U.S. exports, they will turn to \nour competitors. Our farmers and ranchers spend precious resources on \nmarket development activities. It's very frustrating to lose shares of \nthose markets solely because a small group of labor and management \nrepresentatives cannot agree on a resolution.\n  Again, I applaud President Bush's decision last week. I encouraged \nhis action and stand by him now. Invoking Taft-Hartley was the only \nshort-term remedy for the dispute that temporarily closed the West \nCoast ports.\n  Furthermore, during the cooling off period, I urge the President to \nuse his powers to judicially enforce productivity is not purposely \nrestricted.\n  I do not stand here today in support of the PMA's position, nor do I \nstand here today in support of the ILWU's position. Rather, I stand \nhere today in support of the Nation's economy, the American worker, the \nMontana farmer, the retailer, the food distributor, the truck and rail \noperators, the consumer, and every other American that is being harmed \nby this action.\n  I believe collective bargaining can and has worked more often than \nnot. However, it is arrogant for any management or labor group to \nparalyze commerce in our nation.\n  Reopening the ports, even if only for 80 days, will benefit the \neconomy. The parties will be given time to settle the dispute. \nManufacturers and retailers will be given additional time to adjust and \nprepare.\n  Invoking Taft-Hartley was the right thing to do. It was the \nappropriate action to take to protect our economy, to protect American \nworkers, to ensure we have a healthy and happy holiday season.\n  The 80-day cooling-off period will allow both parties to re-evaluate \ntheir respective positions. Furthermore, it will give the ports an \nopportunity to clear up a mounting backlog that has\n\n[[Page S10575]]\n\nparalyzed much of our West Coast export and import commerce. And \nfinally, it will allow the ILWU workers to go back to work earning a \nliving for their families.\n  Today, I would like to introduce a bill that would extend the \ncooling-off period thirty days until the end of January. At present the \n80 day cooling off period will end between Christmas Day and New Years \nDay.\n  This is a move that will not impact the negotiations between the two \nparties. However, it will allow the cooling-off period to end at the \nend of January rather than the end of December and between Christmas \nand New Years.\n  Extending the deadline beyond the Holiday season will help to unsnarl \nthe mess created by this dispute; give the ports another thirty days to \nclear up the backlog. Finally, it will give Congress and the American \npeople an ability to approach the end of this cooling-off period fully \naware of the importance of this negotiation and uninterrupted by the \nholiday season.\n  If negotiators are able to work out a resolution, we have lost \nnothing. However, if in the case, there is no resolution by the end of \nthe cooling-off period, this extension could save thousands of American \njobs and millions of dollars in economic losses.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself, Mr. Allard, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 3118. A bill to strengthen enforcement of provisions of the Animal \nWelfare Act relating to animal fighting, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nAllard and Cantwell to introduce the Animal Fighting Enforcement Act. I \nwould like to thank my colleagues for their support in this endeavor to \nprotect the welfare of animals. This legislation targets the troubling, \nwidespread and sometimes underground activities of dogfighting and \ncockfighting where dogs and birds are bred and trained to fight to the \ndeath. This is done for the sheer enjoyment and illegal wagering of the \nanimals' handlers and spectators.\n  These activities are reprehensible and despicable. Our States' laws \nreflect this sentiment. All 50 States have prohibited dogfighting. It \nis considered a felony in 46 States. Cockfighting is illegal in 47 \nStates, and it is a felony in 26 States. In my home State of Nevada, \nboth dogfighting and cockfighting are considered felonies. In fact, it \nis a felony to even attend a dogfighting or cockfighting match.\n  Unfortunately, in spite of public opposition to extreme animal \nsuffering, these animal fighting industries thrive. There are 11 \nunderground dogfighting publications, and several above-ground \ncockfighting magazines. These magazines advertise and sell animals and \nthe materials associated with animal fighting. They also seek to \nlegitimize this shocking practice.\n  During the consideration of the Farm Bill, a provision was included \nthat closed loopholes in Section 26 of the Animal Welfare Act. Both the \nHouse and the Senate increased the maximum jail time for individuals \nwho violate any provision of Section 26 of the Animal Welfare Act from \none year to two years, making any violation a Federal felony. However, \nduring the conference, the jail time increase was removed.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today seeks to do three things. \nFirst, it restores the jail time increase to treat the violations as a \nfelony. I am informed by U.S. Attorneys that they are hesitant to \npursue animal fighting cases with merely a misdemeanor penalty. To \nillustrate this, it is important to note that only three cases since \n1976 have advanced, even though the USDA has received innumerable tips \nfrom informants and requests to assist with state and local \nprosecutions. Increased penalties will provide a greater incentive for \nfederal authorities to pursue animal fighting cases.\n  Second, the bill prohibits the interstate shipment of cockfighting \nimplements, such as razor-sharp knives and gaffs. The specific knives \nare commonly known as ``slashers.'' The slashers and ice-pick-like \ngaffs are attached to the legs of birds to make the cockfights more \nviolent and to induce bleeding of the animals. These weapons are used \nonly in cockfights. Since Congress has restricted shipment of birds for \nfighting, it should also restrict implements designed specifically for \nfights.\n  Finally, the bill updates language regarding the procedures that \nenforcement agents follow when they seize the animals. This regards the \nproper care and transportation of the animals that are seized. It also \nstates that the court may order the convicted person to pay for the \ncosts incurred in the housing, care, feeding, and treatment of the \nanimals.\n  I appreciate the support of both Senators Allard and Cantwell in this \neffort, and look forward to the overwhelming support of my other \ncolleagues in the Senate. I also wish to recognize Representative \nRobert Andrews for his leadership on the House version of this bill. \nSurely, this is an issue that must be addressed as soon as possible. We \ncannot allow this barbaric practice to continue in our civilized \nsociety.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Fitzgerald):\n  S. 3119. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure the \nguaranteed renewability of individual health insurance coverage \nregardless of the health status-related factors of an enrollee; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Health \nInsurance Fairness Act of 2002'' and I am very pleased to have Senator \nFitzgerald join me as an original cosponsor. This legislation would \nprohibit the insurance practice of reunderwriting at renewal, thereby \nprotecting the millions of Americans relying on individual health \ninsurance policies.\n  The need for this legislation was brought to my attention by an \nexcellent April 9, 2002 article in the Wall Street Journal that \ndocumented the impact of reunderwriting on a married couple from \nFlorida.\n  Shaneen Wahl of Port Charlotte, FL was diagnosed with breast cancer \nin 1996. At that time, she and her husband Tom were paying $417 a month \nfor health insurance. In addition to coping with cancer, the Wahls \nbegan to face rapidly increasing premiums, and by August 2000 their \ninsurer informed them that their new rate would be $1,881 a month. This \npremium increase wasn't due to non-payment of premiums or any other \naction of the Wahls. It was the result of reunderwriting conducted by \nthe Wahl's insurance company.\n  Reunderwriting at renewal is a practice that forces people who have \nbecome ill to pay substantial premium increases or lose their health \ninsurance. While most insurers evaluate an individual's medical history \nonly at the outset, some have adopted the practice of reviewing \ncustomers' health status annually. The purpose of this review is to \ndetermine if the individual has developed a medical condition or has \nfiled claims; if such a determination is made, the company raises the \nindividual's premium. This practice contributes enormously to the \ninstability of health insurance by making it difficult, it not \nimpossible, for people who have paid insurance premiums for years to \ncontinue that health insurance at the very time they need it the most.\n  How does it work? Carriers reunderwriting at renewal charge \nsubstantially higher renewal premiums to policyholders who have been \ndiagnosed with an illness or had medical claims than they charge other \npolicyholders. The carriers do this by transferring a policyholder to a \nhigher risk class than the policyholder was in when the policy was \nissued or in some cases by manually adjusting the policyholder's rate \nbased on his or her medical claims. In either case, the individual's \npremium is based on his or her claims or health status during the \npolicy year. For example, in another case from Florida, Bruce and Wanda \nChambers of St. Augustine saw their rates increase from $300 per month \nto $780 per month in just one year after Wanda was diagnosed with \ndiabetes.\n  Consumers purchase insurance so that they will have access to health \ncare should they become ill, as in the example of Wanda Chambers. If \ncarriers are allowed to increase premium rates based on health status \nat renewal, consumers face a choice between the very two outcomes they \nhad\n\n[[Page S10576]]\n\nplanned to avoid by purchasing insurance in the first place: they can \ndrop the insurance policy and thus likely forgo access to health care \nin times of illness, or they can pay the grossly inflated premiums and \nthus face financial ruin.\n  The practice of reunderwriting at renewal violates the spirit of \nhealth insurance guaranteed renewability requirements under state and \nfederal law. In the 1990's, the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners, NAIC, developed model laws to prohibit insurance \ncompanies from canceling policies once an individual became sick. In \n1997, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, HIPAA, \napplied this requirement to all health insurance policies subject to \nHIPAA. As a result, carriers can no longer cancel individuals because \nof their medical claims.\n  Reunderwriting is a way to circumvent these requirements, and has \nbeen justified as a means of holding down premiums, for the healthy. \nHowever, a July 17, 2002 memo to all NAIC Members from Steven B. \nLarsen, Chair of the Health Insurance & Managed Care (B) Committee \nclarifies that the practice of reunderwriting is illegal under NAIC \nModel Laws:\n\n       The committee also noted that the practice is contrary to \n     adopted NAIC policy, and is illegal under NAIC Model Laws \n     governing the individual market. The Small Employer and \n     Individual Health Insurance Availability Model Act (Model \n     #35) provides for adjusted community rating, and health \n     status is not one of the factors that can be used to set \n     rates. The Individual Health Insurance Portability Model Act \n     (Model #37) provides for the use of rating characteristics, \n     and health status is not one of the listed characteristics. \n     More specifically that model also provides that changes in \n     health status after issue, and durational rating, are not to \n     be used in setting premiums for individual policies.\n\n  Insurance companies should not be allowed to manage health-care costs \nby targeting individuals for premium increases because an individual \nwas diagnosed with an illness or has had medical claims. Doubling or \ntripling premiums for only the individuals who have been diagnosed with \nan illness forces those individuals to drop their policies and is \nfunctionally the same as not renewing coverage.\n  Not only is reunderwriting bad for consumers, but it creates a \ncompetitive disadvantage to the many reputable insurance companies that \nagree that this practice is contrary to the public interest and \nundermines the theory behind insurance. Faced with the practice being \nused by some companies, the Wall Street Journal has reported that other \ncarriers are ``closely watching'' this practice intending to adopt a \nsimilar practice either to avoid a competitive disadvantage or to \nimprove their bottom line. While selective targeting improves the \nprofitability of the reunderwriter, it shifts the responsibility for \nhigher risk people to other insurers or employers or local and state \ngovernment health programs.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would make health insurance \nmore secure. The legislation would clarify that guaranteed renewal of \nhealth insurance means that insurers cannot target individuals for \npremium increases because the have had claims or a new disease \ndiagnosis. The bill would ensure that individuals will not be priced \nout of the market for health insurance at the very time that they need \nit most.\n  The goals of this legislation are simple: 1. To strengthen HIPAA's \npromise of guaranteed renewable coverage and make private health \ninsurance more secure for millions of Americans, and 2. to hold all \ninsurers accountable to a level playing field of reasonable standards \nso they can compete fairly without dumping customers when they get \nsick.\n  The ``Health Insurance Fairness Act'' will help the many millions of \npeople who rely on the individual health insurance market: those that \nare self-employed, those employed by small businesses unable to get \ngroup coverage, early retirees who rely disproportionately on \nindividual health insurance if their COBRA runs out before Medicare \nbegins, and others whose employers don't provide health benefits.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the ``Health Insurance Fairness \nAct'' and I thank the Chair.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 3120. A bill to impose restrictions on the ability of officers and \nemployees of the United States to enter into contracts with \ncorporations or partnerships that move outside the United States while \nretaining substantially the same ownership; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill on behalf \nof Sen. Baucus and myself to address the issue of inverting \ncorporations that are awarded contracts by the federal government. Our \nbill is the ``Reclaiming Expatriated Contracts and Profits'', RECAP, \nAct.\n  Inverting corporations set up a folder in a foreign filing cabinet or \na mail box overseas and call that their new foreign ``headquarters.'' \nThis allows companies to escape millions of dollars of Federal taxes \nevery year. In April of this year, Sen. Baucus and I introduced the \n``Reversing the Expatriation of Profits Offshore'', REPO, Act to shut \ndown these phony corporate inversions. Today, our REPO bill sits in the \nCare Act, awaiting Senate passage.\n  You would think that the ``greed-grab'' of corporate inversions would \nsatisfy most companies, but unfortunately it is not enough. After these \ncorporations invert and save millions in taxes, they then come back \ninto the United States to obtain juicy contracts with the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Imagine the nerve. They create phony foreign headquarters to escape \ntaxes and then use other peoples' taxes to turn a profit. That's really \nsomething, something that needs to be stopped.\n  Let's look at some of the numbers. Tyco had over 1700 contracts in \n2001, worth over $286 million dollars. Accenture had contracts worth \nnearly $279 million. Ingersoll Rand left the United States for Bermuda, \nwhere it reportedly pays less than $28,000 a year to register its phony \nheadquarters and receives $40 million in U.S. tax savings. Ingersoll \nRand had more than 200 government contracts in 2001, worth over $12 \nmillion.\n  I was the first member of Congress to disclose that inverting \ncorporations were receiving Federal contracts, back in March of this \nyear. Out of respect for the committee system, I have waited for the \ncommittees with jurisdiction over government contracts to act on this \nissue. They have not. Instead, we have seen a series of politically-\ninspired amendments offered in Congress, all of which are ineffective, \neasily evaded, and, if enacted, could cost thousands of Americans their \njobs. I then read in the paper last week that the Defense \nAppropriations conferees dropped one of those amendments, rather than \ntry to rewrite it. I decided enough is enough. It is time for serious \nlegislation on this issue.\n  Chairman Baucus and I offer our bipartisan RECAP bill as a compliment \nto our earlier REPO bill on corporate inversions. For future corporate \ninversions, our RECAP bill will bar the inverting company from \nreceiving Federal contracts. For the inversions that have already \ngotten out before the REPO bill can be enacted, our RECAP bill will \nmake them send back their ill-gotten tax savings by forcing them to \nlower their bids in order to obtain government contracts. The RECAP \nbill does not unwind Federal contracts that were legal when they were \nentered into. Therefore, unlike the other proposals, our RECAP bill \nwill not throw thousands of Americans out of a job. The bill we submit \ntoday has only one objective: to permanently place corporate inversions \non the endangered species list.\n  I am aware that many of my colleagues believe this measure is \nunnecessary because inverting corporations pay U.S. taxes on their \nprofits from Federal contracts. It is generally true that profits \nearned from a Federal contract are taxable in the United States, but \nthose profits are easily reduced when an inverter creates phony \ndeductions through its inversion structure. For example, most inverted \ncompanies create phony interest deductions for interest that is \nfictitiously paid to the ``file folder'' foreign headquarters. \nObjections to this bill simply overlook the real insult to the American \npeople: these inverted companies take other peoples' tax dollars to \nmake a profit, but they won't pay their share of taxes to keep America \nstrong. And that's just wrong.\n  So let me be clear to everyone developing or contemplating one of \nthese inversion deals, you proceed at your own peril. We are not only \ngoing after the\n\n[[Page S10577]]\n\ncorporate expatriation abuse, but also the abusers who seek big \ngovernment contracts while skirting their U.S. tax obligations. I \nintend to pursue this issue throughout the remainder of this Congress \nand into the next.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3120\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reclaiming Expatriated \n     Contracts and Profits Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I join the Ranking Republican Member of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, in introducing bipartisan \nlegislation to further address the increasing problem of U.S. \ncorporations reincorporating to tax haven countries to avoid taxes, a \npractice also known as a corporate inversion. I am pleased to cosponsor \nthe Reclaiming Expatriated Contracts and Profits, RECAP, Act which \nprohibits the most egregious inverted corporations from receiving \nFederal Government contracts.\n  Last March, Senator Grassley and I announced our intention to \nintroduce legislation to curb the proliferation of U.S. corporations \nchanging their Articles of Incorporation to become a corporation of a \nforeign tax haven country. On April 11, 2002, we introduced legislation \nto address this problem. S. 2119, the Reversing the Expatriation of \nProfits Offshore, REPO, Act, was designed to put the brakes on the \npotential rush to move U.S. corporate headquarters to tax haven \ncountries. On June 18, 2002, the Senate Finance Committee sent a strong \nmessage to corporate America by passing S. 2119 by unanimous vote.\n  But the REPO Act was just the first step to curb inversions. Senator \nWellstone led the effort to eliminate another incentive for these \ncorporations by restricting them from qualification for government \ncontracts. The idea is simple. If a corporation wants to, in essence, \nrenounce their U.S. citizenship, then they shouldn't be entitled to \ncompete for U.S. government contracts. I applaud Senator Wellstone for \nhis leadership and willingness to press ahead with restricting inverted \ncorporations from winning government contracts.\n  Today, Senator Chuck Grassley and I cosponsor legislation focused on \nthe same goal as that of Senator Wellstone. The legislation we \nintroduce today will prevent the most egregious of these inverted \ncorporations from receiving any U.S. government contracts. These \ncompanies have placed tax avoidance as their first priority and their \nU.S. identity as their second priority. The reduction in taxes for \ninverted corporations allows them to underbid those corporations that \nchoose to remain U.S. corporations. This is wrong.\n  I welcome the opportunity to support RECAP and I urge Congress to act \nquickly on this legislation, as it will go a long way toward restoring \npublic confidence in corporate America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Clinton, \n        Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 3121. A bill to authorize the Secretary of State to undertake \nmeasures in support of international programs to detect and prevent \nacts of nuclear or radiological terrorism, to authorize appropriations \nto the Department of State to carry out those measures, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Nuclear and \nRadiological Terrorism Threat Reduction Act of 2002.'' This is a bill \nto strengthen the efforts of the world community to gain control over \nthe vast amounts of radioactive materials that, left uncontrolled, \ncould cause economic disruption and sow terror in American cities.\n  In the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's hearing on March 6 of \nthis year, experts testified that an amount of ground up radioactive \ncobalt-60 the size of the ball in your ball point pen could contaminate \nan area of Manhattan greater than the footprint of the World Trade \nCenter. The damage and risk would be so great that buildings in the \naffected area might have to be abandoned, destroyed, and trucked away \nas radioactive waste.\n  We learned that if a terrorist dispersed a few hundred curies of \nradioactive material, the resulting public panic could make much of \ndowntown Washington, DC uninhabitable without a difficult and expensive \nclean-up. Decontamination is a serious and poorly understood problem \nbecause many of the radioactive isotopes a terrorist might choose will \nbind chemically to construction materials such as marble and stone used \nin our most precious buildings.\n  One curie of radioactive cesium-137, strontium-90, cobalt-60 or \niridium-192 poses a significant risk. But sources as strong as several \nhundred curies are used every day in world-wide commerce. They serve to \nestimate the oil in active oil wells, to provide a compact and \nconvenient source of x-rays to check the quality of welds in the field, \nand to provide pencil beams of radiation to measure the amount of soda \nor beer in an aluminum can.\n  Hospitals, primarily in poorer countries, but also in the United \nStates, use cesium-137 or cobalt-60 sources as strong as several \nthousand curies to provide radiation therapy in cancer treatment. Some \nof these sources are used in Southern California in mobile treatment \ncenters mounted in trucks. These rolling radioactive sources move on \nthe highways and through the streets of our country and perhaps of \nother countries, where they are vulnerable to accident or foul play.\n  Each year many radioactive sources, world wide, are abandoned or \nstolen and leak out of the existing control system. They become \n``orphan'' sources, unwanted and with nobody to care for them or keep \nthem out of trouble. Sometimes industrial sources are abandoned in \nplace when their owners go out of business. They can then find their \nway into the scrap metal pool, and may arrive on the doorstep of a \nsteel mill.\n  That happened shortly before our March 6 hearing. A 2-curie cesium-\n137 source turned up on the conveyor belt of the Nucor Steel Mill in \nHertford, NC. Caught just before it would have gone into the furnace, \nit was identified, removed, and taken into safe custody by the North \nCarolina radiation protection authorities. Where did it come from? A \nbankrupt chemical company in the Baltimore area whose equipment was \nsold for scrap. But when the records were traced it was found that the \ncompany had bought not one, but four, such sources. Fortunately, two \nmore were traced and recovered, but one of those ``gauge sources'' \nstill is missing.\n  If the source found at Nucor had gone into the molten steel, the \nclean-up would have cost the company millions of dollars. If it had \ngotten into the\n\n[[Page S10579]]\n\nhands of a terrorist who could disperse it with high explosives, it \ncould have contaminated many square blocks of an American city and the \nrecovery might have run into the billions.\n  Far more intense radioactive sources turn up in strange places from \ntime to time.\n  In 1987, two junk collectors in Brazil broke open an abandoned gamma \nray cancer treatment machine containing 1,400 curies of Cesium-137. \nInside they found about 2/3 of an ounce of softly glowing powder. \nSeveral people were delighted at the idea of glowing in the dark and \nthey rubbed the powder on their bodies. They contaminated not only \nthemselves, but their homes and families. The toll: 5 people dead, 21 \nrequiring intensive care, 49 requiring some hospitalization, 249 \ncontaminated, and 111,800 people tested in improvised medical \nfacilities at a local soccer stadium.\n  And that was an accident. A deliberate attack using the same 20 grams \nof material could have had far greater consequences, as our witnesses \ntold the Committee.\n  ``Dirty bombs'' do not even need to explode. Murders have been \ncommitted by the simple act of inserting a small radioactive source in \nthe victim's desk chair and simply waiting until radiation sickness and \ndeath followed. If a terrorist is willing to die, he could merely fling \nfinely powdered material from the window of a tall building and allow \nthe wind to spread his poison.\n  Finally, I worry that other terrorist groups, not just Al Qaeda, \ncould make a radiological dispersion device. Radioactive material is \nout there for the taking, especially in the former Soviet Union.\n  In January of this year, three hunters gathering firewood in a forest \nin the former Soviet republic of Georgia found two abandoned cans of \nstrontium-90, each containing 40,000 curies of material. Because the \nheat from these sources melted the snow for yards around, the hunters \nwere delighted to find free warmth for their tent. They picked up and \ncarried off the sources in their backpacks. All three woodsmen were \ncritically injured, but since they did not break open the two cans, \nenvironmental contamination was limited.\n  A team from the government of Georgia, assisted by the International \nAtomic Energy Agency, recovered the sources, but several more are \napparently missing and unaccounted for. The nuclear industry of the \nformer Soviet Union made hundreds of similar devices.\n  In fact, 40,000 curies of strontium-90 represents a small source by \nSoviet standards. A string of 131 arctic sites in Russia is powered by \nradioisotope thermal generators--portable power plants that draw energy \nfrom the heat liberated by the decay of radioactive nuclei. Each site \nuses a 300,000-curie source. That raises the maximum damage that a \nterrorist dirty bomb could do by a factor of ten beyond anything the \nCommittee heard at our March hearing.\n  There once were 136 sites in this chain, but the Norwegian government \nreplaced five with solar-powered installations. The remaining 131 \nshould be replaced as soon as possible so as to remove a potential \nsource of truly destructive dirty bombs.\n  We must, and we can, raise significant and sensible barriers to \nprotect against terrorists who would use the power of the atom to do us \nharm. To that end, Senators Lugar, Domenici, Clinton, Gregg and Schumer \njoin me today in introducing the ``Nuclear and Radiological Terrorism \nThreat Reduction Act of 2002.''\n  The bill's principal cosponsors, Senators Lugar and Domenici, have \nbeen among the Senate's long-time leaders in the causes of non-\nproliferation, threat reduction and counter-terrorism, and I welcome \ntheir support. Senator Gregg's position on the Appropriations Committee \nhas sensitized him to the need to protect our embassies. And both of \nthe Senators from New York, Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton, attended the \nForeign Relations Committee's classified session where we learned some \nof the specifics regarding the threat of nuclear and radiological \nterrorism.\n  Our bill takes the initiative in several significant areas:\n  One, it creates a new program to establish a network of five regional \nshelters around the globe to provide secure, temporary storage of \nunwanted, unused, obsolete and orphaned radioactive sources. The bill \nauthorizes $5 million to get started in Fiscal Year 2003, and up to $20 \nmillion a year for construction and operation of the facilities in the \nfuture. We envision accomplishing our goals through bilateral \nnegotiations with the host nations or, when advantageous to the United \nStates, through special contributions to the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, the IAEA. Regional storage facilities can remove some of \nthe most dangerous material from circulation.\n  Two, to round up the sources to be stored in the regional facilities, \nwe propose an accelerated program--in cooperation with the IAEA--to \ndiscover, inventory, and recover unwanted radioactive material from \naround the world. This would be similar to the Department of Energy's \nOff-site Source Recovery Program, but aimed at material outside our \nborders. This bill will make a modest start by authorizing $5 million a \nyear in special voluntary contributions to the IAEA.\n  Three, recognizing the threat posed by the very intense radioactive \nsources packaged by the former Soviet Union to provide electric power \nto very remote locations, such as lighthouses, weather stations, \ncommunications nets, and other measuring equipment, the bill authorizes \nfunding to replace that equipment with non-nuclear technologies. We \nbelieve that $10 million a year over the next three years should not \nmerely make a dent in this problem; it should largely solve it.\n  Four, other bills this year have provided funding to train American \nfirst responders to handle a radiological emergency. The bill we \nintroduce today authorizes $5 million a year for the next three years \nto train responders abroad. This is a matter of self-protection for the \nUnited States: we have diplomatic missions at risk around the world, \nand we will be funding the construction and operation of temporary \nstorage sites for radioactive material. Should accidents or incidents \noccur, we would like to be able to rely upon competent responses by our \nhost countries.\n  Five, this bill requires the Secretary of State to conduct a global \nassessment of the radiological threat to U.S. missions overseas and to \nprovide the results to the appropriate committees of the Congress in an \nunclassified form, but with a classified annex giving details if he \ndeems necessary. We hope the Secretary will take into account the \nlocations of the interim storage facilities and also the results of \nthis threat assessment in choosing where first to provide the overseas \nfirst responder training authorized by this bill.\n  Six, the Customs Service is charged with preventing illicit shipments \nof radioactive material and fissile material from reaching our shores. \nInspection of today's large cargo containers for fissile material, in \nparticular, is a technologically challenging task, one performed most \nsafely and easily before the containers are loaded aboard ship. Customs \nhas agreements to permit U.S. inspectors to do their jobs in ports of \nembarkation. In order to assist the Service, the Nuclear and \nRadiological Threat Prevention Act establishes a special representative \nwith the rank of ambassador within the State Department for negotiation \nof international agreements that ensure inspection of cargoes of \nnuclear material at ports of embarkation. This special representative \nwill work in close cooperation with the Customs Service to make certain \nthat the agreements meet the Service's needs.\n  Seven, we could diminish the threat of Dirty bombs by reducing use of \nradioactive material where other technologies could be substituted. \nThis bill mandates a study by the National Academy of Sciences to tell \nus how and where safe sources of radiation can replace dangerous ones. \nSome substitutions are well known: for many applications, X-ray \nmachines powered by the electric grid are almost as convenient as the \ngamma ray ``cameras'' that use intense iridium-178 sources. Powered \nradiation sources can replace radioactive sources in some oil well \nlogging work. Linear accelerators are replacing radioactive cobalt and \ncesium in cancer therapy. All of the substitute sources have one thing \nin common: a switch. When that switch is turned ``off,'' the radiation \nsource is safe. There may be many more applications\n\n[[Page S10580]]\n\nin which a switchable source can replace a radioactive one and be at \nleast as economical, particularly when the risks of dirty bombs are \naccounted for properly.\n  Fissile material is the indispensable element of a true nuclear \nweapon. At our March 6, 2002, hearing experts from the Department of \nEnergy weapons laboratories told the Committee that terrorists in \npossession of highly enriched uranium or plutonium could assemble a \ncrude ``improvised nuclear device'' with a yield large enough to smash \nWashington from the White House to the Capitol. Such an improvised \nnuclear device would not require a Manhattan Project. In a study done \nin the 1970s, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment wrote \nthat a group of two or three technically competent individuals in \npossession of enriched uranium or weapons-grade plutonium could \nprobably build a one-kiloton device in a few months.\n  For that reason, one provision of this bill deals specifically with \ndeveloping the tools to guard against illicit traffic in highly \nenriched uranium and plutonium.\n  Last summer, a meeting in Washington to discuss ``nuclear science and \nHomeland Security'' was sponsored by the Department of Energy, the \nNational Science Foundation, NSF, and other Federal science funding \nagencies. It brought together some of the best scientists in our \nuniversities and colleges, all of whom were willing to put aside their \nnormal research to help strengthen our security at home. But few of \nthose scientists can use the research money they already have for this \nwork. Research support given for one purpose usually may not be \nchanneled into other uses.\n  Therefore, this bill establishes a small program within the NSF to \nsupport researchers at colleges and universities who will work on the \ndetection of fissile materials--the hardest and most critical task or \non real-time identification of radioisotopes and decontamination of \nbuildings after a dirty bomb goes off.\n  The Department of Energy has a special role to play in this program: \nwe expect that Department and its national laboratories to work in \ncooperation with NSF to transition laboratory apparatus into field-\nready operational hardware. This bill authorizes $10 million a year for \nresearch funded by the NSF and an additional $5 million a year for the \nDepartment of Energy to accomplish the transition.\n  The threat of radiological terrorism, and even of true nuclear terror \nattacks, is real. We know that most radiological attacks will kill few \nAmericans, but there is little doubt they will lead to economic crimes \nof the greatest consequence. The radioactive source that killed only a \nfew people in Brazil cost hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up. \nAnd nobody tried to cause that destruction.\n  We must do something to head off the nuclear and radiological \nterrorist threat where it will most likely first appear: in foreign \ncountries.\n  The ``Nuclear and Radiological Terrorism Threat Reduction Act'' gives \nus a good start at doing just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3121\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear and Radiological \n     Terrorism Threat Reduction Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is feasible for terrorists to obtain and to \n     disseminate radioactive material using a radiological \n     dispersion device (RDD), or by emplacing discrete radioactive \n     sources in major public places.\n       (2) It is not difficult for terrorists to improvise a \n     nuclear explosive device of significant yield once they have \n     acquired the fissile material, highly enriched uranium, or \n     plutonium, to fuel the weapon.\n       (3) An attack by terrorists using a radiological dispersion \n     device, lumped radioactive sources, an improvised nuclear \n     device (IND), or a stolen nuclear weapon is a plausible \n     event.\n       (4) Such an attack could cause catastrophic economic and \n     social damage and could kill large numbers of Americans.\n       (5) The first line of defense against both nuclear and \n     radiological terrorism is preventing the acquisition of \n     radioactive sources, special nuclear material, or nuclear \n     weapons by terrorists.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I'm pleased to join Senator Biden and \nSenator Lugar in sponsoring the Nuclear and Radiological Terrorism \nThreat Reduction Act of 2002.\n  Only a few months ago, I introduced the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act \nof 2002 with these same Senators and many others as co-sponsors. It's \nbeing called the Domenici-Biden-Lugar bill. I am pleased to learn that \nmost provisions of that Act are being incorporated in the Conference on \nthe Armed Services bill.\n  The current bill and the Domenici-Biden-Lugar bill are highly \ncomplementary. The first bill focused entirely on the contributions \nthat the Department of Energy should be authorized to make to minimize \nrisks of nuclear and radiological risks to our citizens. The current \nbill focuses on the contributions that the Department of State should \nmake in that same arena. And in both cases, there is careful \nrecognition of the importance of a tight partnership between those two \nDepartments in accomplishing this vital mission.\n  I'm particularly pleased with this bill's focus on assisting in the \ncreation of a number of international repositories that can be used to \nstore radioactive sources safely, while ensuring that they don't become \n``orphaned'' sources that might fuel a terrorist's dirty bomb. Other \nprovisions to assist the IAEA in promoting source inventory and \nrecovery are also critical.\n  One important application of this new bill must be to help the \nRussian Federation address the large number of Radio-isotope Thermal \nGenerators that rely on large quantities of radioactive material to \npower many remote installations, especially lighthouses. These large \nradioactive sources, in isolated locations, are very vulnerable to \ncompromise. With this bill, we can assist other nations, like Norway, \nin shifting the power for these lighthouses away from radioactive \nmaterials to other means of power.\n  Another important aspect of the bill involves the authorization for \nthe State Department to help other nations in developing their own \nFirst Responder program for response to dirty bomb or nuclear threats. \nIn this country, we now have a First Responder program that grows \nstronger each year, thanks to the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici bill that created \nthe effort. Now we need to share the lessons we have been learning with \nothers.\n\n[[Page S10582]]\n\n  This new bill is another important contribution to our nation's \nefforts to ensure that terrorists will never threaten the United States \nor other nations with radiological or nuclear weapons.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 3122. A bill to allow North Korean's to apply for refugee status \nor asylum; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will clarify the status of North Korean refugees.\n  As a Nation, the United States is the world's leader in the \nprotection of refugees. The world takes its lead from the United States \nwhen reacting to asylum-seekers, and the example we set have far-\nreaching implications for those who flee persecution. For this reason, \nwe have stood firm against excuses for the denial of basic human rights \nand life's basic liberties.\n  The tenuous status of North Korean refugees in China is well \ndocumented. As we all know from news reports, including several news \nprograms, that few North Koreans are able to seek asylum and refuge, be \nit in China or elsewhere. The few that do, however, are functionally \nbarred from seeking asylum in the United States or being admitted to \nthe United States as refugees. As I understand it, the State Department \nhas expressed concerns that the legal hurdle to admitting North Koreans \nrefugees is the fact that South Korea automatically conveys its \ncitizenship to any escapee from North Korea who makes it to South \nKorea. In short, the State Department claims it cannot, as a matter of \nlaw, consider any North Korean to be a refugee.\n  I am not persuaded that this is the case, but even if we assume that \nto be true, we must stand firm for the proposition that the moral \nobligation that we have for refugees everywhere seeking basic human \nliberties should not be laid aside because of that legal technicality \nand it should not preclude the United State from providing refugee \nprotections to North Korean refugees.\n  The bill I am introducing today clarifies and fixes that \ntechnicality. It says quite simply that, for asylum and refugee \npurposes, a North Korean is a North Korean. This bill in no way \ndetracts from the generosity of the South Korean government or the \nSouth Korean people. It does not encourage refugees to choose the \nUnited States over South Korea as a safe haven. Far from it, since \nthose refugees who are able to reach South Korea will go there and will \nbe afforded the rights that refugees escaping from persecution \nrightfully deserve whether under various international conventions or \nthe South Korean Constitution. Instead, this bill recognizes the \nphysical obstacles facing North Korean refugees and removes the \ntechnicality that compromises our ability to help them.\n  The bill I am introducing today has the support of the Lawyers \nCommittee on Human Rights, Amnesty International, the International \nRescue Committee, the U.S. Committee on Refugees, Immigration and \nRefugee Services of America, among others.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 3123. A bill to expand certain preferential trade treatment of \nHaiti; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have many long-standing concerns about \nthe dire situation, political, economic, and humanitarian, in Haiti. As \none who has witnessed the unbelievable poverty and despair in that tiny \nnation, I believe we must pay closer attention to what is happening \nthere. We must be engaged.\n  That is why I am introducing the ``Haiti Economic Recovery \nOpportunity Act of 2002.'' This bill would help improve the economic \nand political situation in Haiti through an important tool of our \nforeign policy, and that is trade. I would like to thank \nRepresentatives Gilman and others for introducing a similar measure in \nthe House.\n  The situation in Haiti is bleak. Haiti is the poorest country in our \nHemisphere, with approximately 70 percent of its population out of work \nand 80 percent living in abject poverty. Less than one-half of Haiti's \n8.2 million people can read or write. Haiti's infant mortality rate is \nthe highest in our hemisphere. And, one in four children under the age \nof five are malnourished.\n  Roughly one in 12 Haitians has HIV/AIDS, and, according to the \nCenters for Disease Control projections, Haiti will experience up to \n44,000 new HIV/AIDS cases this year, that's 4,000 more than the number \nexpected here in the United States, where our population is 35 times \nthat of Haiti's. AIDS already has orphaned over 163,000 children, and \nthis number is expected to skyrocket to between 323,000 and 393,000 \nover the next ten years.\n  The violence, corruption, and instability caused by the flow of drugs \nthrough Haiti cannot be overstated. An estimated 15 percent of all \ncocaine entering the United States passes through Haiti, the Dominican \nRepublic, or both.\n  Haiti still lacks democracy and political stability. The U.S. policy \nof not providing assistance directly to the Haitian Government is based \non President Aristide's failure to enact necessary reforms to uphold \ndemocracy and help the people of his own country.\n  All of this creates an environment where the logical course of action \nfor many Haitians is simply to flee. We have seen this in the past, and \nwe may see it again. So far this fiscal year, the Coast Guard has \ninterdicted and rescued over 1,485 Haitian migrants at sea, compared to \n1,113 during the entire fiscal year 2000. And, according to the State \nDepartment, migrants recently interdicted and repatriated to Haiti have \ncited economic conditions as their reason for attempting to migrate by \nsea. I do not think that a mass exodus is imminent, but we cannot \nignore any increase in migrant departures from Haiti. In addition to \nbeing an immigration issue for the United States, these migrant \ndepartures frequently result in the loss of life at sea.\n  The bill I am introducing today attempts to change this situation by \ngranting limited duty-free treatment on certain Haitian apparel \narticles if, and only if, the President is able to certify that the \nHaitian government is making serious market, political, and social \nreforms. The bill would correct a glitch or oversight in U.S. trade law \nthat recognized the special economic needs of least developed countries \nin Africa, but did not recognize those needs for the least developed \ncountry in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti.\n  Specifically, the bill would allow duty-free entry of Haitian apparel \narticles assembled from fabrics from countries with which the U.S. has \na free trade or a regional trade agreement. It also would grant duty-\nfree status on articles, regardless of the origin of the fabrics and \nyarns, if the fabrics and yarns were not commercially available in the \nUnited States.\n  The bill would cap duty-free apparel imports made of fabrics and \nyarns from the designated countries at 1.5 percent of total U.S. \napparel imports. This limit grows modestly over time to 3.5 percent.\n  The enactment of this legislation would promote employment in Haitian \nindustry by allowing the country to become a garment production center. \nWhile the benefits of this bill would be modest by U.S. standards, in \nHaiti they are substantial. It is estimated that the bill could create \nthousands of jobs, thereby reducing the unemployment rate and breaking \nthe shackles of poverty. Before the 1991 coup, Haiti was one of the \nlargest apparel suppliers in the Caribbean. But today, Haitian apparel \naccounts for less than one percent of all apparel imports into the \nUnited States.\n  The type of assembly carried out in Haiti would have minimal impact \non employment in the United States. In fact, it would encourage the \nemigration of jobs from the Far East back to our hemisphere, including \nthe United States, because most Haitian foreign exchange earnings, \nunlike in the Far East, are utilized to purchase American products. \nAnd, the ``Trade and Development Act'' already includes strong \nsafeguards against transshipment.\n  In order for Haiti to be eligible for the trade benefits under the \nbill, the President must certify that Haiti is making progress on \nmatters like the rule of law. This will not be an easy task for the \nHaitian government. However, I believe that because of the incentives \nprovided in the bill, it would be more and more apparent to them that \nit is in their interest to reform.\n\n[[Page S10583]]\n\n  During my most recent trip to Haiti, I met with President Aristide \nand raised many concerns. I explained that it is essential that he call \nfor peace and domestic order, and that he take the necessary measures \nto bring an end to the political impasse. I explained the need to \ncooperate with the opposition, and to work with the Organization of \nAmerican States, OAS.\n  I also met with leaders of the opposition and told them that they, \ntoo, must be willing to compromise and cooperate. I am pleased to see \nthat the OAS Special Mission in Haiti is up and running, but I remain \ncautious about the prospects for resolving the political crisis. In the \nmeantime, the United States must take responsibility by continuing and \nincreasing our humanitarian and trade efforts in Haiti. This is in our \nown best interest, and we have a moral obligation to remain committed \nto the people of Haiti.\n  Adopting the Haiti Economic Recovery Opportunity Act of 2002 would be \na powerful demonstration of that commitment. I encourage my colleagues \nto join in support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 3124. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to revise and \nexpand the lowest unit cost provision applicable to political campaign \nbroadcasts, to establish commercial broadcasting station minimum \nairtime requirements for candidate-centered and issue-centered \nprogramming before primary and general elections, to establish a \nvoucher system for the purchase of commercial broadcast airtime for \npolitical advertisements, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today we begin another chapter in the \neffort to reform our political campaign system. I am proud to be joined \nby Senator Russ Feingold, my longtime colleague on campaign finance \nreform, and Senator Richard Durbin, in introducing the Political \nCampaign Broadcast Activity Improvements Act.\n  The bill establishes a program to provide candidates and national \ncommittees of political parties, with vouchers that they may use for \npolitical advertisements on radio and television broadcast stations. An \nannual spectrum use fee paid by broadcasters would fund the voucher \nsystem. In addition, the bill requires broadcast television and radio \nstations to provide candidates and parties with the lowest rate \nprovided to any other advertiser in the previous 120 days, and in most \ncases, would prohibit states from preempting advertisements purchased \nby candidates or parties. Finally, the bill requires these stations to \nair a minimum of two hours per week of candidate-centered or issue-\ncentered programming before a primary or general federal election.\n  This legislation builds on the long history of requiring broadcasters \nto serve the public interest in exchange for the privilege of obtaining \nan exclusive license to use a scarce public resource: the \nelectromagnetic spectrum. The burden imposed on broadcasters pales in \ncomparison to the enormous value of this spectrum, which recent \nestimates suggest is worth as much as $367 billion.\n  The purpose of the legislation is to increase the flow of political \ninformation in broadcast media and to reduce the cost to candidates of \nreaching voters. Our democracy is stronger when a candidate's success \nis achieved by ideas, and not by dollars. The benefits of free airtime \nare not only for candidates, however. By increasing the flow of \npolitical information, free airtime can better inform the public about \ncandidates and invite viewers to become more engaged in their \ngovernment by learning more about the individuals seeking to represent \nthem.\n  We recognize that the bill will not be considered during the 107th \nCongress. We look forward, however, to hearing how we might improve the \napproach when we reintroduce it in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3124\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Senator McCain, in introducing legislation that we \nbelieve will significantly improve media coverage of elections and \nreduce the negative impact that skyrocketing TV advertising costs have \non Federal campaigns. And I am very glad that the Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, has joined us as an original cosponsor of \nthis bill.\n  Although broadcast advertising is one of the most effective forms of \ncommunication in our democracy, it also diminishes the quality of our \nelectoral process in two ways. First, broadcasters often fail to \nprovide adequate coverage to the issues in elections, focusing instead \non the horse race, if they cover elections at all. Second, the \nextraordinarily high cost of advertising time fuels the insatiable need \nfor candidates to spend more and more time fundraising instead of \ntalking with voters. These two problems interact to undermine the great \npromise that television has for promoting democratic discourse in our \ncountry.\n  It need not be this way. The public owns the airwaves and licenses \nthem to broadcasters. Broadcasters pay nothing for their use of this \nscarce and very valuable public resource. Their only ``payment'' is a \npromise to meet public interest standards, a promise that often goes \nunfulfilled. A recent study by the Committee for the Study of the \nAmerican Electorate found that only 18\n\n[[Page S10586]]\n\npercent of gubernatorial, senatorial and congressional debates held in \n2000 were televised by network TV and an additional 18 percent were \ncovered by PBS or small independent TV stations. More than 63 percent \nwere not televised at all. This is shocking in a democracy that depends \non information and open debate.\n  The bill we introduce today addresses these problems by requiring \nbroadcast stations to devote a reasonable amount of air time to \nelection programming. It would also direct the FCC to create a voucher \nsystem in which candidates and parties would receive vouchers they \ncould use for paid radio or TV advertising time financed by a broadcast \nspectrum usage fee. Candidates would qualify for vouchers based on a \nratio matched to the amount of small dollar donations they raise.\n  Our proposal would allow candidates to leverage their grassroots \nfundraising and would provide greater campaign resources to candidates \nwithout requiring them to become more beholden to special interests. \nThe proposal would also make air time available to political parties, \nwhich could be directed to underfunded candidates and challengers who \nhave a harder and harder time getting their message out under the \ncurrent system as the costs of advertising continue to rise.\n  Senator McCain and I remain devoted to improving the way our \nelectoral process functions and reducing the impact of big money on our \ndemocracy. This new bill will advance that cause in a very significant \nand necessary way. We recognize, of course, that little will happen on \nthis bill before the end of this session of Congress. We are \nintroducing it now so that the public and our colleagues can review it \nand make suggestions on how to improve it. We hope to make significant \nprogress on this legislation next year and look forward to working with \nour colleagues, as we did on campaign finance reform to make this bill \neven better and then enact it into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Miller):\n  S. 3125. A bill to designate ``God Bless America'' as the national \nsong of the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nwith Senators Nelson, Lieberman, Murkowski, Sessions and Miller, to \nhonor one of our Nation's most stirring songs, ``God Bless America.''\n  This patriotic masterpiece was written by Irving Berlin, a man whose \nbackground as an immigrant to our shores gave him a keen understanding \nand appreciation of our nation and how important its existence was. The \nUnited States has long been a symbol to peoples across the world, of \nopportunity, freedom, and the rule of law, but at the time of ``God \nBless America,'' the US's importance was even more plain. This is \nbecause the song was originally written in 1918 during the height of \nthe First World War, and then released for the first time in 1938 as \nthe clouds of war again gathered over Europe.\n  When Berlin first wrote ``God Bless America'' in 1918, he intended it \nto be a solemn paean to his adopted nation as he looked across the \nocean to a war-torn Europe. Unfortunately, its somber and serious tone \nmade it incompatible with the musical revue he was working on at the \ntime. When the drums of war again sounded on distant shores, Berlin \nrealized his song had a purpose, and knew it was time to offer it to an \nanxious country. After revising the lyrics to reflect the difference \ntwenty years and one Great War make, he introduced the song on \nArmistice Day 1938, a simple song of peace, yet one that reminded both \nAmericans and people of all nations that our Nation was a great one.\n  This song accomplished exactly the author's intent--it so eloquently \nexpressed his love for our country that it has provided for all of us a \nmeans to express our own love and feelings. It is why we have sung it \nso many times over the past year since those terrible events of \nSeptember 11, and why we will continue to sing it for the years to \ncome. It captures the feelings every citizen shares, of love, of pride, \nof patriotism, of sacrifice, and of freedom.\n  An instant sensation since its release, the power of this song to \nuplift and comfort us particularly in the dark days of this past year, \nreminds all of us of the strength of words to inspire. For that reason, \nthe time has come to give this song its long overdue recognition. That \nis why today I propose legislation to designate ``God Bless America'' \nas our national ``song.''\n  This is not to replace our rousing national anthem, which is an \nunforgettable salute to our hard-fought and triumphant birth as a \nNation, but to offer recognition to ``God Bless America.'' For ``God \nBless America'' is truly the perfect tribute for a Nation rising from \nthe ashes of September 11 to reclaim our firm and unwavering belief in \nthe goodness of man and the universal rights of liberty.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the lyrics of \nthe song be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3125\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nan income tax credit for the provision of homeownership and community \ndevelopment, and for other purposes, to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, owning your own home is the foundation of \nthe American dream. It encourages personal responsibility, provides \neconomic security and gives families a greater stake in the development \nof their communities. Families who own their home are more civic-minded \nand more willing to help develop the communities where they live. \nCommunities where homeownership rates are highest have lower crime \nrates, better schools and provide a better quality of life for families \nto raise their children. However, too many working families and \nminorities have not been able to share in the dream of homeownership \ndue to the cost or lack of available housing.\n  That is why I am introducing the Community Development Tax Credit \nAct, along with Senators Rick Santorum and Paul Sarbanes, which will \ncreate a new homeownership tax credit program, based on the Low Income \nHousing Tax Credit program, to encourage the construction and \nsubstantial rehabilitation of homes for low and moderate-income \nfamilies in economically distressed areas. I believe this legislation \nwill increase the supply of affordable homes for sale in inner-cities, \nrural areas and low and moderate-income neighborhoods across the United \nStates. The tax credit will bridge the gap that exists between the cost \nof developing affordable housing and the price at which these homes can \nbe sold in many low-income neighborhoods by providing investors with a \ntax credit of up to 50 percent of the cost of home construction or \nrehabilitation.\n  Over the past decade, we have made substantial progress in increasing \nthe homeownership rate in the United States. In 2000, the U.S. \nhomeownership rate reached a record high of 67.1\n\n[[Page S10587]]\n\npercent with some 71 million U.S. Households owning their own home. \nHowever, too many working families in low- and moderate-income \nneighborhoods and minorities across our Nation have not been able to \nshare in this piece of the American Dream due to the high cost or lack \nof available housing.\n  According to Census data for the second quarter of 2002, non-Hispanic \nwhites have a 74.3 percent homeownership rate while minority groups \nhave just a 53.7 percent homeownership rate. African-Americans have \nonly a 48 percent homeownership rate and Hispanics have a mere 47.6 \npercent homeownership rate in the same study. These numbers are \nunacceptable.\n  Many middle-income working families increasingly struggle to either \nfind or afford a median-priced home in our Nation's cities. Over the \npast two generations, many families have moved out of cities and into \nthe suburbs, which has had a negative effect on the development of \nhousing in the inner-city. In 1999, the homeownership rate in the \ncentral-city areas was 50.4 percent, this is 23.2 percent lower than \nthe suburban homeownership rate of 73.6 percent. Today, developers are \nunlikely to invest in any new housing development in inner-cities and \nrural areas that may not be sold for the cost of construction. This is \nespecially true in low-income areas. There is a lack of affordable \nsingle-family housing in areas where a majority of residents are \nminority families. Properties will sit vacant and neighborhoods will \nremain undeveloped unless the gap between development costs and market \nprices can be filled.\n  Working families in this country are increasingly finding themselves \nunable to afford housing. A person trying to live in Boston would have \nto make more than $35,000, annually, just to rent a two-bedroom \napartment. This means teachers, janitors, social workers, police \nofficers and other full-time workers are having trouble affording even \na modest two-bedroom apartment when they should have a chance to buy a \nhome.\n  The story of Benjamin and Rita Okafor show how working families in \nMassachusetts have great difficulty obtaining a decent home of their \nown. For many years, the Okafor's and their two young children were \nforced to live in a one-bedroom apartment. Benjamin Okafor, who worked \nfull time as a cab driver in Boston, spent days and months looking for \na bigger apartment for his family. However, the lack of affordable \nhousing in the Boston area made it impossible for him to find \nappropriate housing for his family. When his wife Rita became pregnant \nwith their third child, the Okafor's knew something had to change in \ntheir living situation. Luckily, Ben was accepted into the Habitat for \nHumanity program and worked for 300 sweat equity hours constructing a \nhouse. In August 2000, the Okafor family moved into a new home of their \nown in Dorchester. Ben says that this new home gives them the hope and \nstability they need. There are still too many working families living \nin substandard housing and many more families that desperately need \nassistance from Habitat for Humanity or from the Federal government to \nbecome a homeowner.\n  Today, our Nation is facing an affordable rental housing crisis. \nThousands of low-income families with children, the disabled, and the \nelderly are finding it difficult to obtain or afford privately owned \naffordable rental housing units. Recent changes in the housing market \nhave limited the availability of affordable housing across the country, \nwhile the growth in our economy in the last decade has dramatically \nincreased the cost of the housing that remains. Moving thousands of \nworking families from apartments to homes each year will help ease our \nrental housing crisis and help many families now living in substandard \nhousing increase their quality of life.\n  By facing the mounting challenge of affordable housing we can \ndramatically assist in the economic development low- and moderate-\nincome communities across our country. The production of new homes will \ncreate millions of jobs in the inner city and rural areas where \nunemployment has been for too long fact of life. The production of \nhousing has always been considered a driver of economic growth in our \neconomy. New housing production can turn many low income communities \naround and help end the spiral of unemployment and crime which plague \ntoo many of our inner cities today.\n  For these reasons, we need a new tax incentive for developers to \nbuild affordable homes in distressed areas to allow working families to \nbuy their first home at a reasonable rate.\n  The Community Development Tax Credit Act, which I am introducing \ntoday, bridges the gap between development costs and market value to \nenable the development of new or refurbished homes in these areas to \nblossom. The tax credit would be available to developers or investors \nthat build or substantially rehabilitate homes for sale to low- or \nmoderate-income buyers in low-income areas. The credit would generate \nequity investment sufficient to cover the gap between the cost of \ndevelopment and the price at which the home can be sold to an eligible \nbuyer\n  The tax credit volume would be limited to $1.75 per capita for each \nState and allocated by the States themselves. Credits would be claimed \nover five years, starting when homes are sold. This legislation will \nresult in approximately 50,000 homes built or refurbished annually, \nassuming about $40,000 per home.\n  The maximum tax credit equals 50 percent of the cost of construction, \nsubstantial rehabilitation, and building acquisition. The eligible cost \nmay not exceed the Federal Housing Administration single-family \nmortgage limits. The minimum rehabilitation cost is $25,000. Eligible \nbuilding acquisition costs are limited to one-half of rehabilitation \ncosts. States will allocate only the level of tax credits necessary for \nfinancial feasibility. Ten percent of the available credit will be set \naside for nonprofit organizations.\n  The eligible areas for the tax credit are defined as Census Tracts \nwith median income below 80 percent of the area or state median. Rural \nareas that are currently eligible for USDA housing programs will be \neligible for the tax credit. Indian tribal lands will be eligible for \nthe tax credit. State-identified areas of chronic economic distress \nwill be eligible for the tax credit, subject to disapproval by the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development\n  Those eligible to buy homes built or refurbished using the tax credit \ninclude: individuals with incomes up to 80 percent of the area or state \nmedian and up to 100 percent of area median income in low-income/high-\npoverty Census Tracts.\n  Individual states will write plans for allocating the tax credits \nusing the following selection criteria: contribution of the development \nto community stability and revitalization; community and local \ngovernment support; need for homeownership development in the area; \nsponsor capability; and the long-term sustainability of the project as \nowner-occupied residences. Individual developers along with investors \nthen can apply to the State to be awarded a tax credit for developing a \nproperty in a low- or moderate-income area. If chosen by the State, \ninvestors can start to claim the tax credits as the homes are sold to \neligible buyers. They can continue to claim the tax credit over five \nyears. Investors are not subject to recapture. If the home owner sold \nthe residence within five years, a scale would determine the percentage \nof the gain would be recaptured by the Federal Government. In the first \ntwo years, 100 percent of the gain and 80, 70 and 60 percent in the \nthird, fourth, and fifth years, respectively would be recaptured.\n  This legislation is supported by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, \nFannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Enterprise Foundation, Local Initiatives \nSupport Coalition, Mortgage Bankers Association of America, National \nAssociation of Home Builders, National Low Income Housing Coalition, \nNational Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies, National \nAssociation of Realtors, National Council of La Raza, National Hispanic \nHousing Conference, Habitat for Humanity International and others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/16/senate-section/article/S10587-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10587-S10588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 342--COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND WORK OF STEPHEN E. \n                                AMBROSE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nLott,\n\n[[Page S10588]]\n\nMr. Feingold, and Mr. Reid) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Revolutionary advancements in computing and \n     communications technology have interconnected government, \n     commercial, scientific, and educational infrastructures--\n     including critical infrastructures for electric power, \n     natural gas and petroleum production and distribution, \n     telecommunications, transportation, water supply, banking and \n     finance, and emergency and government services--in a vast, \n     interdependent physical and electronic network.\n       (2) Exponential increases in interconnectivity have \n     facilitated enhanced communications, economic growth, and the \n     delivery of services critical to the public welfare, but have \n     also increased the consequences of temporary or prolonged \n     failure.\n       (3) A Department of Defense Joint Task Force concluded \n     after a 1997 United States information warfare exercise that \n     the results ``clearly demonstrated our lack of preparation \n     for a coordinated cyber and physical attack on our critical \n     military and civilian infrastructure''.\n       (4) Computer security technology and systems implementation \n     lack--\n       (A) sufficient long term research funding;\n       (B) adequate coordination across Federal and State \n     government agencies and among government, academia, and \n     industry; and\n       (C) sufficient numbers of outstanding researchers in the \n     field.\n       (5) Accordingly, Federal investment in computer and network \n     security research and development must be significantly \n     increased to--\n       (A) improve vulnerability assessment and technological and \n     systems solutions;\n       (B) expand and improve the pool of information security \n     professionals, including researchers, in the United States \n     workforce; and\n       (C) better coordinate information sharing and collaboration \n     among industry, government, and academic research projects.\n       (6) While African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native \n     Americans constitute 25 percent of the total United States \n     workforce and 30 percent of the college-age population, \n     members of these minorities comprise less than 7 percent of \n     the United States computer and information science workforce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today the Senate will pass the Product \nPackaging Protection Act of 2002. This bill will help prevent and \npunish a disturbing trend of product tampering--the placement of hate-\nfilled literature into the boxes of cereal or food that millions of \nAmericans bring home from the grocery store every day. I am pleased to \nhave worked on this legislation with Senators Hatch, Leahy, DeWine, and \nDurbin, as well as Chairman Sensenbrenner, Congressman Scott, \nCongresswoman Baldwin and Congresswoman Hart.\n  Too many Americans have recently opened groceries and found \noffensive, racist, anti-Semitic, pornographic and hateful leaflets. In \nthe last few years, food manufacturers have received numerous \ncomplaints from consumers who report finding such literature. Hundreds \nmore incidents have likely gone unreported. This behavior is outright \nshameful.\n  Unfortunately, when consumers or companies turn to the authorities, \nthey cannot be helped. According to the FBI and the Food and Drug \nAdministration's Office of Criminal Investigation, these actions are \nnot covered by federal product tampering statutes. A loophole in \nFederal anti-tampering law allows it to go unpunished. And only a \ncouple of state laws are in place. So, the Product Packaging Protection \nAct of 2002 will close this loophole ion Federal product tampering law \nand protect consumers.\n  I am pleased that the Senate will pass this measure today. We hope \nthat the House of Representatives will take it up the legislation in a \ntimely manner. Then, consumers will be able to rest a little easier \nwhen it comes to the safety of the products they purchase at their \nlocal grocery store. The Product Packaging Protection Act is a small\n\n[[Page S10594]]\n\nbut meaningful thing we can do to make our current laws more effective \nand to give consumers and companies the help they need.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Kohl \nsubstitute amendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread three times and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate will pass the Product \nPackaging Protection Act of 2002. This bill will help prevent and \npunish a disturbing trend of product tampering--the placement of hate-\nfilled literature into the boxes of cereal or food that millions of \nAmericans bring home from the grocery store every day. I am pleased to \nhave worked on this legislation with Senators Hatch, Leahy, DeWine, and \nDurbin, as well as Chairman Sensenbrenner, Congressman Scott, \nCongresswoman Baldwin, and Congresswoman Hart.\n  Too many Americans have recently opened groceries and found \noffensive, racist, anti-Semitic, pornographic and hateful leaflets. In \nthe last few years, food manufacturers have received numerous \ncomplaints from consumers who report finding such literature. Hundreds \nmore incidents have likely gone unreported. This behavior is outright \nshameful.\n  Unfortunately, when consumers or companies turn to the authorities, \nthey cannot be helped. According to the FBI and the Food and Drug \nAdministration's Office of Criminal Investigation, these actions are \nnot covered by federal product tampering statutes. A loophole in \nFederal anti-tampering law allows it to go unpunished. And only a \ncouple of state laws are in place. So, the Product Packaging Protection \nAct of 2002 will close this loophole in Federal product tampering law \nand protect consumers.\n  I am pleased that the Senate will pass this measure today. We hope \nthat the House of Representatives will take up the legislation in a \ntimely manner. Then, consumers will be able to rest a little easier \nwhen it comes to safety of the products they purchase at their local \ngrocery store. The Product Packaging Protection Act is a small but \nmeaningful thing we can do to make our current laws more effective and \nto give consumers and companies the help they need.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Kohl \nsubstitute amendment at the desk be agreed to, the committee substitute \namendment be agreed to, as amended, the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate and that any statements \nrelating to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       [Congress makes the following findings:\n       [(1) The Peace Corps was established in 1961 to promote \n     world peace and friendship through the service of American \n     volunteers abroad.\n       [(2) The three goals codified in the Peace Corps Act which \n     have guided the Peace Corps and its volunteers over the \n     years, can work in concert to promote global acceptance of \n     the principles of international peace and nonviolent \n     coexistence among peoples of diverse cultures and systems of \n     government.\n       [(3) The Peace Corps has operated in 135 countries with \n     165,000 Peace Corps volunteers since its establishment.\n       [(4) The Peace Corps has sought to fulfill three goals, as \n     follows: to help people in developing nations meet basic \n     needs, to promote understanding of America's values and \n     ideals abroad, and to promote an understanding of other \n     peoples by Americans.\n       [(5) After more than 40 years of operation, the Peace Corps \n     remains the world's premier international service \n     organization dedicated to promoting grassroots development.\n       [(6) The Peace Corps remains committed to sending well \n     trained and well supported Peace Corps volunteers overseas to \n     promote world peace, friendship, and grassroots development.\n       [(7) The Peace Corps is an independent agency, and \n     therefore no Peace Corps personnel or volunteers should have \n     any relationship with any United States intelligence agency \n     or be used to accomplish any other goal than the goals \n     established by the Peace Corps Act.\n       [(8) The Crisis Corps has been an effective tool in \n     harnessing the skills and talents for returned Peace Corps \n     volunteers and should be expanded to utilize to the maximum \n     extent the pool of talent from the returned Peace Corps \n     volunteer community.\n       [(9) The Peace Corps is currently operating with an annual \n     budget of $275,000,000 in 70 countries with 7,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       [(10) There is deep misunderstanding and misinformation \n     about American values and ideals in many parts of the world, \n     particularly those with substantial Muslim populations, and a \n     greater Peace Corps presence in such places could foster \n     greater understanding and tolerance of those countries.\n       [(11) Congress has declared that the Peace Corps should be \n     expanded to sponsor a minimum of 10,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       [(12) President George W. Bush has called for the doubling \n     of the number of Peace Corps volunteers in service in a \n     fiscal year to 15,000 volunteers in service by the end of \n     fiscal year 2007.\n       [(13) Any expansion of the Peace Corps shall not jeopardize \n     the quality of the Peace Corps volunteer experience, and \n     therefore can only be accomplished by an appropriate increase \n     in field and headquarters support staff.\n       [(14) It would be extremely useful for the Peace Corps to \n     establish an office of strategic planning to evaluate \n     existing programs and undertake long-term planning in order \n     to facilitate the orderly expansion of the Peace Corps from \n     its current size to the stated objective of 15,000 volunteers \n     in the field by the end of fiscal year 2007.\n       [(15) The Peace Corps would benefit from the advice and \n     council of a streamlined bipartisan National Peace Corps \n     Advisory Council composed of distinguished returned Peace \n     Corps volunteers.\n\n     [SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Peace Corps Charter for the \n     21st Century Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Peace Corps was established in 1961 to promote \n     world peace and friendship through the service of American \n     volunteers abroad.\n       (2) The three goals codified in the Peace Corps Act which \n     have guided the Peace Corps and its volunteers over the \n     years, can work in concert to promote global acceptance of \n     the principles of international peace and nonviolent \n     coexistence among peoples of diverse cultures and systems of \n     government.\n       (3) The Peace Corps has operated in 135 countries with \n     165,000 Peace Corps volunteers since its establishment.\n       (4) The Peace Corps has sought to fulfill three goals, as \n     follows: to help people in developing nations meet basic \n     needs, to promote understanding of America's values and \n     ideals abroad, and to promote an understanding of other \n     peoples by Americans.\n       (5) After more than 40 years of operation, the Peace Corps \n     remains the world's premier international service \n     organization dedicated to promoting grassroots development.\n       (6) The Peace Corps remains committed to sending well \n     trained and well supported Peace Corps volunteers overseas to \n     promote peace, friendship, and international understanding.\n       (7) The Peace Corps is an independent agency, and therefore \n     no Peace Corps personnel or volunteers should be used to \n     accomplish any other goal than the goals established by the \n     Peace Corps Act.\n       (8) The Crisis Corps has been an effective tool in \n     harnessing the skills and talents for returned Peace Corps \n     volunteers and should be expanded to utilize to the maximum \n     extent the talent pool of returned Peace Corps volunteers.\n       (9) The Peace Corps is currently operating with an annual \n     budget of $275,000,000 in 70 countries with 7,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       (10) There is deep misunderstanding and misinformation \n     about American values and ideals in many parts of the world, \n     particularly those with substantial Muslim populations, and a \n     greater Peace Corps presence in such places could foster \n     greater understanding and tolerance.\n       (11) Congress has declared that the Peace Corps should be \n     expanded to sponsor a minimum of 10,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       (12) President George W. Bush has called for the doubling \n     of the number of Peace Corps volunteers in service.\n       (13) Any expansion of the Peace Corps shall not jeopardize \n     the quality of the Peace Corps volunteer experience, and \n     therefore can only be accomplished by an appropriate increase \n     in field and headquarters support staff.\n       (14) In order to ensure that proposed expansion of the \n     Peace Corps preserves the integrity of the program and the \n     security of volunteers, the integrated Planning and Budget \n     System supported by the Office of Planning and Policy \n     Analysis should continue its focus on strategic planning.\n       (15) A streamlined, bipartisan National Peace Corps \n     Advisory Council composed of distinguished returned Peace \n     Corps volunteers and other individuals, with diverse \n     backgrounds and expertise, can be a source of ideas and \n     suggestions that may be useful to the Director of the\n\n[[Page S10597]]\n\n     Peace Corps as he discharges his duties and responsibilities \n     as head of the agency.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil action \ncommenced in the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia against Secretary Jeri Thomson, Financial Clerk Timothy \nWineman, their counterparts in the House of Representatives, the \nCongress, and the United States.\n  The plaintiff in this case, Mr. Michael Newdow, is the individual \nchallenging the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance in \nCalifornia. Mr. Newdow alleges in this action that the disbursement of \npublic funds to the offices of the congressional chaplains violates the \nFirst and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution, and Article VI.\n  Both the United States Supreme Court and the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit have already established \nthe constitutionality of the congressional chaplaincies, which date \nfrom 1789. In the landmark Supreme Court decision Marsh v. Chambers, \n463 U.S. 783 (1983), the Supreme Court unequivocally rejected a \nchallenge to the constitutionality of Nebraska's legislative chaplain. \nIt stated that given the ``unambiguous and unbroken history'' of \nlegislative chaplains, the ``practice of opening legislative sessions \nwith prayer has become part of the fabric of our society'' and is not \n``an `establishment' of religion or a step toward establishment; it is \nsimply a tolerable acknowledgement of beliefs widely held among the \npeople of this country.'' Id. at 792. Several months later, the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, sitting \nen banc, dismissed a constitutional challenge to the Congressional \nchaplains. Murray v. Buchanan, 720 F.2d 689 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (en banc). \nIt stated that the Supreme Court ``answered the question presented in \nMarsh with unmistakable clarity: The `practice of opening each \nlegislative day with a prayer by chaplain paid by the State [does not] \nviolate[] the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.' '' Id. at \n690 (quoting Marsh, 463 U.S. at 784).\n  This resolution authorizes the Senate legal counsel to represent \nSecretary Thompson and Mr. Wineman to seek dismissal of this action.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution and \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements in relation thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 344) to authorize representation by \n     the Senate Legal Counsel in Manshardt v. Federal Judicial \n     Qualifications Committee, et al.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, an unsuccessful applicant for U.S. \nAttorney in Los Angeles has commenced a civil action in Federal court \nin California against Senator Feinstein, Senator Boxer, a prominent \nRepublican businessman and political leader in California, and a \njudicial screening panel set up by these defendants, to challenge the \nuse of this screening panel to identify potential nominees for Federal \nDistrict Court judgeships in California. Specifically, the plaintiff \nalleges that the use of informal screening panels to develop lists of \npotential judicial nominees violates the Federal Advisory Committee \nAct, the Government in the Sunshine Act, and the separation of powers.\n  The laws underlying this suite do not apply to the Senate, and the \nSpeech or Debate Clause bars suits against legislators for the \nperformance of their duties under the Constitution. Thus, there is no \nlegal basis for suing Senators for their role in forming, appointing, \nor relying on judicial screening panels.\n  Further, the use of informal judicial selection panels to identify \npotential judicial nominees as a part of the advice and consent \nfunction has a long and respected history. Also, the Supreme Court's \nholding in Public Citizen versus U.S. Department of Justice that the \nFederal Advisory Committee Act does not apply to the longstanding \npractice of soliciting views on prospective judicial nominees from an \nAmerican Bar Association committee provides ample support for the \nchallenged practice.\n  This resolution would authorize the Senate legal counsel to represent \nthe Senators sued in this action to protect their role in the advice \nand consent process by which the President and the Senate share \nresponsibility for the appointment of Federal judges under the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, \nand that any statements in relation thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to Calendar No. 549, S. 2182.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2182) to authorize funding for the computer and \n     network security research and development and research \n     fellowship programs, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n Checklist Provision--Cyber Security Research and Development Act, HR \n                                  3394\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with the \nranking member of the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee of \nthe Commerce Committee, Senator Allen, regarding the provisions of H.R. \n3394 that provide for the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology, NIST, to develop checklists for widely used software \nproducts.\n  Mr. ALLEN. The committee, particularly Senators Wyden and Edwards, \nworking with NIST and industry, have reached agreement on this \nprovision. We recognize that there is no ``one-size-fits-all'' \nconfiguration for any hardware or software systems. We have given NIST \nflexibility in choosing which checklists to develop and update. We have \nnot required any Federal agency to use the specific settings and \noptions recommended by these checklists.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The ranking member is correct. Our intent with this \nprovision is not to develop separate checklists for every possible \nFederal configuration. Rather, the checklists would provide agencies \nwith recommendations that will improve the quality and security of the \nsettings and options they select. The use of any checklist should, of \ncourse, be consistent with guidance from the Office of Management and \nBudget.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I agree with the chairman.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the \nSenate's passage of the Cybersecurity Research and Development Act.\n  Americans today live in an increasingly networked world. The spread \nof the Internet creates lots of great new opportunities. But there is \nalso a downside: security risks. The Internet connects people not just \nto friends, potential customers, and useful sources of information, but \nalso to would-be hackers, viruses, and cybercriminals.\n  In July 2001, after I became chairman of the Science and Technology \nSubcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee, I chose cybersecurity as \nthe topic for my first hearing. The message from that hearing was that \ncybersecurity risks are mounting. And that was before the horrific \nattacks of September 11 hammered home the point that there are \ndetermined, organized enemies of this country who wish to wreak as much \nhavoc as they can. The terrorists are looking for vulnerabilities, and \nthey are not technological simpletons.\n  This legislation is essential to the Nation's effort to address \ncybersecurity threats. It is a necessary complement to both the \nhomeland security legislation pending in Congress and to the draft \ncybersecurity strategy released on September 18 by the administration. \nBecause reorganizing the Federal Government to deal more effectively \nwith security threats is only part of the battle. The same goes for \nmany of the steps called for in the Administration's cybersecurity \nstrategy.\n  In the long run, all Government and private sector cybersecurity \nefforts depend on people--trained experts with the knowledge and skills \nto develop innovate solutions and respond creatively and proactively to \nevolving threats. Without a strong core of cybersecurity experts, no \namount of good intentions and no amount of Government reorganizing will \nbe sufficient to keep this country one step ahead of hackers and \ncyberterrorists.\n  Therefore, this legislation makes a strong commitment to support \nbasic cybersecurity research, so that the country's pool of top-flight \ncybersecurity experts can keep pace with the evolving risks. \nSpecifically, the bill authorizes $978 million over five years to \ncreate new cybersecurity research and development programs at the \nNational Science Foundation, NSF, and the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, NIST. The NSF program will provide funding \nfor innovative research, multidisciplinary academic centers devoted to \ncybersecurity, and new courses and fellowships to educate the \ncybersecurity experts of the future. The NIST program likewise will \nsupport cutting-edge cybersecurity research, with a special emphasis on \npromoting cooperative efforts between government, industry, and \nacademia.\n  All of these programs will support advanced cybersecurity research at \na\n\n[[Page S10600]]\n\nbasic, non-applied level, some of which may not pay off for a number of \nyears. Nonetheless, it is my strong expectation that as this \nfundamental research yields results, those results will be made \navailable promptly to the private sector, where they will serve as the \nfoundation for a wide range of practical, tangible cybersecurity \nimprovements, products, and solutions. This kind of commercialization \nof the results of Federal investment in computer and network security \nresearch is consistent with long-standing U.S. technology transfer \npolicy, and will serve the national interest in enhancing the security \nand reliability of cyberspace for commercial, academic, and individual \nusers, as well as Federal and state governments.\n\n  I should also note that, in addition to the extramural research \ngrants at NSF and NIST, the bill will support NIST's ongoing \ncybersecurity research. Americans for Computer Privacy, the Business \nSoftware Alliance, the Information Technology Association of America, \nthe Information Technology Industry Council, the Software & Information \nIndustry Association, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce noted in a \nrecent letter to Senators Lieberman and Thompson that NIST's Computer \nSecurity Division's ``job is to improve the security of civilian \ncomputer systems through technical standards and cooperation with \nindustry.'' This legislation will provide funding to support NIST in \ncontinuing that work.\n  There is broad consensus on the need for this legislation. It has \nalready passed the House by an overwhelming bipartisan vote, thanks to \nthe leadership of Congressman Sherry Boehlert. I introduced the Senate \nversion, S. 2182, and the ranking member of the Science and Technology \nSubcommittee, Senator Allen, joined me in shepherding it through the \nCommerce Committee. We worked closely with Senator Edwards on \nprovisions to help Federal Government agencies safeguard the security \nof their computer systems. And we worked closely with businesses and \nexperts in the cybersecurity field, to ensure widespread support within \nthe high tech industry.\n  Specifically, I would like to mention a few changes that have been \nmade to the bill since we reported the bill from the Commerce \nCommittee. The most significant changes to the bill came in working \nwith Senator Edwards and cybersecurity businesses and experts to give \nfederal agencies additional tools to strengthen the security of their \ncomputer systems, while at the same time encouraging innovation and \nallowing agencies the flexibility to adopt a variety of cybersecurity \nproducts.\n  In addition, working with our colleagues on the House Science \nCommittee, we adjusted the list of research areas of basic NSF research \ngrants. No list could ever encompass every computer security \ntechnology, and for that reason the list is not exclusive. The \nintention was simply to give some general examples of broad research \nareas, without naming specific technologies. But obviously, when \nindividual grants are awarded, they may well focus on particular \ntechnologies that are not listed by name in the final version of the \nbill, such as digital watermarking.\n  Another change is the delection of a cost-sharing provision added in \ncommittee. Instead, the bill language makes it clear that research \ngrants under the NIST cybersecurity research program will be awarded to \ninstitutions of higher education rather than directly funding industry \nresearch.\n  I thank my Senate colleague for taking up and approving this timely \nlegislation. The stakes are high, and you can bet that hackers and \ncyberterrorists won't stand still. So it is important to launch these \nnew cybersecurity research programs as soon as possible. I believe this \nlegislation needs to be enacted into law this fall, and I urge the \nHouse and the President to move swiftly to ensure that happens.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleagues for their \nunanimous support of S. 2182, the Cyber Security Research & Development \nAct. I would also like to thank Senator Wyden for his leadership and \ncontinued work on pushing this important measure through the \nlegislative process.\n  S. 2182 addresses the important issue of cyber security. As our \nreliance on technology and the Internet have grown over the past \ndecade, our vulnerability to attacks on the Nation's critical \ninfrastructure and networked systems has also grown exponentially. The \nhigh degree of interdependence between information systems exposes \nAmerica's network infrastructure to both benign and destructive \ndisruptions. Such cyber attacks can take several forms, including: \ndefacement of web sites; denial of service; virus infection throughout \nthe computer network; and unauthorized intrusions and sabotage of \nsystems and networks resulting in critical infrastructure outages and \ncorruption of vital data.\n  Past attacks, such as the Code Red virus, show the types of danger \nand potential disruption cyber attacks can have on our Nation's \ninfrastructure. The cyber threats before this country are significant \nand are unfortunately only getting more complicated and sophisticated \nas time goes on.\n  A survey last year by the Computer Security Institute and FBI found \nthat 85 percent of 538 respondents experienced computer intrusions. \nCarnegie Mellon University's CERT Coordination Center, which serves as \na reporting center for Internet security problems, received 2,437 \nvulnerability reports in calendar year 2001, almost 6 times the number \nin 1999. Similarly, the number of specific incidents reported to CERT \nexploded from 9,589 in 1999 to 52,658 in 2001. What is alarming is that \nCERT estimates these statistics may only represent 20% of the incidents \nthat actually have occurred.\n\n  A recent public opinion survey indicates that over 70 percent of \nAmericans are concerned about computer security and 74 percent are \nconcerned about terrorist using the Internet to launch a cyber-attack \nagainst our country's infrastructure. One survey shows that half of all \ninformation technology professionals believe that a major attack will \nbe launched against the Federal Government in the next 12 months.\n  Indeed, cyber security is essential to both homeland security and \nnational security. The Internet's security and reliability support the \neconomy, critical infrastructures and national defense. At a time when \nuncertainty threatens confidence in our nation's preparedness, the \nFederal Government needs to make information and cyber security a \npriority.\n  Currently, federally funded research on cyber security is less than \n$60 million per year. Experts believe that fewer than 100 United States \nresearchers have the experience and expertise to conduct cutting edge \nresearch in cyber security.\n  The Cyber Security Research and Development Act will play a major \nrole in fostering greater research in methods to prevent future cyber \nattacks and design more secure networks. Our legislation will harness \nand link the intellectual power of the National Science Foundation, the \nNational Institute of Science and Technology, our Nation's \nuniversities, and private industry to develop new and improved computer \ncryptography and authentication, firewalls, computer forensics, \nintrusion detection, wireless security and systems management.\n  In addition, our bill is designed to draw more college undergraduate \nand graduate students into the field of cyber security research. It \nestablishes programs to use internships, research opportunities, and \nbetter equipment to engage students in this field. America is a leader \nin the computer hardware and software development. In order to preserve \nAmerica's technological edge, we must have a continuous pipeline of new \nstudents involved in computer science study and research.\n  S. 2182 highlights the role the Federal Government will play in \nhelping prepare and prevent cyber attacks, but only if we can ensure \nthe cutting edge research and technology funded in this legislation is \nmade commercially available.\n  Clearly, there is an urgent need for private sector, academic, and \nindividual users as well as the Federal and State governments to deploy \nsecurity innovations. I am confident that the federal investment for \nlong-term projects outlined in this legislation will yield significant \nresults to enhance the security and reliability of cyberspace.\n  I am glad to see the Senate come together and pass this important \nlegislation and again thank my colleague from Oregon for his \nleadership. I have truly enjoyed working with him for the\n\n[[Page S10601]]\n\nsuccessful passage of this positive and constructive legislation that \nwill improve the security of Americans.\n  Mr. REID.
