Mr. President, let me take a couple of minutes to speak \non a couple of subjects which I feel very strongly about and that we \nare facing.\n  First of all, I want to talk about energy. Certainly, during this \nwhole year we have been giving consideration to and having some \nemphasis on energy. The public interest has been higher, and we have \nproblems. When gas prices are higher, everybody recognizes the issue \nthat we have with energy. But when those settle down a little, the \nproblem is still there. We in the Congress have tried to deal with it \nfor this whole year. Now we are in the process of having a conference \ncommittee try to come out with conclusions. I just wanted to urge that \nwe move forward with the conference committee and that we finally come \nup with an energy policy in this country. We do not have one.\n  We find ourselves in the position of being nearly 60 percent \ndependent on importation of oil in order to meet our needs. We don't \nwant to be in that position, particularly with the unrest in the Middle \nEast from where much of our oil comes. We certainly need to find \nsolutions that will make us less dependent. It is not only an energy \nissue, it affects our economy. I do not know of anything that affects \nour economy more than energy. We use energy when we turn on our lights, \nwhen we have heat, and when we have air-conditioning.\n  In terms of the economy itself, nothing is more important than \nenergy.\n  I am hopeful that we can move forward. We have put together a \nconference committee. The House bill is somewhat less extensive than \nthe Senate bill. On the other hand, certainly there are a great many \nthings in which there is common interests. Someone reviewed it and \nfound that there are probably 55 issues in which we have a common \ninterest.\n\n[[Page S6814]]\n\n  We need to move forward. We are ready to do something. The committee \nhas not yet actually met. Staff is meeting. I just can't say how \nimportant it is for us to move forward and complete that conference \ncommittee and bring those issues back to the Senate and the House \nbefore the September time expires.\n  We are talking, of course, not only about the idea of having \nincreased production in our country, which we can have, we are also \ncognizant about renewables. We are talking about research to make coal \ncleaner for the air. We are talking about all kinds of issues with a \nbalance between production and conservation. That is what we ought to \nbe doing in policy.\n  I am really anxious that we find a way to move forward. Obviously, \nthere are some issues on which there is disagreement: For example, an \nopportunity to have production in ANWR on the North Slope, which is \npart of the House bill and not part of the Senate bill. We ought to \nresolve that and come to a conclusion. That ought not be what holds up \nhaving an energy policy in this country. We can deal with the idea of \nhaving access to public lands so we can have production. And we can \nconserve and protect the environment at the same time. We have done \nthat for a very long time in the West where most of the public land is \nlocated. We can do that.\n  There are those who try to make the point that if you have access to \nthe land, it suddenly is going to be spoiled, and so on. That doesn't \nneed to be the case. There are ways in which we can have effective \nproduction and at the same time have effective maintenance. Obviously, \nthere are areas in which we don't want to have that kind of use, \nwhether it be wilderness or the national parks or special parts of the \nforest. But, in general, half of Wyoming belongs to the Federal \nGovernment. The largest percentage of that is Bureau of Land Management \nlands. Those are lands that ought to be available under law for \nmultiple use. Certainly, it should be used carefully. We want to do \nthat.\n  There is also a great debate over what we do in terms of trying to \nget better efficiency out of our energy. And we can do that. There is a \ngreat debate on CAFE standards and mileage standards and whether that \nought to be the best we can do or whether that ought to be put in law \nover a certain length of time. Again, we can resolve those issues.\n  The idea of using ethanol can also be resolved. We need to work at \nit.\n  The other issue that obviously is going to be on the floor right away \nis one that we have worked on in the Finance Committee for some time; \nthat is, prescription drugs and pharmaceuticals, which we will be \ntalking about today, and, as I understand it, from the leader's \ncomments, probably for the next 2 weeks, which is fine. It is an issue \nthat really needs to be resolved. Obviously, it impacts a great many \npeople in this country, particularly those on Social Security, the \nelderly.\n\n  More and more, we find ourselves utilizing pharmaceuticals. \nHopefully, that has been helpful to health care. Utilization is one of \nthe reasons, of course, the costs per individual have gone up, in \naddition to the price of pharmaceuticals.\n  In the Finance Committee we worked on this bill, which is where the \njurisdiction is. But I am disappointed that coming to the floor with a \nbill that has been approved by the committee is apparently not going to \nhappen. The leader is going to go ahead and has already put a bill on \nthe floor that has to do more with the patent rights than it does on \nthe whole question of pharmaceuticals, and then to bring a bill as he \nchooses to do it as opposed to the committee approving a bill.\n  Interestingly enough, that is exactly what happened with energy. The \nbill was taken out of the Energy Committee by the leadership here, and \nthen we dealt with it on the floor for I don't remember how many weeks. \nBut that is not the way we are supposed to work.\n  We have committees and committees are supposed to report and bring \ntheir recommendations to the floor so that the great detail of these \nthings has already been done. When you do not do that, then it comes to \nthe floor, and we find ourselves, as we are now, frankly, behind in the \nwork we ought to be doing towards the end of this session, and largely \nbecause of the idea of going around the committees and then bringing \nthese controversial issues to the floor.\n  I do not think pharmaceuticals are controversial in terms of us \nwanting to deal with it, but there are lots of things in it. It is a \nvery difficult issue. I am disappointed--if that is finally the way it \nworks out--that we don't have a bill reported from the committee of \njurisdiction.\n  It is a tough issue. There are lots of issues to talk about. Who \nshould be the beneficiaries of a pharmaceuticals program of this kind? \nThere are some who want it for everyone. There are some who want it \nsimply as part of Medicare. And then, should the emphasis be on low-\nincome individuals or should it be for everyone? I do not know the \nanswer, but that is one of the issues that has to be talked about.\n  What can we do in terms of trying to get better prices, in terms of \nhaving prescription drugs available for people to buy? Or do we simply \nwant to subsidize them at whatever price comes out? It is a very \ndifficult issue, and one with which we have to deal.\n  Since we are talking about a kind of stand-alone situation with \npharmaceuticals, we have to talk about a delivery system. How do you do \nthis? How do you do this to allow for the local pharmaceutical, the \nlocal drug stores, the local pharmacies to be able to participate, as \nwell as mail distributors? I think that is very important, particularly \nfor those of us in rural communities. We need to make sure the drug \nsystem--whatever we come up with--and the delivery system are available \nin rural areas. We find some problems with that generally in terms of \nhealth insurance. In low-population areas, there are not the choices \navailable as in other places. We need to ensure that is the case.\n  And then there is the cost, of course. There are at least three \nproposals that will be before us. One of them--I think it is called the \nGraham bill--will be one that gives very extensive coverage but over a \n10-year period costs nearly $1 trillion, apparently. At least that is \nthe best sort of pricing that we can get so far.\n\n  There is one that is the tripartisan bill. That comes out to a price \nof about $370 billion over 10 years. Again, it is difficult to get the \nscoring on these, but we have that.\n  And then, of course, there is another proposal out there. I think it \nis the Hagel bill. That is largely one in which there is a group \npurchasing process, and you would belong to the purchasing card \narrangement and basically use the idea of volume to be able to have \nsubstantially less cost. I think it would cost about $150 billion. I \nnever thought I would be talking about $150 billion being less, but \nthat, nevertheless, is the way it is.\n  So we are faced with some tough decisions. Unfortunately, we will not \nhave a committee-approved bill before us to deal with, I am afraid. The \ndifficulty with that, of course, is that in the Senate we also do not \nhave a budget; therefore, a point of order rises on anything that is \nabove what was considered to be in the budget, which is $300 billion. \nSo a point of order can be raised on two of these three bills that I \nmentioned; and then it takes 60 votes to get those passed. If there are \nnot 60 votes, they will not be successful.\n  I think we find ourselves in a real difficult situation in dealing \nwith something that almost everyone wants to complete. Unfortunately, \nit now becomes something of a political issue in terms of what you can \ndo during the election period to talk about what an advocate you were \non the floor. That should not be the purpose. The purpose ought to be \nto come up with a workable program designed to deal with the people in \nmost need of assistance, designed to have a delivery system that gives \npeople some choices which comes through the private sector; and those \nchoices would exist all around the country, not simply in cities and \nhighly urbanized areas, with some control over cost.\n  We are finding ourselves, obviously, in a great spending spree. Part \nof it, of course, is the result of terrorism and some of the events \nthat have happened, and partly as a result of less revenue coming in as \na part of the economy.\n  So I guess on balance I am saying we find ourselves in a tough \nposition. I\n\n[[Page S6815]]\n\nhope we can zero in on what it is we want to accomplish and find the \nbest method of accomplishing that and get it done in the very near \nfuture.\n  So I think we have lots of challenges before us. I mentioned a \ncouple: energy, pharmaceuticals. We ought to be able to get a budget so \nwe have limitations on our spending. In the Senate, we obviously have \nnot yet begun to deal with the 13 bills that we need on appropriations. \nWe have not started on that.\n  So I think we have allowed ourselves to get into a pretty tight \nsituation in terms of dealing with the issues. I am pleased that \nyesterday we were able to at least complete something in the accounting \narea that will deal with some of the problems we have seen in terms of \ncorporate misbehavior. Hopefully, that will work. So I just wish we \ncould move and get on with the work we know we have to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton).

Madam President, last Friday, July 12, the 14th \nInternational Conference on AIDS closed in Barcelona, Spain. This \nyear's theme was ``Knowledge and Commitment for Action.''\n  More than 14,000 doctors, activists, and government officials \ngathered in Barcelona for the largest AIDS conference ever.\n  At the last conference, hosted in Durban, South Africa, in the year \n2000, the concluding plan, by all the nations that assembled, was to \ntake action on the following items: To spread the use of condoms as a \nmeans of avoiding infection; to curb mother-to-child transmission of \nAIDS and HIV; to empower women to choose their relationships and method \nof contraception freely; and, finally, to educate people about the \nrisks.\n  The last 2 years have shown that all four of these activities can be \ndone successfully.\n  Another success achieved in the past 2 years is the focus shift to \nproviding treatment for all. This has been a result of lower drug costs \nand the realization that people will not get tested unless there is \nhope of treatment.\n  The opening session featured the Barcelona Declaration, which called \nfor action on the following goals by the year 2004: Secure a donation \nof $10 billion per year for Global AIDS--$10 billion--provide 2 million \npeople in the developing world with antiretroviral treatment; third, \nprovide affordable drug treatment in the developed world and universal \naccess to generic brand drugs in the developing world; and fourth, \ndevelop a new global partnership between government and nongovernment \norganizations, recognizing the crucial roles that NGOs play in the \nfight against AIDS.\n\n  The Barcelona conference has brought a great deal of attention to \nHIV/AIDS. Newspapers daily provide America with devastating facts. \nUNAIDS warns that the AIDS epidemic is just starting. An estimated 5 \nmillion new HIV infections occurred worldwide during 2001. That is \nabout 15,000 infections every single day. More than 95 percent of these \noccur in developing countries. In 2001, 5 infections each minute \noccurred in young people age 15 to 24, approximately 6,000 young people \nin total. Worldwide, 13.4 million children have lost at least 1 parent \nto AIDS. That number is expected to grow to more than 25 million by the \nyear 2010.\n  We tend to view AIDS and its growth as a Third World problem. We hear \nthe statistics: 40 million infected people in sub-Saharan Africa; 15 \nmillion AIDS orphans or more in sub-Saharan Africa; projections by the \nWorld Bank that there will be over 20 million infected people in India \nalone in the next 5 to 10 years; all of the talk about China and \nRussia.\n  Never should we overlook the problem in the United States. AIDS is \nstill a problem; HIV infection is a reality. It is growing particularly \namong the African-American population in America. It is growing \nparticularly among heterosexuals and among women. This is a problem we \nhave not conquered. In fact, we have not confronted it honestly in the \nUnited States for too long a period of time.\n  UNAIDS has just issued a report on the situation in China. The report \nis called ``China's Titanic Peril'' because the U.N. agency said, if \nChina doesn't act now, this boat will sink. The Chinese Government \nestimates 850,000 are infected. The U.N. report indicates the Chinese \nGovernment lacks political commitment and thus far has not provided \nsufficient resources to deal with it. Seventeen percent of the people \nin China have never heard of the disease. China, India, and Indonesia \nare on the brink of outbreaks that could dwarf the current epidemic.\n  AIDS is the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa. More than \n28 million Africans are infected with it. HIV/AIDS weakens economic and \npolitical stability, national security, and agricultural output, all \nnecessary for continued development.\n  The cost of AIDS rises each minute that the epidemic grows. Without a \ndrastic change in the global approach to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it is \nexpected that an additional 45 million people will be living with AIDS \nby 2010. From the facts reported in the daily newspapers, it is clear \nthat current spending levels are grievously insufficient to address the \nglobal epidemic.\n  In 1993, experts asked the world for $2 billion annually to slow the \nspread and to save $900 billion in associated costs. Only recently, the \nlevel of global spending has climbed to $2.8 billion. Think of that, a \n9-year period of time when we did not respond to this epidemic as it \nspun out of control. This is well below the actual need today of $10 \nbillion every year to fight this epidemic that is circling the globe.\n  A World Health Organization mathematical model estimates that only $9 \nbillion can be usefully spent per year: $4.8 billion on prevention, \n$4.2 billion on treatment. This number assumes the medical \ninfrastructures in developing countries will remain at current \ncapacities. Jeffrey Sachs, a well-known development economist based at \nColumbia University in New York, suggests that investing in \ninfrastructures would raise the yearly cost to about $15 billion.\n\n  I have been to some of these countries suffering with AIDS. Many of \nmy colleagues have. You see that the medical infrastructure is \nvirtually primitive. Not only do they not have clinics, they don't have \nwater that is safe to drink. Imagine trying to treat an epidemic under \nthose conditions. An investment in the public health infrastructures of \nthese countries can mean we could put money into stopping and slowing \nthis epidemic.\n  The United States spends more than $10 billion domestically to fight \nthe disease, but we contribute only $1.1 billion to fight AIDS abroad. \nA few weeks ago, I brought an amendment to the floor asking that we \nmake a commitment on an emergency basis to put $500 million more into \nfighting the AIDS epidemic. I am sorry to report my colleagues would \nnot support me on that amendment. It is unfortunate. I believe, sadly, \nthat in years to come we will look back on this as a missed opportunity \nto do something about an epidemic that will literally affect the lives \nof all of our children and grandchildren and affect the stability of \nthe world.\n  What are the contributing causes to the global epidemic? No. 1 is \nlack of education. Eighty percent of those most at risk receive no \ninformation or any help with prevention. Just a few years back, 10 or \n12 years ago, 30 percent of the pregnant women in Uganda were HIV \npositive. That number is now down to 11 percent. Was there a massive \ninfusion of money into Uganda? There was, a selective infusion of money \ninto public education. It worked. They preached ABC, which is very \nbasic: Abstinence, which is the first advice to be given; make certain \nthat if you are going to be sexually active, you are monogamous; and \nthird, make certain you rely on condoms for protection if you don't \naccept the other two as a premise for your lifestyle. It is very \nfundamental, but it worked. It dramatically reduced the HIV infection \nrate among those who were pregnant.\n  We need programs that are going to change the habits of people. We \nhave to understand poverty creates desperation. There is something we \nhave to\n\n[[Page S6816]]\n\nunderstand, which the Presiding Officer made a point of in the city of \nChicago many years ago after she had returned from a trip to South \nAsia--I heard her speech; I remember it well--in which she said, the \nbiggest single indicator of the likelihood of progress in a developing \nnation is the way they treat their women. If women are treated with \nrespect, if they are given a voice in the society, if they can help \ndecide their fate, you will have a more progressive society; you will \nfind a country able to respond to many crises, not just the health \ncrisis.\n  We in the United States have to understand that though we don't lead \nthe world in foreign aid, per capita, we certainly want to make certain \nthat our investment in foreign aid focuses on improving the role and \nvoice of women in developing countries. Women who are not treated as \nslaves or chattel can make life decisions that will save their lives, \nenrich their children's lives, and give them a marital situation with \nhope instead of despair. That should be part of our approach in dealing \nwith AIDS as well.\n  This epidemic is going to get worse before it gets better. We have to \nunderstand that the United States has, beyond a moral responsibility, a \npolitical responsibility in terms of this HIV/AIDS epidemic. There was \na time a century ago when the problems around the world were in fact on \nthe other side of the world; they couldn't, frankly, make it to the \nUnited States; many of these people who were sick would die on the way. \nWe now know that any problem on the other side of the world is a 10- or \n12-hour airplane flight from being our problem.\n  Let us understand we cannot take the current course that is being \nsuggested by this administration. To give a symbolic amount of money \nthis year to the global AIDS effort is in fact to invite further \ndisaster on the people around the world and on the people of the United \nStates. To go, as the administration has said, along the route that \nwould suggest next year we would make no contribution to the global \nAIDS fund suggests perhaps that they believe the epidemic is going to \nwait for us to catch up with it. It won't. Then finally to say that \nmaybe 2 years from now we will put another $300 million in, that kind \nof halfhearted, weak attempt to meet our moral and political obligation \nwill mean the AIDS epidemic will continue to grow, not just in Africa, \nnot just in Asia, but around the world.\n  Taking a meaningful, positive step forward in supporting prevention \nof AIDS research and education is in the best interest of the United \nStates.\n  I note that major donor organizations such as the Gates Foundation \nand the Kaiser Foundation and others have made a commitment to this. \nThe United States has to meet and exceed that commitment as well. We \nhave to make certain that the Senate reverses the sad, terrible vote we \ncast just a few weeks ago, saying that we are not going to put more \nmoney on an emergency basis to fight the AIDS epidemic. I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate, as they reflect on the Barcelona conference \nand the commitment of thousands of leaders around the world, the HIV/\nAIDS epidemic, will put pressure on this administration to go beyond \nthe rhetoric, beyond juggling the books, about $500 million over a 3-\nyear period of time, and make a meaningful commitment that will save \nlives.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6816-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6816-S6818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I first commend my friend from \nIllinois for his advocacy on this critical issue. He has been here time \nand again with amendments to do what needs to be done. I thank him for \nhis advocacy and concern, deep concern, about this issue.\n  In a related issue--relating to health care--this morning I am in the \nChamber with my colleague from Florida to urge our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to join us in proceeding to the critical debate \non the issue of prescription drugs. I cannot think of a more important \nissue facing our country than making sure that lifesaving medicines are \navailable to our seniors, to our families, to anyone who needs them, \nand that we are lowering prices so that our small businesses can see \ntheir health care premiums go down to a reasonable level.\n  Large manufacturers, such as the big three automakers, that are in \nMichigan, and others all across the country who are seeing explosions \nin their health care costs need to know there is some relief in sight, \nthere is a way to get this into a manageable situation. We have plans \nto address that, to provide Medicare coverage for our seniors--it is \nlong overdue for prescription drugs--and to lower prices to everybody \nthrough increased competition and making sure our laws work and the \nopportunities for competition exist.\n  I was concerned to come to the floor last evening and find that a \nsimple motion to proceed to debate the bill was objected to by our \nfriend from New Hampshire and by others on the other side of the \naisle--just to proceed to the debate. The leader told us we will have a \nfull 2 weeks in a very crowded schedule to focus on this issue because \nit is so incredibly important. There is nothing more important to the \nquality of life of our citizens, to the cost to the economy, and there \nis nothing more important right now than addressing this issue of \nlowering prices and the issue of corporate responsibility, quite \nfrankly, with the drug companies and how we make sure that lifesaving \nmedicine is available to all of our citizens at an affordable price and \nthat our seniors have a real promise of Medicare caps, because without \ncovering outpatient prescriptions, we are no longer keeping the promise \nof Medicare.\n\n  So I come to the floor today to urge our colleagues to take away \ntheir objection and allow us to proceed to the debate. We have 2 weeks \nto work out the specifics, to work together on the right kind of plan. \nBut we need to get to that debate.\n  The Governors of the country are meeting right now, and in fact the \nGovernor from Michigan leads that organization. The Governors' \nconference, according to the paper, focuses on health costs. This \nmorning, I tuned in to C-SPAN to listen to some of the discussion they \nwere having on prescription drug prices and the costs to our Governors. \nIt says in the paper:\n  Despite signs of a gradual national recovery, the State's woes are \nexpected to persist well into the current fiscal cycle. Their biggest \nproblems are the ballooning costs of prescription drugs and Medicare.\n  We in the Senate have an opportunity to do something about that right \nnow. The Governors are asking us to do that. Businesses are asking us, \nas are families, seniors, and workers. Every worker who has had to have \ntheir salary capped or frozen so that the employer can afford the \nrising cost of their health care plans has asked us to do something \nabout this.\n  I want to take just a moment to bring forward the urgency of this \nissue by sharing some stories that have come into my Web site. I have \nset up something called a prescription drug people's lobby, asking \npeople in Michigan to share their stories and join with us. We know the \nreason this is being held up, unfortunately, in the Senate is that \nthere are far more drug company lobbyists than there are people's \nvoices talking about what is affecting them and their families. There \nare six lobbyists for every one Member of the Senate. So we have a \nresponsibility to speak for them and make sure their stories are told.\n  I start with Melissa Askin from Romulus, MI, who was the first person \nto sign up for our Michigan prescription drug people's lobby on May 22. \nI thank Melissa for that. She wrote in her story:\n  I guess my story is no different from the many Americans, when it \ncomes to deciding if I can afford food to live or medications. It boils \ndown to a choice these days: what can I afford to keep myself alive \nonce I pay my bills.\n  I am 68 years old, my husband is deceased, and I have no family. I \nhave had a heart bypass, both carotid arteries in my neck cleaned out, \nand now in April I was operated on for cancer, not to mention several \nother surgeries. I am supposed to be on nine medications, however, at \nthe price of these meds, I can only afford three.\n  I don't know what will happen with me by not being able to be on the \nmeds I can't afford, but it makes me wonder what I'm living for. I feel \nlike nobody cares.\n  Melissa needs to know that we care, we in the Senate care--not by our\n\n[[Page S6817]]\n\nwords, because people have heard enough words, but by our actions. That \nis what this is about right now. Are we going to proceed to this \ndebate? Are people going to use procedural motions to stop us from even \ngetting to the debate, or are we going to move forward together, find \nways and common ground in a bipartisan way to do what needs to be done? \nWill we do that so that Melissa Askin, 68 years old, of Romulus, MI, \nknows that someone cares? When she needs nine medications in order to \nlive and have quality of life, she should be able to get all nine \nmedications and not have to settle for three. That is what this is \nabout.\n\n  Let me share a story from a young woman, Shawn Somerville, from \nYpsilanti, MI, who e-mailed me:\n  Just this last Christmas, my grandmother was hospitalized because she \nstopped taking her prescription so that she could afford presents for \nall of us grandkids. She later died from an undiagnosed ulcer. It was \nvery sad to me that these drugs are so expensive. Do they need to be?\n  Well, Shawn, no, they don't need to be. We as American taxpayers \nunderwrite the cost of research and invest in and support the companies \nand provide patents so they can recover costs, and work with them in \none of the most subsidized industries certainly in the country and in \nthe world, because we want to make sure your grandmother has access to \nher medicine. We want to make sure the grandmothers and grandfathers of \nthis country don't have to stop taking their medicine in order to have \nChristmas with their grandkids.\n  Unfortunately, today this system is just plain out of control. When \nwe see prices rising three times the rate of inflation in the most \nprofitable industry in the world and we see people who cannot afford \ntheir medicines, I argue that this is a debate about corporate \nresponsibility.\n  We just finished an important debate last night in a unanimous vote \nto improve the oversight of publicly held corporations in this country \nso that in fact we can guarantee corporate responsibility, information \nfor investors so that people's pensions will be protected. It was an \nimportant, bipartisan effort that ended up in a good result for the \nAmerican people.\n  This is also about corporate responsibility. That is what this is \nabout. I believe it is about corporate responsibility and ethics and, \nin fact, even morality. We can do better in the greatest country in the \nworld than we are doing now as it relates to the affordability of \nlifesaving prescription drugs and the spiraling, out-of-control costs \nof our health care system as a result.\n  I urge people to get involved with us today. If someone is listening \nto what we are debating now on the Senate floor, I urge you to get \ninvolved right now. We need you to call your Senator. We need all of us \nto be engaged in this battle, and we welcome you to come to a Web site \nthat has been set up--fairdrugprices.org.\n  We are asking people to share their stories. We are asking people to \nsign an online petition drive sending a message to the House, the \nSenate, and the President to act now. We do not need one more Christmas \nto go by with grandmas and grandpas trying to decide whether or not \nthey can buy Christmas presents for their grandchildren or take their \nmedicine.\n  Fairdrugprices.org is about getting involved and together getting our \nvoices heard, and then through my colleagues and me, we will bring \nthose stories that are shared through this Web site to the Chamber of \nthe Senate and continue to make the case that this is real, it is about \nreal people. We are not making this up. This is one of the most \ncritical, if not the most critical, issues we will debate this year in \nterms of touching people's lives. The bill we just finished on \ncorporate responsibility certainly is right up there with it, making \nsure we have confidence in the markets and people's pensions are \nprotected, but if they have to take every single dime of that pension \nto pay for prescription drugs, they will still have a very difficult \ntime in their retirement.\n  It is my pleasure right now to yield to my colleague from Florida who \nhas been an outspoken advocate. I know he has been working with people \nas well and sharing stories and hearing from his constituents about \nthis issue.\n  I simply say, as I yield to my colleague, that we are out of time. \nNow is the time to act. Now is the time for us to at least get started \non the debate. We have the next 2 weeks to work together to figure out \nthe specifics and bring it to a close.\n  I yield to my colleague and good friend from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I am delighted to join my \ncolleague from Michigan, who has given such tremendous leadership on \nthis issue. It is very important that in the next couple of weeks, \nbefore we break for the August recess--and my colleague from Michigan \nwill certainly agree with this--that we in the Senate pass a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  The problem is, under Senate rules, we do not have the opportunity to \npass something unless we get 60 votes. It is not the typical majority \nplus one, otherwise 51 votes, but under the rules of the Senate, we \nhave to get an extraordinary majority of 60 votes to prevent a \nfilibuster in a parliamentary procedure that is known as a cloture \nmotion, to cut off debate. That takes 60 votes.\n  Therefore, on one particular plan that is proposed for a prescription \ndrug benefit, it makes it extra difficult for us to get those extra \nvotes because out of every plan, there is going to be something in the \nplan with which somebody disagrees.\n  I wish to talk about one of those plans and talk about the reason why \nit is so important for us to modernize Medicare.\n  If we were designing a health insurance system for senior citizens \ntoday, would we design it to include prescription drugs? The obvious \nanswer to that question is yes, because every day lives are benefited \nby virtue of an increased quality of life, an enhanced quality of life, \nenhanced health with the miracles of modern medicine that we know as \nprescription drugs. But Medicare, the health insurance system for \nsenior citizens, was not designed today. It was designed 37 years ago.\n  In 1965, when state-of-the-art health care was centered around the \nhospital and acute care, the health care system, supported by the \nFederal Government, for senior citizens did not include prescription \ndrugs unless they were attendant to the care of someone who was in the \nhospital. Thirty-seven years later, we must update that health \ninsurance system for senior citizens. I want to give an example.\n  There is a lady in my constituency in Parrish, FL. Obviously, her \nname shall remain confidential, but for these purposes, I will refer to \nher as Mrs. Smith. Mrs. Smith is 69 years old and she suffers from a \nvariety of medical conditions, including a painful muscle disorder. \nBecause the cost of her prescription drugs is not covered by Medicare, \non a monthly basis, her out-of-pocket expenditures are over $300 just \nfor prescription drugs.\n  Let's look at her financial condition. She lives alone. She has no \nfamily members to help her. Sons and daughters often help their moms \nand dads, but Mrs. Smith does not have immediate family members to help \nher with her daily cost of living, including those costs of over $300 a \nmonth for prescription drugs.\n  What does she receive from Social Security? This is the only income \nshe has--a $1,030 per month benefit from Social Security.\n  Of that $300 that she has to take out of that $1,000 Social Security \npayment, she has some big expenses. She has a drug called Neurontin. It \nis at a cost of 125 bucks a month. She has a drug called Ultram. It is \nat a cost of 150 bucks a month. She cannot afford, out of her Social \nSecurity benefits, to take the daily dosage of those drugs that her \ndoctor has prescribed for her painful muscle disorder. What does it \ncome down to? It comes down to groceries or prescriptions.\n  Can you imagine that in America in the year 2002 we have senior \ncitizens all across this land who are having to make a choice between \nwhether they are going to eat or whether they are going to get their \nmedicine, as in the case of Mrs. Smith in Parrish, FL? I cannot imagine \nit, but it is happening, and that is what brings us to the Senate \nChamber now as we take up this prescription drug bill.\n\n[[Page S6818]]\n\n  Mrs. Smith is obviously frustrated that in her golden years she has \nenormous anxiety because of the high cost of the prescriptions. Under \none version of the prescription drug bill, the version that I am a \ncosponsor of with my colleague from Florida, Bob Graham, Mrs. Smith \nwould only have to pay $25 a month premium for a Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit. If she chose to have a brand name prescription, she would \npay a copay of $40, but if she wanted a generic prescription, Ultram--\nthat drug that I mentioned she takes at 150 bucks a month--it does have \na generic alternative so she would only have to pay $10 for the \nprescription for the generic. That coverage for Mrs. Smith would begin \nupon enrollment, and Mrs. Smith would not be subject to any initial \ndeductible, as is the case in the legislation that passed in the House.\n  It is another personal example, a real-life example, of why we ought \nto have a prescription drug benefit enacted to modernize Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the minority leader for his courtesy.

Will the Senator yield so I can respond?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to Senator Kennedy if he wants to make some \nclarification.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We were going to get started. We all are under pressure, \nbut I would be glad to have the Senator from Minnesota speak.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then we will move on the regular order with the \npresentation of the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I understand there was discussion last \nnight, and in the HELP Committee, about how to proceed on the \nsubstantive issue, and there was some understanding that some language \nwould be worked out. I do not know the details of it, but I am hoping \nthat whatever was agreed to in committee can be resolved in a \nsatisfactory way.\n  Without getting into how it was reported out of the committee and how \nwe will proceed once that is clarified, I want to talk about the \noverall situation that causes me major concern. The Finance Committee \nhas been meeting off and on for probably 5 years trying to decide the \nbest way to proceed on prescription drugs. We have had repeated \nbipartisan meetings of the full committee, even this year. I have met, \nI think five times for as much as a couple of hours talking about the \nsubstance but it has always been a general discussion with no markup.\n  Last week, even though we did two minor bills, there was no markup on \nprescription drugs in the Finance Committee. This week we were \nscheduled to take up another bill, but the meeting at 10 was cancelled \nand now the meeting at 2 was cancelled because I assume the chairman \nrealized that the so-called tripartisan bill was going to be offered in \nthe Finance Committee to whatever bill might have been brought up.\n  This is legislation that has been developed by Senator Breaux, \nSenator Snowe, Senator Grassley, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Hatch. \nIt is truly a bipartisan bill and tripartisan because it does have the \nsupport of Senator Jeffords.\n  There is a determination not to allow the Finance Committee to act on \nthis bill. The Finance Committee, for years, has been known as one of \nthe most effective and bipartisan committees, whether it is welfare \nreform or trade legislation, Medicare, whatever it may be, but in this \ninstance the Finance Committee is basically being told if they cannot \nget the votes for the so-called Kennedy-Graham-Miller proposal, they \ncannot act.\n  I think we are beginning to debate once again in the wrong way on the \nSenate floor on a very important issue. The majority leader has twice \nbefore tried to ignore the Finance Committee and basically come \nstraight to the floor. We saw what has happened, how long it takes for \nus to work through a bill that has not gone through a committee markup. \nThat is why I continue to urge that the homeland security issue go to a \nregular markup in the Governmental Affairs Committee, and I am being \ntold that is what is going to happen, because so many of the problems \ncan be resolved at the committee level. If we bring these important \nissues to the Senate floor without them having been worked through \ncommittee, it is a prescription for a real problem, long debate and in \nthis case likely no result.\n  Last fall the majority leader and the Finance Committee chairman \nrammed a partisan stimulus bill through the Finance Committee. We told \nthem at that time that process would fail because it set up a situation \nwhere we had to get 60 votes and we more than likely could not do that.\n  Two months ago, the majority leader used a flawed process to bring \ntrade legislation to the Senate floor, and we saw as a result of that \nit took us, I think, about a month to get it done, even though it was a \nbill that had bipartisan support on both sides. Four bills were brought \ntogether, the trade promotion authority, the Andean trade provisions, \nthe GSP provisions, as well as trade adjustment assistance. It was very \ndifficult to get that work done.\n\n  But what we have today worries me even more. We are calling up the \ndrug pricing and patents bill out of the HELP Committee. Then I \nunderstand at some point, a prescription drug bill, or bills, will be \noffered. No matter what is offered, it will have to get 60 votes.\n  Prescription drugs would have to get 60 votes in the Senate. Why is \nthat? One, we do not have a budget resolution, so we are going under \nthe existing law which says a prescription drug bill cannot be brought \nup that exceeds, I believe it is $300 billion. If it does, it takes 60 \nvotes. Also, a bill that is brought to the floor without going to the \nFinance Committee requires 60 votes.\n  So we have two things that are happening with no budget resolution: \nwe have a limit with the amount. If a bill exceeds $300 billion, it \ntakes 60 votes. If it has not come through the Finance Committee, it \nwill have to have 60 votes.\n  I do not know what the scoring is on the so-called Kennedy-Graham \nbill. As\n\n[[Page S6819]]\n\nof last Friday, or even yesterday, it was not clear. I am under the \nimpression that it is well in excess of $800 billion, probably closer \nto a trillion over 10 years. It is a universal coverage provision, \nwithout being targeted to catastrophic problems or the elderly poor. We \ndo not know for sure what the costs will be. I am being told that the \ncosts might be less because, instead of it being for 10 years, it will \nbe for 5 years, or maybe even 4 years.\n  So we are setting up a situation where we cannot act. I think that is \na tragedy. It is time we provide the elderly poor who are sick an \nopportunity to get help with their prescription drugs.\n  Some States are dealing with this issue, but they are to the limit of \nwhat they can do. Others have not been able to deal with it.\n  I certainly do not agree with this strategy, and the tragedy is that \nwe are going to wind up without getting a result once again. Why not \nallow the Finance Committee to act?\n  Let us see what is reported out. Maybe it would not be the \ntripartisan bill or the Kennedy bill. Maybe it would be something more \nalong the lines of what Senator Hagel and Senator Ensign have proposed. \nI understand there are other Senators on both sides who will try to \nwork together to find a way to get a result, something that can get 60 \nvotes that would produce a result in this very critical issue.\n\n  Senator Grassley has always worked to get bills out of the Finance \nCommittee. They have always been bipartisan bills. I know he is \ndisturbed by this and I believe Senator Baucus is disturbed that the \nFinance Committee has been cut out once again and that we are going \nwith this convoluted process which, I guess, will provide some action \non the pricing and patent bill.\n  That is fine. If we want to bring up that bill and have debate and \nhave some action on it, I think we ought to have debate and some votes \nand we could get to conclusion of that. But I think to use this as a \nvehicle to avoid the Finance Committee is a very big mistake. It is not \njust about politics, it is about results.\n  Do we want to get a prescription drug provision through the Senate? \nIf we want to do this, we can do it. But what we have before us will \nnot produce a result, a product.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I have just very brief remarks. I \nthank my colleagues. I have to go back to a committee hearing. I will \nbe back for this debate day after day after day for the next 2 weeks \nbecause it is so important to the people of Minnesota.\n  I take exception to the remarks of the minority leader, as is quite \noften the case. I think it is an honest disagreement. I think, whether \nit be 50 votes or 60 votes, if we have a will there is a way. We voted \n97 to 0 for a piece of legislation last night. We should have passed \nit. It was extremely important security reform legislation that was \ncritical for people in the country.\n  Frankly, affordable prescription drug coverage is also critical for \npeople in the country, for senior citizens, and others as well.\n  So if there is a will there is a way. We need to get started with \nthis debate. I don't think we should be putting it off at all. It is a \ncompelling interest, a compelling issue in people's lives.\n  In Minnesota, 40 percent of senior citizens have no coverage \nwhatsoever. I remember a couple of months ago, actually, Helen Dewar \nfrom the Washington Post came out to Minnesota to cover the campaign. \nShe spent time with different people. I wanted her to go to Northfield, \nwhich was really our home where I taught college, because I wanted her \nto go to the Quality Bakery--just a great place, a family-run bakery.\n  We were sitting in there talking and she was meeting with people and \nthis man came in. I don't remember his name. I should have, but I did \nnot remember his name, but I recognized him. It was a small town. We \nshook hands, and as soon as we shook hands I knew he had Parkinson's \ndisease. I know that disease like the palm of my hand. Both my parents \nhad Parkinson's. I could feel the shaking.\n\n  We were talking and I said: Are you on Sinemet?\n  He said: Yes, but there is another drug people are talking about that \nwould be more helpful.\n  And I said: What about that?\n  And he looked at me and he said: I can't afford it.\n  This is unconscionable.\n  I want to say just a couple of things. These are the principles. \nEverybody is talking about getting together. That is absolutely \ncritically important, but these are the principles.\n  No. 1, it ought to be affordable. You can't have the premiums too \nhigh. If you are going to talk about a premium or a deductible, we \ncan't just suggest it. People have to make sure it is there. That is \nthe problem with the House. There are suggestions about a deductible, \nbut it is not part of Medicare, not a defined benefit. People don't \nknow for sure.\n  No. 2, you bet it has to be catastrophic expenses. But if you have, \nfor example, like on the House side it is between $2,000 and $3,700--no \ncoverage at all. People are saying it will not make sense. We are \npaying premiums and you are not going to help us when we have bills \nover $2,000 a year--that is when we need the most help.\n  No. 3, absolutely make sure, for low-income seniors, they are not \nhaving to pay a lot or maybe anything. But if you are going to say \nthat, then don't have stingy means tests where you say if they have a \ncar worth more than $4,500, or a burial fund worth more than $1,500, \nthey could be disqualified. Don't do that. Don't do that. Make sure it \nis affordable.\n  Finally, make sure as a matter of fact there is some way that people \nknow this is really, again, going to be a benefit for them, and it will \nmake a real difference.\n  I think that is why you put it on Medicare.\n  I understand what is going on here. The pharmaceutical industry--any \nbill that sort of meets their test is a little bit suspect. I know they \nare not interested in having the affordable coverage. I know they are \nnot interested in broad coverage. And they are also, of course, not \ninterested in any potential cost containment. If it becomes a part of \nMedicare, it is absolutely true that at a certain point in time we may \nvery well say: Look, what we are doing here is giving a blank check to \nthe industry, and you are filling in the amount and it is exorbitant \nprices and there has to be some cost containment.\n  I want to make a humble suggestion. It is a bill I will be bringing \nout with Senator Dorgan, Senator Stabenow, and others. Here is one \nthing we could do that could be a part of our overall getting the work \ndone for people right here in the Senate. We could pass a provision \nwhich would say that our citizens, American citizens, can reimport back \nfrom Canada these prescription drugs meeting the strictest, same FDA \nguidelines, consumer protection guidelines. They ought to be able to do \nso. That not only helps senior citizens, it helps all the citizens.\n  Do you know what is interesting? You are talking about widely used \ndrugs for depression, for cancer, for heart disease, at 30, 40, 50 \npercent discount. This is a winner, colleagues, and I believe that \nought to be part of the mix as well.\n  I think the minority leader is wrong. Time is not neutral. I think \npeople are expecting us to do the work. I think we should. If we \nbelieve we ought to do this, there ought to be a strong vote for it. I \nthink the Graham and Miller and Kennedy bill is an extremely important \nstart. I think there will be other amendments to strengthen it. But the \nmain thing is we make this part of Medicare. It is not a suggestion. It \nis a benefit people can count on. We make sure it is affordable in \nterms of the premiums and the payments, and we make sure it covers the \ncatastrophic bills that put people under.\n  I don't want to talk about the problems anymore. We have been talking \nabout the problems forever. Let us talk about the solution. Let us get \ngoing. Let us start the debate. We should\n\n[[Page S6820]]\n\nstart. We should not delay anymore. We should have amendments out here. \nI am ready with an amendment and a provision which I have worked on for \nyears on drug reimportation. Other Senators have amendments. We should \nget this work done.\n  My last point is that I think people are counting on us. There is a \ncritically important issue. There is important work to be done. No more \ndelay; let us all come out here and have the debate. Let us be \naccountable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, today is a very important day for all \nAmerican families, and certainly for families who have suffered and \nhave been diminished in a very important and significant personal way \nbecause of the high cost of prescription drugs. The Senate of the \nUnited States is debating an issue introduced by our colleagues and \nfriends, Senator Schumer and Senator McCain, to reach out a helping \nhand to the families of this country in order to get a handle on the \ncost of prescription drugs.\n  The cost of prescription drugs as well as the accessibility and the \navailability of prescription drugs are very closely related. We will \nhave an opportunity to debate that issue later in the week. We are \nhopeful we will be able to work through this process in a way that will \ncommand broad bipartisanship on the floor of the Senate.\n  We invite the American people to give focus and attention to this \ndebate. Certainly for me, this is most important because it is related \nto a commitment that we as a country made to our senior citizens back \nin 1964 and 1965 when we enacted Medicare. It is an issue which is \nfront and center to every family in America today. It was an issue to \nfamilies early this morning when many of our seniors went to their \ndrugstores and tried to get the prescription drugs which are absolutely \nnecessary for them and found that the costs have been continuing to \nescalate and wondered whether they could afford the prescription drugs \nand the food they need. It will be there this afternoon, at noontime, \nor this evening when workers return and they need prescription drugs to \ntry to help a sick child.\n  The issues are front and center for every family. I don't think we \nwill debate an issue which is of such central importance to every \nAmerican family as this one. This issue is not a new issue for this \nbody, but it is a new issue by the fact that we are debating this or \nhave an opportunity to debate it on the floor of the Senate today.\n\n  Prescription drug legislation has been introduced and referred to \ncommittees over the last 5 years which has never emerged from those \ncommittees. I won't take the time of the Senate to go back prior to \neven 5 years ago. In 1978, Senator Thurmond and I introduced \nprescription drug legislation. We were never able to get it to the \nfloor of the Senate. Now we will have a debate on this.\n  I take a moment of time to respond very quickly to the comments of my \nfriend, the Republican leader, about the process of procedure.\n  Legislation is now before the Senate. It was voted on in our \ncommittee 16 to 5. We had a very similar vote on the legislation we \njust concluded, as a matter of fact. We found after the debate and \ndiscussion that we were able to get a unanimous vote on that \nlegislation. We might not end up with a unanimous vote on this, but let \nus not discount the possibility that we can do something that is \nimportant for our seniors.\n  The point has been made about whether this procedure is consistent \nwith the Senate rules. Clearly, it is. The legislation we are \nconsidering was reported out in a bipartisan way. I am hopeful and \nconfident that we will consider other legislation to expand the access \nto prescription drugs.\n  I will not take much time to remind our Republican friends about \nactions they have taken on important legislation that also circumvented \ncommittee action. There were a number of instances. I think that is \nimportant. I think the needs of families in this country are by far \nmore important.\n  I regret very deeply that we are going to have to take the Senate's \ntime before we are permitted to actually get consideration of the bill. \nAll Members know we are facing effectively a filibuster on the motion \nto proceed to this legislation. It is under the guise that some \ntechnical language wasn't satisfactory to the members of the committee. \nI reviewed last night the history on that technical language indicating \nthat if it was just technical in nature, we would be glad to consider \nthose proposals this morning and to clarify the language. If it is \nsubstantive, let us get on to the debate and let us get on to \namendments. Why delay the Senate of the United States from considering \nthis legislation?\n  We shouldn't be surprised that there are powerful financial interests \nthat do not want this legislation, that are strongly opposed to this \nlegislation, and that want Members in this body to filibuster to their \nlast breath. This is because they have been taking advantage of the \nexisting legislation to expand their profits at the expense of \nconsumers in ways which we will describe during the course of this \ndebate--the greed and collusion with other companies in order to deny \nquality drugs and generics being available at cheaper prices.\n  What this debate is about in many respects is corporate greed by \nthose companies that are ripping off the public. They are able to get, \nin effect, a delay by this body in considering this important \nlegislation. Let us make no mistake about what is going on. We will see \nit over the continuation of this debate.\n  There was a strong belief that we would never have the opportunity to \nreport this legislation out of Committee. We were successful in doing \nit in a strong bipartisan way. We are grateful to our Republican \nfriends for their support. But we don't underestimate the strong \nopposition that has been voiced by drug company after drug company that \nare abusing the process under the old Hatch-Waxman. As a result of \nthat, they are experiencing incomes of billions of dollars more than \nthey ever should, and they are receiving that at the cost of the \nAmerican consumer. They do not want to lose that privileged position. \nAs a result, they are in support of delay, delay, delay, delay, delay, \ndelay. That is what is happening. Prescription drug legislation is \ngoing to be opposed by those that are profiteering.\n  There are many within the drug industry who support our efforts to \ntry to work through a process because they understand the importance of \nthe health factors that are involved in this. We are grateful to them. \nWe hope we can work with them in trying to come up with real \nlegislation that can benefit people. But we should not have to spend a \ngreat deal of time in reviewing what has been happening in terms of the \nescalation of the costs of prescription drugs.\n  The cost of prescription drugs has been escalating and far exceeding \nthe average cost of living. It has been going up at the most \nextraordinary levels.\n  We see from this chart the fact that the increase in the cost of \nprescription drugs has been going up and exceeding the cost of living \nby about three or four times in recent years.\n  In 1996, we had a 3.23-percent rate of inflation, CPI, and the \nincrease in the cost of prescription drugs was 10 percent. The increase \nin the cost of prescription drugs was 14 percent in 1997, 15 percent in \n1998, 16 percent in 1999, 17 percent in 2000, and 17 percent in 2001. \nLook at the yellow bars that indicate the rate of inflation.\n  Why is it so important? It is important, obviously, for the health \nand consideration of our fellow citizens. But the fact remains, in \n1965, when we passed the Medicare legislation, we went on record--the \nCongress went on record--with a solid commitment to our seniors and to \nthe American people: Work hard, pay into the system, and at the time \nyou are 65 years of age, you will have health security in this country. \nThat was our commitment, and we did it. We have done it with regard to \nphysician services, and we have done it with regard to hospitalization.\n  But what we have not done this with is prescription drugs. Every \nsingle day we fail to enact a prescription drug benefit program that is \naffordable, accessible, and available to seniors we are violating that \nsolemn commitment and promise to our seniors--every day, every day; \ntoday, tomorrow. And that is a solemn commitment.\n\n[[Page S6821]]\n\n  We will hear: We have X provision or Y provision that isn't \nclarified. The seniors understand what is out there. They understand \nwhat is important. We have a responsibility to meet the needs of our \nsenior citizens, and to do it in a way that is affordable and \naccessible.\n  This legislation that is before the Senate now will have a \nsignificant impact in terms of the escalation of costs, make no mistake \nabout it--if we are able to, and when we are able to, get a debate for \nthe consideration of it. But what we are being told now, with only 3 \nweeks left before the August recess, is: No, we are not satisfied. No, \nwe are not going to be able to take this up. No, we are not going to be \nable to consider this legislation.\n  If they have differences, let's hear those differences. Let's \nconsider those amendments. Let's debate those amendments this \nafternoon. Let's vote on those amendments. But let's not just hide \nbehind the questions about clarifications of language.\n  We have seen what has happened in terms of our senior citizens with \nregard to the coverage on prescription drugs. If you look at this \nparticular chart, you will see where our seniors are now with regard to \nprescription drugs.\n  Thirteen million of our senior citizens have virtually no coverage \nwhatsoever in the United States today. Ten million have employer-\nsponsored plans. We will come back to that. But keep that in mind: 10 \nmillion have employer-sponsored plans. Five million are under Medicare/\nHMO. Two million are under Medigap. Three million are under Medicaid.\n\n  The only Americans who can be guaranteed prescription drug coverage \nthat will be available and accessible are those under Medicaid. Those \nare the only Americans who are not at risk today. We are trying to do \nsomething about it. But the drug companies say no. They will not even \nlet us begin the debate on it. They say, no, we are not going to permit \nyou to even proceed to the debate on this issue, even though we are \nfinding out what is happening to our seniors.\n  We have 10 million who have employer-sponsored plans. Let's take a \nlook at what happens to those who have employer-sponsored plans. If you \ntake the employer-sponsored plans, the firms that have offered the \nprescription drug program for our seniors, look what has happened to \nthose 10 million people. These individuals have retired. Let's look at \nwhat is happening to their coverage. It is dropping like a stone in a \npond. It was 40-percent coverage in 1994; and it is going right on down \nand dramatically being reduced. That is as a result of the employers \ncutting that program out.\n  And 13 million do not have any coverage. As I said, 10 million have \nemployer-sponsored plans. And this is what is happening to the \nemployer-sponsored retirement coverage: The coverage is dropping like a \nstone in a pond.\n  Let's look at what is happening in terms of the HMOs. We said we had \nabout 5 million who were covered by the HMOs. Take a good look at this \nparticular part of the chart. This is Medicare coverage. HMO drug \ncoverage is inadequate and unreliable. A drug benefit is offered only \nas an option, and 30 percent offer no drug coverage. And 5 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries in rural areas have it.\n  But look at this bullet line: Medicare/HMOs are reducing the level of \ndrug coverage. Seventy percent of Medicare/HMOs limit their drug \ncoverage to $750 or less--$750 or less.\n  Fifty percent of the Medicare/HMOs with drug coverage only pay for \nthe generic drugs.\n  So you can say we have all of those who are covered by employers. \nThat is phony because the bottom is falling out for them. You can say \nyou have 4.5 million of them covered by HMOs. This is increasingly \nphony because they have a limitation of $750. And about 18 percent of \nall of the seniors will benefit under that particular program.\n  So we go on and see what happens in terms of the next group, which \nwould be the Medicaid coverage. We will find out that some 3 million \nhave that program. And then, finally, you have those who are involved \nin what they call Medigap, where the average cost has gone up so high \nthat it is increasingly out of range.\n  Our seniors are in a crisis. Our seniors are in crisis with the \nexplosion of drug costs and the failure of coverage, and we are being \ntold out here on the floor of the Senate we cannot even bring up the \nbill, even though there has been a prescription drug bill for 5 years \nin the Senate, and we have not had a debate on these issues.\n  So the question is, which way is the Senate going to go? Is the \nSenate going to go with the drug companies and the wealthy corporations \nthat today are abusing and colluding with some generic companies to \ndeny the lower prices for families in this country? Or are they going \nto stand up and say: We want to get this legislation passed that can \nmake a real difference in the cost of their drugs?\n  If that is what they want, they should be letting those forces know \nhere in the Senate--the Republican leadership on down--that this is the \ntime for debate and action on this. We do not accept the fact that it \nis going to be complicated, it is going to be difficult, it is going to \nbe hard to try to reach a coalition.\n  We are committed to getting something done. We believe we have the \nway to be able to do it.\n  I want to also mention another feature. We know that the House of \nRepresentatives took some action recently in order to try to address \nthis issue. We welcome the fact that at least they passed some \nlegislation. We would not be able to get legislation unless, obviously, \nthe House passed it and the Senate passed it. We would not be able to \nget legislation unless we were able to have the House of \nRepresentatives pass legislation.\n  But I want to just review, very quickly, with the Members about what \nhappens in the Republican proposal in the House of Representatives.\n  First of all, there is an assets test. What they have is an assets \ntest. You will hear: The Republican program really covers and reaches \nout and covers individuals in the lower income levels. That is where \nthe real need is.\n  Right, that is where the real need is. There is a great need when you \nfigure two-thirds of seniors have incomes below $25,000. The average \nincome is less than $14,000.\n  We talk about individuals, wealthy seniors. When two-thirds of them \nhave an income of less than $25,000 and the average income is $13,000, \ncertainly our seniors are hard pressed to be able to do this.\n  It is interesting. It has been suggested that for low-income people, \nthey won't have any premiums. They won't have deductibles. They will \nnot have any copays. That sounds good, but just take a look at the \nprint. There is the assets test. Any senior can't have any more than \n$4,000 in savings. You can't have a car that is worth more than $4,500 \nor you are out. You are telling seniors who might be driving around in \nthe cold of winter that they can't have a dependable car in order to go \nto the drugstore to get their prescription drugs or have a car in the \nheat of the summer, in the areas of this country that are scorching hot \nand have a decent car to be able to make sure they get to the \ndrugstores. If they do, they will lose eligibility.\n  Burial expenses worth more than $1,500--isn't this wonderful? If it \nis more than $1,500, it moves against the assets test and moves to \ndisqualify them. Personal property, a wedding ring, no more than $2,000 \nin furniture or personal property. A wedding ring counts as personal \nproperty. Let alone if it goes over that $2,000, it counts in the \nassets test, as does $4,000 in savings. In other words, you have to \njust burn every nickel and dime that you have been able to save over \nyour lifetime in order to qualify for this.\n  Not only is this process unconscionable and it has been rejected by \nSenator Graham and Senator Miller in their particular proposal, but it \nis a very important part of the Republican program in the House of \nRepresentatives. It is not only that this is demeaning, but what do we \nask our elderly people to do? Go in to fill out a little form. Can you \nimagine how demeaning that is? People who need that prescription drug \nas a lifesaver have to go in there to try to qualify. They have to \ncount their wedding ring, their furniture, personal property, and \nwhatever is in their savings when they go to qualify for this program. \nThat is when we know from a financial statement that they are \nindividuals in need.\n  Beyond this, you have the paltry coverage benefits under the \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S6822]]\n\nplan. On this left side you have the percent of seniors that purchase, \nfor example, 18 percent spend $250 or less on drugs; 18 percent spend \n$250 to $1000; 17 percent spend $1,000 to $2000; 23 percent spend \n$2,000 to $4,000; and 7 percent spend $4,000 to $5,000. The beneficiary \npayments and the Medicare benefits, if you are spending $250 on drugs \ncosts, you are still going to pay $658 because you are going to pay the \npremium and the deductible. So virtually we are telling these 18 \npercent of the Americans under the Republican program, no benefit, \nnone. You don't get any at all.\n  If you are at 18 percent and you have drug costs of $1,000, you pay \nthe payments and you pay the deductible. You pay your premiums and you \npay your copay. That is $808. The Medicare payment is $192. The cost \npaid by the senior citizen is 81 percent. Some help and assistance that \nis.\n  The list goes on. The 17 percent with drug costs of $2,000 pay 65 \npercent of the cost themselves. Those with drug costs of $4,000 pay 83 \npercent; and the 7 percent with drug costs of $5,000 pay 82 percent. \nSome drug benefit that is.\n  It is important we have a debate to find out exactly what program \ndoes what. But we are denied that opportunity. We are denied that \nopportunity in the Senate to get on to what is happening with costs. We \nare strongly committed on our side to try to do something about one \naspect of it, and that is the escalation in the drug costs to the \nAmerican consumer.\n\n  We have a strong bipartisan proposal sponsored by our friends and \ncolleagues, Senator Schumer and Senator McCain, strong bipartisan \nlegislation that came out of our committee and can save as much as $71 \nbillion over the next 10 years and make a real difference. There are \nother ideas that our colleagues have in the Senate that can show how \nthe consumers can get an additional break in terms of the high cost of \nprescription drugs. We ought to have the opportunity to debate them.\n  But no, we can't do that. We can't do it today. We are prepared to \nget into the debate. We are prepared to get into amendments. We are \nprepared to have votes in the Senate. But, no, we are told by our \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle that we can't because there \nare language changes in here that are not satisfactory. If it is not \nlanguage, it is substance. I might say that we are glad to work out \nlanguage. And if it is not language, if it is substance, let's get to \nit in terms of a vote. We are being denied not only to consider the \nbasic underlying bill, the Schumer-McCain proposal, but we are unable \nto consider other amendments that can also have a positive impact in \nreducing the cost of prescription drugs. We are denied that \nopportunity.\n  There are several of those. I see my friend from Michigan in the \nChamber now. She knows a number of those and she will be an effective \nadvocate for many of those. We can have an important debate, and we can \nhave action that can have a meaningful impact in terms of seeing a \nleveling down of the escalation of the cost of prescription drugs in \nthe future. But, no, we can't consider that.\n  There are certainly those who would say, if we are going to take that \nvery important step, that will be important in and of itself, but what \nabout the coverage? We are being denied consideration of various \nproposals including those by Senator Ensign, Senator Hagel, and the \ntripartite group. However, we are unable to even consider and debate \nthose. We are being closed out.\n  We will have to take the time of the Senate this week to just go \nahead with what this body has done so well over a long period of time \non prescription drugs, and that is to talk and talk about it but not \ntake action.\n  We are prepared to take action. Majority Leader Daschle said weeks \nago that we would take up legislation dealing with prescription drugs. \nHe has met that commitment. That is a strong position of those of us on \nthis side of the aisle. We were able to get that legislation out. We \ndon't just say that it is only the Democrats who are interested, as I \nhave said repeatedly; we have strong Republican support for the \nunderlying legislation. If it had been so egregious at the time, I \nwould have expected they wouldn't have supported it.\n  So we have important legislation. It is bipartisan in nature. We \nagreed, Republicans and Democrats, we want to take action, but we know \nwhere many of the drug companies, not all, but many of the drug \ncompanies are. They are saying: No, we do not want action on this bill. \nNo, we do not want action on coverage. No, we don't want to have \nconsideration of this legislation. No, we don't want any action \nwhatsoever to protect the seniors and sick people of this country in \nterms of prescription drugs.\n  There are many of us who reject that attitude and that position.\n  We are strongly committed to having action here in the Senate on this \nproposal. We believe that the quicker we get to this legislation, the \nbetter off we are going to be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, there have been a lot of representations by \nthe Senator from Massachusetts as to why we are in this position. He \nneed only turn to himself to answer that question.\n  When we marked up this bill in committee, there was an unequivocal, \nunquestioned agreement, in my opinion, that we would reach \naccommodation on two parts of this bill. There was significant \ndiscussion about the 45-day rule and about the fact that what the \nlanguage in the bill represented, what the sponsor of the bill \nrepresented the language to do, was the opposite of what the language \ndid. It was agreed to by the Senators there--both Republican and \nDemocrat--that that language would be corrected. There was an agreement \nbetween the Senator from North Carolina and the Senator from Tennessee \nthat the language dealing with the bioequivalency issue, which is \ncritical in this bill, would be corrected before it got to the floor.\n  The essence of this bill was presented to the committee on Thursday \nand marked up. Now it is on the floor. That is rather prompt action, to \nsay the least. But the understanding was that, before it got to the \nfloor, these two items would be corrected so that the bill would be in \nthe proper form when it reached the floor.\n  The reason there is delay occurring is that there continues to be a \nstonewalling of the agreement that was reached in the committee as to \ncorrecting those problems. It is pretty hard to reach an agreement in \nthe committee and suddenly find it means nothing when you get to the \nfloor. It makes it very hard to do business around here when that \nhappens. But that is the reason for the delay of this bill being \navailable for amendment.\n  The debate is going forward rather intensely. The Senator has \nnumerous charts, and I am sure other Senators will be down here with \nnumerous charts to discuss this bill. But I thought it was important we \nmake the point that when an agreement is reached in committee during a \nmarkup that the bill will be corrected before it gets to the floor, on \ntwo specific and important points, that agreement should be upheld.\n  Now, obviously, at some point we are going to go to this bill and we \nwill start amending it. It doesn't look as if the agreements that were \nreached in committee are ever going to be fulfilled, which is \nregrettable and inappropriate, in my opinion. It makes future markups \nvery tenuous, because how can you mark up something and have an \nunderstanding, and then suddenly find that the understanding was \nmeaningless once you agreed to move forward with the bill? It changes \nthe whole tempo of how you do things around here.\n  So it has nothing to do with greedy drug companies. I am sure there \nare a lot of greedy companies out there. We have seen that everywhere. \nIt has to do with the appropriate process in the Senate and the \nmovement from the committee to the floor, as to why we are delaying \nthis specific bill's ability to be amended. We are not delaying the \nability to discuss the bill. There is a great deal to discuss, and I \nwill take a few minutes to do that.\n  I am talking about the underlying bill, not the drug bills that are \ngoing to be coming as amendments to this bill. The underlying bill, \nwhich was Hatch-Waxman and has been amended by Edwards-Collins, has a \nvery legitimate purpose: To get generics to the market quickly but at \nthe same time protect the incentive of brand name companies to do \nresearch and have protection in\n\n[[Page S6823]]\n\nthe research and the products they produce, but at the same time allow \ngenerics onto the playing field quickly. It is a very technical bill, \nwith technical language, which will have a big impact on the ability of \nAmericans to buy drugs more cheaply and also to have new drugs come to \nthe marketplace, which drugs will be able to save lives.\n\n  You have to remember that. I think something is often forgotten in \nthe demagoguery of ``let's reduce the price of drugs,'' which dominates \nthe political marketplace today, as buses drive to Canada and people \nclaim they can buy this or that at cheaper prices. The basic benefit \nthat we as the American society have is that we have a vibrant research \ncommunity in the area of producing new drugs. That has taken us from \nbeing a society where people were operated on all the time, and put \nunder the risk of a knife, to a society where in health care drugs are \nable to take care of many of the issues that were not able to be cured \nbefore; and if they were not, you were put at risk of being put under a \nscalpel.\n  We need to continue to expand that, to have an expanding research \nbase in the area of drug production. But in doing that, we see the \ncosts going up. So how do we address that? The hope is that, as the \ndrugs come on the market and after the people who have developed the \ndrugs have a reasonable period of time to get a return on that so that \nthey recover the costs--and it takes about 12 years and $500 million to \nbring a new drug to market--that was the last number I saw; maybe it is \nhigher. But once the costs have been recovered at a reasonable rate in \na typical market system, then you allow other people to produce the \nsame drug. That is called the generics. They come in and produce it at \na much lower cost.\n  What we don't want to do, as we are making those lower cost drugs \navailable, is wipe out the incentive of people to go out and produce \nnew drugs for the marketplace. So it is a very delicate balance, and it \ncannot be effectively handled by suddenly going to the Canadian system. \nThe reason the Canadians are able to offer low-cost drug prices is that \nthey take our research and they basically don't pay us back for it. \nThey sell the drugs in Canada without the research factor as part of \nthe cost.\n  Of course, there are other things we can do in this area--and, \nhopefully, we will get into those debates--such as marketing drugs and \nhow you control the cost more effectively. Those are other issues. But \nthis question of how we balance bringing generics into the marketplace \nversus creating continued incentive to research is absolutely a \ncritical question of maintaining a healthy society and getting more \ndrugs to the market, which will benefit more people within our society.\n  Hatch-Waxman has been an extraordinary success. When it was drafted \nby Senator Hatch and Congressman Henry Waxman, I don't think they would \nhave anticipated they would produce something so successful. It has \naccomplished its goal very effectively. But, unfortunately, as so often \nhappens, as time has gone on, we have seen some holes in it. It has \nmutated a bit, and smart lawyers have figured out ways around it. As a \nresult, unfortunately, both the brand companies and the generic \ncompanies have found ways, in some instances--not all but some--to game \nthe system. Brand companies are keeping generics out of the market \nlonger by using the mechanisms available under Hatch-Waxman, and \nkeeping other generic companies off the playing field by also using the \nmechanisms under Hatch-Waxman.\n  So there has been an attempt to reform it. It began with a bill \ncalled McCain-Schumer, which mutated into Collins-Edwards, which \nactually took as its base a significant amount of language that I \ndeveloped for an amendment within the committee. So the underlying bill \nis basically moving in the right direction and is a good bill.\n  It has four major problems, however, two of which I thought had been \nfixed before we got out of committee--at least I think it was pretty \nclear that everybody at the markup believed there was an agreement that \nthey would be fixed before it got to the floor. Two of the others still \nrequire amendment activity--or they are all going to require amendment \nactivity now, but they should not. Only two of them should have to \nrequire amendment activity.\n  Where are these problems? They are technical in nature, but they have \na huge impact on the process. The FDA has looked at the bill, and it \nhas found these problems to exist. They are not my creation. They are \nnot some brand name drug company's creation. They are not even the \ngenerics companies' creation. They are a problem which is highlighted \nby the way the language is drafted.\n  I want to read now the FDA's concerns because they basically make the \ncase for these problems. The FDA, I believe, is the fair arbiter of \nthis issue. In a memo dated July 10 from Frederick Ansell of the FDA to \nDiane Prince and Patrick McGarey, he points out a variety of issues. I \nwill highlight the ones I think are the most significant.\n  The introductory paragraph:\n\n       This memorandum follows up on my July 9 memorandum on \n     technical issues with S. 812's substitute amendment. This \n     memorandum addresses substantive concerns--\n\n  Substantive concerns--\n\n     about the legislation.\n\n  The first point they make deals with something called civil actions. \nThis is a change in patent law which is rather dramatic. It deals with \nthe 30-month stay issue and how that works.\n\n       Civil action to correct or delete patent information. The \n     civil action can be brought against patent holder to \n     ``correct'' patent information required to be provided under \n     the bill. Since there is no requirement that the plaintiff \n     have filed a par. IV certification, does this mean there is \n     an alternative available to an ANDA holder to file suit in \n     lieu of certifying under par. IV? That language also means \n     that a suit can be brought not only to delete a patent that \n     should not have been listed, but over whether the listing was \n     ``correct.'' If the incorrect or missing information means \n     that the NDA or patent holder ``fail[ed] to file information \n     on or before the date,'' (even if it is later ``corrected,'' \n     since the correct information was not filed as of the due \n     date), then a potentially technical failure to provide \n     information will make the holder ``barred from bringing a \n     civil action for infringement of the patent against a \n     person'' who filed an ANDA.\n\n  Skipping a few sentences:\n\n       This is a change in the patent law that would provide \n     pharmaceutical patents less protection than any other \n     category of patent and would presumably harm innovation in \n     drug research area.\n\n  I reemphasize this point: This language ``would presumably harm \ninnovation in drug research.'' That is the FDA evaluating the effects \nof the 30-month rule as it is structured in this bill.\n  Going on to another section, the 45-day rule. This was something on \nwhich we thought we reached an agreement in the committee. It is a \ncomplicated issue, but the 45-day rule means that under the bill as it \nis drafted, if the holder of the patent, the brand company, the primary \ndeveloper of the patent does not bring a suit in 45 days, they \nessentially lose their ability to bring suits against anybody, not just \nthe generic company that filed a plan against their patent--against \nanybody.\n  This is a radical departure and would essentially mean that for most \nbrand companies, they would just have to file suits interminably or \nelse be put at risk of losing any rights to their patent.\n  To quote the FDA, which is summarizing their view of this language:\n\n       The same considerations raised about barring patent \n     lawsuits altogether raised about an earlier provision of the \n     bill apply to this language concerning patents that would \n     not, following the notice and suit, permit a 30-day stay.\n\n  Skipping down again:\n\n       That may make preparing an infringement case sufficient to \n     obtain a preliminary injunction difficult, making illusory \n     the ability to protect the patent or forever be barred.\n\n  Making illusory--emphasizing ``the ability to protect the patent or \nforever be barred.''\n  Essentially this language, which we had thought we had agreement to \ncorrect, in the FDA's view would make ``illusory the ability to protect \nthe patent or forever be barred''--obviously not constructive to \ncreating new research in the area of drugs.\n  The third area is the 180-day issue, which is a major issue. If a \ngeneric company files a challenge under the present law and comes on \nthe playing field, so to say, then they get 180 days exclusively to put \ntheir product in the marketplace. This is an attempt to encourage \ngenerics to come into play.\n  The Edwards-Collins bill has an incredibly complex new system to try \nto\n\n[[Page S6824]]\n\naddress this issue. The language I proposed would have essentially \neliminated the 180 days if there had been collusion between the brand \nname company and the generic company.\n  One way the system is gamed is a brand name company and a generic \ncompany get together. A generic company comes in, files, and, as a \nresult, with the consent of the brand name company, essentially locks \ndown the product for another 180 days, and then they continue to roll \nthat out.\n  In an attempt to address that, I proposed language which would \nbasically be use-it-or-lose-it language. In other words, if they came \nin and did not produce their product, they would not get their 180-day \nexclusivity.\n  The Edwards-Collins bill sets up a very convoluted system where you \ncan have a rolling 180 days and can actually end up with this going on \nforever. The FDA memo describes this, and then it says in conclusion:\n\n       And if in that circumstance, the second applicant cannot go \n     to market within 60 days, then the third applicant obtains \n     180 day exclusivity.\n\n  Talking about how this becomes a rolling event.\n  Then it says:\n\n       This does not seem to make a great deal of sense, given \n     that the supposed purpose of exclusivity is to encourage a \n     challenge to a patent by a generic. It is also possible that \n     exclusivity could roll and roll on forever. It also means \n     that it will not be clear which applicant if any should \n     receive exclusivity. Finally, whereas under current law, only \n     one applicant (the first) or none can receive exclusivity, \n     the ability of one of multiple applicants to receive \n     exclusivity means that there will be more instances of \n     exclusivity, delaying the date that the public will be \n     enabled to obtain generic versions of a drug generally, and \n     at a cheaper price, than during the duopoly of the innovator \n     and the generic with exclusivity.\n\n  In other words, the language actually works against bringing generics \nto the market according to the FDA view.\n  We have these four major issues, the fourth one being the fact that a \nnew cause of action is created under this bill which is a private cause \nof action and which, in our opinion, is a very bad idea and very poor \npolicy, and I will enter into the Record a number of letters, including \none from Susan Estrich, reflecting the view that this is bad policy, to \ncreate this new cause of action.\n  The reason I raise these points is to make clear that this bill, \nwhich was first introduced on Thursday, which came out of committee on \nThursday and which is now on the floor, has some substantive problems \nwith it. Some of these substantive problems could have been corrected \nif the markup procedure had been followed. They were not. But I do \nbelieve it is appropriate we have a few days to air the issues so \npeople can get a little window of knowledge on this bill before we \nsuddenly jump into it. That is what we are asking for as a result of \nthis delay in the ability to amend the bill.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts made the statement, or at least he was \nreported to have made the statement, that the first he heard of these \nconcerns was 5 minutes ago--or to quote, ``the first I heard there was \nan objection was 5 minutes before.''\n  I presume before the objection, quoting Senator Kennedy. That was in \nan AP story by Janelle Carter.\n  The fact is, that is not accurate. We had made it very clear that we \nexpected the agreement in the markup to be followed, and one would \npresume if the agreement was not followed there would be an objection. \nHow else would one proceed?\n  So the 5 minutes either implies that he was not at the markup, or \nthat if he was at the markup he did not hear the agreement. The fact \nis, there was an agreement. So it is not reasonable to say that we were \ndelaying this bill when, in fact, all we are trying to do is accomplish \nwhat was represented to us was going to be done originally, when the \nbill was ran through committee.\n  To lay the blame for this delay at the hands of greedy corporations \nis to throw red herrings and smokescreens over a process which, in my \nopinion, is being abused from the standpoint of the markup process. It \nhas nothing to do with winners and losers under a delay. As a practical \nmatter, this delay is probably going to have virtually no impact on \nthis bill, or on the drug bill, because the debate is going to go \nforward today and we are going to discuss all the different issues, as \nI have outlined the problems--the FDA memorandum and the other issues \nwhich are of concern. Then when we get to the amendment process, people \nwill be up to speed. Hopefully, a little more light will have been \nshined on this bill, which needs light on it, and then hopefully we can \npass it. Of course, this bill is going to be totally overwhelmed by the \nactual bills that are going to deal with the overall drug bill.\n  While we are on that topic, let me make a couple of points. The \nSenator from Massachusetts held up a chart which showed a line that \nwent straight down about drug coverage and other coverage that insured \nindividuals are getting. He also held up another chart with a line that \nwent straight up about people being added to the marketplace who were \nuninsured. I suspect he will probably refer to the fact there are so \nmany uninsured.\n  It is a little like that story of the fellow who kills his parents \nand then goes to the court and throws himself on the mercy of the court \nbecause he is an orphan. The fact is, the reason the amount of coverage \nis going down and the reason the number of uninsured is going up is \nbecause this Congress continues to pass mandates on to the price of the \npremium, all sorts of different things which feel good, sound good, are \ngood ideas but each new mandate significantly increases the cost of \ninsurance for everyone. As a result of increasing that cost, either the \nother items of insurance have to be reduced in order to keep the price \nstable--which sometimes is what happens in reducing the availability of \ndrug coverage or dental coverage or something else that one might have \nhad before the new mandate hit--or you have to increase the price of \nthe insurance, thus people and businesses cannot afford it, especially \nsmall businesses, so more people become uninsured.\n  We are complaining coverage is less and that more people are \nuninsured while we are basically creating the problem by adding more \nand more mandates into the marketplace, which inevitably forces up the \nprice of insurance and inevitably forces people out of coverage. In the \nend, it may be the goal of some in this body and in the other body to \naccomplish that so there will be more pressure to generate a national \nhealth care plan along the lines of what was presented by Senator \nClinton back when she was First Lady, a plan which would basically have \nthe Federal Government take over all health care so everybody would \nhave some form of coverage, much like the Canadian or the British \nsystem. If more uninsured are created, there will be more pressure \ncreated, obviously. That may be the goal of some. The goal of others \nmay be: I am especially concerned about this ailment or that ailment \nand I really want it to be covered by insurance; I have an anecdotal \nexperience in my life that says this part of health care definitely \nneeds to be covered because I know somebody who did not have coverage \nand who had this problem. So we add that as a mandate.\n\n  Whatever the reasons are, the facts cannot be denied: Every time we \nadd these new mandates, we increase the cost of insurance or we reduce \nthe other coverages under insurance, and the result is we are adding \nmore uninsured to the marketplace, or alternatively we are reducing the \navailability of various types of coverage in other areas that are not \nmandated. And that is why that chart occurs. That is why we are seeing \ndrops in coverage; it is us.\n  It is like the famous Pogo cartoon: We know the enemy, and he is us.\n  On that issue, the Senator from Massachusetts attacked aggressively \nthe House-passed plan. The House plan does not happen to be the Senate \nplan--and that would be the Senate Democrat plan or the Senate \nRepublican plan or the tripartite plan or bipartite plan, or however \nmany different plans we have floating around. There are some very \nlegitimate plans that have been proposed in the Senate, though, and if \nwe are talking about procedure and how we get these plans discussed and \nproperly voted on, one must ask the question: Why is the Finance \nCommittee being bypassed? Why is this new drug plan being written in an \noffice across the hall instead of in an open committee room where it \nshould be written?\n  The answer is very simple. Because if the Democratic leadership went \nto the Finance Committee, it is very likely\n\n[[Page S6825]]\n\nthat a bipartisan bill would be reported out and it would be the \ntripartisan plan which has been offered by Senator Breaux, Senator \nJeffords, and Senator Snowe. That plan, I suspect, has a majority \nvote--I do not know because I do not serve on the committee, but I \ncertainly heard this from a lot of members of the committee--that plan \nhas a very reasonable chance of having a majority on that committee. \nThat is why the committee is being bypassed, because the Democratic \nleadership does not like that plan for some reason. I guess it does not \ncost enough.\n  That plan costs about $400 billion. That is still over the $300 \nbillion we had in the budget, but it is nowhere near the pricetag of \nwhat I suspect will be the plan we will see proposed by the Democratic \nleadership, which may be scored as high as $700 billion, which is a \nhuge amount of money, which leads me to the next question: When Senator \nKennedy talks about how little coverage the House plan had--or maybe \nothers in this body do not feel the Snowe-Jeffords-Breaux bill has \nenough coverage and they want to expand that coverage dramatically by \nreducing copays or reducing deductibles or essentially reducing the \ncatastrophic threshold, and so they get up to a number of $700 billion \nin their scoring of what their bill ends up costing, which is a huge \namount of money. The $300 billion is a lot of money, I think; $700 \nbillion is two and a half times that, almost. So that is really a lot \nof money.\n  Somebody has to ask the question: Where does it come from? We do not \nhave a surplus. Where is the $700 billion going to come from, this \nextra $400 billion on top of the $300 billion that we have? It comes \nfrom the younger generation. It comes from those Americans who are \nworking today, going to be working tomorrow, and going to be working 10 \nyears from now, and who are going to have to support the baby boom \ngeneration when it hits retirement--my generation, the generation of \nBill Clinton, the generation of George W. Bush, the generation of the \nSenator in the chair, the Presiding Officer.\n\n  Our generation is huge, absolutely huge. We know that. In every \nsegment of American society that we have impacted, from when we started \na dramatic run on baby carriages and cribs back in the early 1950s, to \nwhen we pushed the limits of our educational systems in the 1960s and \n1970s, to our music in the 1980s--we have changed fundamentally the way \nthis society has worked, simply by our size.\n  When we hit retirement we are going to have a huge impact on this \nsociety and the impact, the most significant impact we are going to \nhave is that we as a massive generation that will be in retirement will \nhave to be supported by the smaller generations that are younger than \nus who are working for a living--our children and our grandchildren. We \nare going to end up passing on to them huge costs to maintain the \nstandard we have set and which we think is reasonable as a society for \nsenior citizens to have, both in the area of health care and in the \narea of retirement benefits--Social Security. We know the Social \nSecurity system is headed toward a crisis because of this generation, \nbecause of our generation, and the demands we are going to put on the \nsystem.\n  When we add a new drug benefit, of which we are basically going to be \nthe biggest beneficiaries--obviously people who are in the system today \nwill benefit significantly, too, but the big cost of the benefit is \ngoing to kick in when we start to retire, beginning in the year 2008, \nwhich is not that far away--that cost is going to be passed on to our \nkids in the form of taxes. Their taxes are going to have to go up. They \nare going to have to work harder or they are going to take home less in \norder to support their young families so we can get that drug benefit.\n  When we start throwing out these new benefit ideas on the floor of \nthe Senate, and we start to malign other programs--whether it is the \nHouse program or whether it is the tripartisan program put forward by \nSenator Grassley and Senator Breaux and Senator Collins and Senator \nJeffords, or whether it is the proposal put forward by Senator Ensign \nand Senator Hagel--when we start to malign these programs because they \ndo not cost enough, they do not give enough benefit, somebody should be \nasking the question: Who is going to pay the bill for the increase to \nbump these programs up above what they are proposed at?\n  They are all extremely generous, $300 billion being the floor for \nthese programs. Who is going to pay the cost? It is going to be younger \nAmericans; our children and our grandchildren who are going to pay that \ncost. We need to be careful about what we do to them because if we \ncontinue on this path as our generation retires, we are going to \nsignificantly impact their quality of life. We are going to reduce it \nbecause we will have put so many burdens on them to support us.\n  Let's put some balance into this debate. Let's not just talk about \nhow many new benefits we can put on the books. Let's talk about how \nmany new benefits we can afford to put on the books, how many new \nbenefits can our children afford to pay so we can help in the area of \ndrug coverage.\n  Yes, we need a drug package. We need a Hatch-Waxman reform package \nabsolutely--in fact, I drafted a large part of the package we are \ndebating today, the Collins-Edwards package. That was borrowed from \nlanguage which I was successful in putting in.\n\n  I appreciate the fact the Senator from North Carolina and the Senator \nfrom Maine chose to use language which I had developed because I \nbelieve very strongly that we need a strong generics industry and we \nneed to have the capacity of generics to compete aggressively in the \nmarketplace, coming quickly--or as quickly as reasonable--after you \nhave a reasonable return to the brand companies, to accomplish the goal \nof reducing prices of drugs.\n  The basic bill is a good bill with some significant reservations, the \nmost significant being the ones I have outlined.\n  Of course a new drug benefit for senior citizens is critical. We have \ngone from a society where, as I mentioned earlier, we treat people by \nputting them under the knife to where we treat people by giving them \nthese miracle drugs. They are expensive. If you are a senior and you \nare trying to make ends meet and you get hit with a drug bill, it can \nbe very difficult, in some instances. So we need a benefit. Low-income \nseniors especially should be completely covered--and all these programs \ndo that and do it effectively. Middle-income seniors should have some \nsort of relief. Certainly anybody who has a catastrophic event which \ninvolves the cost of drugs over a threshold of any significance should \nhave coverage. We can design a plan to do that.\n  But in doing that, let's be sensitive to the fact that it is costing \nsomebody something. This is not money that grows on trees. This is \nmoney that comes from somebody's hard day's work. And that hard day's \nwork is going to be done by our children and our grandchildren. They \nwould like to have that money to maybe help them educate their children \nor their grandchildren or buy a new car or live a better life. So we \nhave to be judicious in our approach, not simply be political.\n  Let me, for the record, put in the record, parts of the record of the \nmarkup so that it is clear at the markup there was an understanding, I \nbelieve, reached that this language would be corrected.\n  The first issue went to the ``use it or lose it'' language. I quote \nSenator Clinton.\n\n       My staff at least believed that it was intended to be as I \n     have described it, that generic ``X''----\n\n  And then Senator Edwards intervened and said:\n\n   Edwards saying:\n\n       Why don't we just clarify it--Mr. Chairman, if we can just \n     clarify this language. I think Senator Gregg is right about \n     intent, and I actually read the language the same way he \n     does--\n\n  Then I speak and I say:\n\n       Well, that is a major step in the right direction.\n\n  That went to that issue. Then on another issue--this may be the same \nissue actually--Senator Clinton said:\n\n       --so I think we need to go back to the drawing board to \n     clarify this.\n\n  Senator Edwards said:\n\n       Yes, we can fix this.\n  Further to this issue why we--I, not we--have delayed going to this \nbill until tomorrow when cloture ripens, and the point about the \nrepresentation being made by the Senator from Massachusetts that it was \nbecause of the\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\ngreed of some corporations out there, that they want to delay, my \nrepresentation is that there was an understanding in the markup--in the \nmarkup that was very clear, in my opinion--that two items in the bill \nwould be corrected, two major items, one dealing with the 45-day rule, \nand the other dealing with bioequivalency, and that had to do with \nSenator Frist, that those would be corrected before we took the bill to \nthe floor.\n  Because of the rapidness of the bill coming to the floor without a \nreport, within less than a week of its being actually filed in the \ncommittee, it seems to me that it was reasonable to shine some light on \nthese two issues before we move to the bill--to actually amending the \nbill.\n  So I want to return to the language here of the markup to make it \nclear why I believe my presentation is correct on this point. The first \nitem I quoted was Senator Edwards saying:\n\n       Why don't we just clarify it--Mr. Chairman, if we can just \n     clarify this language. I think Senator Gregg is right about \n     the intent. . . .\n\n  This deals with the 45-day issue, and the question of whether or not \nit cuts off all lawsuits, all rights of remedy if you do not bring a \nsuit; it cuts off all rights of remedy under the patents so that a \nperson--the company basically loses its patent if it doesn't bring a \nlawsuit against filing generically in that 45 days. You lose your \npatent against everybody. Nobody wanted that, but that is what the bill \nended up doing in its present language.\n  Then the second part of that discussion went to--Senator Clinton:\n\n     --so I think we need to go back to the drawing beard and \n     clarify this.\n\n  Senator Edwards says:\n\n       Yes, we can fix this.\n\n  Then I said:\n\n       Good.\n\n  The Chairman said:\n\n       All right. Now we are going to instruct the staff to make \n     that clarification, along with the rest of the bill.\n\n  That is my point.\n  There was, at the same time, some discussion of language which \nSenator Collins was straightening out. I believe that was actually \nstraightened out.\n  Then I went on to say:\n  I think that significant progress has been made here in these \ndiscussions, obviously on the 45-day issue and on Senator Collins' \nproposal.\n  I believe there is middle ground that can be reached on the new cause \nof action, and much of this bill is excellent. In fact, it came out of \nideas that I strongly endorse and was supportive of and hoped we could \nreach agreement on.\n  With the cause of action language in its present structure, I cannot \nvote for the bill, but certainly I hope that by the time we get to the \nfloor and as we move through the floor that we can adjust it enough so \nthat I can feel comfortable with voting for the bill.\n  I was talking about cause of action.\n  That is really a point on which I still hope we can reach agreement. \nIf we can, the bill becomes, in my opinion, a very workable piece of \nlegislation that should be passed.\n  Then wrapping up, I said:\n  I would also note for the record that we do wish to have our \nprocedural days which are available to us to review this, and I would \nhope during this time we could work out the few--obviously, get the \nlanguage straightened out--but work out the few substantive kinks and \nget this to a point where it could have unanimous support.\n  The Chairman. We will certainly work with you and your staff in \nworking out the language on this.\n  That is more vague and not as much to the point as the 45-day \nexchange. But the point I was making there was that the traditional way \nwe bring a bill to the floor is we do a report. The minority then has 3 \ndays to file. Then there are 3 more days. You usually have 6 days after \na report is filed under a bill before the bill comes to the floor. That \nhas been totally shortened.\n  By not filing the report, the majority was able to put themselves in \nthe position where they can call up a bill after 1 day. That is their \nright. That is the rule. But it is not the traditional way things have \nhappened when you report a bill out of committee. You usually have the \nreport and then have 3 days to respond to it. I was under the \nassumption, wrongly obviously, that we would have 3 days to work this \nout, put some light on the bill, and address the issues which were \nhighlighted by me here.\n  There was another exchange--unfortunately, I don't have a copy--\nbetween Senator Frist and Senator Edwards in which Senator Frist raised \nthe point about the bioequivalency issue that goes to whether or not \nthe generic drug comes to the market and is actually equivalent to the \ndrug that it claims to be copying. If it is not, you have significant \nhealth questions. I don't want a drug out there that comes to market \nclaiming to be equivalent but is not equivalent, because then you have \ndifferent absorption rates. As a result, you could have serious medical \nproblems.\n  This was the point that Dr. Frist made very well. Obviously, he is a \ndoctor. Senator Edwards said to Dr. Frist rather specifically: All \nright. We will work that out. I understand your concern. I am \nparaphrasing. We can work that out. Unfortunately, that was also not \nworked out.\n  Those are the reasons. Those are the issues that lie here on the \nquestion of why we are holding this bill over for 48 hours before we \nproceed to the amendment process, which will begin occurring tomorrow \nafter cloture is voted, or cloture is vitiated. Either way, I do think \nit is appropriate that we have this time to discuss the bill because it \nis a complex bill and it needs to be aired.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I must say that is one of the more \ntortured explanations I have heard about why a bill has been delayed \ncoming to the floor of the Senate. Of course, everyone has that right.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I haven't finished the first sentence. Of course, I will \nyield to my friend.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator consider it tortured that a Senator feels \na representation made in markup is not being pursued?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No. Let me just say that I heard the explanation the \nSenator gave, and I heard the explanation also by Senator Kennedy on \nthe floor that, in fact, we have people who do not want to bring this \nbill to the floor of the Senate. They never wanted it on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  They described a ``good'' bill in the House which was passed by the \nHouse. It is referred to as a credible bill. A senior with $1,000 in \nannual drug costs would still pay 81 percent out-of-pocket costs under \na bill passed by the House. Is that a good bill? I don't think so.\n  A senior citizen with $2,000 in yearly drug expenditures would still \npay 65 percent of the cost out of their pockets. Is that a good bill? I \ndon't think so.\n  A senior citizen with $3,000 in annual drug costs pays 77 percent of \nthe money out of their pocket. That is not a drug benefit that makes \nsense.\n  My only point is to say there is no reason to delay. Let us just \nproceed with the legislation, understanding that we are going to do a \nbill that deals with prescription drug benefits and Medicare. Let us \nproceed with the amendment process. If there are representations that \nneed to be honored, let them be honored.\n  I think everyone understands that the chairman of the committee who \nbrought this bill to the floor is an excellent legislator, and he works \nwith everyone in this Chamber. I am certain that before the final \nconsideration of this bill, the concerns that were expressed and the \nrepresentations that were made in that committee, if they have not been \nfully met at this point, they will be met.\n  My only point is that was a long, tortured explanation of why to \ndelay this bill. They do not need to delay this bill. The fact is, we \nall understand what needs to be done. We ought to get about the \nbusiness of doing it now--not later, not tomorrow, and not the day \nafter tomorrow.\n  It is true, as the Senator from New Hampshire said, that not too many \ndecades ago most health care was treated under a knife. If you had a \nbig problem, you went and had surgery.\n  It is also true that now we have miracle, lifesaving drugs that have \nbeen created in this country, in large part\n\n[[Page S6827]]\n\nby public research at the National Institutes of Health, by research \nfunded all across America, and also by private research by \npharmaceutical manufacturing companies, which, incidentally, we provide \na tax credit for that research. I support that tax credit. But the fact \nis, we have produced miracle, lifesaving drugs and those prescription \ndrugs are now available to people who have problems with their health. \nThe difficulty, however, is that you can only see a miracle happen with \nmiracle drugs, or you can only save a life with lifesaving drugs if the \nperson who needs them can afford them.\n  We have so many people living so much longer these days who reach \ntheir retirement years and declining income years who can't afford \nthese lifesaving drugs. That is the reason we ought to put a \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program.\n\n  My colleague who just spoke said: Who is going to pay for this? I \nfound that interesting because we never heard any of those questions \nwhen recently we had a bill on the floor of the Senate and we were \ntalking about repeal of the estate tax for the highest income earners \nin America. One of my colleagues said: Well, at least let us just \nrepeal it for everybody under $100 million. And only people with more \nthan $100 million will have to pay any estate tax at all. But that \nwasn't good enough. They voted against that. Who is going to pay for \nthe estate tax of people whose estates are higher than $100 million? \nDid anybody ask that question? No. They only ask the cost when it comes \nto trying to provide some help for senior citizens--those who live on \n$400, $500, or $600 a month who are 80 years old, have heart disease \nand diabetes, and who have to take several different kinds of \nprescription drugs and can't afford them.\n  The two issues we are going to deal with are coverage; that is, shall \nwe, will we, can we put a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare \nProgram? The answer to all of those questions is yes. It is long past \nthe time to do that.\n  We should provide coverage for prescription drugs in the Medicare \nProgram, but it ought not be an illusory kind of coverage. It ought not \nbe the case that we passed the bill and let us just tell everybody we \npassed a bill. Is it a good bill if you have $3,000 in prescription \ndrug costs and the House of Representatives says, oh, by the way, we \nhave given you a prescription drug benefit and you still get to pay 70 \npercent of your $3,000 cost out of your pocket, and we will cover the \nrest? That is like giving someone a $5 coupon and saying go buy a \nMercedes. It isn't worth anything. But they say: We gave a discount \nwith the coupon.\n  We have to provide coverage. We have to provide effective coverage \nthat really does provide help.\n  I have described, before, meeting many senior citizens, especially \nsenior citizens who are affected by drug prices. One evening, at a \nmeeting in a small town in North Dakota, at the end of a meeting a \nwoman came up to me, perhaps 75 or 80 years old, and she grabbed me by \nthe elbow and said: Mr. Senator, can you help me? I said: I will sure \ntry. What is the problem? She said: Well, I have these health problems \nthat are very serious, and my doctor says I have to take this \nprescription drug medicine, but I can't afford it. As she spoke, her \neyes welled with tears and her chin began to quiver. She began to cry. \nShe said: I can't afford it. I don't have the money to get the medicine \nthe doctor says I need.\n  This happens all across the country. We need to do something about \nthat. That is why we want to put prescription drug coverage in the \nMedicare Program.\n  The second thing we need to do--and very important, in my judgment--\nis to do something that puts downward pressure on prices, because if we \njust put a prescription drug coverage provision in the Medicare Program \nand do nothing about prices, we will have done very little in the long \nterm, because last year's prescription drug costs--that is, spending on \nprescription drugs--increased nearly 18 percent in this country; the \nyear before that, 16 percent; the year before that, 17 percent. We will \nhook up a hose to the Federal trough and suck it dry. We can't do that.\n  We have to provide a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare \nProgram, one that works, one that is sensible, thoughtful, and provides \nreal benefits to senior citizens. But if that is all we do, we have \nfailed miserably, in my judgment. We must also put downward pressure on \nprescription drug prices--for the benefit not only of the Medicare \nProgram that will be saddled with these costs, but also for the benefit \nof all other Americans who are also required to take these prescription \ndrugs.\n  Let me say--I have said it before on the floor of the Senate--we have \nprescription drug manufacturers that are good companies. I am not here \nto tarnish all companies that manufacture prescription drugs. We have \nsome great companies out there. We have great men and women doing \nterrific research.\n  Incidently, I support the tax credit they have that exists for that \nresearch, experimentation, and development. I have always supported \nthat tax credit. So good for them. I support those companies. But I do \nnot like their pricing policies. So I am going to offer an amendment.\n  The underlying bill, incidentally, deals with generic drugs, the \nability to substitute a virtually identical drug to be sold at a lower \nprice. That is the underlying amendment. I support that. I and my \ncolleagues--Senator Wellstone, Senator Stabenow, Senator Snowe, and \nmany others--intend to offer an amendment dealing with the \nreimportation of prescription drugs, as well, that will put downward \npressure on prescription drug prices here in this country.\n  I do not want Americans to buy prescription drugs elsewhere. That is \nnot the point of it. I want to force a repricing of prescription drugs \nin this country. I do not want to force Americans to go to Canada, for \nexample.\n  The question is, Why should an American citizen have to go to Canada \nto get a fair deal and fair price on prescription drugs that were made \nin America? That is the question.\n  Let me, if I might, by unanimous consent, show several pill bottles \non the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Just to make the point: This is a drug called Zocor used \nto lower cholesterol. In fact, there is a football coach whom you see \non television almost every day in this country who talks about his \nheart problems. He had surgery, and now he takes Zocor for a healthier \nlife.\n  Zocor, likely, is a wonderful drug. You will see, it is sold in two \ndifferent bottles. For this bottle, sold in the United States, it is \n$3.03 per tablet. If you buy it in Canada--the same drug, put in the \nsame bottle, by the same company, FDA inspected--it is not $3.03, it is \n$1.12 per tablet. That is Zocor--nearly triple the price in the United \nStates.\n  Let me demonstrate another prescription drug and the pricing \npolicies. This is Vioxx, used for arthritis. It is sold in identical \nbottles in the U.S. and Canada. It is an FDA-approved prescription \ndrug. If you buy it in the United States, it costs $2.20 per tablet. If \nyou buy it in Canada, it costs 78 cents per tablet. Why nearly three \ntimes the price in the United States for the U.S. consumer?\n  Finally, if I might demonstrate one additional prescription drug, \nthis is the prescription drug Paxil. It is used to treat depression. It \nis sold in identical bottles, made by the same company. It is the same \ntablet, produced by the same company. It costs $2.20 for the American \nconsumer, 97 cents for the Canadian.\n  These examples beg the question about pricing policy: Why does the \nU.S. consumer pay the highest price in the world? My colleague from New \nHampshire said that is because we are paying for all the research and \ndevelopment. That is not the case. It is just not accurate.\n  In fact, 37 percent of the research and development of prescription \ndrugs is done in Europe; 36 percent is done in the United States. \nSlightly more is done in Europe than done in the United States, yet \nevery European consumer is paying less money than the United States \nconsumer for prescription drugs.\n  So that is not an argument that works. They try it, and I assume we \nwill hear it again, so we will trot out these studies again to \ndemonstrate it is not accurate.\n  We need to do two things, as I indicated. We need to provide a \nprescription drug benefit to the Medicare Program. We are going to do \nthat, if not\n\n[[Page S6828]]\n\nthis week, next week. We have the patience to get this done. It needs \nto be effective. It cannot be what the House did, which is essentially \na hollow vehicle that says: Hey, we passed a bill. They passed a bill \nthat provides precious few benefits to senior citizens.\n  We are going to pass a piece of legislation that has a prescription \ndrug benefit to it. We are also going to pass some legislation--and I \nhope a reimportation amendment, which is bipartisan and, incidentally, \nreceived 74 votes the last time it was addressed here on the floor of \nthe Senate. We have narrowed it and changed it so it now deals with \nonly reimportation from Canada, which has nearly an identical chain of \ncustody supply and then can be accessed only by licensed pharmacists \nand licensed distributors in the United States.\n  So there is no safety issue. All there is, is a price issue. We are \ngoing to offer a reimportation amendment. We had 74 votes for it \npreviously. I expect it to be added to this bill.\n  I expect, at the end of the day, we will have done something very \nimportant: Added a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare Program \nand also imposed some cost containment measures. By cost containment, I \nam saying, let the market system and the global economy apply downward \nprice pressure on prescription drugs.\n\n  So there has been a lot said. My colleague from New Hampshire also \ntalked about us running out of money in Social Security. I might \nobserve that those who are trying to create privatized accounts in \nSocial Security, and hook them to the stock market, might take a look \nat the market in recent days and see whether they might run out of \nmoney really quickly with their plan.\n  I think it would be nice to debate that plan one of these days. They \nhave been pushing for the notion of privatized accounts inside the \nSocial Security system, which falls about $1 trillion short. They \ncreate a $1 trillion hole but then connect Social Security to the stock \nmarket.\n  One might enjoy, it seems to me, having a discussion about the merits \nof that idea one of these days. There is very little enjoyment talking \nabout what is happening in the market. This is a very important, \nserious issue in the country.\n  I just wanted to make the point that there are those who talk about \nthe Social Security problem, and I will tell you how you make that \nproblem much worse, and that is, embrace those who want to connect the \nSocial Security revenues to the stock market in some way. And that \nincludes the President and those in Congress who feel they want to do \nthat.\n  This would be a good time, perhaps, to have a discussion about the \ndangers of taking the Social Security Program, which has the word \n``security'' in it, and connecting it with the stock market.\n  But getting back, finally, to the question of prescription drugs, let \nme say to the Senator who chairs the committee, the underlying bill you \nbrought to the floor of the Senate is a good bill. I held a hearing on \nthis in my Consumer Affairs Subcommittee in the Commerce Committee.\n  This bill makes great sense. I fully support it. I hope, of course, \nfor his support, and others', on the issue of reimportation, which is \nthe amendment we will offer to try to impose some downward pressure on \nprescription drug prices. And then it is my fervent hope we find a way \nto do something that the House of Representatives could not or did not \ndo, and that is to pass a prescription drug benefit in the Medicare \nProgram that provides real benefits.\n  There are so many people in this country, senior citizens and other \ncitizens as well, who just cannot afford lifesaving drugs. There is \nnothing lifesaving about a prescription drug you need but can't afford. \nThat is what we are trying to address in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, earlier in the debate, there were \nquestions about what was agreed to and what was supposed to be \nclarified. For those who have any question, I will reference two \nprovisions that were discussed during our markup and also what was \nincluded in the bill.\n  As I have indicated, several times last evening and earlier today, if \nit is technical language, we are prepared to address the technical \nlanguage now during the lunch break. We were also prepared to address \nthese last evening. But if it is substantive, we ought to have a change \nin the form of an amendment. That is the way we proceed around here.\n  We agreed with Senator Frist to technical language to clarify one \nprovision. That language is in the bill. It deals with the section:\n  Shall not be construed to alter the authority of the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to regulate biological products under the \nFood and Drug and Cosmetics . . .\n  He was concerned about whether it did or didn't and whether the \nlanguage was sufficiently clear. We have included that particular \nsection in it. Those who want to look at this can see that.\n  We agreed with Senator Gregg to instruct the staff to make a \nclarification on another provision stating that a patent can still be \nenforced against subsequent, future generic applicants. That technical \nlanguage was added last Thursday. Senator Gregg received it last week \nbut raised no objections. That language is on page 35:\n\n       The owner of a patent shall be barred from bringing a civil \n     action for infringement on the patent in connection with the \n     development, manufacture, offer to sell, or sale of a drug \n     for which the application was filed or approved under this \n     subsection.\n\n  That is new language. The last three lines, 18 through 20, are new \nlanguage. That language was available to the minority last Thursday \nnight. We were not notified Friday or Saturday; we were not notified on \nMonday. We were notified about 10 minutes after the leader indicated he \nwas going to offer the motion to proceed to the bill. I don't think it \nreally carries much weight.\n  Before we recess for the lunch hour, I want to discuss the abuses of \nthe existing legislation that the proposed legislation will remedy. \nAlso, I would like to discuss why it is important to close these \nloopholes because of the impact it will have on the costs of drugs to \nconsumers.\n  In 1984, Congress enacted the Hatch-Waxman Act, which provided a \nframework for allowing generic drugs to come to market while protecting \nthe patents of new medicines that are breaking new ground each and \nevery day. But as recent hearings before our Health Committee and the \nCommittee on Commerce have revealed, there are abuses of the Hatch-\nWaxman Act by both name brand and generic drug companies that have \ndelayed the approval and marketing of generic drugs. These findings are \nconfirmed by numerous studies by the Federal Trade Commission and other \nindependent experts.\n  The basic structure of the Hatch-Waxman Act remains sound. It has \nbeen a tremendous success in promoting competition and innovation. But \nthere are clearly weaknesses in the Act which are being exploited to \ndelay competition and shore up the bottom lines of drug companies with \nempty pipelines.\n  These abuses force American consumers to pay four times more on \naverage for some prescription drugs.\n  This must be stopped.\n  Everyone agrees that drug companies are entitled to fair profits on \ntheir research and innovation. But when patents expire, those companies \nmust innovate to succeed and help patients, not block competition to \ntheir old drugs.\n  When we passed Hatch-Waxman, we believed we were going to see a whole \nseries of breakthroughs in new prescription drugs, but that hasn't \nreally taken place. What the drug companies have done is reshuffle the \nold formulas, put them out, and tried to maintain their privileged \nposition under the patent laws. That is what has happened. We have had \nthese abuses.\n  We have seen the patent abuses, as this chart indicates, where we \nshow the cost to date to consumers, the additional cost to date, and \nnow the various prescription drugs themselves. This delay has \nbenefitted the patent holder.\n  Instead of having the patent expire and the generic being able to \ncome on and offer this drug to consumers at a considerably lower price, \nthe generic is not being made available.\n  Here's what we're talking about. Today, of the top fifteen best-\nselling\n\n[[Page S6829]]\n\ndrugs potentially subject to generic competition, the basic patents on \nat least five of them have long expired. Their exclusive rights to \nmarket their drugs have long expired. Yet, there is no generic \ncompetition.\n  Drug spending rose at double digit rates between 1996 and 1999, and \nexperts expect the growth in prescription drug spending to continue to \noutpace the growth in health care spending. Some of this increase is \ndue to increased use of drugs. But experts agree that spiraling drug \nprices have accounted for almost two-thirds of growth in drug spending, \nespecially the higher prices of new, aggressively promoted drugs.\n  Generic drugs are clearly part of the answer. Simply put, a 1 percent \nincrease in generic use can decrease the Nation's yearly bill for drugs \nby a billion dollars.\n  These savings are easy to understand. For patients and health plans \nalike, the costs for a brand drug are four times higher than for a \ngeneric equivalent. That difference is even higher for the elderly and \nuninsured, who must often pay full price for their medicines. On \naverage, a month's supply of a generic drug costs a patient $4 and the \nhealth plan $16; the costs for a brand drug are four times higher: $16 \nfor the patient, $64 for the plan. For the uninsured, and seniors who \nlack prescription drug coverage, the full costs are either $20 for the \ngeneric or $80 for the brand drug.\n  Prozac is a clear example. This anti-depressant recently went off-\npatent after generic companies challenged and defeated a Prozac patent. \nToday, you can buy 30 generic Prozac tablets for less than $30, less \nthan a third of what brand-name Prozac will cost you.\n  There are two key loopholes in the law that our legislation will end. \nThe first is the practice of ``ever-greening'' patents, filing patent \nafter patent, many of them entirely frivolous, to try to bar generic \ncompetition long after the basic patent on the medicine has expired. \nThe second is the outrageous tactic used by some drug companies of \nbuying off a potential generic competitor to prevent it from marketing \nits drug and using a quirk in the law to bar any other competitors from \nthe market.\n  Those are the two loopholes and abuses. This legislation is targeted \nto the abuses. The abuses result in billions of dollars for drug \ncompanies, and that is why many of the major drug companies are so \nstrongly opposed to this legislation.\n  Schumer-McCain closes the evergreen loophole by permitting only one \n30-month stay to apply to each generic drug. For the other patents, the \ndrug companies are free to defend its patents the same way any other \ncompany does.\n  A second tactic used by the drug companies is to collude with a \ngeneric drug manufacturer to block other generic versions of the drug \nfrom getting to consumers. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the first \ngeneric drug company which gets to market has that exclusive right for \nsix months before any other generic can compete. In some cases, brand \ndrug companies have bribed the generic drug company never to go to \nmarket. The clock on the six months exclusivity never starts to run, \nand every other generic competitor is locked out forever. But the ones \nwho pay for these unconscionable sweetheart deals are American \npatients.\n  Those are the two abuses. Schumer-McCain prevents collusion between \nbrand name companies and generic competitors by opening generic \nchallenges to invalid patents. Closing those two loopholes will make an \nextraordinary difference.\n  Finally, Gov. Bill Janklow of South Dakota told our committee that \nthe savings for his State's Medicaid Program would be enormous. He \nadded:\n  That's a drop in the bucket compared to what the real costs are out \nthere for the General Motors of this world, and Roy's Blacksmith Shop, \nand everyone in between. It's some individual or retired person that's \npaying for their own on Social Security, or a working person. The point \nis, they all pay more.\n  Madam President, we will all pay more until Schumer-McCain becomes \nlaw. That is what we are about with this legislation. That is why it is \nso important. It is going to have an important impact in calming down \nthe increase in the cost of drugs for the American consumer, and we \nthink the quicker we get on this bill the better.\n  There are other ideas that can also help us in getting a handle on \nthe escalation of costs. Then, hopefully, we will have an opportunity \nto consider the issues of coverage as well. I know there has been a \nprevious agreement for the lunch break.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak for a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, at 2:15, or thereabouts, either Senator \nDaschle or I will offer a unanimous consent request to move on to the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee appropriations bill. We have been \nworking on this for more than a week. I have spoken to the Republican \nleader and I have spoken to the Senator who has been stopping this from \ngoing forward.\n  Everybody should be aware, as I have told the Republican leader and \nthe Senator who is objecting to this, we are going to do this this \nafternoon. I hope that during the Republican conference they will work \nthings out so that we can move to this legislation.\n  I was in the White House this morning. The President wants us to move \nforward on the appropriations bills, especially MILCON. This will be \nour first appropriations bill. I think it is a shame there are issues \nthat normally are not handled in this bill, and it should not hold us \nfrom moving forward. Under the agreement we will propose, we will \nfinish the bill in a little over an hour and have an appropriations \nbill sent to the conference committee and we can wrap it up quickly. In \nthe next week, this bill could go to the President.\n  I think it is too bad we are being held up from moving forward on \nthis bill. The two leaders of the committee, Senator Byrd and Senator \nStevens, have worked extremely hard to get us to this point. I repeat \nthat, this afternoon, we are going to ask unanimous consent to move \nforward on this. I hope there is no objection to it.\n  Madam President, I simply say this. I have been listening to the \ndebate this morning, and if this were a jury, like I used to have when \nI practiced law, this would be a quick verdict. We have the merits on \nour side. The American people support what we are trying to do, and I \nwant the Record spread with how much I appreciate and applaud the \nleadership of the Senator from Massachusetts. This is something he has \nbeen working on not for days, weeks, or months but years. It is too bad \nwe are being prevented from moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6829-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I indicated this morning, we are \ntremendously anxious to move to our first appropriations bill. I \nrepeat, the President has been pushing us on these bills. We marked up \nin the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee today the largest Defense \nappropriations bill in the history of the country.\n  We have already reported out of the subcommittee and the full \ncommittee the military construction appropriations bill, and we have \nnot been able to get it to the floor. There has been an objection on \nthe other side to moving forward.\n  Mr. President, some have suggested we just bring it to the floor. We \ncannot just bring it to the floor because then we get into the cloture \nprocess and that takes many days. We are now trying to go forward on \nthe prescription drug bill, and we are in a cloture situation there, \nhaving filed cloture on the motion to proceed, and we are going to vote \non that tomorrow unless something comes in the meantime.\n  I am basically going to propound the same unanimous consent request I \ndid before. The majority leader was on the floor. The Republican leader \nhas been on the floor. The Republican leader, to his credit, has said \nhe thinks we should move forward with this. Today, I spent some time \nwith him and indicated what we can do to move this forward. He had just \nfinished a meeting with the President.\n  We want to move forward with this bill. We are doing everything we \ncan to move forward. We were told the last time the reason we are not \nmoving forward--and I spoke with the junior Senator from Arizona, and I \nknow how strongly he believes we have to do something about the \nfirefighting problems. I am from the West. We have two big fires \nburning in Nevada right now. I am concerned about them, but the \nfirefighting problems of our country have never been funded in the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill.\n  We are going to have the ability in the supplemental where it should \nbe done. It is an emergency. We have been blocked from doing that by \nthe administration, but it will be done, as it has always been done \nduring my tenure, if not in a supplemental, in the Interior \nappropriations bill, chaired by Senator Byrd, the President pro tempore \nof the Senate. I hope they will allow to us move forward on this.\n  There are military projects that will have to wait until we pass this \nbill. So here I go: I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader, following consultation with the \nRepublican leader, the Senate may proceed to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 486, H.R. 5011, the military construction appropriations \nbill, and that it be considered under the following limitations:\n  That immediately after the bill is reported, all after the enacting \nclause be stricken and the text of Calendar No. 479, S. 2709, the \nSenate committee-reported bill be inserted in lieu thereof; that debate \ntime on the bill and substitute amendment be limited to a total of 45 \nminutes, with an additional 20 minutes under the control of Senator \nMcCain; that the only other amendment in order be an amendment offered \nby Senators Feinstein and Hutchison of Texas, which is at the desk; \nwith debate limited to 10 minutes on the Feinstein-Hutchison amendment; \nthat upon the use or yielding back of time on the amendment, without \nfurther intervening action or debate, the Senate proceed to vote on \nadoption of the amendment; that all debate time not already identified \nin this agreement be equally divided and controlled between the chair \nand ranking member of the subcommittee or their designee; that upon \ndisposition of the Feinstein-Hutchison amendment, and the use or \nyielding back of all time, the substitute amendment, as amended, be \nagreed to; the bill, as amended, be read three times; that section 303 \nof the Congressional Budget Act be waived; and the Senate then proceed \nto a vote on passage of the bill; that upon passage of the bill, the \nSenate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on \nthe disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, without \nfurther intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Reluctantly, I must object at this time on behalf of a group \nof other Senators and myself, not to the terms of the unanimous consent \nagreement as has been outlined by the Senator from Nevada, but rather \nto bringing up the bill until there has been an agreement reached on \nhow to deal with the supplemental funding for dealing with these \nwildfires.\n  I think the Senator from Nevada is absolutely correct that that \nfunding should be on the supplemental appropriations bill. \nUnfortunately, it has not been put on that bill so far. There are a lot \nof different reasons alleged to exist for that. It seems everybody is \nwilling to do it but somehow or another they cannot all get together to \nmake it happen, and if it does not happen on that bill, the only other \nalternative is to try to do it on the military construction bill.\n  The Interior Department appropriations bill is not likely to be able \nto come before us in a timely fashion so the money that is needed for \nreplenishing these Forest Service accounts can be replenished before \nthe end of the fiscal year, and that is the reason we have to retain \nthis option.\n  I hope that within the next several hours an agreement can be reached \nand these funds will be put on the supplemental appropriations bill, as \nthe Senator from Nevada suggests, and then we can move on with this \nimportant legislation. Until then, we do need this as a possible way to \nmove forward with the funding that it seems everybody is for but they \njust cannot find a way to make happen.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think this is too bad, for lack of a \nbetter way to describe things. This bill is not the proper place for \nthis type of funding. With all due respect to my friend from Arizona, \nthis does not create any pressure, holding up the Military Construction \nSubcommittee bill.\n  We have to understand that if we are going to take care of the men \nand women who are defending our country, we need to take care of the \nbills that fund them.\n  I have indicated I am concerned about firefighting in Nevada. We have \nfires burning as I speak, but never in the history of this country, \nthat I am aware, have we funded firefighting through the military \nconstruction bill, and we are not going to do it in the future. Holding \nup this bill creates a false illusion that we are accomplishing \nsomething regarding firefighting in this country.\n  I hope that in the next couple of hours, as my friend from Arizona \nsaid, more deliberation can come and that we can move forward on this \nbill.\n  I am terribly disappointed we do not have more things declared \nemergencies. It is hard to believe, but the terrible disaster that \noccurred in Oklahoma where a barge ran into part of our interstate \nfreeway system, dumped more than a score of cars in the river, killed \nat last count about 14 people, that is not deemed an emergency to fix \nthat road. Now if that is not an emergency, I do not know what is. I do \nnot know what we are trying to accomplish with the numbers game, but \nthat is an emergency, if anything ever was an emergency.\n  Those fires that are burning, those are emergencies. They are not in \nthe next fiscal year, they are in this fiscal year. The fires are \nburning right now. The fires in Arizona are not even out yet. They have \nthem under control, but they will be burning for weeks into the future. \nThey have large crews making sure they do not blow up again. I think \nbooks will probably be written about that fire in Arizona, if not \narticles. They were blowing out fireballs for miles, not a few hundred \nfeet or a thousand feet but, by some accounts, up to 3 miles. They were \nblowing out big\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\nbombs of fire and starting fires up to 3 miles away.\n  I do not know what is happening down at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but \nthey have to come to their senses and realize that some things are \nemergencies. The big fire in Colorado was started by somebody who \nworked for the Forest Service. The big fire in Arizona, from the \ninformation we have now, a firefighter started that fire. It is too \nbad, but they were started. They are emergencies no matter how they \nwere started. It is like the fire burning some 30 miles from Las Vegas, \nit was started by lightning, but they are emergencies, and they should \nbe declared emergencies, and they should be placed on the supplemental. \nIt does not count against any of the numbers we have. They are truly \nemergencies.\n  We are going to offer this again before the day is out. We want to go \nforward with that bill. The managers of that bill, the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Texas, have done a remarkably good job. \nThis is a fine bill. I think it is remarkable they have been able to do \nthe job they have done. They have both tremendous interest in the \nmilitary, and they have both been speaking about the needs they have in \ntheir respective States and the country.\n\n  The military construction bill goes beyond what we do in this \ncountry. We have military construction we pay for that is outside this \ncountry. So I hope my friend from Arizona will do what he can. He has \ntremendous sway with the White House, and that is where the bottleneck \nis, and it should stop.\n  In the meantime, let us move forward. We are only asking for a little \nover an hour on this bill to complete it.\n  The only other thing, before my friend from Florida begins, is we are \nexpecting a very important unanimous consent agreement on \nantiterrorism, and when that comes, if the Senator will allow me to \ninterrupt, we will make sure his remarks do not appear interrupted in \nthe Record.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6831-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6831-S6853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  GREATER ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE PHARMACEUTICALS ACT OF 2001--MOTION TO \n                           PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What is the parliamentary position of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering a motion to proceed \non S. 812.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am going to talk about one of the issues \nwhich will be a central part of the next several days' debate on \nAmerican health care. The specific bill before us upon which we are \nseeking permission to proceed relates to generic drugs and eliminating \nsome of the legalisms which have grown up around our generic drug law \nand have made it difficult for competitive products to come to market, \neven after the brand name drug has run the full course of its patent. \nThat will be a debate for another day, hopefully as early as today.\n  I am going to talk about an issue that will come up somewhat later in \nthis debate and that is adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare.\n  Some would say: Look, this issue has been around for a long time. Why \nshould we continue to spend time debating a matter which has thus far \nbeen unable to find enough support in the Congress to become law? Why \nis this issue important enough for us to spend time on it?\n  The answer is: Freda Moss. That is why this is an important issue.\n  In Tampa, FL, Freda Moss, an 80-year-old American, along with her 84-\nyear-old husband Coleman, is watching this, and so are thousands like \nFreda and Coleman. They are also watching us.\n  Freda is watching and waiting to see if we can improve her life and \nthe lives of 39 million Americans by adding a prescription drug benefit \nto the Medicare Program. The story of Freda and Coleman is typical of \nmany older Americans. They live on Social Security with an income of \n$1,038 a month. They are both eligible for Medicare. They have no \nprescription drug coverage.\n  While Coleman has remained healthy and has relatively low \nprescription drug costs, unfortunately, Freda suffers from diabetes, \nheart disease, and hypertension. Freda is on a list of prescription \ndrugs that include Plavix, Mavik, Amaryl, and Zocor. In 1 year alone, \nFreda's prescription drug costs were nearly $7,800--62 percent of that \ncouple's total income. It is for people like Freda that we need to add \na prescription drug benefit to Medicare.\n  As more and more Americans discover the effectiveness of prescription \ndrugs in promoting longer and healthier lives, they have become an \nindispensable part of our health care system. In 1980, prescription \ndrugs accounted for less than 5 percent of national spending on health \ncare. In 1980, less than 5 percent. Twenty years later, in 2000, \nprescription drug costs accounted for nearly 10 percent of national \nspending on health care. It is estimated in the year 2010 prescription \ndrugs will reach 14 percent of total health care costs.\n  Last year, 20 percent of the increase in the total cost of health \ncare came from increases in the cost of prescription drugs. Even though \nthey were only 10 percent of all costs, they were 20 percent of the \nincrease in cost.\n  As there has been in the last few years, there will be a lot of \ndebate over the next few days about the many measures that will be \nintroduced to conquer the problems in the prescription drug market. \nWhile many of these proposals are important and even useful to seniors, \nthe ultimate goal must be a prescription drug benefit for older \nAmericans. For many years we have come to the Senate floor to talk \nabout how important this is. Others, beyond Freda, have been used as an \nexample of the urgency of action, but every year we have gone home we \nhave spoken to our constituents about how committed we were, how hard \nwe worked to accomplish the objective of passing a prescription drug \nbenefit but that we had failed.\n  Now is the time to overcome failure with victory. We can pass this \nyear--we must pass this year--a benefit for our older citizens who are \nlooking to us for the protection of their health care.\n  I appeal to all of you who have heard stories such as that of Freda \nMoss to join me in providing a prescription drug benefit for Medicare.\n  Why doesn't Medicare, established in 1965 and which covers 39 million \npeople, provide a prescription drug benefit? Virtually every other \nhealth care plan, the kind of plan that the Presiding Officer, myself, \nand other 98 colleagues have, provides a prescription drug benefit as \npart of a total health care program. Why doesn't Medicare?\n\n  The answer is basically history and inertial. In 1965, when the \nMedicare Program was founded, prescription drugs were a very small part \nof health care. Few drugs were used by the very ill. Can you believe \nthis? In the year Medicare was established, in 1965, the average \nspending for prescription drugs by older Americans was $65. That is not \n$65 a week or $65 a month. That is $65 a year was the average amount \nexpended by older Americans on prescription drugs when Medicare was \nestablished.\n  What is the number today? According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, spending over the 37 years, from 1965 to today, has risen to an \naverage of $2,149. That is a 35-times increase in the cost, on an \nannual basis, of prescription drugs for older Americans.\n  If the Medicare Program were to be designed today, in 2002, there \nwould be no question that lawmakers would include a prescription drug \nbenefit. Why? Not only because every other health care plan, the plans \nthat most people have gotten accustomed to during their working lives, \nhave long included a prescription drug benefit, but also because \nprescription drugs today are an integral part of a modern health care \nprogram.\n  Medications are used not only to halt the effects of a disease, but \nin many cases can even reverse the negative consequences of disease. \nAfter 37 years, it is unfair to ask our Nation's older citizens, one of \nthe most vulnerable populations in our society, to continue to go \nwithout the Medicare Program offering coverage for the necessity of \nmodern health care, prescription drugs. Everyone in this Chamber \nreceives this benefit as a Federal employee. We should demand nothing \nless for our older citizens.\n  How do we solve the problem? I suggest there are a set of principles \nthat we should look to as we shape a response to this problem of the \nmissing\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\nbenefit of prescription drugs for older Americans.\n  The first principle is modernization of the Medicare Program. We will \nhear, have heard, and until this debate is concluded will continue to \nhear, about reform in the Medicare system. There are lots of things we \nought to do to reform the Medicare system. Many of those things that \nare referred to as reform are not unimportant but they tend to deal \nwith the mechanics of the Medicare Program. We should ratchet up or \ndown a deductible. We should change an amount of coinsurance that is \nrequired--alterations such as that.\n  In my judgment, the most fundamental reform that we can make to the \nMedicare Program is precisely what we are recommending today, and that \nis to add a prescription drug benefit. Why is this the most fundamental \nreform? Medicare today is, as it was in 1965, a ``sickness'' system. If \nyou get sick enough to have to go to the doctor, or even sicker and \nhave to go to the hospital, Medicare will come forward and pay a \nsignificant part of your bill. On average, about 77 percent of the cost \nof physicians' assistance or hospitalization will be paid by the \nMedicare Program. What Medicare does not pay for is very much \nprevention, those things that we know will help keep you well and avoid \nthe necessity of having to go to the doctor or the hospital.\n  It doesn't pay a dime towards the prescription drugs that you will \npurchase at your local pharmacy or by mail order, which for almost \nevery one of those prevention methodologies is an absolute fundamental \naspect.\n  For example, suppose you have developed an ulcer. The treatment for \nthat in the past was pretty straightforward. You had an operation and \nthe ulcer was dealt with surgically. Today, ulcer surgery is virtually \nlike the dinosaur, an animal of the past.\n  We have had the good fortune of having in our office for the last \nseveral months Dr. Howard Forman. He is a professor of medicine at Yale \nMedical School. He says that a simple 6-week course of drug therapy \ntoday can avoid the $20,000 cost of hospitalization for ulcer surgery. \nEven drugs such as Timolol, a generic heart drug, is estimated to save \n$4,000 to $7,500 per year per patient in select heart attack victims.\n  Drugs to lower cholesterol and to control hypertension can ward off \npossible stroke or heart attack--medical conditions that not only \nreduce the quality of life but are very costly for treatment through \nthe traditional Medicare Program.\n  Modern medicine has been significantly altered by prescription drugs, \nnotably by improving the quality of people's lives, reducing long \nrecovery periods, and sometimes even negating the need for surgeries \naltogether, as in the instance of ulcers. This is why our seniors need \na universal, affordable, accessible, and comprehensive drug benefit.\n  The second principle behind the addition of a prescription drug \nbenefit is to provide beneficiaries with a real and meaningful benefit. \nAn important part of assuring that a prescription drug program will be \naround for our children and grandchildren is to attract a broad variety \nof beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, you know as I do that a fundamental principle of any \ninsurance plan is to get a broad base of people participating, knowing \nthat some of those people will suffer whatever it is they are insuring \nagainst--like their house burning down or their car being involved in \nan accident--and other people will be fortunate enough to avoid those \ninstances. It is having enough people in the pool who can all share the \ncost that then allows us to rebuild the home that has been destroyed by \nfire.\n  Because this program is voluntary, and because it is critical that it \nattract a broad base of participation, it must have a reasonable price \nand a benefit package that will make it attractive to those older \nAmericans who are relatively well today and who do not have large \nprescription drug bills. By attracting both seniors with high needs and \nthose who simply need modest coverage and would like to be assured that \nshould they suffer a heart attack or some other disabling condition \nthey will be able to access the catastrophic coverage, that is the \ncoverage that will give them full protection for prescription drugs \nbeyond a certain point. This program will be solid. This program will \nbe actuarially sound for our and future generations.\n  Any prescription drug plan must offer seniors coverage that begins \nfrom the first prescription bill; that is, no deductible standing in \nthe way of getting benefits. Seniors should understand that if they are \nreceiving a benefit, the benefit should be consistent, and seniors \nshould actually receive it without any gaps in coverage. That is a so-\ncalled doughnut profit where you have coverage for a certain proportion \nof your drug expenditures and then all of a sudden you are 100-percent \nresponsible until you reach the catastrophic level.\n  In order to make this program easy for seniors, it should operate in \na way as similar as possible to the coverage that seniors had during \ntheir working life.\n  A third principle is that seniors should have choice. America as a \nnation thrives on choice. Choice is an important part of health \ndecisions. Choice is an important part of creating a competitive \nenvironment that will assist in controlling costs. Our seniors deserve \na choice in who delivers their prescription drugs, which is why we must \nassure that each region of the country has multiple providers of \nprescription drug benefits.\n  This will encourage competition, helping to keep costs down to \nbeneficiaries as well as to the Medicare Program and ultimately to the \nAmerican taxpayer. The choice of who you select to deliver your drugs \nshould be made by seniors beginning with the position as to which firm \nyou wish to be your representative. The phrase is a pharmacy benefit \nmanager, or a BPM, and then which specific drugstore you want to go to \nhave your prescriptions filled or should you choose to use a mail order \nform of description. Those ought to be choice decisions made by the \nindividual senior American who we will treat with respect and dignity.\n  Fourth, we need to use a delivery system on which seniors can rely. \nAmerican seniors deserve a delivery system for prescription drug \nbenefits that is based on something tried and true, consistent with \nwhat seniors feel comfortable with, and modeled on what has already \nworked. We should not convert our 39 million older Americans into some \ngiant new social health policy on how to deliver a product as critical \nand as basic as prescription drugs when there are already models on how \nto deliver prescription drugs with which seniors are familiar and which \nare working well.\n  Medical beneficiaries should not be led into being guinea pigs for \nsocial experimentation. If we are going to spend billions of taxpayer \ndollars on a prescription drug program, it should not be handled with \nuntried and untested delivery models. We are responsible to the \nAmerican taxpayers to invest in what we know will work. We should look \nat what the private sector does for guidance in developing a delivery \nsystem for a drug benefit and evaluate what is already effective for \nbeneficiaries so they can help us better understand what will work for \nseniors.\n  The fifth principle is to provide an affordable program for \nbeneficiaries. The majority of seniors in America live on fixed \nincomes. They need to know the cost of those things in order to be able \nto budget. This is why seniors need a prescription drug benefit that is \naffordable with a low premium and low copayments that are easy to \ncalculate. They need to be assured against wild variations from month \nto month, or year to year. The program must also make financial sense \nto beneficiaries. Seniors should not have to wait until an emergency \narises before the benefit is worthwhile.\n  We know that when seniors do not have coverage, they do not fill \ntheir prescriptions, a practice we hope to eliminate with this \nlegislation. The gap in coverage means no coverage for many elderly who \nmight be caught in this doughnut of noncoverage. It means that not only \nwill they be unable to buy their prescriptions during that period, but \nit might discourage them from engaging in the preventive practices of \nasking the very legitimate question: What is the good of my starting on \nan expensive drug that will help control my hypertension if 4 months \nfrom now I am going to be in a position where I will no longer have any \ncoverage and assistance to buy the drug that I can take home, so I will \nnever\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\nstart and get the benefits of that preventive treatment?\n  Cost will be a factor in order to maximize enrollment. We have been \nadvised by a number of organizations that represent the interests of \nolder Americans, such as AARP, that a premium in the range of $25 a \nmonth is a premium which will be able to attract broad participation by \nolder Americans. In order for this program to be solid, we need to have \nthat broad participation.\n  Sixth, this must be a fiscally prudent program. We have a \nresponsibility as lawmakers to pass the budget and to maintain fiscal \ndiscipline. We must exercise this judgment when we look at all \nspending. And the case of prescription drugs should be no different.\n\n  That being said, we must look at prescription drug coverage in the \ncontext of other benefit programs. As I mentioned earlier, Medicare \ncurrently covers 77 percent of the total expenses of those services \nwhich are Medicare covered. If you go to the hospital to have an \nappendectomy or if you go to your local doctor for an outpatient \nprocedure, on average, Medicare will pay 77 percent of the cost.\n  Prescription drugs are as important to seniors as the services which \nare currently covered under Medicare. If we were to cover 77 percent of \ndrug expenses, as we do for current Medicare services, we would be \nspending over $1 trillion in the next 10 years to provide this benefit.\n  If we look at the drug coverage that those of us in this Chamber \nreceive through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, if our \nseniors were to get the same level of Federal support for their \nprescription drugs as we, as Senators, get for ours through the same \nFederal Treasury, it would cost between $750 and $800 billion over 10 \nyears to provide that coverage.\n  These numbers provide a context. Clearly, we will have to find a \nbalance between giving seniors what they need and what the budget will \nallow, and what type of benefit will have the most use for Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  I would like to briefly outline some of the details of the plan that \nwill be introduced later this week on behalf of myself, Senator Miller, \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Cleland, and a number of other colleagues. \nThat plan would begin by asking the seniors, in a dignified way: Do you \nwant to participate at all? It is your choice. This is a voluntary \nprogram.\n  If seniors say, Yes, I do want to participate, here is what they will \nget. First, they will get a bill for $25 a month. That is the cost of \nthe premium to be a participant in this plan. Once they have made that \n$25 payment, then they will become eligible to participate. They will \nbe eligible from the first dollar they expend after they join the plan; \nthat is, there is no deductible.\n  Once they begin to acquire their prescription drugs, they will find a \nsystem very similar to what they used during their active years. They \nwill make a copayment for each prescription they receive. We are \nsuggesting that copayment should be $10 for each generic prescription \nand $40 for each brand name, medically necessary prescription.\n  Once you had expended $4,000 out of your pocket for prescription \ndrugs, you would reach the level of catastrophic, and beyond that \n$4,000 from your pocket there would be no further copayments required.\n  Seniors with incomes below 135 percent of poverty would pay no \npremiums. Beneficiaries with incomes between 135 and 150 percent of \npoverty would pay reduced premiums.\n  Our plan uses the exact delivery model that America's private \ninsurance companies utilize. It is also the same model the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan utilizes which covers virtually, if not \ntotally, all of our colleagues in this Chamber.\n  Every Federal employee health benefit plan uses pharmacy benefit \nmanagers, or PBMs, as the method of delivering and managing \nprescription drug benefits. PBMs are private, commercial companies that \nnegotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to achieve low prices. \nThey are held accountable. Part of their fee to provide this service \nis based on their demonstrated capacity to contain costs and to provide \nquality care and service.\n\n  We would allow all seniors a choice of which PBM they wish to use by \ngiving the seniors the opportunity to shop around for a plan that best \nmeets their needs. PBMs would be accountable to the Medicare Program \nand to the taxpayers.\n  PBMs would be required to demonstrate their ability to keep drug \ncosts down in order to be awarded a contract to seek to represent \nseniors. Further, once the PBM had the contract, they would not be paid \nfor their services if they did not carry out their commitment to \ncontain drug spending while, at the same time, providing a quality \nservice to older Americans.\n  Our plan is estimated to cost less than $500 billion through the year \n2010. We are suggesting that in that year, 2010, Congress should pause, \nCongress should review this plan that will now have been in effect for \n7 years, and the Congress should decide what we have learned during \nthis period, much as we are doing now as we reauthorize the welfare-to-\nwork law. We are looking at what we have learned since 1996. And we are \ngoing to put that learning into the welfare-to-work law for the next \nperiod.\n  In my judgment, in light of the significance of this new program, it \nwill be highly appropriate to examine how well the benefit is working \nand whether it is providing seniors with the benefits they need. Is it \nliving up to those six principles I just outlined, which should be the \ncornerstone of an effective prescription drug program? We can learn \nfrom these first 7 years and apply those lessons to the future.\n  As I indicated earlier, this is not the only plan the Congress is \nconsidering. In fact, the House of Representatives has already passed a \nprescription drug plan. That will be awaiting our action in a \nconference committee, hopefully in the next few days, to begin the \nprocess of trying to arrive at an appropriate compromise. I would like \nto make a few comments about the House Republican plan which has passed \nand awaits that conference committee.\n  Providing a legitimate drug benefit that would actually help \nAmerica's seniors is our goal on the Senate floor. In my judgment, the \nproposal passed by the House of Representatives almost 3 weeks ago \nfails to give Medicare beneficiaries what they need and deserve: an \naffordable, reliable, comprehensive, and accessible prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  Unfortunately, the proposal that apparently is going to be offered by \nthe Senate Republicans suffers from the same defects as that from the \nHouse Republicans. If a comparison is made between the House Republican \nplan, the Senate Republican plan, and the six principles I have just \noutlined, only one of the six criteria for a prescription drug benefit \nis met.\n  After many years, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nfinally come to recognize the basic need for a prescription drug \nbenefit. The problems include the lack of a defined benefit. Seniors \nwill not know, under either the House or Senate Republican plans, what \nthey will get. Another problem is control is turned over to private \ninsurance companies to determine what the senior will receive. And an \nadditional problem is the money beneficiaries are expected to spend \nbefore they actually receive benefits.\n  The House Republican proposal fails to provide Medicare recipients \nwith a stable, sustainable benefit. It would allow insurance companies \nto decide what type of coverage would be offered since the House \nlegislation only requires that there be an ``actuarial equivalent'' of \nthe basic benefits plan.\n  This means we have no idea what type of benefits would be offered to \nseniors. We do not really know what the premium is.\n  I have looked through all 426 pages of the House Republican bill, and \nI was unable to find a real hard number that guaranteed what seniors \nwould pay every month as their premium responsibility. Although I have \nnot looked through the Senate Republican bill, which was just offered \nyesterday, I suspect it is no different.\n  The House Republican bill could mean a $250 deductible or it could \nmean a deductible as high as $1,000. This means there would be a \nsubstantial delay between the time the senior signed up for the plan \nand when they would start getting any benefit. There is nothing \nreliable about this plan.\n  The bottom line is that America's seniors would be at risk for wild \nvariations in the type of benefits they\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\nwould have from place to place in America and from year to year in the \nsame place.\n  For the first time in the history of Medicare, seniors, for instance, \nin Florida would pay a different premium than seniors in Georgia or \nseniors in Massachusetts. In both Republican plans insurance companies \nmake all the decisions, have all the choices--not the Medicare \nbeneficiary. These companies would be lured with taxpayers' dollars \ninto a market in which they do not wish to participate in order to \ncreate a complex delivery system that does not currently exist.\n  There is an organization that represents a number of large \npharmaceutical companies which has been a principal advocate of the \nHouse Republican plan. I met some time ago with a number of \nrepresentatives of that association. After they had given me the \nexplanation of why they were supporting this plan that requires seniors \nto purchase private insurance with unstable and uncertain benefit \nstructures, I then asked them this question: How do your employees, the \npeople who work for your pharmaceutical company, including you as an \nexecutive, how do you get your prescription drug benefits?\n  Do you know what the answer to the question was? Exactly the way that \nwe are proposing in our legislation. They don't use this system of a \nprivate insurance policy for drug only for themselves or their own \nemployees. They want 39 million American seniors to become the first \nfarm of guinea pigs for this experimentation on how to deliver \nprescription drugs, when we know how to deliver prescription drugs, and \nin a system that seniors have already experienced during their working \nlives.\n  Money that could be used to enhance the benefit to seniors would \ninstead go to marketing and administrative costs of the insurance \ncompany.\n  The Republican proposal allows insurance companies to determine \nbeneficiaries, drugs, how many drugs they will get, what kind of drugs \nthey will get, instead of doctors making the decision on our behalf as \nto whether we need Lipitor or Zocor for our cholesterol. Those \ndecisions would increasingly be driven by the profits of the insurance \ncompanies. Seniors deserve the choices, not insurance companies.\n  The President must disagree with his party on this because just last \nweek in Minneapolis he said:\n\n       I support a prescription drug benefit for Medicare that \n     allows seniors to choose the drug coverage that is best for \n     them.\n\n  I support President Bush in my advocacy of seniors having the \nresponsibility and the right to make the decision as to what is in \ntheir individual best interest.\n  The House Republican plan would put our Nation's seniors into an \nuntried, untested delivery system that has never before been used. Is \nit fair to older Americans to be used as a social experiment for the \ninsurance industry?\n  The delivery model presented in the House is, in my judgment, a \nrecipe for potential failure, with a paltry benefit. Only those who \nneed the most prescription drugs are likely to buy into the plan.\n  There is an example of this scheme. We are not talking totally \ntheoretically about what is likely to occur under the House Republican \nplan. Several years ago, the legislature of Nevada adopted such a \nstructure to be used for their prescription drug program. Their \nproposal was used where beneficiaries soon found that they were looking \nat very high premiums, high deductibles and copayments, which only \nlured the sickest seniors into the program. As a result, beneficiary \nclaims exceeded premiums and copayments throughout the entire first \nyear of Nevada's experiment.\n  The experiment had the State paying a premium of $85 a month per \nmember for 7,500 beneficiaries. An independent actuary found that the \nState-operated program, working directly with PBMs, could have provided \nthe same benefit for $53 a month. The extra money was paid to an \ninsurance company which could have been used to serve 4,500 more \nseniors in Nevada.\n  The program has a waiting list of over 1,000 people, no doubt 1,000 \nof among the sickest people in Nevada who want to get on to this \nprogram.\n  One of the most important factors for seniors when deciding that they \nwill sign up for a prescription drug benefit is cost: How much will it \ncost monthly? How much will they have to pay before benefits begin? How \nmuch value will there be in the benefit? The Republican plan fails to \ngive seniors this value. The plan has a $250 deductible, meaning most \nseniors will have to wait for the benefit to begin, even as they are \npaying monthly premiums during this waiting period.\n  This predicament gets worse in the House plan after beneficiaries \nhave spent the first $2,000. At that point, seniors, including low-\nincome seniors, are forced into a gap in coverage. They suddenly, after \nthe first $2,000, have to pay 100 percent of the cost of their drugs.\n  For a senior like 71-year-old Jeremiah O'Conner, a Ft. Lauderdale, \nFL, resident who survived cancer and now pays $1,279 per month for \ndrugs to help with high cholesterol and a prostate problem, the \nRepublican gap would begin in March of each year. He will have to float \nwithout coverage until at least May, still paying a monthly premium.\n  For a low-income senior who is 150 percent below the poverty level, \nwhich is now $13,300 for a single person, this would be more than 25 \npercent of their annual income that would have to be used to pay for \ntheir prescription drugs while they are caught in this gap of coverage.\n  The Republican plan will not help those seniors who are choosing \nbetween food and medicine. The doughnut will provide them with no \nnutrition. All they get is the empty hole.\n  For example, Ms. Olga Butler of Avon Park, FL, receives a monthly \nSocial Security check of $672, which makes her barely over the income \nlimit for Medicaid coverage. This means that 67-year-old Olga has to \npay for her own medications, sometimes having to make that choice among \nfood, rent, and prescription drugs.\n  Olga is on Lipitor and Clonidine for her hypertension and high \ncholesterol. She pays $95 a month for Lipitor and $22 per month for her \nClonidine. These prescription drugs not only improve the quality of \nOlga's life, but they are helpful in warding off possible strokes or \nheart attacks for which she is at a high risk.\n  In order to qualify for the Republican prescription drug plan, Olga \nmust pass an assets test in order to get low-income assistance--the \nfirst time such an asset test has been included in any Medicare \nProgram. I know you know the answer to this question, but some of our \ncolleagues may not know what an assets test is. This test means that \nOlga must deplete her savings which is less than $4,000. She must sell \noff her furniture and personal property, which is worth more than \n$2,000. And she must sell her car, if it is valued at more than \n$4,500. She must place herself in poverty in order to qualify for the \nlow-income assistance under the inadequate House Republican proposal.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question on that point?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So is the Senator suggesting that, on one hand, the \nRepublican proposal is suggesting that it is addressing the needs of \nreally the lowest income seniors? I think it is always useful to review \nthe average income of our seniors, which is about $13,000 a year, and \ntwo-thirds of them have less than $25,000. So we are talking now about \nthe lowest income. I guess it is 135 percent of poverty.\n  So, on the one hand, the Senator is suggesting that those individuals \nare going to be covered and then he is pointing out that the \nRepublicans have included an assets test, which includes a burial plot \nthat is above $1,500. If they have a little cash in their bank account, \nwhich they have saved over their lifetime, evidently, this says they \nhave to spend all of that. You cannot have personal property such as a \nwedding ring. You would have to give that to the pawnbroker and spend \nthat.\n  Besides those cruel aspects of the assets test, what does the Senator \nthink this does in terms of demeaning our fellow citizens--to have them \ngo in hat in hand in this country--the greatest country in the world--\nand have them have to go through and bring out their little sheet and \nrepresent the value of their personal goods at home and demonstrate \nwhat that bank account is.\n  We have other ways of making these assessments that can be done while \ntreating people with a sense of dignity.\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\nDoes the Senator not agree with me that this is a particularly harsh \nproposal as well for our fellow citizens, particularly those who are \nextraordinarily needy and perhaps feeling a certain amount of \ndespondency for the way life has treated them, and then the Republican \nproposal adds this additional dimension? Does the Senator not agree \nwith me that it dehumanizes our fellow citizens and humiliates them in \nways that are completely unacceptable?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It is a testimony to exactly those attributes that we \nhave had Medicare for 37 years and never, never has it been proposed \nthat we add an assets test to people's ability to secure the basic \nnecessities of health care that sustain life and the quality of life.\n  The Senator mentioned a number of items that would be lost, from a \nwedding ring to a burial plot. I think of particular significance is \nthe fact that you can't own a car that has a value of more than $4,500. \nIf you want to go down to the used car lot, you can see what that means \nin terms of an available vehicle.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On this issue, may I ask the Senator a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In part of the country, winters can be extremely cold. \nThe northern tier States are colder still--up in the State of Maine, \nacross the northern tier, in Montana, across Minnesota and Wisconsin. \nAnd the last thing we want for our seniors who are going down to the \ndrugstore to get prescription drugs is to have their car break down. Or \nif they are in the southern part of the country, on those superhighways \nwhere traffic is moving with such rapidity and there is such a degree \nof intensity in terms of the conduct of traffic, you can imagine what \nhappens to a senior whose car breaks down on those roads as well.\n\n  We are really flyspecking our fellow citizens. We are trying to set \nup a system that addresses the needy people in our society. Does the \nSenator not agree with me that we can do that with a sense of respect \nand dignity? When we are talking about this point of $4,500 for a car--\nwhich is to try to say that maybe if it is $2,000, we will be more \nunderstanding.\n  I must say that this is a humiliating aspect for our fellow senior \ncitizens. I find it so difficult and so unwilling to accept.\n  I particularly appreciate the Senator's long explanation and detailed \nelaboration of the Senator's own bill. I pay great tribute to Senator \nGraham and Senator Miller in terms of the fashioning of this proposal. \nI am grateful to be able to join them. I think his careful review of \nthe other proposal should make our colleagues think of whether that \nkind of a proposal is worth any degree of support.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have just one last comment about the automobile. As it \nis for most of us, an automobile is more than just a means of \ntransportation; it is a statement of our independence, our ability to \nbe able to do those things that make life meaningful. This is a \nparticularly important thing for older Americans, many of whom live in \nrural areas. If you say you have a choice, can you imagine the pain \nthat a 75-year-old American living in a rural area in your State, or \nmine, or Senator Cleland's, or Senator Stabenow's, would feel if they \nsay: Here are your choices: We can give you access to some payment for \na drug which, if you are unable to secure will almost assuredly decline \nthe quality of our life, and maybe cause death, but in order to get \nthat assistance, you have to give up your independence by giving up the \nvehicle that allows you to have some degree of mobility. What kind of \ncountry is America? We are saying this to the generation that we have \ndefined as our greatest generation. These are, in many cases, the \npeople who have not only lived through the Depression of the 1930s, \nwhen our country was in tremendous jeopardy, they fought to defend our \ncountry, or they worked in the defense industries, as did that \nwonderful generation of young American women who did hard manufacturing \nwork in order to be sure that those ships, planes, and tanks were \nbuilt; and now we are going to tell these people when they are 75 years \nold: give up your mobility and your independence or give up life \nbecause you cannot afford to buy the prescription drugs. What kind of \nan America is that? That is not the kind of America by which I want my \nchildren and grandchildren and great-grandchildren to judge my \ngeneration.\n  Beyond those points, the insult even gets worse because, to use my \nexample of Olga, she is not going to be immune from this gap, either. \nSo under the Republican plan, once she hit the wall, the beginning of \nthat big nonnutritious hole in the middle of this coverage, she would \nhave to pay between $3,450 and $5,300 of drug costs, without getting \nany assistance.\n  So we have added insult to the tearing away of dignity and \nindependence. The Republican plan would make this gap harder to fill by \nonly including payments directly made to beneficiaries on their behalf. \nThis is a technical issue, but it is an extremely important issue for \nmany of our elderly.\n  The typical person, when they were 45 years old, their union \nnegotiated a contract with their employer and the employer said: All \nright, I am going to put on the table an additional 25 cents an hour of \nimmediate income; or I will write into this contract a provision that \nsays when you get old and retire, I will pay a portion of your \nprescription drug costs.\n  I happen to be a retiree of the Florida State retirement system, and \nI am eligible, when I go on Medicare, to get a certain amount every \nmonth toward my prescription drug costs. We are going to say that in \ncalculating how much you have to have spent out of your pocket to \nbecome eligible for the catastrophic coverage, you can't include the \nmoney that your employer is contributing. You have paid for it back 25 \nyears ago when you gave up that quarter an hour of additional \ncompensation to get that benefit, but now it suddenly evaporates in \nterms of counting toward meeting your catastrophic number that will \nallow you to avoid future copayments for your drugs.\n  It is just blatantly unfair, and it has been one of the hidden \nissues. If I thought of this idea, I would want to hide it, too. It has \nbeen effectively hidden.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can I ask the Senator, and I am so glad the Senator is \ntaking the time to explain this issue, and I hope our colleagues are \ngoing to pay some attention to it because it is very easy to say: A \nprescription drug bill here, a prescription drug bill there, is there \nreally any difference? The Senator is pointing out in great detail some \nof the very powerful differences.\n  One that is enormously important is how the Graham bill treats \nemployers. Those good employers who are trying to provide a \nprescription drug benefit for their employees are hard pressed, \nparticularly smaller businesses that pay a disproportionately high \npercentage in premiums. Nonetheless, they are prepared to do it.\n  Under the Graham proposal, there are provisions which help those \nemployers maintain at least the coverage for the employees. It seems to \nme that everyone wins: The employee wins; the employer wins. The \nobjective of the Graham bill is to make sure they have the coverage, as \ncompared to the Republican plan which has disincentives, as I \nunderstand, in terms of the employers.\n  There are clear disincentives for employers to maintain the coverage, \nwhich means there is going to be additional costs and a higher risk of \ncoverage. It is a very important part of the Graham proposal. I wonder \nif the Senator will spell that out because that is so important when we \nare looking at what is going to happen to companies that are providing \nprescription drugs and which program is best suited to make sure we \nhave a continuity of coverage.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator is absolutely right. Under the current \nsystem, about 30 percent of our 39 million Medicare beneficiaries \nreceive some assistance with their prescription drugs through their \nprevious employer. Frankly, that number has been declining as in more \nrecent years employers have been less willing to add to their benefit \npackage a prescription drug payment in retirement. But 30 percent of \ncurrent seniors do have that, and there is concern that under the House \nplan, which has no incentive for those employers to continue to provide \nthe service, they are going to say: Look, we do not need to continue to \nwrite\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\nthese checks to our retirees. There is now a Federal program. So we are \ngoing to cancel out and turn all these people over to the Federal \nGovernment to pay.\n  What we are proposing is that the Federal Government should \nessentially enter into a partnership with those employers. We would \npick up two-thirds of the cost of what we would otherwise pay for a \nbeneficiary. The employer would pick up the rest. It saves the \nemployers two-thirds of what they are paying now, but it gives them \nenough incentive that they will continue to participate rather than \nhave a new way of cost shift to the Federal Government and to the \nbeneficiaries themselves since under the Republican plan it is less \ngenerous than most of these current employee plans, and so they will \nhave to pick up--they, the beneficiaries--additional expenses.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, as I understand, the CBO has \nestimated there would be 3.5 million people who are covered now with a \ngood program who would lose that good program and be in the substandard \nRepublican plan.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Absolutely.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is CBO. There are the assets provisions the Senator \njust described. There is a provision which is a disincentive for the \nemployers. And there is the doughnut or the wall which the Senator has \ndescribed. This is enormously important because their bill fails the \ntruth in advertising test.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's thoughtful, \nincisive questions which underscore some of the differences--I think \nclear deficiencies--in the legislation the House has already passed.\n  According to the Corporate Health Care Coalition, the benefit of \nemployer-sponsored coverage is minimized under the Republican proposal \nand, as the Senator from Massachusetts said, threatens to force \nemployers to choose between private plans or the Medicare plan, and the \nestimate is that a substantial number of employers would elect to dump \ntheir current coverage for retirees and let this become a full Federal \nplan responsibility.\n  This would be a threat to over 3 million seniors who today are able \nto rely on a reduced prescription drug benefit and which under our \nprogram would be able to, should they elect to do so, have the benefits \nof both their employer plan and the new Medicare plan as, in insurance \nindustry terms, a wraparound policy.\n  Everyone in this Chamber understands the need for fiscal discipline, \nbut this should not come at the cost of providing a meaningful drug \nbenefit for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The budget passed by the Senate Budget Committee provides up to $500 \nbillion for a prescription drug benefit. Mr. President, our plan is \nwithin that range.\n  We do not have to provide beneficiaries a Cadillac. Rather, we would \nbe more prudent to provide them with a Chevrolet or a Ford a reliable, \nuseful automobile. But we also do not need to provide a benefit that is \nmore like a moped--unreliable and cannot be driven on regular roads.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues in the Chamber, now is the \ntime. We have come to the Senate floor year after year promising \nAmerica's seniors a prescription drug benefit, and every year the \nseniors have come to the beginning of the new fiscal year thinking this \nwill be the year in which we will see the promised land, this will be \nthe year in which these promises are delivered. Sadly, to recount, \nevery year the seniors have found not an open door but a closed and \npadlocked door.\n  Today we can take the giant leap that Medicare beneficiaries have \nbeen waiting over the years for us to take. Just last week in \nMinneapolis, President George Bush said:\n\n       We must make sure that whatever system evolves does not \n     undermine the great innovations that take place in America.\n\n  Surely an untried, untested system such as the House Republican \nproposal which has already passed will have exactly that uncertain \nimpact on medical advances. By using a system that is based on what we \nalready know works, we do not threaten that innovation. We can, in \nfact, contribute and advance innovation.\n  That is what our proposal does. By passing the exact system that \nevery Member of the Senate and most Americans use to get their \nprescription drugs, it is within our power to give America's elderly \nthe parity, the security, they deserve in their lives and in their \nhealth care.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the underlying bill and \non the background for Medicare, Medicare modernization, and \nstrengthening Medicare.\n  First, I am delighted the discussion of health care security for our \nseniors has reached this stage of debate, active discussion, and active \ndeliberation in this body. The House of Representatives admirably took \nthis issue head on, worked very diligently through a committee process, \nand produced a bill, after debate, after discussion, and it passed. The \nHouse bill received a majority of votes and represents a very \ndeliberate and very solid effort to address the cost of prescription \ndrugs. More importantly, it addresses the issue of health care \nsecurity--including prescription drugs as a part of the armamentarium \nphysicians or nurses can use in looking seniors in the eyes and saying \ntheir health care security can be complete by passage of this bill. I \nthink this is the crux of the issue.\n  Now is the time for us to act to include prescription drugs--that \npowerful tool, that powerful element of health care as we know it \ntoday--as part of the overall health care security package for our \nseniors. Including a prescription drug benefit within Medicare is long \noverdue. Prior to coming to the Senate, I was blessed to spend 20 years \nproviding care to thousands of Medicare patients in the field of chest, \nheart, lungs, pulmonary status, emphysema, lung cancer, heart disease, \nand stroke. Thirty years ago, medicines, including prescription drugs, \nwere used in these fields. However, 20 years ago prescription \ndrugs were used a lot more, 10 years ago even more, and today they are \nan absolutely essential part of health care delivery.\n\n  As a surgeon, I do not want to say prescription drugs are more \nimportant than surgery, but it is getting to the point that medicines \npeople take every day are equally important in acute and chronic care \nand in disease management. Now is the time for us to address the \nfinancing of health care delivery in this country, both in terms of the \norganization of health care delivery and insurance coverage.\n  Everybody knows the Medicare Program is absolutely critical to health \ncare security. I think my colleagues in the Senate will agree that \nMedicare, health care security for our seniors and for our individuals \nwith disabilities, is critically important and vital. It is imperative \nthat we do not forget that the Medicare debate applies to both seniors \nand those with disabilities. I believe now is the time to strengthen \nit. Others might say to modernize it. Yet even others will say to \nreform it. Whatever word is used, now is the time to take a 1965 \nprogram which has been modified over the years in the way that we \nincrementally do things--and strengthen the program. We need to \nmodernize the program to truly deliver what our seniors and disabled \nindividuals expect us to do--to give them health care security.\n  So whether one uses the word ``save,'' ``strengthen,'' ``modernize,'' \nor ``reform,'' now is the time to have a discussion on the floor about \nthe process itself.\n  As some people listen to the debate about Medicare and prescription \ndrugs, many will question why we need to address the process. The \nprocess is important to help move such complex bills along in order to \nproduce a good bill that can be married with the House bill. We can \naccomplish what most people want to achieve affordable access to \nprescription drugs for our seniors. This is a complicated issue because \nthe overall cost of prescription drugs will continue to escalate unless \nwe fix it.\n  Furthermore, health care delivery will continue to change in terms of \nthe overall relative importance of inpatient hospital care, outpatient \ncare, acute care, chronic management, and\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\ndisease management. The process is designed to take this complex bill \nwhich could potentially be the single largest expansion of an \nentitlement program and modernize it, including the coverage of \nprescription drugs.\n  It is important to enact a bill in a responsible way. The demand for \nprescription drugs is going to be high because people will be counting \non drugs for cures and to improve quality of life. With that sort of \npotential growth superimposed on a Medicare Program which is not \ndesigned for such growth, the impact will literally bring the overall \nprogram down.\n  For some time, the President and I have argued that as we look for \nprescription drug coverage inclusion, we need to do it in a way that is \nresponsible to the American people--to seniors, to individuals with \ndisabilities, to the taxpayer, to the current generation. This is also \nimportant to the next generation coming through the system who, if we \ndo not appropriately fix Medicare, simply will not have the Medicare \nProgram that they expect and deserve for their parents or for them a \ngeneration from now. Therefore, Medicare must be strengthened. Medicare \nmust be improved.\n  I argue we should address prescription drugs through a process that \nincludes the committee structure, where appropriate debate can be \ncarried out. It is not clear if people have followed the debate over \nthe course of today, including which bills are going to be considered, \nif there are going to be large bills to modernize all of Medicare, if \nthere are going to be very specific bills that look at the prescription \ndrug package to be placed in Medicare, or whether there are going to be \ncatastrophic plans. I am hopeful, if we are going to bypass the \ncommittee process and come directly to the floor, that we debate all of \nthose bills so the American people and our colleagues will have the \nopportunity to see the range of alternatives. If we consider just one \nbill, especially if it is a very partisan bill and has not been taken \nthrough a committee process, the long-term risk to the American people \nis huge. This will not just affect Medicare beneficiaries but will \nimpact generations who will be Medicare beneficiaries in the future and \nthe people who are paying for Medicare today.\n\n  Pharmaceuticals are a critical component of health care delivery. Now \nis the time to act, so let's do it. Let's not talk about a plan that \nwill take effect 3 years, 4 years, 5 years from now. Let's go ahead and \nstart today and let's do it in a responsible way.\n  Other Medicare issues my be addressed if health security is our goal. \nThese issues include preventive services and other benefits that are \ncovered by private health care plans today that are not covered in \nMedicare. When we strengthen, reform and modernize Medicare, we need to \ndo so in a more comprehensive fashion.\n  We need to look at the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, the \nFEHBP--the health insurance coverage my colleagues and I have. You do \nnot hear us complaining very much about our health care insurance. It \nis the same plan through which about 10 or 11 million Federal employees \nget their health care today. We ought to look at that model as we look \nto include prescription drugs.\n  There are a number of principles that do need to be stressed as we \nlook forward because we do not know exactly what amendments are going \nto be coming to the floor today or over the next several days as we \nconsider prescription drug coverage. I would like to stress four \nprinciples as we consider prescription drug benefit plans.\n  First, a prescription drug benefit should be permanent, affordable, \nand immediate.\n  By ``permanent,'' I mean that we should not look at bills that will \nfix the program in another 4 to 5 years, rather, we need a bill to fix \nthe program sooner. We need to act now. We need to have a bill that \nwill help seniors and individuals with disabilities as soon as \npossible. So, I argue we should not start a bill or legislation and \nhave its effect, say, 3 years from now.\n  When I say a prescription drug benefit should be permanent, I think \nit is dishonest for us to tell seniors that this is the fix when it \nonly applies for 4 years to 6 years. It should be incumbent upon us to \ndevelop a plan, a proposal. We need to be smart enough to do it in a \nbipartisan fashion and include time for adequate discussion, so that we \npass a bill that can be sustained over time--whether in times of \ndeficit, or surplus. Additionally, a prescription drug benefit needs to \ntake into consideration breakthroughs in medicine that find cures, \ntreat or prevent such diseases as heart disease, Parkinson's disease, \nemphysema, and other lung diseases. Therefore, such a benefit must be \nsustainable to the best of our ability over time.\n  That means when we look at a plan, we don't say it starts at 2005 or \n2006 or 2 years from now, and then sunsets 5 years later. I think we \nneed to be honest with seniors and the current generation who is paying \nfor Medicare today by ensuring that this plan is something that can be \nsustained to the best of our ability, and that it can be sustained over \ntime. So, principle number 1 provides for a permanent, affordable, and \nimmediate prescription drug benefit.\n  A second principle is that a prescription drug benefit should, in \nsome way restrain what cannot be sustained long-term--the skyrocketing \ncost of prescription drugs that we see today. Seniors and individuals \nwith disabilities cannot afford the high costs of drugs. Likewise, \npeople in the private sector cannot afford it. Thus, a prescription \ndrug benefit must lower the cost of prescription drugs. I would argue \nthe only known way of doing that long term is through an element of \ncompetition, an element where you have informed consumers. It is an \nobligation of us in government to inform consumers. Consumers are those \non the front line--seniors listening, to patients, to doctors, to \nnurses. Really, it boils down to what is happening at the doctor/\npatient relationship, to involve an element of educated consumers \nmaking smart, and commonsense decisions, long term.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office has found that bills similar to \nSenator Daschle's bill, which will likely be coming to the floor later \nthis week, would not decrease overall drug costs, but would increase \ndrug costs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, bills that \nrely on public/private sector partnerships and an element of \ncompetition will help maintain the costs of drugs. For example, the \nHouse of Representatives bill that passed by a majority vote \nillustrates this point. Additionally, the Breaux-Frist bill, introduced \nin the 106th and 107th Congress, is based on the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan model which relies on the private/public \npartnership. Overall, these bills include an element of competition, \ncapturing the very best of the public and the private sector working \ntogether and reducing drug costs for seniors.\n  The third principle--following the first principle of permanent, \naffordable, and immediate prescription drug benefit and the second \nprinciple of competition to lower the cost of prescription drugs--is \nthat a prescription drug benefit should be fiscally responsible. We \nneed to do it. We need to act in this Congress. We need to act now so \nit will take effect now, and we need to do it responsibly. This is \nwhere dollar figures are important, so we know what these relative \nalternatives are all about.\n  Experts estimate proposals offered by Senator Daschle and some Senate \nDemocrats would cost at least $600 billion over the next 8 to 10 years. \nIn a time of deficit spending and in a time where the economy is tough, \nthis would ultimately require cuts in other fields like education, \nnational defense and Social Security. Furthermore, it would place a \nheavy financial burden on the current generation receiving benefits, \nthe generation that is paying for those benefits, and the following \ngenerations.\n  The fourth principle I would like to stress is that a prescription \ndrug benefit should be bipartisan. That means we need to come together. \nThis is a big challenge. This is a big, new entitlement that at the end \nof the day is likely to be adopted--and I would argue should be \nadopted--if it is done in a responsible way. I would argue in this \nclimate, especially in this climate where the Senate is about 50-50, \nwhere the American people are about 50-50 in terms of partisanship, \nthat the only way for us to succeed is through a bipartisan bill. We \nneed to have people from both sides of the aisle working together in a \ncommonsense, rational\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\nway. Yes, we will concede to tradeoffs on either side to come to common \nground. But we need to do it in a bipartisan manner.\n  The good news is that if we can pull it off with the right \nleadership, if we can pull it off with people who recognize the \nimportance of pulling people together, we can do it and it can be done \nnow. This will result in seniors benefitting very soon. It can be done \nin a way that is sustainable. I am absolutely convinced there are \nenough people who will work together in a bipartisan way on both sides \nof the aisle--majority of Republicans and majority of Democrats--so we \ncan pass such a bill.\n  That is a challenge. It is a challenge because we have about 112 days \nleft until the elections commence. The real risk is in trying to pass \nsuch a major piece of legislation in a partisan way--partisan could \nbring it down to where we do not pass a bill. Amidst all the talk at \nthe end of the day, there are not going to be sufficient votes because \nthe bills are not bipartisan.\n  A lot of the discussion today has been basically the other side of \nthe aisle reaching out and saying we are ready to move forward, we want \nto take action. But much of the backdrop, is that the Senate Democrats \ntoday actually canceled or postponed a markup because of a fear that \nthe tri-partisan bill that normally--normally the bill would come \nthrough the Finance Committee to be debated and amendments could be \ndebated and passed or failed. There could be good debate among 20 \npeople in that Finance Committee. The committee of jurisdiction was \nbypassed today with these bills being brought directly to the floor.\n\n  If you agree and if the American people agree that a prescription \ndrug benefit is big, now is the time to act.\n  The only way in an environment today that tends to be partisan \nbecause of these elections is to demand bipartisanship. The only way to \npass a prescription drug benefit is to openly consider the bipartisan \nand the tripartisan bills. And we do that, I again argue, first in the \nFinance Committee; however that does not look like that is going to \nhappen.\n  I want to make absolutely sure that the Republicans are not \noverstating the importance of taking a bill this big through the \nFinance Committee before coming to the floor of the Senate. The \ntripartisan bill--the bill that has the majority of votes in the \nFinance Committee--has not been debated and has not been voted on or \nmarked up in the Finance Committee. Additionally, the bill that Senator \nDaschle likely will bring to the floor sometime in the next several \ndays is a strictly partisan bill which has not been considered in the \nFinance Committee either. The American people need to understand that \nSenator Daschle is playing straight up politics. I asked the \nCongressional Research Service to look up the top 10 or so major \nMedicare bills which passed the Congress over the past two decades and \nto find out: (1) Where were they first considered? (2) Did they bypass \ncommittee and brought directly to the floor of the Senate? They \nresponded. It is very interesting. It looks as if there are about 12 to \n15 major bills that have been considered over the past two decades. \nWith the exception of one, all of these bills were considered and \nreported by the Senate Finance Committee before they were enacted into \nlaw. Those bills, again for reference--were TEFRA in 1982, DEFRA in \n1984, COBRA in 1986, OBRA in 1978, the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage \nAct of 1998, the repeal of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act in \n1989, OFRA in 1989, OFRA in 1993, BBA in 1995, BBA in 1996, BBRA in \n1999 were considered through the Finance Committee. The only \nlegislation out of the 13 which bypassed committee was BIPA in 2000. \nBIPA is the only piece of legislation out of the 13 bills that did not \nhave Finance Committee consideration before congressional passage.\n  However, I should note that even that particular bill--BIPA--was \noverwhelmingly bipartisan and passed overwhelmingly as part of the HHS \nappropriations in the year 2000. I mention this because it is important \nfor the American people to understand the importance of the process \nwhich is now being bypassed in order to consider bills, which if they \nremain partisan will simply not pass this body.\n  Let me comment briefly on what I think and what I expect will happen \nover the next several days. I expect tomorrow we will continue to \ndebate the underlying reforms in Hatch-Waxman. I look forward to \nhearing from Senator Hatch and others about that particular bill.\n  There will be several existing bipartisan proposals that are \ncurrently being filed and currently being submitted that will be \nintroduced. I think we will have a good debate on a range of issues. It \nwill be an educational process as we go through each of the amendments \nin the bills that come forward.\n  I hope as we consider these bills that we have as a goal to make them \nnot political issues but to make sure that they are substantive policy \nissues that come forward. It is simply too important to be playing \npolitics with our seniors' health care security. I think there will be \na lot of opportunity over the next few days to talk about these \nspecific Medicare proposals.\n\n  Let me close and simply comment on the patent reform bill and the \nmodifications in Hatch-Waxman that we will in a more systematic way \nbegin to address tomorrow. I think access to prescription drugs clearly \nneeds to be the focus as we go forward, but the overall cost is \nimportant too because if you have prescription drugs and other drugs \nescalating with skyrocketing costs, there is, I think, no system that \nwe can contain that long term over time.\n  The Hatch-Waxman law, which was passed in 1984, has been tremendous, \nbut it has an impact on cost. The cost issues that we see in the \nprivate sector today are increasing 11, 12, and 13 percent. I don't \nthink health insurance can simply be sustained in the long term. One \nmajor component of the increase in coverage is prescription drug costs \nwhich continue to skyrocket.\n  But I need to caution my colleagues who did not have the opportunity \nto sit through the Hatch-Waxman hearings in the Health Committee, it is \npretty technical. It is important that we go back and do it right, that \nwe fix Hatch-Waxman, or that we update it and modernize it because it \nreally hasn't had a major look since 1984. But we must do it in a way \nthat maintains the very careful balance that legislators very smartly \nput together in 1984.\n  The balance boils down to the fact that you have prescription drugs \nin the pharmaceutical industry that values patents and certain \nprotections. Because they have those protections for a period of time, \nthey are willing to invest, they are willing to innovate, they are \nwilling to discover, and they are willing to put capital at risk. It is \nimperative that we all know how important that is. The only answer to \nfinding a cure for coronary sclerosis, for pulmonary emphysema, for \nacute types of leukemia, or for something as big as HIV/AIDS is going \nto be research. Furthermore, I would argue that most of the world's \nresearch is being conducted in the United States of America.\n  Nevertheless, the protection and the incentives that we give to make \nthese great discoveries must be balanced. This is the balance that was \nachieved by Hatch-Waxman with access to drugs. That, in large part, is \ndetermined by a strong, a productive, a broad, a growing generic drug \nindustry where we know that important drugs are available at a \nreasonable cost. When Hatch-Waxman started, generics were only about 20 \npercent of all drugs. Now it is much greater--greater than 50 percent. \nBut it is time to focus on some of those deficiencies in Hatch-Waxman. \nIt is that balance that needs to be reviewed because both generic \nprescription drug companies and brand name companies have abused or \nfound loopholes in Hatch-Waxman. Now is the time to fix the loopholes. \nWe need to do that in a correct manner. That is what much of the debate \nwill be about as we go forward.\n  Another topic, we had the opportunity last week on a couple of days \nto talk about is bioequivalence. It too is a little bit technical. But \nit is very important because, if we get it wrong, it is not just a cost \nissue. If we get it wrong, it can affect safety issues in terms of \ndrugs and generic drugs.\n  The Hatch-Waxman law allows generic companies to market off-patent \ndrugs if they are demonstrated to be bioequivalent.\n  There are definitions of bioequivalence that are applied today. If \nyou\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\nhave drug A, and you have another drug, and you are saying, well, this \ndrug is the same as drug A, you want to make sure when you actually \ntake that drug that it has the equivalent impact in fighting disease, \nthe impact that it is billed to have, that the active ingredient is \nabsorbed at the same rate, and that the side effects are the same.\n  The bill, which is the underlying bill on the floor today, could \nsignificantly weaken this important patient protection by giving the \nFood and Drug Administration, the FDA, broad authority to relax the \nstatutory Hatch-Waxman bioequivalency standard.\n  Senator Hatch will be on the floor in the next several days, I am \nsure. I look forward to joining him in talking about a range of issues \nthat are of concern to him--and he has been around a long time in terms \nof watching this bill and watching the effectiveness of this bill--and \nmyself and many others.\n  Again, there are many other Members on the floor who wish to talk, so \nI will bring things to a close. But I wanted to bring forward the \nprinciples that I think should underline the debate as we move forward.\n  I wanted to point out, in the bill that is currently actively on the \nfloor, this modification of Hatch-Waxman. There are a range of issues, \nsuch as bioequivalence, that I look forward to debating and talking \nwith others about.\n  At the end of the day, in order for us to really be able to look \nseniors in the eyes and say, health care security is what this bill is \nall about, it means we are going to have to work together, we are going \nto have to do it in a way that is bipartisan, that clearly does not \nhave strict partisanship. We cannot play politics with an issue that is \nthis important.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as these bills more \nformally come to the floor.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from New \nYork.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am glad to take the floor today because \nwe are beginning a historic and very important debate on the issue of \nthe accessibility and the cost of prescription drugs. It is going to be \na very important 2 weeks.\n  I, first, thank the majority leader for giving us that kind of time. \nThis is not an issue that should be dealt with quickly. It is an \nimportant issue. It affects all of our constituencies. And there are \nmany different sides to it. Anyone who thinks the issue is totally cut \nand dry is mistaken.\n  We have had great advances in our health care system. Many of them \nare due to these prescription drugs. We knock our health care system. \nIt is easy to do. But we often forget about its successes.\n  I point to my childhood where, in my neighborhood, Brooklyn, my \nfriends would get on their bicycles and come to my house on Wednesday \nafternoons, and they would park their bicycles in the front and walk to \nthe backyard and push their heads up against the window of our kitchen \nbecause sitting in our kitchen every Wednesday afternoon was something \nof a curiosity. It was my great-grandmother, and she was 81.\n  Most children in the neighborhood had never seen someone over 80. And \nshe was billed as: ``Come see the oldest lady in the world.'' The kids \nfrom the neighborhood would come around and look at her. And God bless \nher, she lived a long, tough life.\n  But now, only 50 years later, we have Willard Scott on TV reading--he \nhas given up reading about 80-year-olds and 90-year-olds and 100-year-\nolds--about people who are 105 and 106.\n  Being 80 is young. My parents, thank God--my dad is going to be 80 \nnext year. He is healthy. He has had a few little bouts, but he is \nhealthy.\n  That is the other point I make. We not only live longer, we live \nbetter. When I think of my dad, who is 79, and played golf Sunday--my \nfamily and I went over and had dinner with him and my mom. And I \ncompared them to--I mentioned this to them just that night--how my \ngreat-grandmother was so very old and could hardly walk at 81, and here \nis my dad, just about 80, filled and vibrant.\n  That did not happen all by accident within 50 years. We have had \nenormous advances in health care. And let's give credit where credit is \ndue.\n  A good number of those advances are because of the prescription drugs \nwe have. They are wonder drugs. I did not experience any of them until \na year ago when our House physician--our Capitol physician; I am still \nused to calling him the House physician--prescribed Lipitor because my \ncholesterol was high and, boom, down it went, almost like a miracle. He \nexplained to me that increases my chances of living longer and \nhealthier. So these drugs are very good things. We do not knock them; \nwe like them. We are glad they exist.\n  I think every one of us in this body realizes that it takes a lot of \nwork to create some of these drugs; that it takes time; it takes \nmistakes.\n  I took organic chemistry when I was in college, in the days when my \nparents had dreams that I would be a doctor--dreams that went by the \nwayside, I regret to tell my colleagues.\n  To do one of those organic chemistry experiments, it is 50 steps. \nThose are little ones, the rudimentary ones. If you mess up step 46, \nyou do not go back to step 45, you go to the first step because you \ncontaminated the sample. Well, multiply that a million times, and that \nis how difficult it is to conceive and make these new drugs.\n\n  So the companies that make these drugs deserve a lot of credit. These \ndrugs are wonder drugs; they are terrific.\n  When my friend from Tennessee, Dr. Frist, comes on the floor, with \nall his erudition, and says we have to make sure there is a balance, I \ncould not agree more. There has to be a balance. If we were, tomorrow, \nto do something that would mean the next generation of wonder drugs \nwould not come on the market, we would be disserving everybody: \nourselves, our children, our grandchildren. So that is important.\n  That is why the legislation that is before us today, introduced by \nSenator McCain and myself, was honed with such care.\n  Dr. Frist is right. I am not going to talk in great detail about \nthis. We will have another day to debate the issues. I guess the \nminority is going to bring some amendments. We will get into the \nspecifics of our bill later. But I do want to say we have taken a great \ndeal of care in how we crafted this bill, mindful of the balance.\n  Our goal has been to keep that balance. It is our view, Senator \nMcCain's and myself, almost by definition--the 16 bipartisan members \nwho voted for our bill; in even Dr. Frist's view, who voted against the \nbill--that that balance had fallen out of whack. Here is what I think \nhappened.\n  I think for the first 10 years or so, the Hatch-Waxman Act, the \nGeneric Drug Act, worked quite well. New companies that tried to \ninnovate, produced a whole lot of very fine innovations, got a great \nrate of return. If you look at Wall Street numbers, the drug companies \ndid just about better than any other industry in terms of their \nprofitability. So they were not hurt.\n  But, at the same time, it was a pretty certain thing that after that \ndrug had its run, and the company not only recouped its costs, and \nrecouped the costs of the mistakes that were made--natural and \nreasonable--and made a very fine profit, we would let other companies \ncome and put these drugs out on the market.\n  It worked. When the generic drug comes on the market--we will have a \nlot more to say about this tomorrow--the cost plummets from 25 to 50 \npercent of what it otherwise was. A prescription that might cost $100 \nyou can get for $25. Success is shown by the fact that now 47 percent \nof all the drugs prescribed are generic drugs, creating the same \nmedical benefit but costing people a whole lot less and, incidentally, \ncosting our State governments less when they pay for Medicaid, costing \nour big companies less when they pay for their health care plans, \ncosting our HMOs less, as well as costing the average person less when \nhe or she goes to the drugstore counter.\n  What happened in the last 5 years, in my judgment, was that Hatch-\nWaxman was thrown out of whack. It was thrown out of whack because too \nmany--not all, by the way; a company such as Merck does not engage in \nthis practice; a few other companies are very reticent and reluctant \nand mild in the way they engage in this practice--in general, a whole \nlot of drug companies saw that they had these huge\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\nblockbuster drugs on the market and the patents were expiring. They \nsaid: My goodness, now the generics will come along, and what are we \ngoing to do? We will make a lot less money.\n  What they started to do was to work with their lawyers and their \nadvertisers and everybody else to figure out ways to basically extend \nthe life of the drug. They have done it a whole lot of ways. In fact, I \nthink I will submit for the Record five or six articles in the Wall \nStreet Journal--hardly a publication that is anticapitalist--that \nshowed various ways drug companies tried to get around the laws, tried \nto stretch the laws. Many of them involved the use of generics. But \nsuffice it to say, they tried to figure out ways of going beyond the \noriginal Hatch-Waxman intent.\n  One of the key ways they did it was to, what I call, innovate, not \nnew drugs but new patents--same old drug, new patent. And because the \nlaw had never been updated, as Dr. Frist said, they found a lot of \nclever ways to do it.\n  It began to get out of hand. They would say: Give me a new patent \nbecause I am changing the type of pill. Give me a new patent because \nthere is a different color bottle in which I will put the drug. No one \nwho voted for Hatch-Waxman thought these were reasons to extend \npatents.\n  Then they began to do other things. Some people came over to me and \nasked: What about the situation where there is a vaccine for HIV and \nthey come up with an oral drug; why shouldn't you allow that to have a \nnew patent? We want to. We don't want to allow the oral patent to then \nextend the vaccine patent. In other words, if they come up with an oral \none, let them apply from scratch, get the whole 20-year patent from the \nday the patent is filed. But if the vaccine patent is about to expire \nin a year, don't use the oral patent to extend the vaccine patent. That \nis a little less virulent form of this kind of game.\n  So what Senator McCain and I did a couple years ago, actually, was \nsit down and examine the most egregious abuses. We said: How are we \ngoing to curb these abuses? How are we going to restore the original \nbalance of Hatch-Waxman?\n  The proposal we came up with did that. By the way, it made some of \nthe generic companies not happy either. This is not a bill that is just \nsupposed to side with the generic companies; it is a bill that sides \nwith the consumer. When the pharmaceutical company is abusive, we go \nafter them. But when the generic is abusive, we go after them, too.\n  In one part of our bill, we wanted to get at the fact that certain \ngeneric companies that were given 180-day exclusivity so they might get \na leg up and give them incentive to go out on the market, they were \nsort of selling that right to the pharmaceutical, the brand name \ncompany, and then there would be no generic. We stopped that. It was \nmodified by the amendment of Senator Edwards and Senator Collins. But \nwe looked at the abuses on each side and said: Let's stop it. Let's \nrestore the balance.\n  This started out as a very modest bill. In fact, I think the \npharmaceutical industry didn't pay much attention. They said: Who is \ngoing to pay attention to something that is admittedly technical? But \nwhat we found was that when you looked at this bill, it was one of the \nmost important ways to reduce cost--reduce cost not just for seniors \nbut for everyone, reduce cost for government and get those generics \nout.\n  Over the next couple of weeks we will have a debate on this, and \nthere will be amendments to change what we are doing--probably in the \nnext day or two--and we will debate it.\n  I want to say two things, though, in addition to talking about this \nspecific proposal. The first is the view of my good friend from New \nHampshire that somehow we didn't try to include him, that he is \ndelaying the bill because, well, we could have worked out this \nlanguage. First, this bill is not brand new. It wasn't written on the \nback of an envelope last week; it has been around for a long time. On \nmany occasions I would go to Senator Gregg and say: Let's sit down and \nwork something out, and he would be amenable, but nothing much would \ncome of it.\n  The only point I am making is, he knew about the bill long before. \nAnd then at the end, when in an effort to try to get this bill to be \nbipartisan--it is always better--Senator Edwards and Senator Collins \nstarted to work together on some changes and didn't do a terrible \ninjustice to our bill, Senator Gregg began to get involved. And we \nstarted talking to him. Senator Kennedy and his staff were talking to \nhim. And basically when Senator Gregg had a few objections, we were \nwilling to go along with them.\n  First, he raised earlier the clarification of the language on this \n45-day provision in the bill, the idea that you would have 45 days to \nsue. Senator Gregg had reminded us that there was an agreement during \nthe markup to clarify the language, to make very specific that if a \npatent owner chose not to sue one generic applicant, it wouldn't be \nprecluded from suing another. He is right. We honored that agreement. \nIt is in the proposal. Following the markup, the staff changed the \nlanguage to make the clarification so there would be no confusion.\n  It is my understanding that those technical changes were then \nforwarded directly to Senator Gregg's staff. Then the first time we \nheard about it was long afterwards. I guess it was this morning that we \nheard this was a problem.\n  That doesn't sound to me as though you are concerned with policy. \nThat is saying to me, wait a minute, let's delay this thing. And I \ndon't think that is what we should do, no matter what our view is here.\n  We all agree on the policy. Let me clarify it. The intent of the \nprovision and the effect, because it is now clearly written--it may \nhave not been clearly written before--was not to cut off all the rights \nof a patent owner if it refrains from suing a particular generic \napplicant within 45 days. Rather, it just cuts their rights off to sue \nthat company.\n  It says that if a brand company chooses not to sue a particular \ngeneric applicant on a particular patent, the brand company only loses \nits right to sue that generic applicant or anyone else who sells or \ndistributes that applicant's version of the drug.\n  So if Schering-Plough chooses not to sue Mylan for a patent \ninfringement within 45 days, if they choose not to sue Mylan, they lose \ntheir right to sue Mylan or anyone else who distributes Mylan's version \nof the drug, but they will have every right to sue Barr or Teva or IVAX \nor any of the others, in complete accord with what we said that day at \nthe markup.\n  This is no reason to hold up a bill. It says exactly what my friend \nfrom New Hampshire wanted. Now, if there is some staff talk that the \nlanguage doesn't say that, let's sit down and take a look, but let's do \nit immediately. Let's not spend 30 hours sitting on the floor, each of \nus fulminating and not moving the bill forward and doing the people's \nbusiness.\n  We have a lot of issues to discuss--not just generic drugs. We will \ndiscuss the Canadian importation and the ability of States to form \nconsortia--all to lower costs. Then there is the big debate, of course, \nwhich is accessibility, allowing more people to get the drugs.\n  There is a one-two punch here: Lower the cost and extend the number \nof people who have the ability to get the drugs. But it is just almost \nto the point of, at best, counting the angels on a pin and, at worst, a \ndesire to delay, to say that we don't have an agreement.\n  I wanted to discuss another issue Senator Frist brought up--the \nbioequivalence issue. There is a lot of debate about bioequivalence and \na lot of discussion about bioequivalence. The enemies of generic drugs, \nearly on, had tried to say that the generic is not the same as the \nnongeneric in terms of its active ingredient. That reminds me of the \nargument I had with my mother. I take a vitamin C pill. She would say: \nSon, drink the regular orange juice. I would say: Mom, the vitamin C in \nthe pill is exactly the same as the vitamin C in the orange juice. She \nsaid: No, no, no. I said: Well, it has nice little orange flecks in \nthere, and it tastes different, but if you looked at the oxygen, \nhydrogen, and carbon atoms lined up in the vitamin C molecule, you \ncould not tell the difference. She said: No, no, have the orange juice.\n  It is the same thing my friend, the good doctor from Tennessee, is \ntalking about. The FDA knows what bioequivalence is. While some in the \nbrand name debate have tried to imply in the past\n\n[[Page S6841]]\n\nthat the generic drug isn't as pure, or its inert ingredients may be \ndifferent from nonactive ingredients, we all know it is bunk. The FDA \nhas had rules on bioequivalence that have met every test for years and \nyears, and no one has contested them. In all of the fighting between \nthe brands and generic name court cases, there hasn't been an issue. \nAll of a sudden, we are hearing that bioequivalence is an issue.\n  So what did we do? Senator Kennedy, in the bill--it may have been \nSenator Edwards. Well, an amendment was added in the committee that \ntook exactly what the FDA has done, without any dispute for the last 10 \nyears, and codified it. Now, all of a sudden, we are hearing that \nbioequivalence is an issue. It is not an issue. It is a smokescreen for \npeople who want to delay.\n  So my view is a simple one. Let's get on with the debate. We have two \nmajor issues before us--the issue of cost and the issue of access. The \nMcCain-Schumer bill, the Dorgan proposal, and the Stabenow proposal on \nthe States, all reduce the cost of the drug--here is my good colleague \nfrom Michigan now whom I just mentioned--to everybody, including senior \ncitizens, parents who have a child who needs a serious drug, to State \ngovernments.\n  Then let's go on to what will probably be the main show, which is \naccess, because so many people need access to these drugs. The one is \nnot exclusive of the other. People ask me, Will you be happy if just \nthe McCain-Schumer bill passes? No. I hope it will pass, but we have to \ngo beyond that and we have to increase access. We have to have a good \nprescription drug plan to undo the mistake of those who wrote Medicare \nin 1965--except they didn't know there were so many of these drugs.\n\n  My plea to colleagues is this: Enough. We are debating about the \nnumber of angels on the head of a pin. We are debating about things \nthat have long been settled. Let's move the bill forward. Let's lower \nour costs. Let's increase access. Let's disagree in a civil and fair \nway, and then let's vote and let the chips fall where they may.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be good enough to yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield to our leader from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am struck by the point the Senator \nmakes again on the floor of the Senate, which I have heard him make \nmany times but which I think is important to understand, and that is \nthat this is actually a very conservative piece of legislation. \nEffectively, if we accept the underlying legislation, which is just a \nversion of the legislation the Senator introduced with Senator McCain, \nreally we are going back to what the original intention of the Hatch-\nWaxman proposal was all about.\n  I appreciate the Senator giving the historic perspective because at \nthe time we passed the Hatch-Waxman, we anticipated the breakthroughs \nin many different areas of new pharmaceuticals to try to deal with the \nchallenges of our time. It has never been more likely than it is now. \nWe are in the life science century. Even since the passage of Hatch-\nWaxman, we have seen the sequencing of the human genome. We have this \nextraordinary DNA revolution. We have gone through these extraordinary \nkinds of basic new research. We have seen this explosion using new \nkinds of technology matched together with research, which is opening up \nextraordinary possibilities. We have heard about this in our HELP \nCommittee.\n  So the opportunities are out there in terms of trying to see the day \nwhen Alzheimer's is no longer the scourge of so many families in this \ncountry. That would empty two-thirds of the nursing home beds in my \nState of Massachusetts. That is probably true also in the State of New \nYork. We believe the Hatch-Waxman proposal was to try to make sure for \nthe drug companies, the brand companies, that were prepared to go ahead \nand take advantage of these extraordinary opportunities, building on \nthe incredible investment the American taxpayer has made in the NIH, \nwhich has been doubled in recent years. It is an additional reason the \nSchumer amendment ought to go in.\n  We ought to have the energy of those companies in these breakthrough \nnew opportunities rather than in the ``me too'' drugs. This, I believe, \nis not only dealing with the abuses that exist, but also, if we let \nthis continue along, it seems to me there will be a continued kind of \nfinancial incentive not to take chances for these breakthrough drugs \nthat are out there, in terms of making such a difference in dealing \nwith the health challenges we face, and there will be these financial \nincentives to game the system in order to deny people the lower cost of \ndrugs by the generics.\n  So I commend the Senator. We will have a lot of debate and discussion \nabout patent and patent laws and timing--30 months, and 180 days, and \n45-day windows, and bioequivalency, and the rest. But we are talking \nabout, as the Senator eloquently stated, a major downpayment--the first \none that I know in any recent time that will bring pressure to lower \nthe cost of drugs.\n  This is a major achievement and accomplishment if we do it. It is not \ngoing to solve the problem, but for the many families who are going \nhome tonight and buying their drugs and finding out that the costs have \nincreasingly gone up so far beyond the cost of living, it will make a \nbig difference, will it not?\n  Secondly, I don't know what the argument is--I have not heard it--for \nthe second provision of the Senator's amendment that deals with \ncollusion between the brand names and the generics, which is taking \nplace out there.\n  That is as bad as the gimmickry we have seen from these corporate \nscoundrels who have made out like bandits, such as at Enron, getting \nbillions of dollars and then giving short shrift to the workers. What \nis the difference if those corporations make out like bandits, and in \nthis case, instead of the workers, it is the seniors and sick people \nwho will suffer? I do not see a great deal of difference.\n  The Senator has made such a strong statement. I am as perplexed as he \nis that we have not had a chance to get to the bill this afternoon and \ndebate it. The Senator has correctly given the interpretation we had of \nthe clarification of language that was raised.\n  I point out to the Senator and ask if he will agree with me, if they \ndo not agree with language, we will be willing to accept the language \nto clarify those provisions. It is very clear what the intention was in \nthe hearing record. We are not trying to change our position. We are \nstill at that position. If they have language to do that, we will take \nit now and get on with the bill.\n  We should be under no illusions. That is not it. They want to change \nother provisions, substantive provisions. All the Senator from New York \nis saying is, if that is the case, why are we not out here debating \nthose issues and taking votes on them and moving this legislation \nforward?\n  Does the Senator find any reason this can justify why we are having \nthis delay on this important legislation that can make such a \ndifference to many people? Why is it that on a Tuesday afternoon in \nJuly we are not doing the people's business and voting on these \nmatters, debating these matters but instead are caught in tactical \nmaneuvers by those who are opposed to the legislation?\n  I say to the Senator, it is being perpetrated by those who do not \nwant any bill at all. If we do not have any bill at all, there will be \nbrand companies that will make billions of dollars out of the pockets \nand pocketbooks of the consumers, which is in complete violation of the \nHatch-Waxman bill. They are the ones who are behind this delay, and \nthat is unconscionable.\n  I would appreciate any comment the Senator wishes to make on that \nissue.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague. No one puts it better than he \ndoes, and he is exactly right. Let's vote; let's debate. Our \ndifferences are not very large. That is what makes us scratch our heads \nand think that really they do not want a bill; they hope we will give \nup. They hope people will lose interest. They hope something else will \ncome along, maybe another corporate scandal. But I think I can speak \nfor our leader, the Senator from Massachusetts, as well as the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, as well as the Senator from Michigan, that we are not \nletting this issue go away. They can delay us for a week or a month, \nand we will be back, it is so important.\n  I will make one other comment. My colleague from Massachusetts is \njust so good at this. After I am here half as\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\nmany years as he, if I can be a quarter as good as him, I will be very \nhappy. Here is what he said and I think it is worth repeating.\n  We are doing not only the public but the drug companies a favor. With \nthis amendment, we are putting them back on track. They have lost their \nway. They are degenerating into something that is hated. For people who \ncreate such wonderful drugs, why should they be so despised? I saw a \nsurvey just recently that the drug industry was more disliked than the \noil and gas industry. The reason is they all are losing their way. It \nshould not be for the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from New \nYork, the Senator from Michigan, and the Senator from Minnesota to help \nthem find their way; they should find it themselves. But they have lost \ntheir way, and the Senator from Massachusetts has stated it \nexquisitely, which is we are going to send them back on the path of \ninnovating, of creating new wonderful drugs, of doing good for society, \nand making money as they do it. We want them to do that. But we want \nthem to add value, we want them to cure new diseases, not simply find a \nnew color of a pill that already cures a disease. We want them to find \nnew techniques.\n\n  We are sending them in the direction they started, but they have lost \ntheir way, and the smart ones in the industry know. I hear it \nwhispered. They are letting the worst ones, the bad apples who will do \nanything, extend their profitability even if they do not have a new \ndrug in their closet. They are letting those people lead and, in a \nsense, what we are saying is: Go back to your sacred mission. Go back \nto the mission of finding new cures and finding new drugs, and not only \nwill you make money, but you will be proud of what you do.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will be happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On this point the Senator makes--and I hope our \ncolleagues will listen--we will put in the Record the exact figures, \nbut if one were to look at a chart for new drugs and innovation, one \nwould see that chart rising and rising, going up and up until almost \nthe passage of the Hatch-Waxman bill. From that time, the innovations \nhave gone down. It is the darndest thing we have ever seen.\n  I was absolutely startled by this. This might have been maybe one or \ntwo circumstances, the evergreening process which the Senator has \noutlined.\n  On the Senator's point about getting these drug companies back to \ndoing what we had all hoped they would do and we know they can do and \nhopefully will do, every one of us have family members who benefit from \nthese innovations, but we find that is not where they are going.\n  We have doubled the NIH budget, $33 billion, $34 billion a year. We \ndoubled that over a period of time. Why did we double that at a time of \nscarce resources? The reason we doubled it is because Democrats and \nRepublicans understood this is a life science century, and it is \nunlimited in its ability. It seems everybody knows this except the drug \ncompanies. That is what has been disappointing.\n  I thank the Senator again for outlining the basic provisions which, \nas he has mentioned, bring us back to ground zero. They bring us back \nto what was achieved with the Hatch-Waxman period, and does that to \neliminate the collusion which is taking place and the gimmicking of the \nsystem which basically means higher prices for consumers. That is the \nchallenge.\n  If others have better ways of doing it, I am sure the Senator will \nagree, let's do it, but we did not see that. My friend from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone, was in that markup. We did not hear other ways of \ndoing it. All we heard was more delays, more delays, objections, \nobjections, objections. That is because clearly there are billions of \ndollars at stake. We are talking about billions of dollars of profits \nfor certain of these companies. No wonder they are out here in force \ntrying to resist the Schumer proposal.\n  I thank the Senator for his excellent presentation.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Maine, and I \nknow the Senator from Michigan is here, I will actually be very brief. \nThis will not be a typical Wellstone speech. I only have about 10 \nminutes. I say to the Senators from New York and Massachusetts, I very \nmuch enjoyed their discussion. I thank the Senator from New York for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  I remember, I say to Senator Schumer, during my years here two very \nhumorous situations; one especially where somebody tried to extend the \npatent for Lodine. I actually found out about this, and I think Senator \nKennedy was also involved in trying to get to the bottom of it. It was \nin the language of the bill, but nobody would take credit for it. \nNobody would take credit for having done this, although obviously \nsomebody put in the language. It was you laugh or you cry--the whole \nnotion that we can extend the patent and it does not go generic and \nthey make a lot of money. But who gets hurt as a result?\n  The same thing has come up with Claritin as well. This is a no-\nbrainer of where 99 percent of the people of the country are, that is \nfor sure.\n  The only issue on which I disagree with my colleague from New York--\nand I am sorry to be the one more hard hitting on this, and I do \napologize--I do not know that the pharmaceutical companies have lost \ntheir way--as in recently. As I go back--Senator Kennedy probably knows \nthe history better than I do--I have done a lot of reading about Estes \nKefauver in the early fifties. He took on the pharmaceutical industry, \nand they took him on.\n  David Pryor, am I not correct, really did this? We have been battling \nit out with him for a long time. This is an industry that has been \nmaking Viagra-like profits, if I can say that on the floor of the \nSenate. It would be funny and a little cute to say it, except that what \nthis really means is people cannot afford the prescription drugs, at \nleast the people I represent.\n  This legislation is very important. I know Senator Collins has worked \nvery hard on it. There is quite a bit of bipartisan support. I had a \nchance to speak earlier this morning about other provisions. I heard \nSenator Graham speak earlier. Senator Kennedy has spoken about it.\n  I want to say one thing about two other pieces of this in about 4 \nminutes. One is on this whole question of, how are we going to make \nsure there are affordable prescription drugs? I think delivery is \ncritically important. There is a world of difference between adding \nthis on to Medicare and making it a defined benefit.\n  We are learning all about defined benefits versus defined \ncontributions as people see what is happening to 401(k)s versus the \nlanguage in the House bill that suggests this will be the deductible \nand suggests this will be the premium but, frankly, there is no \nguarantee of it. This needs to be a defined benefit, and it does need \nto be a part of Medicare. We ought to at least agree on that.\n  Then I think there are going to be these trade-offs as to how much \nmoney versus how good is catastrophic coverage. I am sorry to go sort \nof populist on everyone, but I think I heard the Senator from Florida \nsay earlier that for those of us in the Senate and the House--and we \nmake pretty darn good salaries compared to the vast majority of the \npeople we represent--something like 80 percent of our prescription \ndrugs are covered. We might pay 20 percent, and that is it. It seems to \nme we ought to do as well for the people we represent.\n  My dream is to someday be in the Senate when we are debating Medicare \nfor all. That is what I want to get back to. I almost think the people \nwe represent should have as good a plan as we have through the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan. But that is another debate for another \ntime.\n  I cannot imagine how any of us could support any legislation that \nsays when it comes to catastrophic expenses, after someone is over \n$2,000 a year--the very point where people are hurting--then we say we \nare not going to give any coverage, not until they get up to $3,700. \nThat is nonsense. People say: What do you mean? One of the things we \nwant you to do is help us deal with what happens when our expenses go \nup year to year. That is the second point.\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\n  The third thing I want to mention is I am going to be doing a bill on \nthe whole question of drug reimportation for the year, which Senator \nDorgan has addressed. It could be Senator Snowe and Senator Collins \nwill be a part of this. I know Senator Stabenow is. We are going to \nhave legislation or an amendment that deals with cost containment, and \nI want to say one more time it is a simple and straightforward \nproposition. We are coming out together, and I assume there will be \nsome strong bipartisan support. I know I am going to do it with Senator \nDorgan and Senator Stabenow, and I think there will be Republicans as \nwell. Basically, what we are going to say is you use the same FDA \nstrict safety guidelines, and our citizens ought to be able to reimport \nthese drugs.\n  I want to give some examples, and then I will be finished, I say to \nmy colleague from Maine.\n\n  Celebrex, which is used for arthritis: A bottle costs $84.95 in the \nUnited States and $30.99 in Canada.\n  Glucophage, a medicine for diabetes, costs $63.12 in the United \nStates and $16.68 in Canada. Think about that. I will not do the \narithmetic because people can figure it out.\n  Methotrexate, a drug for cancer: $51.03 in the United States, $17.30 \nin Canada;\n  Tamoxifen, a breast cancer drug: $287.16 in the United States, $24.78 \nin Canada--same bottle, same dosage.\n  Imagine that. There is nothing that infuriates people more in \nMinnesota, makes them believe they are more exploited and ripped off by \nthis industry, than this sharp contrast in prices.\n  There is legislation that Senator Dorgan, Senator Stabenow, and I are \ngoing to introduce, as well as others--I do not want to speak for \nSenator Collins, but Senator Collins and Senator Snowe have been real \nleaders on this issue. This does not ask the Federal Government to \nspend any more money. We do not have to run into that issue. We do not \nhave to talk about how much it is going to cost. This will dramatically \nreduce the cost of prescription drugs for our citizens.\n  The only question is this, and then I will sit down: I can promise, \nonce people know it is the same strict FDA guidelines, once we make it \nclear if anything ever happens, if this goes wrong, then emergency \naction can be taken--I will say to the Chair this will happen in \nNebraska--90 percent of the people are going to say: Absolutely, this \nis the best kind of free trade, and we ought to be able to do this. We \nought to be able to reimport, or our pharmacists should be able to do \nit. There is one interest that is going to be opposed--pharmaceutical \ncompanies. They are not going to like it. But at a certain point in \ntime do we not say: Tough luck. This is going to be a test case of a \nvote of whether we are going to represent the people in our States, \ndemocracy for the many, or whether we are going to let the \npharmaceutical companies stop it. It is that simple.\n  We had a 97-to-0 vote last night on legislation on which Senator \nSarbanes and others worked so hard. That was stuck in committee \nforever, and people finally said: We have had enough. Do you know what. \nPeople in the country said it. People in the country are beginning to \nsay: We have had enough. We do not want the pharmaceutical industry to \nrun the show. We want you, Senator, to be accountable to us.\n  That is what these votes are going to be about. This is going to be a \ntest case of whether we have a real system of representative democracy \nworking.\n  I have taken some positions where I know the majority of people do \nnot agree with me, but not in this debate, not in terms of where the \nvast majority of people in all of our States are. Let us not \ndisappointment them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. This week we have a tremendous opportunity to make \nprogress on an issue that affects Americans of all ages, but \nparticularly our elderly, and that is the high cost of prescription \ndrugs. I hope by the time the end of next week comes along, we will \nhave passed the tripartisan legislation to provide a prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare that is long overdue. I also hope we will pass \nthe legislation to which we are about to proceed, and that is the \nGreater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act.\n  I commend my colleagues from New York and Arizona, Senator Schumer \nand Senator McCain, for their leadership and hard work in bringing this \nissue to the forefront. I was pleased to have had the opportunity to \njoin with my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Edwards, in \noffering a compromise in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee last week where it was approved by a strong bipartisan vote.\n  I also acknowledge the hard work of our chairman, Senator Kennedy, \nand our ranking minority member, Senator Gregg, on this issue.\n  During the last 20 years, we have witnessed dramatic pharmaceutical \nbreakthroughs that have helped to reduce deaths and disability from \nheart disease, cancer, diabetes, and many other diseases. As a \nconsequence, people are living longer, healthier, and more productive \nlives. These medical miracles, however, often come with hefty \npricetags, raising vexing questions about how patients, employers, and \npublic and private health plans can continue to pay for them.\n  Prescription drug spending in the United States has soared by 92 \npercent during the past 5 years to almost $120 billion. These rising \ncosts are particularly a burden for the millions of uninsured Americans \nas well as for those seniors on Medicare who lack prescription drug \ncoverage. Many of these individuals are simply priced out of the market \nor forced to make decisions--that no one should have to make--between \npaying the bills or buying the pills that keep them healthy.\n\n  Skyrocketing prescription drug costs are also putting a squeeze on \nour Nation's employers. We are struggling in the face of double-digit \nannual premium increases to continue to provide health care coverage \nfor their employees. I know from talking to the small businesses in my \nState, these escalating costs are a real problem for our smaller \nemployers. They want to continue to provide health insurance coverage \nfor their employees but they simply are finding it increasingly \ndifficult to do so. If they pass on the higher health insurance costs \nto their employees, more and more of the workers deny coverage. They \ndecline coverage because they cannot afford their share of the premium.\n  One of the key factors behind the escalating costs of health \ninsurance is the high cost of prescription drugs. These high costs are \nalso exacerbating the Medicaid funding crisis that we hear about from \nour Governors back home as they struggle to bridge the growing \nshortfalls in their State budgets.\n  The Presiding Officer and I have been working very hard on a proposal \nto increase the Federal match for Medicaid funding to help our \nGovernors and our families, who are so dependent on these services, \ncope through this difficult time when States are struggling with budget \nshortfalls.\n  In 1984, the Hatch-Waxman Act made significant changes in our patent \nlaws that were intended to encourage pharmaceutical companies to make \nthe investments necessary to develop these miracle drugs. At the same \ntime, the legislation was intended to enable their competitors to bring \nlower cost generic alternatives to the market. In large measure, the \nHatch-Waxman Act succeeded.\n  Prior to Hatch-Waxman, it took 3 to 5 years for generics to enter the \nmarket after the brand name patent had expired. Today, lower cost \ngenerics often enter the market immediately upon the expiration of the \npatent. As a consequence, consumers are saving anywhere from $8 billion \nto $10 billion a year by purchasing generic alternatives.\n  Moreover, there are even greater potential savings on the horizon. \nWithin the next 4 years, the patents on brand name drugs, with combined \nsales of $20 billion, are set to expire. If the Hatch-Waxman Act were \nto work as it was intended, consumers should expect to save between 30 \nto 60 percent on these drugs as the lower cost generics become \navailable after the patents expire.\n  However, despite its past successes, it is becoming increasingly \napparent that the Hatch-Waxman Act has been subject to serious abuse. \nWhile many pharmaceutical companies have acted\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\nin good faith, there is mounting evidence that some brand name and \ngeneric drug manufacturers have attempted to game the system in order \nto maximize their profits at the expense of consumers. News reports, \nfor example, have detailed how the manufacturer of the lucrative drug \nPrilosec, the patent on which was set to expire last fall, has used the \nautomatic 30-month stay under the Hatch-Waxman Act to tie up generic \nmanufacturers in court, in litigation, over secondary patents in order \nto keep the generic version of the drug off the market.\n\n  In the year 2000, Prilosec was the best selling drug in the world and \ngenerated an estimated $4.7 billion in U.S. sales. The Medicaid Program \nin Maine spent over $8 million on Prilosec in the year 2000. This bill \ncould be cut in half if the generic alternative were available. So \ninstead of the State of Maine spending $8 million on Prilosec if the \ngeneric were available, as it should have been last fall, the State of \nMaine would save about $4 million. That is much needed money that could \nbe put into other health care services.\n  I mention that because that is just one drug. But that illustrates \nwhat happens when a brand name manufacturer exploits the loopholes in \nthe current law to delay consumers access to the generic equivalent. \nThat is just wrong.\n  It is no wonder that this legislation is supported by a broad \ncoalition representing Governors, insurers, businesses, organized \nlabor, and individual consumers who are footing the bill for these \nexpensive drugs and whose costs for popular drugs such as Prilosec \nwould be cut in half if the generic alternative was available when it \nwas supposed to have been. We are not talking about infringing on the \nlegitimate patents that protect the innovative drugs developed by \npharmaceutical companies. We are talking about eliminating abuses that \nwe are finding increasingly prevalent where the brand name manufacturer \nexploits the loopholes in the current law by engaging in excessive \nlitigation for the sole purpose of keeping the generic off the market.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the Business for Affordable \nMedicine and the Coalition for a Competitive Pharmaceutical Market \nexpressing support for the Edward-Collins compromise approved by the \ncommittee be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I was also disturbed by the testimony of \nthe chairman of the Federal Trade Commission before the Senate Commerce \nCommittee. He testified there were a number of examples where the \nbranded and generic drug manufacturer actually conspired to game the \nsystem and attempted to restrict competition beyond what the Hatch-\nWaxman Act intended. One case cited in the chairman's testimony \ninvolved the producer of a heart medication which in early 1996 brought \na lawsuit for patent and trademark infringement against the generic \nmanufacturer.\n  This is what happened. Instead of asking the generic company to pay \ndamages, the brand name manufacturer offered a settlement to pay the \ngeneric company more than $880 million in return for keeping the \ngeneric drug off the market. So the brand name manufacturer essentially \nconspired with the generic manufacturer and paid off the generic \nmanufacturer to keep the cheaper generic alternative from coming to the \nmarket.\n  The consequences for consumers were considerable. This heart \nmedication, which treats high blood pressure, chest pains, and heart \ndisease, costs about $73 a month but the generic alternative would have \ncost only $32 a month. The compromise legislation that we will soon \nconsider will make cost-effective generic drugs more available by \nrestoring the original intent of the Hatch-Waxman Act and by closing \nthe loopholes that are delaying competition and slowing the entry of \ngenerics into the marketplace.\n  First, as amended by the Edwards-Collins compromise, the legislation \nwould limit brand name manufacturers to a single 30-month stay for \npatents listed at the time of the brand product approval. Now, this \nwill eliminate the brand manufacturer's ability to stack multiple and \nsequential automatic 30-month stays during patent litigation in order \nto keep generics off the market and extend their market exclusivity \nindefinitely. That is one of the primary abuses that our proposal would \nend.\n  It will help ensure that key patent issues are adjudicated before the \ngeneric goes to market, while at the same time ensuring that improper \nlate listed patents are not able to obstruct market competition.\n  We heard in committee examples of the brand name manufacturer making \nextremely minor changes, such as in the color or the design of the \npackaging or the scoring of the pill that really did not indicate a \ndifferent or improved use for the product but, rather, were devices \nintended to keep the generic off the market for a while longer.\n  For subsequent patents for which no automatic 30-month stay is \navailable, a brand name company can still obtain a preliminary \ninjunction based on merit to protect their patent rights and keep the \ngeneric product off the market if it is justified, if there truly is a \nlegitimate patent issue. However, in too many cases we found there is \nnot a legitimate patent issue. This is just an abuse and an \nexploitation of the loopholes in the current patent law.\n  Moreover, our legislation stipulates that the court is not to \nconsider the possible availability of monetary damages when it is \ndeciding whether or not to grant injunctive relief. This provision is \nintended to address the concern expressed by the brand name \npharmaceutical companies that it is difficult to obtain injunctive \nrelief in patent litigation because it is the court's view the treble \nmonetary damages involved in these suits as an adequate remedy.\n  Second, the legislation will prevent the current 108-day exclusivity \nprovision of the Hatch-Waxman Act from becoming a bottleneck for \nsubsequent generic competitors. Under Hatch-Waxman, the first generic \ndrug company to file an application with the FDA certifying that the \npatents on the brand name product are either invalid or will not be \ninfringed is now granted 180 days of market exclusivity, once its \napplication is approved. Entry to the market for other generics is \ntherefore frozen until the 180-day period runs out on the first-to-\nfile.\n\n  This provision has made it attractive for the kind of abuse that I \nmentioned earlier, and that is where a brand name manufacturer pays the \nfirst-to-file generic company to stay off the market.\n  What that results in is nobody else can come to market, under the \ncurrent law, during that 180-day period. So you can see how that is \nabused, when the brand name firm pays the generic manufacturer to \nessentially forfeit that 180 days of exclusive market rights.\n  Under our legislation, the first generic applicant would forfeit that \n180 days of exclusive market rights if it failed to go to market during \nthat time, or entered into an agreement with a brand name company that \nthe FTC determines to be anti-competitive. I think that would help end \nor eliminate altogether the kinds of deals between the brand name \nmanufacturer and the generic manufacturer that are such a disservice to \nconsumers.\n  The original Hatch-Waxman act was a carefully constructed compromise \nthat balanced an expedited FDA approval process to speed the entry of \nlower cost generic drugs into the market with additional patent \nprotections to ensure continuing innovation.\n  Regrettably, however, the law now needs to be strengthened and \nreformed so we can eliminate the abuses that we are seeing. This \nbipartisan compromise bill restores that balance by closing the \nloopholes that have reduced the original law's effectiveness in \nbringing lower cost generic drugs to market more quickly. Increasing \naccess to these lower cost alternatives is all the more important as we \nbegin work to provide an affordable and sustainable Medicare \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Mr. President, I urge all our colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis legislation. It will do a great deal to make prescription drugs \nmore affordable by promoting competition in the marketplace and \nincreasing access to lower price generic drugs.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6845]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                       Coalition for a Competitive\n\n\n                                        Pharmaceutical Market,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As a broad-based coalition of large \n     employers, consumer groups, generic drug manufacturers, \n     insurers, labor unions, and others, we are writing to advise \n     you of our strong support for the Edwards/Collins amendment \n     to S. 812, the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals \n     Act. We believe it is critical that Congress act this year to \n     pass legislation that would eliminate barriers to generic \n     drug entry into the marketplace. The legislation you will be \n     marking up today clearly would accomplish this long-overdue \n     need.\n       Prescription drug costs are increasing at double-digit \n     rates, and clearly are unsustainable. Current pharmaceutical \n     cost trends are increasing premiums, raising copayments, \n     pressuring reductions in benefits, and undermining the \n     ability of businesses to compete in the world marketplace. We \n     believe that a major contributor to the pharmaceutical cost \n     crisis is the use of the Drug Price Competition and Patent \n     Term Restoration Act of 1984 clearly in ways unanticipated by \n     Congress, which effectively block generic entry into the \n     marketplace. The repeated use of the 30-month generic drug \n     marketing prohibition provision and other legal barriers have \n     resulted in increasingly unpredictable and unaffordable \n     pharmaceutical cost increases.\n       Although the compromise amendment being offered today does \n     not totally eliminate the 30-month marketing prohibition \n     provisions, as would be our preference, it does make \n     important process changes that will lead to a more \n     predictable, rational pharmaceutical marketplace. We \n     recognize that compromises have been necessary to garner the \n     support of a majority of the Members of the Committee and \n     appreciate your leadership and the hard work of your staff. \n     However, we would strongly oppose any additional amendments \n     that would undermine the intent of this legislation by \n     further delaying generic access or reducing competition and \n     increasing costs to purchasers. We also remain opposed to \n     legislation that would increase costs to purchasers either \n     through extended monopolies or unnecessary and costly \n     litigation.\n       We are convinced that the legislation you are advocating \n     will make a major difference in increasing competition in the \n     marketplace and enhancing access to more affordable, high \n     quality prescription drugs. We look forward to working with \n     you and other Members of the HELP Committee to ensure that \n     this important legislation is enacted this year.\n       The Coalition for a Competitive Pharmaceutical Market is an \n     organization of large national employers, consumer groups, \n     generic drug manufacturers, insurers, labor unions, and \n     others. CCPM is committed to improving consumer access to \n     high quality generic drugs and restoring a vigorous, \n     competitive prescription drug market.

Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The Business for Affordable Medicine \n     coalition encourages you to support the Edwards-Collins \n     amendment to the 1984 Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \n     Restoration Act (Hatch-Waxman Act).\n       The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \n     is scheduled to vote today on legislation to close loopholes \n     in the Hatch-Waxman Act that delay competition and prevent \n     timely access to lower-priced generic pharmaceuticals. Your \n     vote for the Edwards-Collins amendment will ensure genuine \n     reform for all Americans who face barriers to affordable \n     medicine.\n       BAM members hope to continue working with the Committee and \n     the Administration on appropriate enforcement mechanisms that \n     avoid unnecessary and costly litigation.\n       Consumers and institutional purchasers (including \n     employers, and federal and state governments) can no longer \n     afford the anti-competitive practices that are made possible \n     by loopholes in the Act. Now is the time for Congress to \n     restore the original intent of the Hatch-Waxman Act--no more \n     gaming of the system at the expense of purchasers across \n     America.\n       Please take a moment to review the attached information, \n     including a letter from BAM member governors outlining their \n     concerns about this costly issue and the need for real \n     reform.

The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak \nonce again on this very important topic of lower prices of prescription \ndrugs and providing real Medicare prescription drug benefit. I join my \ncolleague in speaking to the fact that we need to pass the bill that \ncame out of the committee to close generic loopholes and stop the drug \ncompanies from gaming the system. I think everyone should be commended \nfor bringing this to the floor. I appreciate the fact that they have \ndone that.\n  The frustrating thing at this point is, despite the fact that there \nwas an overwhelming bipartisan vote to bring this legislation to the \nfloor so we could begin to add to it--add medicare prescription drug \ncoverage, add other ways to increase competition and lower prices--we \ncome this week with great anticipation of this debate to work together \nand work out all the details after a vote of 16 people saying yes in \ncommittee to only 5 saying no, a bipartisan vote--we come to the floor \nlast night, and a colleague on the other side of the aisle objects to \nus proceeding even to the bill.\n  Colleagues come and talk about concerns about working out details, \nwhich we want to do, we know we have to do, and we will do. But we are \nbeing stopped. In fact, the clock has been ticking since last night and \nwe are not even able to bring this issue before the Senate. It is \namazing to me that, with the importance of this issue and all the words \nthat have been spoken on this floor and the House, during Presidential \ncampaigns and all the campaigns that we have been involved with--we \ncome to the moment of truth of being able to bring this to the floor \nfor debate and, instead, we are seeing an attempt to stall. We are \nseeing an attempt to hold us up from proceeding. That is of great \nconcern.\n  I have great respect for my colleague from New Hampshire, but I \ndisagree with this approach, and I urge him to reconsider and give us \nthe opportunity to bring this to the full Senate.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to \nthe bill; we vitiate the vote on cloture and proceed to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator cannot make such a request until \nhe has the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for me to make that request? The \nSenator suggested I make the request. I am willing to make it.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent we vitiate the cloture vote and \nproceed to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is an interesting proposal. It is 5 \no'clock in the afternoon now on Tuesday. We had the opportunity last \nevening to lay down the bill. We could have considered the amendments \nduring the course of the day and made some real progress on it. But it \nwas the determination of the other side not to permit us to do that.\n  Mr. GREGG. Regular order. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The regular order is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am reserving my right to object.\n  Mr. GREGG. Regular order. I ask for regular order.\n\n[[Page S6846]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that under the regular \norder, I have a right to object, and I----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to object. But not \nmake a speech.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Pardon? No?\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for regular order. Either objection should be or not \nbe made.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we had the opportunity to go to this bill \nlast evening. We have been waiting here all day long in order to take \naction on this legislation. Legislation that can have a direct impact \nin terms of the cost of prescription drugs and also on coverage.\n  Now at 5 o'clock, the Senator comes here without any kind of notice \nand makes this request. I think the American people are entitled to \nknow why, since the Senator from New Hampshire was the one who \noriginally objected to bringing up the bill. I would be prepared to \nvote right now on whether to proceed to the bill if the Senator wants \nto call off tomorrow's cloture vote.\n  But if the Senator is objecting to the bill on substantive grounds \nlast night, I think the American people are entitled to know where \ntheir Senators stand on considering this legislation. If the Senator \nwants to do it tonight, that is fine with me. If he does not care to do \nit tonight, we will follow the regular order and tomorrow when the roll \nis called--as it will be done here in the Senate--when the roll is \ncalled, we will find out. The American people will find out who \nbelieves we ought to move ahead with this legislation. That is the way \nit should be.\n  There has been objection raised to the majority leader to moving \nahead. Now I think, since this issue has been raised during the course \nof the debate, during the course of the day, the American people are \nentitled to know who is going to be for this particular legislation.\n  That is why I have raised that issue.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think it is wise, if we are going to \nconduct our activities, that we do it in the light of day rather than \nthe twilight of the evening. We ought to have the chance to have an \nopen kind of a process. We have the Senator from Michigan here who has \nbeen waiting to make an excellent presentation. I was engaged in a \nconversation with my friend and colleague from Maine about this. \nSuddenly, there is a unanimous consent request to just go ahead with \nthe legislation.\n  I think we ought to conduct a full debate on this issue, which is of \nsuch importance and consequence to families across the country in terms \nof the cost, availability, and accessibility of prescription drugs. And \nwe ought to do it in the light of day. We ought to have a good debate \non this issue.\n  But since there has been objection to the majority leader proceeding \nto this issue, because evidently the Committee did not conform to the \nunderstandings of certain Senators, and there has been objection raised \nfrom that side of the aisle during the course of discussion and debate, \nI am going to insist that the Senate go ahead and have a roll call \nvote. We are going to vote on this. And the American people will \nunderstand who is for moving ahead with this legislation and who is \nnot. Hopefully, we can then make progress on this legislation. We will \nconsider amendments and begin the substance of this debate rather than \njust the general debate.\n  I would be glad to yield to the Senator from New York. I believe I \nhave the floor. The Senator from New York has asked for me to yield for \na question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator. I appreciate his yielding. I want \nto make an inquiry of him. I am, in fact, in accord with what my friend \nfrom Massachusetts said.\n  We have now spent all day today. We could have spent it debating \namendments and moving the bill forward. We might have even been able to \ngo forward on Friday. All of a sudden, after all of this, when we can't \naccomplish anything, when we can't accomplish amendments, our good \nfriend from New Hampshire comes up and says: Never mind.\n  Well, there is a reason we think we ought to have a vote. We ought to \nsee where people are. We ought to avoid this from happening another \ntime. What if it happens again 2 days from now? What if there is an \namendment that gets somebody upset and they decide to filibuster again? \nThen we are in the middle of debating access, or in the middle of \ndebating Canadian reimportation.\n  Let us see where the cards are. Let us see if there was a real reason \nto delay and delay and delay. Let us see where the votes are. Do people \nreally want a delay? This idea of spending a whole day--I don't mind \nit. I like this issue. I have fun talking about it. I think it is good \nthat the American people hear about it. But I would rather be voting on \namendments. I would rather be crafting legislation. I would rather be \nreducing the cost of drugs to my constituents from Buffalo to Montauk \nfrom Plattsburgh down to Brooklyn.\n  I completely agree with my friend from Massachusetts. If you want to \nhave a vote now so we can avoid these games in the future, by all \nmeans. But if you don't want to have that vote now, then let us wait \nuntil tomorrow. Let's have a vote on this. God knows we have spent \nenough time debating the issue.\n  I thank him for making that point so well and so forcefully.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see the Senator from Michigan has asked to be \nrecognized. I yield to her.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate very much having the \nopportunity as well to raise the issue. I appreciate now our friend \nwants to move ahead with this issue. But we certainly want to make sure \nwe have a vote so that we know that in fact we can proceed.\n  I ask of our leader, the Senator from Massachusetts: In order for us \nto guarantee that we can proceed and that this will not happen again in \nthe future, is it his assumption that it is best for us then to move \nahead to a vote so we may guarantee in fact, as my friend from New York \nsaid, that we don't have this happening again and not just a series of \nfilibusters in order to stop us from moving ahead on this important \nissue?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I intend to yield the floor. I will \ninsist on the regular order so that we have a chance to vote on this \ntomorrow.\n  I see my friend and colleague, our leader from Nevada, wishes to \naddress the Senate. Obviously, I would follow the leadership in terms \nof when that vote would occur. If the request is that we move ahead \nwith a vote this evening, I will certainly support that proposal.\n  (Several Senators addressed the Chair).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, crocodile tears are being shed here, I see. \nWe agree to vitiate the vote. But we didn't want to vitiate the vote. \nWe agree to proceed to the bill. We don't want to proceed to the bill. \nAll day we heard about how outrageous it was that we were having to go \nto a vote. Suddenly, crocodile tears appear to be shed early today.\n  My reason for suggesting that we vitiate the vote was in response to \nthe specific comments of the Senator from Michigan. The Senator from \nMichigan came to the floor and called upon me by name and by State to \nproceed with the bill. That is what the Senator from Michigan called \nupon me to do.\n  I ask if it is possible to read back the statement the Senator from \nMichigan made just prior to the most recent exchange.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The statement would have to be obtained from \nthe Official Reporters.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will represent--and hopefully people will take the \nrepresentation as accurate--that the Senator from Michigan was on the \nfloor asking why I was slowing the bill down and called on me to----\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will my colleague from New Hampshire yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I was here at 10 o'clock this morning asking that, and \nI\n\n[[Page S6847]]\n\nthink it would have been very appropriate if you had been here at 10 \no'clock this morning. We would have welcomed that. We have all day been \nasking that. Now we are at a point where I think the concerns of my \nfriend----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire yielded for a \nquestion.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask why you were not with us this morning. We have \nbeen asking all day.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate that question. I wasn't here this morning \nwhen you asked that question. But there is a tempo to this body. And \nthe tempo involves putting on the Record the reasons this bill was, in \nmy opinion, being brought forward in a manner which was inconsistent \nwith the agreements which had been reached, in my opinion, within the \ncommittee.\n  There are two items that were represented as being fixed before the \nbill came to the floor, in my opinion. Neither of those items was \ncorrected. The bill has had a very short shelf life. It was introduced \nlast--we saw it for the first time, I believe, last Wednesday morning. \nIt was passed last Thursday, and it was on the floor without a report \non Monday.\n  During that period of it being passed in the committee on Thursday, \nthere was an understanding between Senator Edwards and myself that part \nof the bill was incorrect and it would be fixed. Between Senator Frist \nand Senator Edwards, there was another part of the bill that was \nincorrect which would be fixed.\n  For me, it seems inappropriate to move to the bill in such rapidity \nwithout having made that point--that point I spent a considerable \namount of time making this morning and this afternoon, and which I am \nhappy to continue to make.\n  But as a practical matter, I think the point has been made. I am \nwilling to proceed to the bill, as the Senator from Michigan said. She \ncame to the floor while I was here. I wasn't here this morning. \nRegrettably, I didn't hear your excellent speech. I am sure it was an \nexcellent speech. But I was here to hear your last excellent speech. In \nresponse to it, I thought: Gee, let us proceed to the bill rather than \nhave a vote tomorrow. We can have a vote tomorrow. I would counsel \neveryone to vote in favor of it, if they can.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield in a second.\n  But the question was why I made this statement. It was because the \nSenator from Michigan asked me. I was stunned, startled, and surprised \nby the Senator from Massachusetts who, upon--and I understand that he \nwas in a conversation and probably didn't hear the Senator from \nMichigan ask me. But had he heard the Senator from Michigan ask me, I \nam sure he would have said that is a reasonable response to the Senator \nfrom Michigan, I agree with it, and we should move to a vote.\n  I am also surprised that someone on the other side of the aisle is \nobjecting to proceeding to the issue without a vote. If that is the \ncase, that is the case; so be it; let us have the vote tomorrow. But if \nyou want to proceed to the issue right now, I am perfectly willing to \ndo that without a vote.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield for a question, my good friend?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield for a question. I am sure it will be an \nexcellent question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire yields for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  He knows from the days we played basketball together in the House gym \nthat my questioning ability is about equal to my basketball playing \nability--not very good. But I would simply ask him a question.\n  If he wishes to move to the bill, and understanding that some of us \nfeel a little grieved that we debated this all day, why would he object \nto us having a vote right now and then moving to the bill?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would answer the question, because my colleague from New \nHampshire is in New Hampshire attending a funeral. I would otherwise be \nhappy to move to the vote right now.\n  I renew my request that we proceed to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire still has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the opportunity to spend a lot of \ntime on the floor and I see what goes on here more than this very \nimportant piece of legislation dealing with prescription drugs. For \nmonths and months, I have seen this. I have watched what has gone on. \nAnd it does not matter whether it is election reform, whether it is the \nenergy bill, whether it is terrorism insurance, the supplemental \nappropriations bill, the Department of Defense authorization bill, or, \nas a couple hours ago, trying to move to military construction \nappropriations, it does not matter what we do, we cannot do it because \nthey will not let us.\n  This is no different. And the answer is, you know, we can talk about: \nSure, let's do it today. We will do it right now--after we have wasted \nactually 2 days--not 1 day, 2 days. Today is Tuesday.\n  This is the same on every piece of legislation with which we deal. \nAnd the reason is they do not want us--``they,'' meaning the Republican \nminority, do not want us to deal with this legislation--this \nlegislation, election reform, energy, terrorism insurance, the \nsupplemental, DOD authorization.\n  And the game does not stop with cloture on getting the bills to the \nfloor with a motion to proceed. It is one thing after another. No, they \ndon't want a 3-to-2 breakdown on the conference committee. They want 4 \nto 3. Or it doesn't matter what it is, we can't do it right.\n  But, Mr. President, we have the ability to persevere. And we have \nbeen able to pass election reform in spite of their not wanting us to \ngo to it. We have been able to pass an energy bill in spite of their \nnot wanting us to go to it. We have been able to pass a good terrorism \nbill in spite of not being able to get to it for weeks and weeks and \nweeks. We have passed a supplemental bill that is a good bill. The \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill is a good bill.\n  We have the ability to persevere and we are going to do it on \nprescription drugs. They can stall us for days. That is what this is \nall about, the big stall. That is one thing I have learned. I know what \nthis is: stall, delay. And, of course, the Senator from Massachusetts \nis absolutely right; that is all this is about.\n\n  I have the greatest respect for the senior Senator from New \nHampshire. He is good and he knows Senate procedures. He served in the \nHouse and was Governor of New Hampshire. And he is now a Senator, \nsenior Senator. He knows the rules. He knows they have gotten 2 days on \nus on this bill to prevent us from offering amendments. I would like to \nspend some time on the Graham-Miller legislation, which the vast \nmajority of the Senate--Democrats--support. It is good legislation. We \nshould have been debating that all day today, and started on it \nyesterday.\n  No, we will not be able to do it. And the word has come from the \nother side that the minute it comes up--the minute it comes up--they \nare going to raise a point of order. And so the longer they stall on \nthat, the less opportunity it will give us to talk about substantive \nissues.\n  So I am not surprised. This is the way it has been. They are going to \ncontinue to do this because they do not want the Senate Democrats to \nhave victories. And we are having them in spite of having to fight \nevery step of the way--every step of the way--to get where we need to \ngo.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend from New Hampshire for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am willing to give you a victory. I am saying: You win. \nProceed to the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Let me respond to my friend. I also understand this, that \nyou have stalled for 2 days, at least. I think we can count Friday as \nanother stall day.\n  Mr. GREGG. The bill wasn't passed until last Thursday.\n  Mr. REID. You stalled for 2 days. And here we now have a situation \nwhere,\n\n[[Page S6848]]\n\nafter having wasted 2 days, we now are in a situation where you say: \nOK, let's just go to it.\n  It is 5 o'clock tonight. You have told us your friend in New \nHampshire has a funeral. I also spoke to our colleague from New \nHampshire. He said: Do you think there are going to be any votes? I \nsaid: It looks like you're not going to give us any votes. I said: I \nwould hope we would have a vote on military construction. Right out \nhere at about 2:30 today he and I visited.\n  So I say your statement that our colleague from New Hampshire is at a \nfuneral--I am glad he is attending a funeral. I am glad he was able to \ngo there. I think it is the right thing to do. But what I say, if going \nto a funeral isn't an excuse for missing a vote, there isn't one that \nexists in the world. So I think that is a very poor excuse for our not \nvoting on this tonight.\n  If, in fact, you want us to go forward, I ask unanimous consent that \nwe vote on cloture right now. Let's say at 5:45. Give people an \nopportunity to get here. We vote. I will spread on the Record that \nanyone who questions the junior Senator from New Hampshire not being \nhere for the vote--I will personally campaign against that person and \nsay that it is wrong for anyone to raise that as an issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I would actually note I am \nactually the junior Senator from New Hampshire. But independent of that \nsubtlety----\n  Mr. REID. Let's say, you don't act like the junior Senator.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Not all the time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Let me make the point, we do not need a vote because I am \nwilling to agree to go to this without a vote. But if we are going to \nhave a vote, let's have it when it was originally scheduled, which is \ntomorrow at 10:30 or 9:30, whatever it was. So I would object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New Hampshire, we have had people \nwho have told us they didn't want us to go forward. And I think they \nshould be called here and cast a vote and see how--I don't like to use \nwords like this, so I will not use the word ``phony''--let's say \ndeceptive.\n  Here they are now. They are saying: We aren't going to let you go to \nthis, but we don't want to vote on it. I want them to vote on it. \nProbably the vote will be 98 to 0. We will show how fallacious and \nfoolish and wasteful it was not allowing us to go forward on this \nanyway.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for a further question, I think \nthe Senator's knowledge of process around here certainly exceeds mine \nand, obviously, it borders on genius. And, therefore, I suspect the \nSenator knows there are ways in which to get one's point across in this \ninstitution which involve procedural activities.\n  My purpose in raising this issue was to get my point across, that I \nbelieved the bill was coming to the floor without having been \nadequately structured as to how it was going to leave the committee. \nNow, I made my point. I am happy to move on without a vote. There will \nbe a vote tomorrow, if you wish to have it, and it will probably be 98 \nto 0.\n  Mr. REID. Does my friend have a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. My question is, Why do you need a vote?\n  Mr. REID. For the reasons that have been outlined, in detail, by the \nSenator from Massachusetts, and by me.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed to Calendar No. 491, S. 812, occur at 10:30, Wednesday morning, \nJuly 17, and that the time until the cloture vote be equally divided \nand controlled between Senators Kennedy and Gregg or their designees; \nand that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived; that \nimmediately following the vote, if cloture is invoked, the motion to \nproceed be agreed to, and the Senate begin consideration of S. 812.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader has asked that I \nannounce there will be no more votes today.\n  I would say, after having said that, that is really too bad. What a \ntime to do military construction today. We would take 20 minutes, plus \n45 minutes. We would finish that bill and send it to the President.\n  Now, I would say that my friend from Arizona complained because he \nwants firemen. I have checked with Nevada. I will be very brief. I know \npeople want to talk on prescription drugs, which they should, but in \nNevada--you know, my friend from Arizona is complaining he wants to \nmake sure there is going to be money to fight these fires--we have the \nMud Springs fire covering 4,000 acres; Eagle fire, 10,000 acres; \nBuckeye fire, 850 acres; Ellsworth fire, 1,200 acres. They are burning \nright now--the Belmont fire, 650 acres; Cold Springs fire, 1,000 acres; \nAdobe fire, over 500 acres; Bridgeport fire, 250 acres; Pony Trail \nfire, 100 acres; Lost Cabin fire, 1,500 acres.\n\n  I am willing to do what we always have done: Wait until the money \ncomes forward in the Interior appropriations bill. We have already \nestablished that the President should push this in the supplemental. He \nhas not done that. Maybe he will do that. That is no excuse, no reason \nfor not going forward with this bill.\n  As I outlined following Senator Kennedy's statement, it is a sham. \nEverything we do here is an ordeal. It is an ordeal to get money to \ntake care of construction needs for our military around the world. I \nrepeat, election reform, energy, terrorism, supplemental \nappropriations, DOD, the corporate security bill, whatever it is, the \nbig stall takes place. And we are able, in spite of that, to work our \nway through the system and declare some victories for the American \npeople. We are going to continue to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a minute or two, and \nhopefully the Senator from Michigan will be able to complete her \nstatement. She has been here all day long. She has yielded to all of \nthe interventions. She has a determination that cannot be matched, but \nshe also has patience and grace that can't be matched either. I will \njust take a moment, and hopefully she will be recognized.\n  Just as a general matter, this legislation is enormously important. \nWe have all said that during the course of the day. I hope at the start \nof the substantive debate we can have a sense of civility about how we \nare going to proceed. If there are legitimate kinds of concerns, as \nexpressed by the Senator from New Hampshire about being unwilling to \npermit the Senate to move forward, I will take those. I don't agree \nwith them, and I think they are misplaced for reasons I have outlined, \nbut I can understand those. Then we are going to play by the rules.\n  But I would hope, as we begin this extraordinarily important debate \nand discussion, that we will free ourselves from gamesmanship and \nsurprises. Let's try and deal with this important issue. Let's share \nour amendments if we are going to call them up. Let's get back to a \nsense of civility. People have strong views. This is enormously \nimportant. The underlying legislation and these amendments are \nincredibly important.\n  People are entitled to have the full attention and consideration of \nthe Members of this body and to be free of the gamesmanship that too \noften takes place. I hope at the start of this, we will have that as a \nbasis on the way to proceed. I think the American people expect no \nless. There has been objection, as has been pointed out, to our \nconsidering this. This is too important. The American people will see \nwith tomorrow's vote on the will of the Senate, whether this \nlegislation is flawed in some way or whether we ought to proceed to it.\n  As the Senator from Nevada has pointed out, we are prepared to have \nthat vote this evening as a roll call vote, so that the American people \ncan see, after listening to this debate all day long and after the \nallegations and charges that were made about the incompleteness of the \nlegislation, whether there are substantial Members of this body who \ndon't feel we ought to go ahead, or whether the majority believe we \nshould go ahead.\n  At the beginning of this debate, which will take some time and is \nvery important, let's hope we can proceed in a way that is worthy of \nthis institution.\n  I thank the Senate.\n\n[[Page S6849]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to comment on some of the remarks \nof the majority whip and some of the comments of the chairman of the \ncommittee with respect to this legislation.\n  No. 1, the junior Senator from New Hampshire has every right, as \nranking member of the committee, to be outraged at the way this bill \nwas brought to the floor. It is my understanding, listening to him \ntoday and from the discussion in committee, that there were certain \ncommitments made with respect to bringing this bill to the floor. The \nfact is, the reason we have seen delays on the floor on the energy \nbill, the terrorism insurance bill, election reform, a variety of other \nbills, was because those bills had bypassed committees. They had been \nbrought straight to the floor.\n  Now we are talking about another bill, the Medicare drug bill, which \nwill be amended, attempted to be amended, to this underlying bill that \nwill be bypassing the committee and brought straight to the floor. What \nis the underlying bill? A bill that was introduced on Thursday and now \nis on the floor. No one had seen it. I am still trying to understand \nthis legislation. It is very technical, very complex. It is very \nimportant to my State, in which there is a lot of drug manufacturing. I \nam still trying to understand the complexity of what this bill actually \ndoes. It is here on the floor, and we are asked to just move ahead.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire had some understanding of what was \ngoing to be changed. As you know, when you are marking up a bill in \ncommittee, markups are not about legislative language. There are \nconcept documents that are then put into legislative language and \nbrought to the floor. The Senator from New Hampshire had understandings \nand those understandings were not incorporated into this legislation.\n\n  The Senator from New Hampshire had a right to come to the floor and \nexplain his dissatisfaction with this procedure. We have two procedures \nset up: No. 1, you completely bypass the committee; No. 2, you go \nthrough committee, and then you don't bring the bill out that you say \nyou are going to from committee.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire simply wanted to make that point. As \nyou know, in the Senate we have the opportunity to put a halt on things \ntemporarily so you can make a point. The point is, procedurally this \nSenate is being run amok, whether it is the work now coming out of \ncommittee or, more often than not, it is the work that is not even done \nin committee.\n  I don't know why we have a Finance Committee, much less a chairman of \nthe committee, because every important issue the Finance Committee has \nhad to deal with this session has been bypassed. The committee has been \nbypassed.\n  Whether it is taxes or Medicare prescription drugs, I cannot think of \nany two issues more important--I also include trade--the three most \nimportant issues Finance deals with: trade, taxes, and health care--of \nthe three major issues of this session of Congress, the Finance \nCommittee and the chairman were simply bypassed. Partisan bills were \nbrought straight to the floor.\n  Why are we discussing this underlying bill? They brought this bill up \nbecause this is the vehicle by which to talk about health care because \nthey couldn't get their prescription drug bill through the committee. \nThey couldn't get the Democrat prescription drug bill through committee \nbecause it is a partisan approach. It will get no bipartisan support. \nIt has no scoring. It has not even been written yet. It is still being \nworked on.\n  The bottom line is, they couldn't get that through committee. \nActually, the bill that would have come out of committee--I am fairly \nconfident--the bill that would have come out of committee would have \nbeen a bipartisan bill. But it wouldn't have been a bill that the \nmajority leader wanted. So he takes the gavel out of the hand of the \nchairman and runs the bill straight to the floor; that is, his bill. \nThat is a partisan bill.\n  Why does he do that? We are still operating on last year's budget \nagreement. Last year's budget agreement requires two things of a \nMedicare prescription drug bill: No. 1, that it be within the budget \namount, which I believe is $300, $350 billion in number--it has to be \nthat number or under--No. 2, it has to be reported from the Finance \nCommittee.\n  So here is the state of play now because we are playing politics with \nprescription drugs instead of trying to do prescription drugs. We are \nplaying politics. Why? Because any bill that is offered in the Senate \nthat provides a prescription drug benefit for seniors will be subject \nto a point of order which is 60 votes. Why? Because it was never \nreported through the Finance Committee. Why? Because the majority \nleader refused to let the Finance Committee mark up a bill.\n  So what has he done? He has set up a game where he has placed the bar \nso high that no benefit will pass the Senate. Why? Morton Kondracke \nanswered that in Roll Call when he said it is obvious the Senate \nDemocrats wanted the issue more than the prescription drug coverage for \nseniors. They would rather have the issue this fall than the drug \ncoverage for seniors as soon as possible.\n  I have not been around that long. I have been around since 1991. But \nsince I have been here in the House and in the Senate, I have noticed \none thing: When it comes to dealing with the big issues of the day, \nparticularly health care, taxes, Social Security, et cetera, by and \nlarge--particularly with Social Security and Medicare entitlements--you \ncannot pass one of these pieces of legislation without a bipartisan \nconsensus. You cannot do it, and I argue that you should not do it. You \nshould try to work together to get a consensus. If you are serious \nabout getting a bill through the Senate on prescription drugs, you \ncannot bypass the committee, bypass bipartisan agreements, bring a \npartisan bill to the floor, play games of 60-vote points of order, and \nclaim you tried and the other side blocked you from succeeding, which \nis exactly the way this is going to play out.\n\n  Let's have no illusions as to how this will end. This is not a \nserious discussion, folks, of getting prescription drugs for seniors. \nThis is a serious campaign rhetoric debate about who is for seniors \nmore, knowing full well, the way the game was set up, seniors will \nlose, no matter what happens.\n  If you were serious about getting a prescription drug benefit for \nseniors, you would take it through the Senate Finance Committee and \nthey would do the work that should not be done on the floor of the \nSenate. You have folks on the Finance Committee who have waited years \nand years to get on that committee and have studied these issues very \nhard, such as the Senator from Massachusetts, who is an expert in the \nareas under the Labor Committee's jurisdiction. He is an expert. He has \nbeen working on these issues. This is his area of expertise in \nlegislating. When the Finance Committee deals with welfare, taxes, \ntrade, Medicare, and health care, this is their area of expertise. They \nwork together. This is a dynamic. That is how committees work. They \nwork together and find compromise. They understand the real intricacies \nof the issues, and they work together to knead together legislation \nthat will work and come to the floor without all of the different \nproblems that confront a virgin piece of legislation that is dreamed up \nin some back room somewhere.\n  That is how the process works to help the Senate do its work. You \nbuild consensus in committee. You get Democrats and Republicans working \ntogether to form agreements and coalitions, to bring a bill to the \nfloor so you can continue that. That has all been thrown out the \nwindow. Why? This bill is about partisan politics. This bill is about \nthe November election. This is not about providing prescription drugs \nfor seniors.\n  This is really tragic. It is amazing to me that the Senator from \nNevada would complain about losing 2 days. We are going to lose 2 weeks \nin the Senate. We are going to spend 2 weeks debating health care \nissues that, because of the procedure that has been set up, will never \npass the Senate, because we have set up a procedure that is doomed to \nfail, we have set up a procedure that does not allow bipartisan \ncooperation.\n  We have a bill introduced by members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee--a tripartisan bill--that would have passed the committee, \nthat could\n\n[[Page S6850]]\n\nhave come to the floor. A lot of the problems already could have been \nworked out. We could have spent less time, not more time, here in the \nSenate. If we really wanted to do a prescription drug bill, we could \nhave let the Finance Committee do its work and we would have had the \nissues narrowed as a result of that. We could have come to the Senate \nfloor and worked together and tried to get a bipartisan bill that could \nbe conferenced with the House, so we could get a Medicare prescription \ndrug bill. But a prescription drug bill is a partisan issue now. That \nis the result of this procedure we have going right now.\n\n  I don't understand why we say we have lost 2 days. We just voted on \nthe corporate accountability and accounting bill at 7 o'clock last \nnight. We had amendments and debate going on up until then--which would \nbe allowed. There were amendments that were not allowed to be offered. \nWe had debate going on and we had 4 or 5 votes last night. So I don't \nknow how we have lost 2 days. The Senator from New Hampshire, about an \nhour ago, said he would be willing to vitiate the vote. There has been \nplenty of time for Members to lay down amendments. I think I can \nstipulate for the record, if anybody on the other side would care to \nhave the stipulation as a satisfactory admission on our part, the vote \ntomorrow will be unanimous to move to proceed to the bill.\n  I don't think there is any question that every Member on this side \nwants to proceed to the bill. We want to talk about prescription drugs. \nWe want to have our ideas. We have three different plans on this side \nof the aisle that are supported by various Members. Senator Smith from \nNew Hampshire and Senator Allard have a plan, Senators Ensign and Gramm \nhave a plan, and the tripartisan plan that is supported by many \nRepublicans, all of which I think bring a tremendous contribution to \nthe debate. We will have good discussions about it.\n  I know the Senator from Nevada said he wishes we had the Democratic \nprescription drug bill up. I hope the Senator from Nevada offers that \nbill right out of the shoot. I hope we do have a vote on that tomorrow, \nor lay down that bill and have a discussion about it. I think it would \nbe great.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator from Pennsylvania support, then, an up-\nor-down vote on the Graham-Miller bill that you just talked about? Do \nyou want to debate that, and would you be willing to have an up-or-down \nvote?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think we should have up-or-down votes on every plan I \njust listed. If the Senator would agree to up-or-down votes on the \ntripartisan plan and the other two plans I just listed, which are \nserious legislative proposals, I think there would be no question you \nwould easily get an agreement to have an up-or-down vote on the point \nof order on all of those.\n  Mr. REID. I am not talking about a point of order. I asked the \nSenator from Pennsylvania if he would give us an up-or-down vote on the \nGraham-Miller prescription drug benefit plan.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Obviously, the procedure by which this bill has been \nbrought to the floor has tainted this entire process. I believe, \nactually, the best chance we have to get the high-water mark--in other \nwords, the most votes on any bill--will be the tripartisan bill because \nit has tripartisan support.\n  Mr. REID. So the answer to my question is no?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Again, I suggest that you have created the atmosphere \nby which the point of order is available to some Members, and whether I \nagree or not doesn't matter. I think there will be Members on both \nsides of the aisle who will raise a point of order. Why? Because it is \navailable. The Senator from Nevada knows full well if points of order \nare available, someone on this side--or the other side of the aisle, I \nmight add--will raise a point of order. You have brought this bill to \nthe floor by bypassing the Finance Committee. You have brought it with \nan instant point of order. That is the remarkable thing. You could have \na prescription drug benefit bill that would cost $10, and if you \nbrought that to the floor, it would have a budget point of order. Why? \nBecause the budget says the bill had to come through the Finance \nCommittee. So what we have done is set the bar where you now have to \nhave every single Member of the Senate agree that this bill comes to \nthe floor without objecting to it on a point of order.\n\n  As the Senator from Nevada knows, you hardly get anybody to agree to \nanything around here, much less a multibillion-dollar expansion of \nhealth care benefits, without having someone opposed to the legislation \nand then raising a point of order. So what we have done, as I said \nbefore, is set the bar so high that you have ensured that nothing will \nhappen.\n  I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I would say that the bill we are working on here was \nreported out of the HELP Committee by a 16-to-5 vote; 5 Republicans \nvoted to bring it to the floor. That is why we were so stunned when we \nweren't able to go to the bill. I also say that it appears to me that \nthis bill didn't need to go to the Finance Committee; it was under the \njurisdiction of the HELP Committee. But even if a bill went through the \nFinance Committee, it would still need 60 votes and we could raise a \npoint of order on it.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, taking back my time I say not \nnecessarily. It depends. If it were in the budget constraint and were \nnot marked up in the committee, would it not be subject to a point of \norder?\n  Mr. REID. Being marked up in committee makes no difference \nwhatsoever.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is not what last year's budget agreement says.\n  I also make the other point that, with respect to this bill--and you \nsaid you were shocked at the objection. I hope you listened to the \nSenator from New Hampshire in laying out what were legitimate \ncomplaints about the way this bill was brought to the floor, when \ncertain assurances were given. As you know--and the Senator is a \ncommittee chairman and knows how markups work--certain assurances were \nmade about issues being brought up in committee, and technical \ncorrections or other corrections were ``agreed upon.'' And then when \nthe bill came to the floor, those changes were not made.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, he asked me a question. May I respond?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be happy to let the Senator respond, and then I want \nto ask a question.\n  Mr. REID. I will be very quick in responding to the question. I say \nto my friend, in response to the question--even though you had the \nfloor and you asked me a question--this, as far as I am concerned, is \none of those excuses I have talked about. The bill was reported in a \nbipartisan fashion out of committee.\n  My friend from New Hampshire, the junior Senator, said: You told me \ncertain things. That is what the amendment process is all about. He \nsaid: It is technical in nature. This is just an excuse not to go to \nthe bill. This is just an excuse not to go to the bill. We are wasting \ntime that should be used on prescription drugs. That is what we have \ntried to establish today. We are wasting time when we should be dealing \nwith the bill itself, not talking about technical amendments that \nshould not be here. It is here, it is here on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Reclaiming my time, the Senator knows fixing \nlegislation on the floor is a lot harder than having something in the \nbase bill. The fact is, the Senator believed certain assurances were \nmade and those assurances were violated. He wanted an opportunity to \npause to make that case. Subsequent to him making that case, he agreed \nto vitiate the vote. In fact, he agreed to proceed to the bill over an \nhour ago, and he agreed to vitiate the vote a couple hours ago.\n  All I suggest is, if we were serious about moving to this \nlegislation, having a discussion about prescription drugs, we could be \ndoing that right now. We are in some degree doing that right now. We \ncould be on an amendment. I hope the Senator from Nevada or somebody on \nhis side puts down the Democratic proposal that we can have this \ndebate, begin in earnest and have votes. I will be happy to yield to \nthe leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator from Pennsylvania will yield, \nlet\n\n[[Page S6851]]\n\nme clarify. There are several issues in play. First of all, there was \nthe point the Senator from Pennsylvania was just making that there was \nsome understanding that Members thought they had some modification of \nthe bill that was going to be made that did not happen. Maybe that was \njust a misunderstanding, but that contributed to this problem.\n  The second issue, this is not just about this drug pricing bill. \nEverybody knows this is going to wind up being the vehicle for debate \non prescription drugs. There is concern about going forward in this \nway; that this is going to be a process to which I have referred as \nmutually assured destruction because whatever is offered is going to \nhave to get 60 votes because it did not come from the Finance Committee \nand/or because it exceeds what the budget allows. And that is the point \nI wish to clarify.\n  If I am misinformed, I would like to know that at this point. But my \nunderstanding clearly is that because we do not have a budget \nresolution passed by the Senate, we do not have any budget numbers, \nthat the number we are operating on that is allowed for prescription \ndrugs is $300 billion. That is what was identified last year, and that \nstill is what applies.\n  If you exceed that amount, you have to have 60 votes to overcome a \npoint of order. Secondly, if it does not come from the Finance \nCommittee, that in itself would require 60 votes to overcome a point of \norder.\n  There are two reasons we will have to have 60 votes to pass any of \nthe bills that may be offered in the prescription drug area.\n  If that is not correct, then I stand corrected. If we could get a \nbill out of the committee that was under that amount, then there would \nnot be a problem. At least one of the approaches, or maybe a couple \napproaches, that will be offered--the one by Senators Hagel, Ensign, \nand Gramm that would cost, I understand, somewhere between $150 billion \nto $170 billion--would not require the votes to overcome the point of \norder, but it would because it did not come through the \nFinance Committee.\n\n  There is a simple solution to this: The Finance Committee should meet \nand vote. We have met for hours trying to figure out the right way to \ndo this. It is difficult, it is complicated, and it is important. We \nmet 4 hours, and I was there a couple hours last week. Yet we have not \nhad a markup. Let's go to a markup, have debate, amendments, and see if \nthe Finance Committee can report a bill. That is what I urge we do. \nThen we can have a bill that came out of the committee, that could have \ntripartisan support, and it would not be subject to a 60-vote point of \norder. We could pass it with 51 votes and get real help to people who \nneed it--the elderly, sick, poor people--and we can do it this week.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Was there not a markup scheduled for the Finance \nCommittee this week?\n  Mr. LOTT. There was a markup. We marked up two minor bills last week, \nand there was a markup scheduled at 10 o'clock this morning. It was \ndelayed to 2 o'clock and then cancelled. Why? Because Senators Snowe, \nGrassley, and others in the tripartisan effort served notice that they \nwere going to offer a prescription drug package to a so-called minor \nbill. As a result of that, that markup was canceled.\n  It really bothers me. It looks to me that we are headed for a \nsituation where, when the smoke clears next week, no package will be \nleft standing, and we will not have passed a bill with 60 votes and the \npeople once again will not get the help they need. We seem to be \nstriving to find a way not to do this. I do not understand it.\n  I do not question the merits of the different bills. We can argue \nabout them and we can debate them, but if the end result is nothing, is \nthat good? As far as the underlying bill, if we knew debate was going \nto be on the drug-pricing issue, we could have started earlier, and we \ncould probably have finished it this week. But there are two distinct \nissues that are riding on each other. It is a real problem.\n  Once the prescription drug bills perhaps fail, I guess we will come \nback to the base bill, and it will probably pass and I assume it will \nbe a bipartisan vote: Some for it; some against it. I want to clarify, \nit is my understanding that clearly it takes 60 votes because of the \namount involved and because the Finance Committee will not have acted.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Republican leader is correct. As I said earlier, if \na drug benefit bill were brought forward that cost $10, it would be \nsubject to a budget point of order because of this procedure.\n  People are asking: Why is the 60-vote procedure such a problem? The \nSenator from Nevada asked would I object to an up-or-down vote on one \nof them? I can certainly agree to that. The problem is the 99 other \nSenators; only one of them needs to object to an up-or-down vote and \nmake a point of order against the underlying bill because it is not \nreported out of the Finance Committee, and we have a problem. We have \nto get 60 votes.\n  The interesting question is why are we in this situation? Obviously, \nbecause the majority leader has decided to bring a bill straight to the \nfloor and not through committee. Why are we in this situation even \nstepping back from what happened yesterday? Because we do not have a \nbudget. We have no budget. For the first time since 1974, we have no \nbudget in the Senate. Now we are starting to see the consequences of \nnot having a budget.\n  The other point is we do not have any appropriations bills passed. I \nam not the one objecting to the MILCON appropriations bill, and I hope \nwe can work that out and I would be very supportive of passing it on a \nvery short timeframe. The fact is, we are way behind on appropriations, \nand if I look at the schedule, we are talking about health care this \nweek, next week, and talking about homeland security the week we leave. \nI do not see any time in here to do 13 appropriations bills that are \nnecessary to run the Government of the United States.\n\n  We have no budget, we have no appropriations bills, and as a result \nof having no budget, we have a, to be very candid, screwed-up system by \nwhich we are dealing with a Medicare prescription drug bill, which to \nmy constituents--and I represent per capita the second oldest \npopulation in the country--is perhaps one of the most important bills, \nmaybe the most important bill, we are going to deal with in Washington, \nDC, for the people of Pennsylvania.\n  I always say we are second to Florida per capita in the number of \nseniors, but my comment is, my seniors care more about Medicare and \nprescription drugs than the ones in Florida because all my rich seniors \nmove to Florida, and what is left in Pennsylvania are the folks who \nreally need the coverage and cannot afford it. So this is a very \nimportant bill for the folks in Pennsylvania.\n  This is something we want to accomplish. This is not something I want \nto be held up by some procedural trick.\n  I will say without reservation that if we had a clean process and we \nhad a bill that came out of the Finance Committee that was not subject \nto a point of order, we could begin the amending process and have the \nSenate work its will. Would I be happy with the product? I would \nprobably not be overjoyed with it. I do not even know if I would vote \nfor it. But we would move the process forward where we get a bill to \nconference that is conferenceable with the House, and we have the \npotential of getting a prescription drug benefit for millions and \nmillions of seniors across America who are relying on us to do it. But \ninstead of going through the process which assures us of getting a \nbill, we have developed a process which assures us of getting no bill.\n  So don't anybody next Friday say, oh, golly, we did not make it; oh, \ngolly, we did not pass a bill and think, gee, we really gave it a good \nchance.\n  This process was scripted for failure. This process was created for a \npartisan issue in November and nothing more. This is not a serious \ndebate about Medicare prescription drugs. When we are serious about \ndoing Medicare prescription drugs, we will do it the way it was \nintended to be done and contemplated by the budget of last year, which \nis what is done with every other major entitlement bill we have ever \ndealt with in the Senate. What is that? Go through the committee of \njurisdiction. The committee works its will. A bill is brought that has \nhad a lot of the kinks worked out, has had bipartisan compromise by \nexperts who study and\n\n[[Page S6852]]\n\nwork on that kind of legislation--that is why they are on the \ncommittee--and the bill is brought to the floor to work out the final, \nin many cases major, issues. Then you get the bill done, you go to \nconference, and you move on.\n  That is not what is happening. Why? That is a good question. Why? Do \nwe not trust the chairman of the Finance Committee to mark up a bill? \nDo we not trust the committee of jurisdiction to take up this \nlegislation on which there is intense interest in the committee? There \nare several bills germinating out of members of that committee on both \nsides of the aisle. Why do we not trust this committee to do its work \non the most important issue that that committee will deal with this \nyear? Why have we said we do not trust the Finance Committee, we do not \ntrust the chairman, we are going to go over their head, we are going to \nbring a partisan bill, which to my knowledge no one on this side of the \naisle has seen? And I suspect there are a lot of folks on that side of \nthe aisle who have not seen it.\n  The bill has not been scored. We have no idea how much it costs. The \nSenator from Nevada said he hoped to be debating this bill tomorrow. I \nhope to be debating the bill tomorrow, too, because I would like to see \nit.\n  Think about this: The largest expansion of entitlement programs in \nthe history of the country, and we are going to bring the bill to the \nfloor, having not gone through committee, having not seen it, and ask \nfor a vote on it.\n  The rumor mill among the press is this bill costs $800 billion. Now, \nthat may be high. I do not know. That is the number I heard outside. \nThat is $800 billion, not over 10 years, because the bill sunsets, but \nonly 6 years. So it is a trillion-dollar expansion of government. That \nis even a big number for Washington, a trillion-dollar expansion of \ngovernment, and no one has seen the bill. It has not gone through \ncommittee. There has not even been a hearing on the bill. A trillion-\ndollar expansion of government, and there has not been a hearing on the \nbill, much less a markup.\n  Now what they are telling the American public is: We are really \nserious, aren't we? We are serious about passing a drug bill, aren't \nwe? We have not had a hearing on it, we do not know how much it costs, \nwe haven't gone through committee, haven't marked it up, we have not \nbrought it to the floor, but trust me, we are serious about passing a \nbill. This is real, this is legit, we really want to do this, we really \nwant to make this happen.\n  Remember, we have not drafted the bill, do not know how much it \ncosts, have not had a hearing, have not had a markup, have not even \nbrought the bill up to the floor, but we are serious, and it is, by the \nway, a trillion dollars. We really want to make this happen, and we are \ngoing to get it done in a couple of days, trust us, and we will work it \nout. That is the procedure.\n\n  Then we have people saying: How dare you raise a point of order \nagainst this bill that has not been finished, that costs a trillion \ndollars, has not had a hearing, has not been marked up, has not come to \nthe floor. How dare you raise a point of order against this trillion-\ndollar expansion of government. How can you do that? You must not care \nabout seniors. That is going to be the issue in November: You do not \ncare about seniors because you did not allow us to pass a bill that no \none had seen, costing potentially a trillion dollars, that no hearing \nhad been held on, that no markup had been done on, and that we had not \nhad the opportunity to even see and debate on the floor, with people \nwondering why we raised a point of order.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that this legislation about which the \nSenator from Pennsylvania speaks has been written and authored by these \ntwo radical Democrats by the name of Bob Graham from Florida and Zell \nMiller of Georgia, who both have credentials, I would suspect, that are \nas moderate as any in the Senate? Is the Senator aware of these two men \nwho have sponsored this legislation, who have written it?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I understand they have been involved in the writing of \nthe legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator also aware that this legislation about which \nthe Senator speaks has been endorsed by many organizations and groups \nin America, including the AARP?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Which I find remarkable to believe, and the answer is, \nI do know that some organizations support it, but I find it remarkable \nto believe that any legitimate organization would endorse a bill they \nhave not seen and have no idea how much it costs. The answer to your \nquestion is, yes, I am aware that certain organizations have endorsed \nit. I question the responsible nature of those organizations that would \nendorse a bill they have not seen, have no idea what the impact is on \ntheir members, and have no idea what the impact is as far as the cost \nto their members and the cost to the taxpayers, because we do not know \nthat yet.\n  Mr. REID. I have two very brief questions I would ask the Senator to \nanswer.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is not suggesting in any way that AARP is not a \nlegitimate organization, is he?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I did not say legitimate. I said responsible. There is \na difference. They are certainly legitimate. I question how responsible \nthey are.\n  Mr. REID. In the Senator's first statement, he did say legitimate.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I did, let me correct that. AARP is certainly a \nlegitimate organization. I would question how responsibly they are \nacting if they are endorsing legislation they have not seen and do not \nknow how much it costs.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has indicated we should be working on \nappropriations bills, and I agree with the Senator. But is the Senator \naware that for--I have lost track of the days, but for several days I \nhave offered at least four, maybe more, unanimous consent requests that \nwe move to military construction with a time of 65 minutes and I have \nreceived an objection on that side of the aisle?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would say to the Senator from Nevada, he did not \nreceive an objection from me. All I can say is we have a Member or two \non this side of the aisle who are concerned about the ability to pay \nfor fires in their States, and I think the Senator knows that. We all \nhave concerns about appropriations and disasters in our State. I \ncertainly respect the Senators objecting to that. I hope we can work \nthat out because I agree with the Senator from Nevada that we should be \ndealing with appropriations bills.\n  MILCON is one that is usually not very controversial, there usually \nare not a lot of amendments to it, and we should be able to pass it in \na very short period of time. We are certainly working on this side of \nthe aisle very diligently to try to take care of the objections so we \ncan get to that issue.\n  I appreciate the Senator moving forward on that, and I hope the \nSenator from Nevada will then, after we get MILCON done, move to the \nDefense appropriations bill because I think it is vitally important, as \nwe are fighting this war and we are trying to protect the homeland and \nwe are doing things that are on the cutting edge of transforming our \nmilitary, that we get that legislation passed in the Senate. When we \nget MILCON and DOD passed, the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines \nwill know the money is there and the program dollars can be spent in a \nmuch more efficient way.\n  I am a member the Armed Services Committee, and that is always a \nconcern, that there will be a delay in the release of money in the \nappropriations process. I think that would be a very important thing we \ncould do between now and the August recess, if possible. I will \ncertainly work with my colleagues on this side of the aisle to get them \nto have a very short list of amendments and see if we can get a DOD \nbill passed in short order.\n  Mr. REID. If I could respond to my friend without his losing the \nfloor, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, we reported out \nthis morning, or this afternoon--around noontime--the largest \nappropriations bill in the history of the country. That is why--and the \nSenator has taken my script--I have said basically the same thing on \nmilitary construction. We have to move forward on that because we have \nconstruction projects for our men and women in the military all over \nthe\n\n[[Page S6853]]\n\nworld. Most of them, of course, are in America, but we have military \nconstruction projects around the world that are waiting, and we need to \nget to that.\n  I appreciate the Senator saying he would join with us, but the \nproblem is we have had trouble moving all legislation, not the least of \nwhich is the military construction appropriations bill.\n  I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator allowing me to ask \nquestions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Nevada is always courteous to Members \non our side when we come to the floor and we appreciate that gentility \nin the way he deals with questions and answers and appreciate his \nquestions. I know we can work together in a bipartisan way to \nmanufacture as many appropriations bills as possible between now and \nthe August break. I know the Appropriations Committee has begun to \nchurn out these bills in marathon sessions. That is welcome news.\n  Hopefully, we can get to what I believe is the most important. It is \na big bill and it is complex. It is several hundred billion dollars. It \nis still smaller than this bill and a heck of a lot less complex, a \nbill that potentially could be presented here by the majority to expand \nprescription drugs.\n  Again, even though I object to the way this procedure is being done, \nI am very much for having this debate on the Senate floor and trying to \nget a prescription drug bill done that meets the needs of our seniors \nall across the country. I don't like the way it is structured. I don't \nbelieve it has been structured in a way that will lead us to a result \nthat can be satisfactory to any senior. It is certainly a debate we \nshould have. I just wish we had it under circumstances with a \npossibility of success. I don't think we are heading in that direction \nat this time.\n  A final point is on the underlying legislation. As I said before, I \nhave only had a chance to look at it over the last 24 hours since I \nhave been back in town. I have some concerns about this underlying \nlegislation. This is more of a vehicle than a substantive issue. We \nhave to understand, when it comes to the pharmaceutical companies, they \nare the great whipping boy in the Senate and certainly in the House and \nmany places across the country. The fact is, about 50 percent of the \nnew drugs that come on the market come from innovations in the United \nStates of America. People are alive today who are listening to my voice \nbecause of pharmaceutical companies making billions of dollars in \ninvestments each year to create new drugs, to move the envelope \nforward, to improve the quality of and to lengthen people's lives.\n  I understand they get beat up on because they try to use their \npatents and they charge more money here than in other countries and all \nthe other things said about them, but the fact is, if bills such as \nthis pass--and I am concerned about this particularly, some of the \nlitigation provisions--we are going to erode the incentives for \npharmaceutical companies to invest in cures.\n  It is popular, very popular, to go around and promise seniors you are \ngoing to get them cheap drugs; that these generics are the answer. \nThese filthy horrible drug companies, the pharmaceutical companies, the \nname brand pharmaceutical companies are horrible people who are raping \nand pillaging you, and if we just give all their patents to the generic \nfolks as quickly as possible and give the generics an opportunity to \nget in there quicker, your drug prices will be lower. That is an \nargument that appeals very much to this generation of seniors and this \ngeneration of pharmaceutical users at the expense of future cures for \nthem and others.\n  Some may say that is a good tradeoff. The politics is smart, I guess, \nbecause people would rather have the money in their pocket than the \nperspective of maybe something happening that may or may not affect \nthem in the future. I understand the game. I understand the politics. \nThe politics are great in being able to promise somebody a 50-percent \nreduction in their drugs, or a 30-percent reduction in their drugs. \nThat is great. People see it, feel it, and hear it. But people also \nneed to realize that when you do that, you limit the innovation that \noccurs; you limit those lifesavings drugs, the enhancing of the \nquality-of-life drugs that come out of this Nation's terrific \npharmaceutical industry.\n\n  Sure, I will join others on this side with some amendments. I know \nSenator Hatch and Senator Gregg have concerns about this underlying \nlegislation, have concerns about some of the issues, such as the \nreimportation of drugs.\n  I have very serious concerns about the safety of the reimportation of \ndrugs. In Canada, they are cheap and they can send them back here and \nthey are cheap. They sell them in Canada because they say this is how \nmuch you are going to charge; if you don't want this price, you cannot \nsell your drug in Canada. By the way, if you really want the drug, we \nwill make it and sell it here ourselves. So you have no market and we \nwill sell your drug anywhere.\n  You say: I cannot believe that happens. That happens.\n  Here is a pharmaceutical company that says: I charge $2 for the drugs \nin America; it costs me a quarter to make them. I charge $2 for the \ndrug in America. It costs me a quarter to make it--that is, the process \nto make it. But the rest is to make up for the many cases, hundreds of \nmillions, invested to get this formula to where it is. I have to make \nit up somehow so I have to charge more.\n  Canada says: I will only pay you a dollar; I will not pay you $2. I \nwill only pay you $1 or 50 cents. The drug company has to make a \ndecision: Do I sell it for less there and get the wrath of the American \npoliticians who say, look how cheap this drug is, or do I sell it for \nless there, still cover my costs, and make a small profit--not as much, \nbut I make a small profit--or do I not sell my drug there, have a \nCanadian steal my patent, make the drug and sell it there anyway?\n  If you are a pharmaceutical company, that is a decision you have to \nmake. Some say: No, I don't want to sell the drug. I will not do it. \nOthers say a little profit is better than none. And some suggest this \nis perhaps a unique drug, they feel a social obligation to make it \navailable in countries because this is a drug that maybe doesn't have \nanything similar to it. So they sell the drug even at a very small \nprofit because they feel a social responsibility to do so because it \nwill save lives.\n  For this, they have Senators of the Senate holding up drugs and \nsaying: Look at these rotten drug companies. Look at these rotten drug \ncompanies. Look what they are doing.\n  Understand the story because you are not being told the full story. \nYou are not being told what really happens. Yes, they are cheaper, but \nnow you understand why they are cheaper. They can say no. Fine. In some \ncases, saying no means people will die. Most pharmaceutical companies, \ncontrary to what you hear, are not in the business of wanting people to \ndie so they sell their drugs. I suggest we understand the whole story \nbefore we get into how bad these guys are for selling drugs cheaper in \nother places.\n  The bottom line is the American public, as a result of the way \nforeign governments operate, subsidize research in the world. Is it the \nright thing to do? We should have a good policy discussion on that. \nThere might be legitimate competing arguments whether we should \nsubsidize the research by paying more for research. However, if we do \nnot, the research will not get done and people will die because that \nnew drug that could have been invented had the investment been made \nwill not be developed or it will be much later.\n\n  Those are the chances. I know that is taking the dollar you could get \nnow for cheaper drugs for the promise of something better later. One \nthing drug manufacturers can point to is the promises have been made \ngood, if you look at the quality of the pharmaceuticals that we have on \nthe market today and for people whose lives are being saved and the \nquality of life that is being improved.\n  Understand what we are doing. This is not as simple as some would let \nyou believe. Understand what we are doing. We are going after the big \nbad pharmaceutical companies that are responsible for many people being \nalive today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6853-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6853-S6854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, it is difficult to know where to begin \nat this point. I feel compelled to respond to my colleague and friend \nfrom Pennsylvania, who has spoken at some length. As I listened to him \non a variety of subjects, I have changed what I was going to say a \nnumber of times.\n  Let me just start by addressing the last issue he raised about \nknowing the whole story because I believe it is incredibly important. \nWe have been trying, now, since Friday--or certainly we have been \ntrying since yesterday--to move to this legislation which is so \ncritical to lower prices of prescription drugs for everyone and also \nprovide a Medicare prescription drug benefit that is beneficial. As we \nfinally move to the bill, it is important that we understand the whole \nstory of how the industry operates today and our role as taxpayers.\n  I think we need to understand that we start with basic research. This \nyear, we as taxpayers are spending $23.5 billion that we give to the \nNational Institutes of Health for basic research. I support that. I \nwould support doing more. I think it is critical. But we do that, and \ncompanies take the information and then move it to the next level after \nwe have subsidized or paid for the research.\n  They move to the next level and do research and development \nthemselves, which is also very important. We subsidize that as well \nthrough tax writeoffs on research and development as well as \nadvertising and business costs and so on. So we participate through tax \ndeductions and credits.\n  We then allow companies that bring a product to market to have up to \na 20-year patent. That patent, then, allows them to have exclusive \nrights, without competition, so they can recover their costs, their \nresearch costs. It does cost a tremendous amount of money to bring new \ndrugs to the market. We know that. We as Americans have built in a \nsystem to make sure that that innovation is recognized. We allow \ncompanies to recoup their costs, and they are then able to bring these \nlifesaving drugs to market.\n  We then get to the end of that process, and then something else is \nsupposed to happen. The formula is supposed to be available for generic \ncompanies to be able to, in turn, manufacture the drugs and reduce the \nprices.\n  What happens today? Unfortunately, this industry, that has been \nsupported and subsidized and is making 18-percent to 20-percent profit \na year, fights every possible venue for competition. They fight \neverything. They fight generics going on the market. Sometimes they buy \nup the companies. Sometimes they just sue them to keep them off the \nmarket. They fight opening the borders to Canada which would create \nmore competition. They fight real Medicare prescription drug coverage \nthat would allow 40 million seniors and those with disabilities to be \nunder one insurance plan and be able to have the clout to get a group \ndiscount. They fight everything.\n  That is the real story: Why we are here, seeing delay after delay \nafter delay, because we see the lobbyists in that industry looking for \nevery opportunity to stop us from going forward.\n  My colleague also said we should have brought this up in the Finance \nCommittee. One of the things I learned is that if you are wrong on \nsubstance, you bring up process arguments. So we had a lot of process \narguments. Unfortunately, not one of those process arguments would buy \none prescription for one senior.\n\n  We have heard arguments about the Finance Committee. I ask my \ncolleagues: It is my understanding there has been a bill in the Finance \nCommittee for 5 years. How long is long enough? How long is long \nenough? How long do seniors in the country have to wait for Medicare \ncoverage? How long is long enough?\n  We debate on the floor skipping the Finance Committee. How about the \nsenior who is skipping supper right now? Frankly, I am more concerned \nabout that person right now. How long do people have to wait? How many \nPresidential debates and campaigns? How many congressional campaigns? \nHow long?\n  Now is the time to stop talking about process and start talking about \nreal Medicare coverage and lowering prices for everyone, so the next \ngroup of employees do not have to be told their pay is frozen so the \nemployer can pay the health care benefit; so the next round of small \nbusinesses do not see their premiums jump 30 percent, 40 percent, and \nthey have to consider dropping insurance coverage for their employees--\npredominantly because of the driving costs of prescription drugs; so \nthe manufacturers in my State do not have to struggle with this issue.\n  How long? I would suggest too long. And now is the time to do it. Now \nis the time to act. If we are operating as people of good will, we can \nwork out the process, we can work out the details. There are \nphilosophical differences--no question--about how to proceed. But if \npeople of good will want to make something happen, I believe we can and \nwe will.\n  I will have a lot more to say about the differences in the Medicare \nplans and other differences tomorrow, as we move through this debate. \nBut this evening I would like to remind Senators, again, what we are \nsupposed to be focusing on. I hope, anyway, with all due respect to \ncolleagues, that we pay attention to what is really at stake. I have \nset up a prescription drugs people's lobby through my Web site and \nasked people to share with me their stories.\n  I close with two descriptions of real-life situations that are \nhappening right now. One is from Rochelle Dodgson of Oak Park, MI. I \nwant to thank her very much. I have shared this before, but I want to \nbring us back to what this is about. She writes:\n\n       My mother is currently insured under COBRA after losing her \n     job in August of 2001. While she has her basic Medicare \n     coverage, she will lose her supplemental medical coverage in \n     January 2003. She has recently been diagnosed with multiple \n     myeloma and will require treatment for this blood disorder \n     the rest of her life. The medication she was taking before \n     this new illness costs over $500 retail on a monthly basis. I \n     have not checked the prices of the `chemo' she takes monthly \n     nor the cost of the Procrit she takes weekly. I expect her \n     monthly out of pocket expenses to be around $700 a month. Her \n     Social Security is just over $800 a month.\n\n  Her monthly out of pocket expenses are $700; her Social Security is \naround $800.\n\n       I can't imagine having to budget food and housing expenses \n     along with medication on that kind of income. My husband and \n     I will try to find a way to budget some of her medical costs \n     into our own expenses. . . .\n\n  Many families are doing this across America.\n\n     . . . but we also care for my husband's mother.\n       My mother is still a viable part of society. She doesn't \n     deserve to struggle just because she has chronic illness.\n\n  That is what this is about. It is not about procedures, and 60 votes \nversus 51 votes, and all of the other processes, objecting to \nproceeding with bills. This is what this is about.\n  Let me just share one other story. This is actually from Austin, TX. \nJackie Smith wrote through my e-mail. I am sure she shared it with \nother colleagues as well. I appreciate it. She says:\n\n       My prescriptions will cost $3,850 a month beginning August \n     15 [of this year].\n\n  Madam President, $3,850 a month for prescriptions.\n\n       That is when my COBRA benefits--which allowed me to \n     continue my health care coverage through my employer--will \n     run out. I will then qualify for Medicare with no \n     prescription drug coverage.\n       Between my disability policy benefits and Social Security \n     disability my fixed income is\n\n[[Page S6855]]\n\n     $2,000 a month. I have no idea where to turn for help.\n\n  Madam President, $2,000 a month in income, $3,850 a month in \nprescription drug costs. She describes her situation and ends by \nsaying:\n\n       Thank you so much for working for a meaningful drug \n     benefit.\n  That is what this is about. If we want to fix it, we will. We don't \nneed another campaign issue. This is about getting it done. We can do \nthat if we want to do that. We are here thanks to the leadership of our \nmajority leader who understands that it needs to be done and allocated \n2 weeks in a schedule with a lot that needs to happen. Because of the \nimportance of this issue, he said we will take 2 full weeks on this and \nwork through it. Instead of doing it on Monday or on Tuesday, it will \nbe tomorrow--Wednesday--before we start. OK. But let us get started. \nLet us get it done. If we want to do it--we have bright people on both \nsides of the aisle--we can do it. If we want to just argue process, we \ncan argue process. But this is a bill which for 5 years has been under \nconsideration by the Finance Committee. If it is not possible to get a \nmeaningful, real Medicare benefit, and we instead do it on the floor--I \nhave only been here for 1\\1/2\\ years; I have seen an awful lot of bills \nnot go through committee and go directly to the floor, an awful lot of \nthem on both sides of the aisle with both leaders of different parties. \nThe reality is that when you are not able to do what you believe needs \nto happen it frequently goes to the floor.\n  The issue is how we are going to get it done. Are we going to do what \nis long, long overdue? I believe the American people are getting tired \nof hearing us talk. They want us to get it done. I hope we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, I wish to take a moment to respond \nto some of the comments by my distinguished colleague from Michigan \nregarding the process. I agree that the process in many cases does not \nmatter. Normally, the American people do not care about process. \nInstead, they care about results. They care about their pains and their \nfamilies' pains, and they are concerned about the future.\n  But if you have a process that is a prescription for failure, then \nprocess matters. If you have a process that is set up to ensure there \nis no result, then process matters.\n  I say to my distinguished colleague from Michigan that it is easy to \nridicule concerns about the process, but when the process results in 60 \nvotes needed for passage instead of 51 votes--a process which is going \nto guarantee that we don't get a prescription drug benefit for our \nseniors, and that is exactly the situation--then process matters. If \nthe fact that we didn't go through the Finance Committee, and the fact \nthat we didn't have a markup in the Finance Committee results in a \npoint of order that sets the bar so high that we are not going to get a \nbill through, then it matters. If the process ensures that we are going \nto pass a bill with a pricetag that CBO has not even given us yet, \nperhaps in the range of $800 billion, and we send it to conference with \nthe House bill that is much, much smaller, and it assures we are not \ngoing to have a result, then process matters.\n  I would suggest that the process we have been given--for legislation \nthat provides for an enormous change in policy and the most significant \nlegislation that some of us will vote on and many of us will debate in \nour entire careers--is less than adequate because we are being given a \nbill that has not had the benefit of a markup in committee.\n\n  As an Arkansan, I have colleagues in this body who serve on the \nFinance committee who are being denied their right to have input into \nthe product that comes out. It is my understanding that members of the \nFinance Committee are ready to vote on a prescription drug bill, and \nthe votes are there; that we could send a product to the Senate floor \nright now that we could debate and use as our vehicle. But instead we \nare going to have a bill presented that no one on this side has had the \nopportunity to read and that has not yet been scored by the \nCongressional Budget Office. It is a moving target. That is no way for \nus to do significant and important legislation.\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania said he has the second highest per \ncapita senior population in the Nation. He is accurate in that, I am \nsure. But I would point out to him that in my home State, \nunfortunately, we have one of the highest percentages of low-income \nseniors per capita. This is an issue that is very important to seniors \nin Arkansas. And it is important not so we have a political issue for \nthe campaigns that are less than 4 months off. It is important because \nthere are millions of seniors who are making do with a Medicare system \nthat is out of date and that is headed towards obsolescence.\n  Medicare today was a wonderful system when it was developed in the \n1960s. But health care has changed. Insurance has changed. It would be \nlike going back to a 1960 model automobile. Prescription medicines \ntoday are an integral part of patient care. Medicare denies seniors \nthose needed drugs. These are drugs to ease the symptoms of \nParkinson's, Alzheimer's, and arthritis--drugs to control cholesterol, \nblood pressure, and to fight other life-threatening diseases such as \ncancer. Many seniors, even though they are prescribed these drugs, \nsimply go without because they cannot afford them.\n  My colleague from Michigan is right about that. Seniors are what this \ndebate is about. It is not whether or not at the end of next week, when \nall the dust has settled, we can campaign on an issue as we go into the \nelection season. It is about whether or not millions of seniors are \ngoing to get the help they need.\n  Mary McDaniel from Crossett, AR, wrote and said:\n  I am in favor of a program that promises affordable medication to all \nsenior citizens but not a Medicare pharmacy policy that may take away \nmy rights to choose my pharmacy and one that offers false promises. I \nwant to be able to get the medication my doctor prescribes and not \nsomething the Government says I can have.\n  The fact is that prescription drugs improve lives and in many cases \nthey save lives. Coverage for prescription drugs needs to be a part of \nour Medicare system.\n  The 21st Century Medicare Act--called the tripartisan bill--creates a \nprescription drug benefit which is permanent, available to all seniors, \nand does not jeopardize the stability of Medicare for future \ngenerations. That is so important.\n  What benefit are we giving our seniors if we pass a prescription drug \nbenefit that is so expensive that it is like a barnacle on the ship \nthat is the Medicare system, dragging it down to bankruptcy? A \nresponsible benefit must be one that does not jeopardize the stability \nof the system for future generations.\n  Seniors will be able, under the tripartisan bill, to voluntarily sign \nup for this prescription drug benefit, which has an affordable monthly \npremium of $24, the lowest premium of any of the prescription drug \nbills introduced so far.\n  For low-income seniors, the bill provides additional support. Madam \nPresident, 11.7 million lower income beneficiaries with incomes below \n150 percent of poverty will receive a generous subsidy for their \nprescription drug costs. Those below 135 percent of poverty will have \n80 to 98 percent of their drug costs covered with no premium at all. \nFor the State of Arkansas, that means for those beneficiaries under 135 \npercent of poverty--there are 179,378 such seniors in Arkansas out of \n453,598 total Medicare beneficiaries--these seniors will have their \nentire premiums paid for and most of their drug costs covered as well.\n  This legislation also provides catastrophic coverage to protect \nseniors against extremely high out-of-pocket drug costs that exceed \n$3,700 per year.\n  The 21st Century Medicare Act also seeks to modernize Medicare \nbenefits by allowing seniors to choose a new, enhanced benefit called \nMedicare Part E. This new benefit eliminates copays for important \npreventative health benefits such as mammograms, prostate cancer \nscreenings, bone mass measurements, and medical nutrition therapy. It \nalso streamlines hospital benefits, eliminating per-day copays and \nother limits.\n  If seniors do not like this option, they can always stick with \ntraditional Medicare. This bill does not weaken\n\n[[Page S6856]]\n\ntraditional Medicare, but it makes it better and stronger. It does not \nmake it more expensive. It does not make it less accessible.\n\n  To further ensure that seniors have choices, the 21st Century \nMedicare Act requires qualified providers of the prescription drug \nbenefit to have ``bricks and mortar'' pharmacies in their network.\n  Let me pause here to tell you just how important our Nation's \npharmacies are to seniors and to all Americans. You can give seniors \nprescription drugs, but if they don't know how to use them, they don't \nget any benefit.\n  Pharmacists play a critical role in counseling seniors and other \npatients about drug interactions and medication use in general. During \nthe debate on how to structure a Medicare prescription drug benefit, we \ncannot forget that pharmacists will play, and must play, a critical \nrole in making this a quality benefit.\n  So I am very pleased to be one of the cosponsors of the 21st Century \nMedicare Act. I intend to work to enhance the bill in regard to the \nrole of pharmacists in the future.\n  I have received, as I am sure we all have, many examples of those who \nhave written to express their support for a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. I have also heard this sentiment expressed in town meetings \nacross the State of Arkansas. During the Fourth of July recess, there \nwas no issue more on the minds of my constituents than the rising cost \nof prescription drugs and how Congress is going to deal with it.\n  Ruth Blair, from Rogers, AR, writes:\n\n       Please vote for help with prescription drugs for senior \n     citizens. We either eat or take medicine. It's a tradeoff.\n\n  That is the sad situation for millions of Americans and tens of \nthousands of Arkansans on Medicare.\n  In 2001, more than 15 million Medicare beneficiaries had no \nprescription drug coverage at all, according to the Kaiser Family \nFoundation. Almost 400 new drugs have been developed in the last decade \nalone to fight diseases such as cancer, arthritis, heart disease, and \ndiabetes. While 98 percent of employer health plans offer coverage of \nthese often lifesaving therapies, Medicare does not. That is the issue \nbefore us. That is what we must address.\n  Dorothy Adams from England, AR, writes:\n\n       Please support a prescription drug benefit. My husband and \n     I have $300 to $400 drug bills every month.\n\n  That adds up to $3,600 or $4,800 per year. Under the tripartisan \nbill, the Adams family would have 90 percent of their drug costs \ncovered after reaching $3,700 in drug costs. That is the kind of help \nwe can give.\n  We have this phantom bill that is going to be brought to the floor by \nthe Senate Democrats. It has not been scored by the Congressional \nBudget Office. We do not know what the pricetag is going to be. And \nthere are different estimates out there as to what it is going to cost.\n  The original Graham-Miller-Daschle-Kennedy bill, the temporary \nbenefit bill that was introduced, has a sunset provision. So you have a \nbenefit that is truly an illusion. It starts late and ends early.\n  The Graham-Miller bill, which is the only bill we have to analyze \nright now, establishes a prescription drug benefit for seniors, and \nthen it takes it away by terminating the benefit in 2010. That is the \ncruelest of all hoaxes. That is the ultimate use of a sensitive issue \nfor vulnerable people for political purposes. And it is no way to \nfulfill our promise to America's seniors. They do not need a benefit \nthat will disappear a few years after they sign up.\n\n  This gimmick is intended for one reason, and that is to reduce the \nprice tag of the Democrat proposal.\n  AARP has said that a prescription drug benefit should be ``a \npermanent and stable part of Medicare.'' The key word is ``permanent.'' \nThe benefit created under Graham-Miller bill is neither permanent nor a \nstable part of Medicare.\n  The Graham-Miller bill supposedly costs $450 billion over 7 years, \naccording to the bill's sponsors. But by others' calculations, the bill \ncould cost as much as $600 billion or, without the sunset, easily $1 \ntrillion.\n  A benefit that costs $600 billion over the next 10 years would \nrequire cutting 10 percent of all Government programs other than \nMedicare. That includes education, health care, and national security \nprograms. That is not responsible.\n  If we want a bipartisan bill, if we want a bill that Republicans and \nDemocrats have worked together on and have consulted on and cooperated \non--then we have a tri-partisan bill that we can vote out, and we have \nthe prospect of actually having a responsible, realistic, achievable \nprescription drug bill to give the President this year.\n  But if the House passes a partisan bill, and if the Senate leadership \ninsists that we are going to bypass the Finance Committee and bring a \npurely partisan bill to the floor of the Senate, it is a prescription \nfor doing nothing this year. I suggest that in fact--though it will \nnever be admitted--such failure is exactly what some people want to \nhappen.\n  The Graham-Miller bill is partisan and does not currently have the \nsupport of Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus. It is apparent that \nthe Graham-Miller bill could not pass out of the Finance Committee, and \nI would suggest that may be why the Finance Committee was not allowed \nto mark up a bill.\n  If the majority leader were serious about getting a prescription drug \nbill enacted into law this year, I would suggest that he would not \nbypass the Finance Committee. Is it a real accomplishment, achievement, \nthat we want, or is it an election issue for November that is sought?\n  The majority leader has, I believe, turned a blind eye to the fact \nthat there is in fact a bipartisan bill--a tripartisan bill as it is \nbeing called; it was introduced on Monday by Senators Grassley, \nJeffords, Breaux, Snowe, and Hatch--which I have cosponsored. It could \npass out of the Finance Committee today if the committee were allowed \nto bring it up.\n  If Democrats and Republicans are willing to work together, we could \nmake meaningful progress for our seniors.\n  In 1999, Republicans supported legislation based on the bipartisan \nBreaux-Thomas proposal which would have spent $60 billion over 10 years \non a Medicare prescription drug benefit. That was 1999. But Democrats \nrejected this proposal and offered a $111 billion proposal. That was in \n1999.\n  In 2000, Republicans proposed a drug benefit that would have spent \n$140 billion over 10 years on a Medicare prescription drug benefit, but \nDemocrats again rejected this proposal as inadequate and offered a $338 \nbillion proposal. That was in the year 2000.\n  In 2001, Republicans and Democrats agreed on a budget resolution \nwhich provided $300 billion for a Medicare prescription drug benefit. \nThe House of Representatives has passed a $350 billion proposal, and \nthere is a bipartisan bill in the Senate which is a $370 billion \nproposal. Yet the other side now says that is not enough.\n  I suggest that nothing will be enough because they do not want an \naccomplishment, they do not want an achievement, they do not want a \nprescription drug benefit this year. They want a campaign issue.\n  If we are serious about providing seniors with a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, in the days ahead we should look at the only \ntruly bipartisan bill that has a majority of support. Senator Grassley, \nSenator Breaux, Senator Jeffords, and others, who I have now joined as \na cosponsor, have crafted a responsible, achievable, doable \nprescription drug benefit that can be conferenced, passed, and sent to \nthe President.\n  So if we really mean it--when we say that the issue is not process, \nbut our seniors--then the time to act, on a bipartisan basis, is now, \ninstead of going down the road of a purely partisan political exercise.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6856-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6856-S6858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       21ST CENTURY MEDICARE ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, Medicare has not kept pace with the\n\n[[Page S6857]]\n\nimprovements in health care since its inception in 1965. It was a plan \nthat was put together based on the practice of medicine in 1965, which \nyou might expect to be natural for any program written at that \nparticular time. At that particular time, the practice of medicine was \nto put almost anybody in the hospital who had anything very serious \nwrong with them. Today, the practice of medicine is to keep people out \nof the hospital environment as much as we can. Prescription drugs are \nvery much a part of the medical plan to keep people out of hospitals.\n  Back in 1965, the cost of prescription drugs as part of the total \ncost of medicine was about 1 percent. Today the practice of medicine \nand the cost of medicine related to the total practice of medicine is \nabout 10, 11 percent. So quite obviously, if Medicare is to be brought \ninto the 21st century, we have to modernize it by including a \nprescription drug program for everybody, not just like it has been, \nprescription drugs for people who are in the hospital, but once you \nleave the hospital, no prescription drugs.\n  We have assumed a responsibility, some of us. I think maybe all 100 \nSenators agree on this issue, although they may not agree on how to do \nit, but we have all come to the conclusion that if you are going to \nstrengthen and improve Medicare for the 21st century, Medicare must \ninclude a prescription drug program.\n  Several of us in this body--Senators Breaux, Jeffords, Snowe, and \nHatch, and this Senator--have introduced a plan that we call the 21st \nCentury Medicare Act. To cite the most obvious example of Medicare \nbeing outdated, many conditions that used to be treated in the hospital \nare now treated with prescription drugs. For that reason, employer-\nsponsored health plans have changed with the times since 1965 and now \ncover prescription drugs. But Medicare does not cover prescription \ndrugs outside of the hospital environment.\n  Imagine that private health insurance for a long period of time has \nbeen including prescription drugs, but the Government-run Medicare \nProgram is still back there in the 1960s, not covering prescription \ndrugs.\n  There is another example of the outdated Medicare Program. The \npractice of medicine has evolved to focus on preventive benefits, since \neveryone knows that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. \nFor this reason, many private health plans have eliminated cost sharing \nfor preventive benefits. But the 1960s Medicare plan, run by the \nGovernment, has not covered preventive medicine in the same way that \nprivate health plans have by eliminating cost sharing. We still have \ncost sharing in the 1960 plan.\n  We ought to have Medicare come into the 21st century from the \nstandpoint of eliminating cost sharing for preventive benefits in order \nto make sure that we emphasize an ounce of prevention weighed against a \npound of cure.\n  There is a third example of Medicare being out of step. For those of \nus with employer-sponsored coverage--and Members of the Senate would \nfall into that category--these programs provide a limit on how much we \nwill have to spend out of pocket if we become seriously ill. Yet the \n1965 brand of Government-run health program, Medicare, offers no such \nprotection for our senior citizens.\n  I will give three examples of the 1960-era, Government-run Medicare \nplan that does not give seniors adequate protection. Most important \namong all those is not having a prescription drug program.\n\n  I could go on and on, but I would rather focus on the good news. \nThere is a compromise that can be enacted into law this year so that we \ncan finally get to the business of bringing Medicare into the 21st \ncentury; in other words, to have a Government-run Medicare Program for \nseniors that parallels the practice of medicine in the 21st century.\n  This compromise, once again, is the only bipartisan compromise inside \nthe beltway or outside the beltway. It is offered by Senators Breaux, \nSnowe, Jeffords, Hatch, and this Senator.\n  I emphasize the importance of bipartisanship. Nothing can get through \nthe Senate that is strictly Republican or strictly Democrat. The Senate \nwas meant to function for the last 214 years based on the proposition \nthat minority points of view would be protected and considered. \nConsequently, with no limit on debate, with efforts of people to stymie \nthe process, it is very essential that we work from day 1, if you want \nto get anything done, in a bipartisan way to craft a bill.\n  The five of us didn't just decide to do this. We started last summer \nto work on a prescription drug bill that could garner bipartisan \nsupport. We even announced about a year ago some basic principles, very \nbroad principles, but we immediately got to work on filling in details. \nWe had most of the details filled in back in March--not everything \nspecific, but pretty much the principles and the details filled in.\n  I suppose people are asking: Why just now has this bill been \nintroduced? We have even had some of the legislative language written a \nwhile ago.\n  Well, the reason we couldn't present our colleagues in the Senate \nthis bipartisan approach was because we had to wait for the \nCongressional Budget Office to do the scoring and also, based upon \npreliminary scoring, some fine tuning on our part. It was just over the \nweekend that we, after we did our final fine tuning, got the final \nfigures so that the bill could be put before the people of the country \nyesterday.\n  I want to mention bipartisan because obviously the President--there \nis one person there, one party--when he puts forth a proposal, it is \npartisan. There is a House Republican proposal that was passed. That is \nobviously a partisan proposal. There was a House Democrat alternative. \nIt was obviously a partisan proposal. And there is a Senate Democrat \nproposal that is obviously partisan. There is no Republican proposal, \nsomething that represents the point of view of just Republicans in the \nSenate. But there is this bipartisan plan put together by Senators \nBreaux, Snowe, Jeffords, Hatch, and myself that is the only bipartisan \nplan, and not hastily put together, as 1 year of work on it indicates.\n  Consequently, it seems to me that if the Senate majority leader had \nallowed the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction, to work \nits will--and there is a majority of the Senate Finance Committee that \nis backing this proposal--we would have something out here for the \nSenate to consider, a bipartisan proposal.\n  That doesn't prove it would get 60 votes, but it has to be further \ndown the road to accomplishing that very important goal than any of the \nproposals here in Washington, DC. Any coverage will have to be a \ncompromise, a beginning. It is not something perfect.\n  I applaud Senator Baucus for seeking a reasonable compromise that can \npass the Finance Committee. He has held a lot of rump sessions to \ndiscuss these things and understand them. But we have not had the \nopportunity to have the formal session to actually debate and amend and \nvote out a compromise. So after working on this for over a year, I can \nsay this bill is that compromise. This level of total spending--$350 \nbillion--is the level that can gain a majority of the votes in the \nSenate Finance Committee. In moving it up some to satisfy some people, \nor moving it down to a lower figure to satisfy some other people, it \nbegins to lose votes from the high end or from the low end.\n  Nobody, including me, considers this a perfect plan, but it is the \nonly deal that can be struck, and it is the only bipartisan proposal in \nWashington, DC. I urge Senator Daschle to allow the Finance Committee \nto work on my bill. Let any Senator, in a free exchange and \nconsideration in the Senate Finance Committee, offer amendments. That \nis the only way to have a product that can get 60 votes.\n  As I have already written to Senator Daschle, to bypass the Senate \nFinance Committee when it can put out a bipartisan project is probably \nto kill any chance of a drug bill, and I hope he will reconsider.\n  Let me be very candid. Drug spending by the senior population is \nexploding. The cost between the bill a year ago, when we started, until \nnow--as I said, it evolved over 12 months--has gone up $70 billion, but \nnot because we as Senators working on this bipartisan compromise \ndecided we wanted to spend $70 billion more, no; that is the way the \ndrug market is today. So if Senator Daschle wants an issue instead of a \nprogram for seniors, then we come back next year, and it doesn't matter \nwho controls the Senate. We will come\n\n[[Page S6858]]\n\nback next year and we are going to spend another $70 billion to $100 \nbillion more. Why don't we decide to put that money into the program \nand save it by adopting something right now, when we know, based upon \nthe projections of prescription drugs, what is going to happen.\n  Let me suggest to you that the passage of strong legislation is going \nto be a damper on those exploding drug prices. So we have an \nopportunity and, if we miss it, it is going to cost Medicare a \ntremendous amount of money. Maybe $100 billion is a little bit high, \nbut $70 billion to $80 billion to $90 billion would not be out of the \nrealm of possibility. And we should also do it now so that baby boomers \nwho have these good corporate plans they want to retire on are not \nshocked with a big difference between what 1965 Medicare is and what \nthey have. They won't have to go through that if we have this \nbipartisan plan that gives seniors an option of having a new and \nimproved and strengthened Medicare plan that is much closer to what \nthey have now in the world of work.\n  The baby boomers are going to start to retire in only 8 years. So a \nnew drug benefit could be incredibly expensive and could even put the \nexisting Medicare Program at risk. In light of these facts, the truth \nis that we cannot afford an extravagant benefit. If we get to work and \nget it done now, it is not going to be so expensive.\n  The other main component of the bill that I have already made some \nreference to is a new, enhanced Medicare option, and it is not \nsomething seniors have to take if they don't want to. If they want to \nkeep what they have right now, they can keep it, but if they want \nsomething a little closer to what they have in the private sector, they \nwill have that available.\n\n  I talked about Medicare or a prescription drug program, but there is \na new and enhanced Medicare option that reflects 21st century health \ncare. The enhanced option removes all cost sharing on preventive \nbenefits. Just think. If somebody under the present Medicare has an \nopportunity to take a prostate cancer test, and they have a 20-percent \ncopay, and they, say: ``I just cannot afford it,'' or ``I don't want to \npay that copay,'' you are going to discourage that person from taking \nthat test. And one out of three men might need an operation to catch it \nahead of time so that cancer hasn't spread. No copay. That is more apt \nto be. That is an ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure. It brings \nMedicare into the 21st century. It adds protection against devastating \ncosts due to serious illness. It features a single deductible of $300 \nand a rational cost sharing rather than the irrational cost sharing in \nthe existing fee-for-service system. It offers new, cheaper Medigap \noptions. And with the improved coverage, beneficiaries might decide \nthey don't need to buy Medigap at all.\n  This would create a tremendous savings for them and, potentially, for \nMedicare. The enhanced options resemble what beneficiaries had when \nthey were still working, and they might decide to take it. But this is \nall entirely voluntary. We don't say to a single senior citizen in \nAmerica that they have to do this. It is their choice. If they like \nwhat they already have, what has been on the books since 1965, they can \nhave it.\n  The cost of our reform provisions--this new and improved and enhanced \nMedicare--is only $30 billion over 10 years.\n  Now, the AARP held a news conference today. Everyone around here \nknows that Senator Daschle's partisan approach cannot lead to 60 votes \nand can only lead to deadlock. Failure is not acceptable to the people \nof Iowa and it is not acceptable to me.\n  Let me comment on the substance of my bill, the 21st Century Medicare \nAct. The drug benefit we offer is a voluntary benefit with affordable \npremiums of $24 a month. Unlike some proposals, it will provide drugs \nin a cost-effective manner, which is crucial. It will protect all \nseniors with drug costs, with special protections for low-income \nbeneficiaries and those who incur very high costs. By law, at least two \nplans will be available everywhere in America, including rural areas, \nwhich is so important to me.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells me that virtually all \nbeneficiaries will find this drug benefit a good deal and will elect to \ntake it. In fact, when you hear people demanding that ``Cadillac'' drug \ncoverage be added to Medicare, what that tells you is that person \ndoesn't really want legislation to pass. They just want an issue on \nwhich to campaign.\n\n  I have been very surprised and somewhat disappointed at the recent \nactivity of the AARP on this issue. They ran ads this past weekend and \nthey held a news conference today supporting the bill that Senator \nDaschle, we are told, plans to bring to the floor. In the same breath, \nthey say they want a drug benefit that is permanent. They should make \nup their minds because Senator Daschle's bill is not permanent. That is \nbecause making it permanent would reveal how unaffordable it is. It is \ndifficult to understand why they are sowing such confusion on the \nissue. Do they believe we should sunset the Medicare Program as a \nwhole, as that bill does? I do not think we are going to sunset senior \ncitizens. When the prescription drug program ends in 2009 or 2010, do \nthey think the senior citizens of America are not going to need \nprescription drugs the next day? I hope AARP's members will tell \nSenator Daschle that is quite ludicrous, and they would be right.\n  Believe it or not, my bill--I should not say ``my bill'' because I \nhave never had the pleasure of working with so many politically \ndifferent people as Senator Hatch, Senator Snowe, Senator Breaux, \nSenator Jeffords, and myself--I am different, too. Over the course of a \nyear, we had give and take by people with so many different political \nphilosophies, bringing us to where we are with this bill. So many times \nalong the way we thought everything would fall apart, but we would come \nback together because people of good will working together can get \nthings done.\n  That same good will is on the Senate Finance Committee if we just \nhave an opportunity to work the will of the committee. But we have \nproduced a product--and I said I am embarrassed it was this Monday; it \ncould just as well have been May 1, but we just could not get the \nCongressional Budget Office to score the bill. Maybe it is legitimate. \nIt is a whole new Government program. They had to take into \nconsideration putting people on board. I suppose CBO had to do a lot of \neducation of their own staff. All I can say is, it is here, and it is \nnot here too late.\n  Believe it or not, this bill is the only true bipartisan bill in all \nof Washington, DC, to add a drug benefit to Medicare. If ever there was \nan issue where true bipartisanship was needed, it is in this bill, it \nis needed beyond the authors of this bill to the entire body, and we \ncan get something done this year rather than wait next year to spend \nanother $100 billion more with the costs rising.\n  In short, the bipartisan 21st Century Medicare Act is the reasonable, \npragmatic approach that can work even in an election year if Senator \nDaschle wants us to do it.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be brief. The Senator from Utah has \nbeen waiting for some time. I am not going to talk long in this regard, \nbut I say to my friend from Iowa, for whom I have the deepest respect--\nI consider him a friend and a fine Senator--that AARP supports Graham-\nMiller because it is good legislation. I do not think anyone could ever \nconsider the AARP as some wild-like liberal group. They are very \ncareful with the legislation they sign on to.\n  I also say to my friend from Iowa, it is too bad we had not been able \nto start debating his amendment and other amendments earlier. Every \ntime we bring a bill up, we have to fight to get it on the floor, but \nwe are going to continue to do that. As on the other bills I listed \nearlier today which we had to fight to pass, we are going to work hard \non this bill. We are going to pass prescription drug legislation \nbecause it is necessary we do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6858-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6858-S6860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  2002 NATIONAL PEACE ESSAY CONTEST SOUTH DAKOTA WINNER, JESSICA HICKS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am honored today to present to my \ncolleagues in the Senate an essay by Jessica Hicks of Rapid City, SD. \nJessica is a student at St. Thomas More High\n\n[[Page S6859]]\n\nSchool and she is the National Peace Essay Contest winner for South \nDakota. ``Taking the Middle Ground: The Role of the Military in \nInternational Peacekeeping With Focus on Rwanda and Bosnia'' is a call \nto U.S. leaders to seek an active American role in international \npeacekeeping that never loses sight of our national security interests. \nJessica has tackled a vitally important subject with compassion, \nrealism, and maturity. I can only hope that she continues to share her \nwisdom with the world, and I commend her essay to my colleagues' \nattention.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Jessica Hicks' essay be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Taking the Middle Ground: The Role of the U.S. Military in \n       International Peacekeeping With Focus on Rwanda and Bosnia\n\n                           (By Jessica Hicks)\n\n       ``Never doubt that a small group of deeply committed \n     citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing \n     that ever has'' (qtd. Mead). The U.S. military is composed of \n     a group of ``committed citizens'' that works to serve the \n     U.S. and its interests. As of late, the U.S.'s interests have \n     turned to international conflicts and peacekeeping. \n     International peacekeeping involves outside countries aiding \n     in stabilizing an area through mediation, presence, and \n     humanitarian aid. The military's role in international \n     peacekeeping has often been called into question. Many feel \n     that the U.S. military should only work to end conflict and \n     to ensure peace in areas of interest to the U.S. Others \n     believe that the U.S. should take an isolationist approach \n     toward peacekeeping, with the focus of the military on \n     protecting U.S. borders.\n       Critics may not agree, but the U.S. military does have an \n     important role in international peacekeeping, a role that was \n     especially apparent during the 1990s. During this decade, \n     genocide occurred in Rwanda and Bosnia. In Bosnia, the U.S. \n     military took an active part in peacekeeping efforts (``Why \n     the Troops Should Go''), whereas in Rwanda, the U.S. did not \n     contribute to the United Nation's (UN) initial peacekeeping \n     mission (Onumah). In the next decade, the U.S. military \n     should follow a ``middle ground'' policy in international \n     matters, so as to be able to maintain national security and \n     to participate in peacekeeping (Hull 77).\n       The Rwandan genocide that occurred in 1994 was a result of \n     past tensions (Goble). In 1919, Belgium colonized Rwanda, \n     whose majority population is composed of two ethnic groups, \n     the Hutus and the Tutsis (Freeman 16). Belgian colonizers \n     increased differences between the two groups by issuing \n     ethnic identity cards and placing the Tutsis in high \n     government positions, though the Hutus were in the majority \n     (Prunier 28).\n       Frustrated by their lack of power, the Hutus overthrew the \n     monarchy of Rwanda in 1959 (Giles 59). As a result of this \n     change of power, many Tutsis were killed, and approximately \n     200,000 became refugees in neighboring countries \n     (``Rwanda''). In 1962, Rwanda gained independence from \n     Belgium, and the Hutus gained control of the government \n     (Iliffe 251). In 1973, Habyarimana, a Hutu general, became \n     president of Rwanda. His attempts to include minority parties \n     in the government were unpopular with Hutu extremists \n     (Prunier 74-75).\n       Meanwhile, the exiled Tutsis created the Rwandan Patriotic \n     Front (RPF), an army rebel group. In 1990, the RPF launched a \n     civil war against the Hutus (Giles 59). The United Nations \n     Assistance Mission to Rwanda (UNAMIR) was sent in to support \n     Habyarimana's plan to share power with minorities (Shawcross \n     21). However, tensions between the Hutus and the Tutsis \n     continued to increase, and in 1994, Hutu extremists shot down \n     Habyarimana's airplane. Beginning in April of that year and \n     continuing over the next three months, 800,000 Tutsis and \n     moderate Hutus were killed in a genocide by the Hutus \n     (Shawcross 21). The genocide ended in July, 1994, when the \n     Tutsis regained control of the government. As a result, about \n     two million Hutus left Rwanda, becoming refugees \n     (``Rwanda''). When the killing began, most of the UNAMIR \n     troops left Rwanda, and the genocide continued practically \n     unrestrained by foreign influence (Goble). Although the \n     U.S. sent humanitarian aid to Rwanda, it neglected to \n     contribute much needed troops to initial UN peacekeeping \n     efforts (Onumah).\n       The response of the U.S. military was different in Bosnia. \n     Bosnia's tensions largely began with the creation of \n     Yugoslavia after the First World War (Fromkin 135). Three \n     ethnic groups have traditionally existed in Bosnia: the \n     Croats, the Serbs, and the Muslims (Borden 16). Bosnia was \n     part of communist Yugoslavia in the 1980s, and declared its \n     independence in 1992 (Dragnich 192). Bosnian Serbs set out to \n     create a ``greater Serbia'' by means of ethnic cleansing \n     (Allen 44). In 1992, the UN responded by imposing naval \n     blockades and trade sanctions on the former Yugoslavia \n     (Ricchiardi 59). Croats and Muslims fought each other, as \n     well as the Serbs. The United Nations unsuccessfully created \n     six ``safe havens'' (protected cities) for the Muslims and \n     the Croats in 1993 (Donia and Fine 243).\n       The U.S. helped to reduce the ethnic groups' fighting by \n     mediating the signing of a peace agreement between the Croats \n     and the Muslims in 1994 (``Fact Sheet: Human Rights Issues . \n     . .''). Finally after atrocities committed by both sides, \n     peace was reached in 1995, when, with the U.S.'s help the \n     warring groups agreed to peace (to end war) in Dayton, Ohio \n     (``Bosnia and Herzegovina''). To aid in peacekeeping, NATO \n     sent in 60,000 troops as part of ``multinational military \n     Implementation Force'' (IFOR) with U.S. soldiers comprising \n     one-third of the troops (``Why the Troops Should Go''). The \n     U.S. provided appropriate peacekeeping measures in Bosnia \n     through mediation, presence, and humanitarian aid. Today, a \n     reduced number of troops continues to remain in Bosnia to aid \n     in keeping peace (Burg and Shoup 387).\n       The U.S. military has a vital role in international \n     peacekeeping. Because of U.S. military influence, U.S. \n     military involvement is critical to the success of \n     peacekeeping efforts (Fromkin 49). The U.S. has access to \n     resources that are essential to the peacekeeping process. In \n     Rwanda, the U.S. initially did not want to be involved, and \n     did not contribute troops, thus delaying peace in Rwanda \n     (Jenish 24). In Bosnia, the U.S. military successfully worked \n     through NATO to provide peacekeeping forces (Burg and Shoup \n     377-379). However, the U.S. should not dominate the \n     peacekeeping process. A ``middle ground'' must be found in \n     foreign policy. The ``middle ground'' policy involves the \n     U.S.'s contributing military troops and aid, in cooperation \n     with the UN, NATO, and other countries (Hull 77).\n       The U.S. military must determine whether its involvement is \n     necessary in foreign conflicts. International peacekeeping \n     turns the U.S. military away from its primary duty to protect \n     the American borders and people. The U.S. must determine if \n     the results of the conflict will affect its interests, such \n     as national security (Fromkin 168). The U.S. military \n     recognized that unrest in Bosnia could eventually cause \n     conflict in Europe, whose stability is vital to the U.S. \n     (``Why the Troops Should Go'').\n       However, the U.S. also sends in military based on its \n     ideals, such as recognition of a need for peace and stability \n     (Fromkin 171). The U.S. has been accused of not being \n     consistent in its involvement in international \n     peacekeeping, and of becoming involved only when benefits \n     are apparent for the U.S. The U.S. became involved in \n     Bosnia partially because civilians felt that great \n     injustices were occurring, and that peace was needed \n     (Vulliamy 118).\n       Over the next decade, the U.S. military needs to continue \n     aiding in international peacekeeping. However, a ``middle \n     ground'' policy is a necessity when dealing with \n     international matters. By maintain a ``middle ground'' \n     policy, the U.S. can sustain a sufficient force at home for \n     national security purposes (Hull 78). The U.S. military can \n     also work with the UN, other countries, and regional \n     organizations in peacekeeping. By taking the middle course, \n     the U.S. military will be able to do its part in \n     international affairs, while still protecting the American \n     people.\n       In cooperation with the UN, the U.S. can work to provide \n     mediation, presence, and material aid. Mediation was \n     important in solving the Bosnia conflict. The U.S. helped \n     arrange to have Bosnian leaders meet in Dayton, Ohio, acting \n     as a mediator at the peace talks (Burg and Shoup 408). The \n     U.S. can contribute military troops to the UN forces to help \n     local officials maintain peace. The U.S. military can help \n     ensure that minority groups are not threatened. As \n     illustrated in Rwanda, the U.S.'s hesitancy to send troops to \n     aid the UN forces in 1994 prevented the cessation of the \n     genocide in its early stages (``Rwanda Revisited: A Look Back \n     . . .''. Regional organizations should be utilized or \n     established to help in peacekeeping actions, such as the \n     distribution of humanitarian aid (Hull 93). When such \n     organizations are not employed, aid can be misdirected, as in \n     Rwanda, where corruption prevented appropriate distribution \n     (``Humanitarian Efforts Threatened . . .''). Regional \n     organizations are at the ground level of the problem, and, \n     therefore, know who needs aid. Misappropriations of aid, as \n     in Rwanda, can thus be avoided. These actions of mediation, \n     presence, and material aid will be vital in the next decade.\n       The U.S. military has an important role in international \n     peacekeeping, which was especially apparent in the 1990s. The \n     U.S. military took an active part in Bosnian peacekeeping \n     efforts. In Rwanda, however, the U.S. military failed to help \n     in initial peacekeeping actions. The U.S. military should \n     have a ``middle ground'' policy in dealing with international \n     peacekeeping. This policy would allow the U.S. to maintain \n     national security and to be active in international \n     peacekeeping efforts. Because of the complicated nature of \n     peacekeeping, the U.S. goals may not always be realized; but \n     U.S. involvement is imperative for peace. As Theodore \n     Roosevelt said, ``. . . the man who really counts in the \n     world is the doer, not the mere critic--the man who actually \n     does the work, even if roughly and imperfectly, not the man \n     who only talks or writes about how it ought to be done.'' The \n     U.S. military aspires to take on this role in international \n     peacekeeping.\n\n\n                              Works Cited\n\n       Allen, Beverly.

Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to the \nplight of the people of Colombia. For decades they have been plagued by \nthe scourges of drugs, war, and terrorism. Today, thousands, if not \nmillions of Colombians live under constant threat of attack by leftist \nguerrillas and right-wing paramilitary groups. However, in the recent \nelections the Colombian people overwhelmingly voted to bring the forces \nof terror and violence to their knees.\n  In support of their fight against terror, I believe it is the \nresponsibility of our great Nation to offer its unwavering moral \nsupport to the people of Colombia and their democratically elected \nleaders. Since President Monroe first offered a vision for our Nation's \ninvolvement in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has been the \nguarantor of peace and democracy for all the peoples of the Americas. \nThis is a tradition we must continue.\n  Consequently, it is time for us as a Nation to explore further \nextending our support, both moral and physical to the cause of \ndeveloping the institutes of justice and governance in Colombia. In \ndoing so, we help the Colombians achieve a better way of life and \nfurther our own fight against the forces of global terror.\n  In closing, we should not forego this opportunity to help a neighbor \nand an ally. I offer my firmest support to the people of Colombia and \ntheir fight to eradicate terrorists and criminals in their own country.\n  Mr. John Norton Moore is a distinguished professor of law and is the \nDirector of the Center for National Security Law at the University of \nVirginia. He has written thoughtfully on this matter. I found his \nremarks to be highly valuable and wish to share them with the Senate. \nTherefore, I ask unanimous consent that an article written by Professor \nMoore be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Ending Terrorism in Colombia\n\n                         (By John Norton Moore)\n\n       The people of Colombia, after years of negotiation with the \n     forces of terror, have courageously voted for their own war \n     on terrorism. For almost four decades, the people of Colombia \n     have been beset with drug lords, old-thinking leftists, and \n     paramilitaries waging war against their democracy and their \n     humanity. Every year in that war a much smaller country than \n     the United States loses more people than were killed in 9/11. \n     Kidnapping runs rampant and the force of law is held hostage \n     to the law of force. It is time for the World to notice \n     Colombia's plight and to join with them to decisively end the \n     terror.\n       Why should the United States and others help? Simply \n     because unchecked terrorism left free to ravage democracies \n     anywhere ultimately affects us all. Simply because the drug \n     business in Colombia will never be tamed without an end to \n     the armies of terror it feeds. Simply because economic \n     development in Latin America and an extension of hemispheric \n     trade requires the rule of law. Simply because a decisive \n     hemispheric victory over terrorism in Colombia will have \n     powerful deterrent legs in the global war against terrorism. \n     Simply because the people and democracies of Latin America \n     matter. And simply because, as the people of Colombia have \n     just attested, four decades of terror is enough.\n       How can the United States help? Visualizing the ghost of \n     Vietnam, the body politic in the United States has been \n     reluctant to become directly involved in what many see as a \n     domestic struggle in Colombia. Human rights abuses from all \n     sides have further discouraged assistance. Political \n     consensus has only permitted an increased program of aid said \n     to be directed at the war on drugs. Even in a post 9/11 \n     World, it is unlikely that the American body politic wants an \n     Afghan style American military presence on the ground in \n     Colombia. Moreover, America has a full plate in the fight on \n     terror at present, and an important agenda for peace in the \n     Palestinian/Israeli dispute and now the India/Pakistan \n     dispute. But the alternative is not, and has never been, \n     simply a U.S. military presence in Colombia or terror as \n     usual.\n       The United States should take the lead in consultations \n     with the new leadership of Colombia and the Organization of \n     American States to put together a powerful Inter-American \n     coalition under the Rio Treaty to decisively and permanently \n     restore the reach of democracy over all of Colombia. The Rio \n     Treaty, as the security arm of the Inter-American system, \n     preceded NATO and, indeed, NATO was largely modeled on it. \n     The Inter-American system as a whole has as a central purpose \n     the protection of democracy and human dignity throughout the \n     region. The Rio Treaty pledges the collective action of all \n     of the American states to deal with threats to the peace to \n     those ends. It is time to put that system to the test.\n       To be successful such as Inter-American effort would need \n     the full agreement and cooperation of the new Colombian \n     Government. In addition, it must be designed to field an \n     overwhelming response against terror on all fronts and to \n     prevail decisively and promptly. To do this would likely \n     require a sophisticated package with major ground units from \n     leading Latin American states, logistics, technological and \n     intelligence assistance from the United States, a substantial \n     package of economic aid, perhaps coordinated from Nations \n     around the World, and a vigorous human rights effort to \n     accompany the necessary military action. The action should \n     also be coordinated with the United Nations Security Council \n     even though as a matter of international law Colombia has \n     every right simply to request assistance from any nation or \n     the organization of American States to deal with its problem \n     of terror. Further, the action should properly be placed in \n     the global war on terror. Once the plan for overwhelming \n     response has been adopted under the Rio Treaty, a requirement \n     experience shows will lessen casualties on all sides, then \n     the groups in Colombia resisting the rule of law should be \n     given an opportunity to turn over their weapons and \n     unconditionally accept democratic rule from the properly \n     elected Colombia officials. If the perpetrators of terror \n     refuse, the Inter-American plan should be carried out \n     promptly and decisively to restore the rule of law and \n     democracy throughout the proud nation of Colombia.\n       For many years I have heard brave representatives from \n     Colombia describing the daily terror in their country. I have \n     listened to the stories of car bombs, kidnappings, and a \n     rural judiciary that had to wear running shoes to Court in \n     order to be able to jump out of the window and run when the \n     terrorist arrived. It is time to put those running shoes on \n     those who challenge the rule of law.\n\n[[Page S6861]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6860-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6860-S6861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FUTURE OF ANTI-TERRORIST COOPERATION IN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I rise to express my support \nfor the accounting reform bill and the underlying goals of the \nlegislation. I wholeheartedly endorse the principles expressed in this \nbill to root out corruption in our accounting industry.\n  The need for this bill is enormous. The accounting scandals that have \nrocked this Nation over the past nine months have shaken Americans' \nfaith in our free market system. We simply cannot allow this attack at \nthe bedrock of our economic system to pass unanswered. Those who have \npropagated corporate greed, those who have engaged in unethical \nbusiness practices, and those who have willingly and knowingly turned a \nblind eye must be punished.\n  Moreover, we need to assure all Americans that they can and should \nhave faith in American business. The loss of confidence caused by a \nlack of accountability has caused nearly as much damage as the economic \nimpact of these surfacing scandals.\n  The perpetrators of these scandals are certainly in the forefront of \nour minds as we have debated this legislation. But, in the end, this \nbill is not about those who have violated the trusts of their employees \nand shareholders. This bill is really about those employees and \nshareholders who have been violated, it's about average Americans who \nare now being penalized and disadvantaged because of the corporate \ngreed of a privileged few. And it is about those honest accountants \nwhose integrity and profession have been scarred by a few dishonest \nindividuals.\n  I need look no further than my home State of Nebraska to see the \nhuman aspect of these fraudulent accounting practices. Before it merged \nwith Houston Natural Gas in 1985, InterNorth, the forerunner of Enron, \nwas based in Omaha. In the year following the merger, the newly named \nEnron relocated to Houston, but it still had roots in Nebraska as well \nas thousands of InterNorth retirees.\n  Those retirees and employees have seen their lives turned upside down \nby the accounting trickery perpetrated by those at the top. Many have \nseen their retirement accounts evaporate while others have lost their \njobs.\n  Not only has their trust been violated by the actions of Enron \nexecutives, they also have to witness the apparent disinterest of the \naccountants who were obliged to ensure honesty and integrity in \nbookkeeping. With the livelihoods and savings of tens of thousands on \nthe line, a handful of accountants failed to do their duty.\n  When I was governor of Nebraska, we had a period of upswing in the \ndistribution of dangerous drugs. In response, we stiffened penalties in \nour omnibus crime legislation. The same principle applies here. When \nthere is an upswing in criminal and unethical behavior, we have to get \ntough.\n  Corporate greed is a scourge on Americans and those who are \nparticipating in it should be paying the price.\n  This legislation will ensure they do pay a price commiserate with the \npain they have inflicted upon the American people.\n  I'd like to thank my colleague Senator Sarbanes for his tireless work \non this bill. His efforts to crack down on unethical accounting \npractices are greatly appreciated.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. \nThrough this legislation, we can move away from the failures of the \npast, begin to restore investor confidence, help return to our strong \neconomy and prove that a few bad seeds cannot bring down our great \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6861-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred August 1, \n2001 in Roanoke, VA.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of H. Con. \nRes. 378, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent on July 12, \n2002. This resolution commends the District of Columbia National Guard, \nthe National Guard Bureau, and the entire Department of Defense for the \nassistance provided to the United States Capitol Police and the entire \ncongressional community in response to the terrorist and anthrax \nattacks of September and October 2001.\n  I would like to thank all of those who worked tirelessly for almost \nfive months in response to the heightened state of emergency in the \nCapitol complex following the terrorist and anthrax attacks of \nSeptember and October 2001.\n  We owe so much to the over 140 members of the District of Columbia \nArmy National Guard, specifically the 260th Military Police Command, \nthe 260th Regional Training Institute, the 74th Troop Command, the \nHeadquarters District Area Regional Command, and the 33rd Civil Support \nTeam, who answered the call to duty to assist the Capitol Police in \nprotecting the Capitol complex. We here in the Capitol saw firsthand \nthe cooperation between the National Guard and the Capitol Police. This \ntime presented a challenging assignment for all involved, and the \ncombined efforts of these two agencies served as a model for managing \nsuch a difficult situation.\n  Because of these men and women, we were protected around the clock \nand the activities in the Capitol were secure. Members of Congress, \ncongressional employees, and visitors were confident of their safety \nhere, and we were able to continue to serve the American people.\n  The dedication of the District of Columbia National Guard came at a \nprice. These men and women worked an extreme number of hours under \ndifficult conditions. The time they spent in order to serve their \ncountry was time away from their loved ones, and we are grateful for \nthe personal sacrifices they made for our nation.\n  During the course of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln came to \nWashington as the new president. The States began to divide into the \nConfederacy and the Union. When he arrived, this Capitol dome which you \nsee outside was under construction. Many people went to the President \nand said: Mr. President, we can't afford to wage a war and build this \nCapitol dome. He said: ``Yes, we can, because that Capitol dome \nrepresents the unity of this country and what we will be after this \nwar.'' During the Civil War, he continued the construction of that \ngreat dome we see today. And Lincoln was right.\n  The National Guard protected not only the people within the Capitol \ncomplex, but the complex itself and the unity, liberty, and freedom it \nrepresents. I am honored to support this resolution commending the work \nof the District of Columbia National Guard, the National Guard Bureau, \nand the entire Department of Defense, and I extend my personal \ngratitude for their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6861-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6861-S6862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN MEMORY OF THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF FRANCES RILEY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

As a \nHouse member from 1985 to 1998, Fran co-founded the Legislature for \nLimited Spending and was a valued member of the Manchester Federation \nRepublican Woman's Club. She demonstrated an unyielding respect, not \nonly for her position but for the positions of her colleagues as well. \nThis was an important principle from which Fran never faltered, \nsolidifying her role as a first-rate political official.\n  Riley is survived by her husband, Paul; their three daughters, \nKatherine James, Christine Riley, and Karen Godzyk, one brother, one \nsister, and four grandchildren.\n  Frances Riley had been a resident and active member of the Manchester \ncommunity since she arrived there in 1957.

Mr. President, I rise today among my colleagues \nto pay tribute to Susy Aparicio of Lexington, Kentucky. Last week, in \nwhat will surely be a giant step for Lexington's Latino community, Mrs. \nAparicio officially opened Biblioteca Hispana to the public.\n  Susy Aparicio, a native of Ecuador, and her husband, a native of \nBolivia, met while they were both students at the University of \nKentucky in the late 1970s. After a short stint in Bolivia, Susy and \nher husband returned to Lexington. Throughout their time living in \nKentucky, they have taken notice of the severe deficiency of books, \nmagazines and newspapers available in Spanish. The public library \noffers a few options, but transportation and language issues serve as \nunavoidable obstacles to many Spanish-speaking residents. Although both \nSusy and her husband understand the importance of their children \nlearning and mastering the English language, they still prefer that \ntheir children and their children's children grow up with access to \nresources published in their native language. For nearly two decades, \nMrs. Aparicio has dreamed of opening a library where the Hispanic \ncommunity could have easy access to various reading materials in \nSpanish. This dream has now become a reality.\n  Using a grant from the Partners for Youth Foundation, Susy organized \na collection of about 400 books and audio and videotapes, mostly geared \ntowards children. Eventually, Susy would like to obtain more funding to \nexpand the library to include more adult-oriented books and offer \nstorytelling, tutorial and family-literacy programs. She hopes this \nproject will provide an adequate gateway for the Latino community to \nrevel in its rich culture.\n  America is a diverse land full of differences in opinion, prayer and \nlanguage. While I firmly believe that to succeed in America one must \nfully embrace the English language, at the same time the new arrivals \nto America should be sure to remember and celebrate their traditional \nroots. Diversity has always been and will remain to be one of this \nnation's greatest strengths.\n  Mrs. Aparicio has worked extremely hard for the Hispanic community in \nLexington, and in the end, Biblioteca Hispana will be a place where \nfuture generations can take their children to learn about their \nancestry and where they came from.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6862-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ATOMIC VETERANS\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge President \nReagan's designation of July 16 as National Atomic Veterans' Day.\n  Between 1945 and 1963, the United States conducted over 235 \natmospheric nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific and the American \nSouthwest. At least 220,000 American servicemembers participated in \nthese tests, or were stationed near Hiroshima and Nagasaki immediately \nfollowing World War II.

For 50 years, these veterans have been \none of the most neglected groups, even though they risked their lives \nfor our freedom.\n  Despite their valuable contributions to the United States, these \nveterans have not received the recognition they deserve.

Mr. President, on April 26, 2002, I had the \nopportunity to attend the 10th annual ArtTable Luncheon. ArtTable is a \nnational organization for professional women in leadership positions in \nthe visual arts. Founded in 1981, it provides a forum for its members \nto exchange ideas, experience and information through various programs. \nArtTable is dedicated to promoting and advancing greater knowledge, \nunderstanding, and appreciation of the visual arts. At each year's \nluncheon, a different woman who has given her distinguished service is \nhonored. The keynote speaker on this occasion was Dr. Kirk Varnedoe, \nChief Curator of the Department of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum \nof Modern Art and Professor in Historical Studies at the Institute for \nAdvanced Study, Princeton University.\n  Dr. Varnedoe has more than a dozen major exhibitions to his credit, \nboth for the Museum of Modern Art and for other institutions. His work \nhas often been at the forefront of the history of modern art and his \nextensive publications on European and North American art of the \nnineteenth and twentieth centuries have helped reshape and open up a \nvariety of fields in art history. His contributions began in 1972, at \nthe age of 25, with his doctoral dissertation on the drawings of Rodin \nand the epidemic problem of forgeries of the later drawings. This work \nwas so significant that its results were published in collaboration \nwith Albert Elsen before the dissertation had even been submitted. His \nscholarship since that time has been instrumental in opening entire \nfields of inquiry, for example, Impressionism, Scandinavian modernism, \nand the influence of photography on painting, as well as bringing \nlittle known artists into the center of debate.\n  In his remarks at the luncheon, which I will ask be printed in the \nRecord, Dr. Varnedoe spoke eloquently about his ``personal odyssey with \nthe art of Auguste Rodin'' and the greater issues that journey brought \nto life. He discussed the ever-changing world of modern art and what it \ncan teach us, especially during this incredibly challenging period of \nhistory through which we are living.\n  I am grateful to Dr. Varnedoe for his continued scholarship efforts \nin the area of art history and for sharing this history with us in a \nway that we can apply it to our experiences in the world today.\n  I ask that the remarks be printed in the Record.\n\n                            ArtTable Keynote\n\n                             April 26, 2002\n\n                           (By Kirk Varnedoe)\n\n       I have had a personal odyssey with the art of Auguste \n     Rodin. It's a love that I share--along with a great regard \n     for her late husband Bernie--with Iris Cantor. Rodin was once \n     for me an intense and special passion, a singular entry point \n     into the history of art. And now, that body of work seems \n     somehow seen at a distance, more coolly, and that artist one \n     among many with whom I've worked, and from whom I've taken \n     inspiration. Today, I would like to take that small and \n     really trivial personal trajectory into and through Rodin and \n     ruminate on it in relationship to a larger pattern: to use it \n     to think about the way that the modern tradition metes out \n     its gains and losses, the way it gives and takes; and then \n     also to use my little journey to suggest much larger issues \n     about learning and growth--about what we want from art as we \n     change and learn.\n       Modern art, as is notorious, kills, and it kills \n     mercilessly. In the late 19th Century as it was just being \n     born it laid waste to the Salon world of Gerome and \n     Bougureau. And then as it built up steam in the early 20th \n     Century it decided to start slaying some of its own parents \n     and godparents. After World War II modern art killed Rodin \n     like a bright young barbarian gladiator taking down an aging, \n     opulently garlanded emperor--in sheer exhaustion at the \n     achievement of Rodin's weight and complexity, people found \n     themselves gagged to surfeit by the ancienne cuisine richness \n     of this enormous oeuvre, and yearned for a leaner, cleaner \n     psychic and physical life in art. That is perhaps exemplified \n     most pointedly by the beautiful polished surfaces of \n     Brancusi's sculpture. Where once Rodin's flesh roiled \n     volcanically, now you had a still-waters-run-deep beautiful \n     gleam, more like armor than palping flesh; compression/\n     density replaced extension/elasticity;\n\n[[Page S6863]]\n\n     wit and elegance took over for brooding and suffering; and \n     abbreviated, pithy economic certainties were set up against \n     the older anguished overflowing desire and doubt; fulfillment \n     replaced yearning, and the sticky sweet humidity of Rodin's \n     world was replaced by slick machine cool. And then in the \n     20's and 30's, the curse of the word ``Victorian'' descended \n     on The Kiss on The Thinker and on so much else of Rodin's \n     work. A curse that I might say is still enacted at the \n     Metropolitan Museum of Art, if you go look at the \n     installation of the former Andre Meyer Galleries where there \n     is a special kind of purgatory off to the right of Cezanne \n     Degas, and Manet, where The Age of Bronze strides in pride \n     next to Rosa Bonheur and Bastien-Lepage.\n       But just as certainly as the modern movement took away, it \n     so eventually gave back. Modern art is a sure killer but it \n     is also a fantastic resuscitator. And it works its growth \n     through pulses of recovery. One of those main pulses came in \n     the 1960's with scholarship by men like my mentor Albert \n     Elsen at Stanford, and by Leo Steinberg, who wrote a key \n     essay at the time of Elsen's Retrospective of Rodin at the \n     Modern in the late 60's. Elsen re-found a new Rodin, via his \n     training under Meyer Schapiro, and by his engagement as a \n     young man in the 50's with Abstract Expressionism. And his \n     show in the late 60's was the culmination of new interest, in \n     everything about Rodin's bronzes that was spontaneous, \n     painterly, seemed to depend on accident, and broadcast a kind \n     of heroic drama of angst that seemed in tune with Pollock, \n     with Rothko etc.. While Steinberg, on the other hand, via his \n     experience of Jasper Johns and Judd, pointed us to a new \n     awareness of the formal strategies of Rodin: his techniques \n     of repeating single molds to form new compositions; his \n     processes of fragmenting and hybridizing the body's anatomy, \n     against nature, towards new expressive devices. In these \n     radical, small gestures of handling material, he found a new \n     and more relevant Rodin for the late 60's, the age of \n     minimalism.\n       Moving on, recuperating, resuscitating, the way that Modern \n     art does it, involves, not simply leaving behind, but finding \n     new ways to carry forward. We know that for example that \n     Cezanne said that his goal was to redo Poussin after nature. \n     Modern art has always had a steady urge to reinvent the past \n     and to recapture it in terms that translate its values into \n     ours, to reinvent, to make new, and this means not only old \n     masters like Poussin, but its immediate forbearers. So in the \n     1960s, you not only have the reinvention of Rodin, but the \n     re-invention of Russian Constructivism through minimalism, \n     Marcel Duchamp reborn in the work of Richard Hamilton, Jasper \n     Johns and Bruce Nauman, and Futurism in Pop Art, especially \n     British. A whole new parentage was reinvented, often outside \n     the traditional ``school of Paris'' lineage, for Modernism. \n     And the ``recovery'' of Rodin was a part of this \n     revivification.\n       But at what a cost? Steinberg's essay for example, was \n     explicit in saying we have to begin by disregarding so much. \n     We have to begin by eliminating all of the public Rodin, all \n     of the finished works, indeed virtually all of the most \n     ambitious parts of his work, which are seen in a scornful \n     way, as part of the desire to please too large a public. \n     Steinberg wants to favor instead the intransigent truculence \n     of a private experimenter, showing no compromise at all with \n     the tastes or demands or emotions of the public of his time. \n     In Steinberg's case it is particularly modern irony that \n     imposes the great divide between our cooler, sophistication, \n     and a rejected messier world of sentiment pathos, and earnest \n     heroism in Rodins.\n       ``Our'' Rodin, then, relevant, sanitized and censored--not \n     the Rodin of The Kiss, the Thinker, or the marble works, and \n     surely not the Rodin before whom Cezanne fell embarrassingly \n     to his knees, and to whom Ranier Maria Rilke dedicated his \n     pen and his time. Is that the inevitable price of progress in \n     knowing art? To narrow-hew, in order to make newly vivid/\n     relevant? To diminish and deform as we try to reform, pick \n     and choose?\n       This audience in this room is a kind of aristocracy, or \n     meritocracy, of special knowledge about art. We work at it. \n     We are typical of those the self-elected and self-organized \n     elites and cenacles and Salons that have made Modern art get \n     up and go from the beginning and all along. And this group \n     too is typical of the kind of voluntary assemblages--shooting \n     associations, stamp guilds, glee clubs, softball leagues and \n     debating societies--that, far from being anti-democratic in \n     nature, have been seen by observers since Tocqueville as \n     being central to the health of our plural society, and indeed \n     the unscripted backbone of democracy's difference from mere \n     mob rule. Now it's an article of faith in this room that \n     knowing more about art, being more sophisticated, is \n     certainly a good way of forming a club, of defining one's \n     self, gathering together with fellow feelers. But is it a \n     legitimate corollary that more sophistication and knowledge \n     is necessarily greater moral intelligence about the larger \n     world, or indeed about all art? The dirty truth is that there \n     is always a price to be paid, in the deadening of our \n     capacity to respond to joys that once moved us, sealing us \n     off from others in our iced and ironic superiority.\n       We have been living for years now in a time of great \n     surprises, unpredictable events and changes that have deeply \n     affected us--the coming of AIDS, and with it a new sense of \n     fatality and mortality; the fall of the wall and what did not \n     come in the wake of its euphoria; the haunted resurgence of \n     Holocaust memory--and then, finally the massive rent in the \n     historical fabric that took place just over six months ago. \n     It is not just that the art of Louise Bourgeois, of Ghormley \n     and Munoz, of Kiki Smith and Charlie Ray have for years now \n     been asking us to rethink Rodin's heritage of the vulnerable \n     body. Nor certainly am I dealing with only the question of \n     suddenly now considering the specific memorial, monumental \n     and public ambitions of the best sense of memory and tragedy \n     in this one artist, Rodin--though both of these reinventions \n     and rethinking seem overdue. But what seems subliminally an \n     issue now is the broader confrontation with what our \n     sophistications may cost us more generally--in a lack of \n     access to the heroic, or to tragic, when these terms seem \n     suddenly, newly apposite and relevant. Is it we slick pros \n     who are irrelevant, and bound in? Inadequate to our time, as \n     it has to our great surprise changed faster than we seem to \n     be able to? This is a question I know many artists have been \n     asking themselves, and it is one worth our asking ourselves \n     too.\n       We need to rethink the balance of continuity, and relevance \n     in art, the two things I think, that we go to art for. On the \n     one hand for a vivid sense of our own life, of being alive, \n     but also for a sense of things outside ourselves, other \n     minds, other ways of feeling. And that other shifts as we \n     change, and grow, and can include the parts of ourselves, the \n     passions that got us here but that we have abandoned and \n     closed up to some ostensible hipper and better good. What \n     does it mean to grow up? (Baudelaire felt that true genius \n     was only childhood recovered at will, now equipped with adult \n     means of communication) What does it mean in the art world \n     that we all inhabit, to be a pro? Is it a dead ideal that it \n     could entail for ourselves, and those we advise and instruct \n     an effort always towards a broadening, increasing sympathy \n     for a wider range of life experience, more encompassing, more \n     fully human? It might--if we could be less hidebound, a \n     little more sure of ourselves--it might be a goal to be more \n     alive to the possibilities of our peculiar moment in history, \n     if we truly work at it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6863-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONGRATULATIONS TO WESTMINSTER CHRISTIAN ACADEMY\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nexceptional leader--Lieutenant General Mike Nelson, United States Air \nForce, Retired--in recognition of his remarkable career of service to \nour country.\n  General Nelson has a truly distinguished record, including 35 years \nof commissioned service in the U.S. Air Force uniform, that merits \nspecial recognition on the occasion of his retirement as President of \nThe Retired Officers Association (TROA).\n  Born in East Los Angeles, California, he graduated from Stanford \nUniversity and entered the Air Force as a second lieutenant in 1959, \nthen earned his pilot's wings the following year. His subsequent \nmilitary career exemplifies what the Air Force expects from its best \nand brightest.\n  General Nelson demonstrated valor and leadership throughout his 35 \nyears of dedicated military service to his country, and has been a \npositive role model and mentor for countless officers of all services \nin his dedication to protecting the welfare of those who serve and \nsacrifice in uniform. That dedication and excellence has not diminished \nin his subsequent service to our nation's military community since 1995 \nas President of The Retired Officers Association, the position from \nwhich he is now retiring.\n  Under his thoughtful and inspired leadership, The Retired Officers \nAssociation has played a continuing, vital\n\n[[Page S6864]]\n\nrole as a staunch advocate of legislative initiatives to maintain \nreadiness and improve the quality of life for all members of the \nuniformed service community--active, reserve, and retired, plus their \nfamilies and survivors.\n  General Nelson has been a key supporter of the Armed Services \nCommittee's efforts to improve long-term retention and readiness \nthrough a competitive compensation and retirement package for active \nand reserve forces, restoration of lifetime health care and fair \ndisability treatment for retired personnel and their families, and \nenhancing protections for the survivors of deceased service members. \nGuided by his personal leadership efforts, TROA has been an invaluable \nsource of information in the committee's deliberations on a long list \nof compensation and benefits issues during this extraordinarily \nproductive period.\n  General Nelson's long and exceptionally distinguished career of \nleadership and personal dedication to protecting our Nation and those \nwho serve in our armed forces is an inspiration to all who care about \nmaintaining a strong national defense. Our very best wishes go with him \nfor long life, well-earned happiness, and continued success in service \nto his nation and the uniformed service members whom he has so \nadmirably led and served.\n  As a former Sailor and Marine, I offer General Nelson a grateful and \nheartfelt salute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6864-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6864-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6864-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At. 6:31 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3214.

A bill to modify certain water resources projects for the \nApalachicola Chattahoochee, and Flint Rivers, Georgia, Florida and \nAlabama; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the locals call it ``God's country.'' The \nApalachicola River, beginning at the confluence of the Chattahoochee \nand Flint River, near the borders of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, was \nand remains an important waterway in the southeast. The river's purpose \nas a waterway, however, has changed since its colonial fame.\n  The Apalachicola is the largest river east of the Mississippi. In its \nheyday, the Apalachicola was an important tributary that served as the \nlargest port on the Gulf of Mexico, harboring ships carrying cotton to \nEurope and New England.\n  In the 21st century, while no longer an essential route of transport, \nthe Apalachicola River is an important environmental and commercial \nasset. The history of the Apalachicola River is an Army Corps of \nEngineers project began in 1945 with the Rivers and Harbors Act, which \nauthorized dredging of navigation channels. Over the past 57 years, \nmillions of taxpayer dollars have been swept down the river in an \neffort to dredge and maintain the 9 foot deep channel.\n  The Corps has had difficulty maintaining the channel, and combines \ndredging with water releases in order to raise water levels and provide \nnavigation windows. This system is hopelessly flawed. Dredging is \nunmanageable and navigation windows are unreliable, making the process \na fiscal waste.\n  Add to this fact over the last few years, commercial barge traffic \nhas slowed from an intermittent stream to a virtually non-existent \ntrickle. River traffic dropped dramatically in the late 1990's, with \nfewer than 200 barges a year using the river system. By 2001, only 30 \nbarges used the entire tri-river system with the cost of dredging the \nchannel exceeding $30,000 per barge. The past November, the only \ncompany that used barges to carry cargo on the upper reaches of the \nriver ceased operations.\n  Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the \naverage cost per ton-mile from 1995-98 at 14.1 cents, almost 24 times \nmore than the cost of the Upper Mississippi River at .597 cents. In \nlight of these circumstances, continuing to dredge Florida's largest \nriver is not just wasteful, it is foolish.\n  Ending the dredging is not just about how wasteful this project is, \nit is also about the environmental destruction that is being inflicted \non the Apalachicola River and Bay. There are now beaches of sand where \nthere were once river banks. There are now walls of sand, some towering \nlike buildings four stories high, where the river waters used to \nmeander. To date, dredged sand has resulted in the destruction of \napproximately one-quarter of the banks of the Apalachicola. The large \namounts of sand have choked sloughs and cut off the water supply to \nsurrounding habitat, ultimately threatening the local economy.\n  Navigation windows remain a threat to endanger species like the Gulf \nSturgeon, the Fat Three-Ridge and the Purple Bank Climber. The April \n2000 navigation window resulted in an almost complete failure of \nsportfish spawn along the entire Apalachicola River and reservoirs \nupstream. Sportfish populations have been in rapid decline along the \nriver since 1990. This time frame corresponds with the Corps' continued \nreliance on water releases to provide adequate water for navigation.\n  The constant and gross interruptions of nature have degraded the \nenvironment of the Apalachicola River and quality of life of those who \ndepend upon it. Because of this, the Apalachicola recently earned the \ndesignation by American Rivers as one of our nation's Most Endangered \nRivers. The Apalachicola has also been included in the 2000 Troubled \nWaters Report and the 2001 and 2002 Green Scissors Reports.\n  Manipulation of the Apalachicola poses a serious risk to the local \neconomy. Important businesses, such as farmers who produce Tupelo honey \nand the fishermen who harvest oysters and shrimp in Apalachicola Bay, \nare dependent on the river's overall health. Commercial fishing \noperations along the Gulf Coast also rely on the Bay for their \nlivelihood.\n  The negative impacts of dredging and the low commercial use of the \nApalachicola River led former Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, \nJoe Westphal, to describe the project as not ``economically justified \nor environmentally defensible.''\n  Dredging the Apalachicola exacts too high a price from both taxpayers \nand the environment. Clearly it is time to rethink this expensive and \necologically devastating practice. The bill I offer today, the Restore \nthe Apalachicola River Ecosystem, RARE, Act, provides for the actions \nnecessary to reform the Apalachicola River project.\n  First, my bill puts a stop to navigational dredging.\n  Secondly, it instructs the Corps to develop a comprehensive \nrestoration plan to be submitted to Congress that corrects the past \nharms done to the Apalachicola.\n  This legislation is widely supported in the State of Florida. \nGovernor Jeb Bush and his Cabinet recently passed a resolution that \ncalls the end of navigational dredging on the Apalachicola. My bill is \nsupported by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the \nFlorida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the Northwest \nFlorida Water Management District, Taxpayers for Common Sense, American \nRivers, Audubon Society, Florida Wildlife Federation, the Apalachicola \nBay and River Keepers, Help Save the Apalachicola River, the Nature \nConservancy, the Apalachee Ecological Conservancy, the Chipola River \nEconomic and Environmental Council, the League of Conservation Voters \nEducation Fund, Florida PIRG, the Florida Fishermen Federation, and \n1000 Friends of Florida.\n  The only way to restore the Apalachicola River to its former \ngreatness is to cease navigational dredging. This designation of the \nApalachicola as one of the nation's most endangered rivers should be a \nwake-up call to Congress and the Army Corps of Engineers to permanently \nend the dredging of the Apalachicola and allow the river to return to \nits natural state free of man's manipulation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which is both \nfiscally sound and environmentally responsible.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to day in support of the \nGraham-Nelson bill to de-authorize the dredging of the Apalachicola \nRiver.\n  The time has come to end the dredging of the Apalachicola river in \nnorth Florida. The detriments far outweigh the benefits of this \nexpensive Army Corps of Engineers river project. The barge traffic is \nnegligible; and the environmental and economic impact to the area \nsurrounding this river are harmful.\n  Since 1998, fewer than 140 barges have used the Florida portion of \nthe Apalachicola River. And of the barge traffic that does navigate \nthis waterway, most is confined to a 6 mile long stretch of the \nApalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint ACF River System for the transport of \nsand and gravel, the principal commodity shipped on the system.\n  The dredging to keep this small amount of barge traffic going has \nresulted in sand mountains that have destroyed one-quarter of the banks \nof the Apalachicola River and choked sloughs cutting off water supply \nto surrounding habitat. In addition, the releases of large quantities \nof water to allow barge traffic to navigate the river disrupts the \nspawning behavior of three endangered species: the Gulf Sturgeon, the \nFat Three-Ridge and the Purple Bank Climber.\n  Another concern is the effect of pulses of this fresh water on the \nbalance of salt and fresh water in Apalachicola Bay. The Apalachicola \nBay is the largest oyster harvesting area in the Gulf of Mexico and one \nof the principal nurseries for Gulf Shrimp and blue crabs. Commercial \nfishing operations along the Gulf coast rely heavily on the Bay for \ntheir continued prosperity. The fresh water influxes threaten this \nimportant industry. For these reasons, this project must end.\n  I urge my colleagues support for this important piece of legislation.\n\n[[Page S6870]]\n\n\n                                  ____\n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 2731. A bill to establish the Crossroads of the American \nRevolution National Heritage Area in the State of New Jersey, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today along with Senator Torricelli I am \nintroducing legislation, the Crossroads of the American Revolution \nNational Heritage Area Act of 2002, to establish the Crossroads of the \nAmerican Revolution National Heritage Area in the State of New Jersey. \nI am proud to be joining my New Jersey colleagues, Representatives \nRodney Frelinghuysen and Rush Holt, who have introduced this \nlegislation in the House of Representatives with the support of the \nentire New Jersey delegation.\n  This legislation recognizes the critical role that New Jersey played \nduring the American Revolution. In fact, New Jersey was the site of \nnearly 300 military engagements that helped determine the course of our \nhistory as a nation. Many of these locations, like the site where \nGeorge Washington made his historic crossing of the Delaware River, are \nwell known and preserved. Others, such as the Monmouth Battlefield \nState Park in Manalapan and Freehold, and New Bridge Landing in River \nEdge, are less well known and are threatened by development or in \ncritical need of funding for rehabilitation.\n  To help preserve New Jersey's Revolutionary War sites, this \nlegislation would establish a Crossroads of the American Revolution \nNational Heritage, linking about 250 sites in 15 counties. This \ndesignation would authorize $10 million to assist preservation, \nrecreational and educational efforts by the State, county and local \ngovernments as well as private cultural and tourism groups. The program \nwould be managed by the non-profit Crossroads of the American \nRevolution Association.\n  A National Heritage Area would bring many benefits to New Jersey. \nFirst, it would help our communities and state preserve our history and \neducate our citizens. It would also encourage the protection of open \nspace within the area, which is so critical to our quality of life. \nFinally, National Heritage Areas create significant economic \nopportunities, providing local communities with incentives and \nresources to work together to increase tourism in the region by \nhighlighting historic sites and cultural events.\n  Simply put, we are the Nation that we are today because of the \ncritical events that occurred in New Jersey during the American \nRevolution and the many who died fighting there. By enacting the \nCrossroads of the American Revolution National Heritage Area Act of \n2002, we will pay tribute to the patriots who fought and died in New \nJersey so that we might become a Nation free from tyranny.\n  I am proud to introduce this legislation to ensure that we properly \nhonor New Jersey's pivotal role in our Nation's history as the true \ncrossroads of the American Revolution.\n                                  ____\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2732. A bill to allow a custodial parent a bad debt deduction for \nunpaid child support payments, and to require a parent who is \nchronically delinquent in child support to include the amount of the \nunpaid obligation in gross income; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today is long \noverdue. The Child Support Enforcement Act will bring much-needed \nrelief to the millions of families who are not receiving the child \nsupport they are legally due.\n  The importance of this bill is clear. Each year, nearly 60 percent of \nparents owed child support receive less than the amount they are due. \nAnd more than 30 percent receive no payment at all. California is no \nexception: preliminary findings from the 2000 Census Report found that \nof the more than 2.3 million Californians who were owed child support, \nonly 39 percent received those payments.\n  Clearly, millions of individuals, women and children, are in crisis \nwhen it comes to child support. It is time to treat delinquent child \nsupport the same way bad debt is treated in the tax law.\n  The Child Support Enforcement Act would allow custodial parents to \ndeduct the amount of child support they are owed from their adjusted \ngross income on their income taxes. This is true for all taxpayers, \nregardless of whether they itemize. So while we are not providing the \nfull amount they are due, this bill will provide much-needed relief.\n  This bill will also penalize the non-custodial parent who is not \npaying his or her legally obligated child support. It will force the \ndeadbeat parent to add the owed amount to his adjusted gross income, \ncreating a tax penalty.\n  This is not creating new tax law. It is extending current tax law on \nbad debts to delinquent child support payments. It's that simple.\n  The relief provided in this bill is extremely important for single \nparents. Child support payments can literally mean the difference \nbetween paying rent or being homeless; the difference between putting \nfood on the table or being forced to let children go hungry; the \ndifference between making ends meet or going on welfare.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Snowe. And \nRepresentative Cox is introducing the House version of the bill today \nas well. As you can see, this is not a partisan issue, this is a family \nissue. It will help families and children nationwide. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this bill.\n                                  ____\n\n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2733. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nretirement savings for moderate and lower income workers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Retirement Security for All Americans Act,'' legislation that will \nhelp all of our Nation's workers save for their retirement. Although \nthere are several ways to measure pension and retirement plan coverage, \nthere is one constant statistic, less than half of the workers in our \ncountry are covered by an employer sponsored pension plan. In spite of \nnumerous incentives provided by Congress over the years, our Nation's \ncoverage rate has remained virtually unchanged for the past three \ndecades. New Mexico, my home State is the worst, with a coverage rate \nof 30 percent. In real terms, this means that 70 percent of New \nMexicans working in the private sector will have to fund their \nretirement on the other 2 legs of the proverbial 3 legged stool, \npersonal savings and Social Security. In truth, it seems unlikely that \nprivate sector workers who do not have a pension or retirement plan \nwill have any significant savings, leaving them to get by on a one \nlegged stool, not an easy trick.\n  Not surprisingly, the coverage rate is substantially reduced for \nlower income workers and minorities. For example, the 1999 U.S. Census \nCurrent Population Survey illustrates that only 27 percent of Hispanics \nin the private sector have an employer sponsored pension or retirement \nplan while it is 47 percent for whites and 44 percent for all workers. \nThe Census data further illustrates that minorities are more likely to \nwork at jobs that do not offer their workers a retirement plan. For \ninstance, only 40 percent of Hispanics work at jobs that offer \nretirement plans while 62 percent of whites and 58 percent of all \nworkers have this employee benefit. If, on the other hand, an employer \ndoes offer its employees a retirement plan, the Census data indicates \nthat all workers, regardless of race or ethnicity tend to participate \nat the same rate. While it is not conclusive, this data indicates that \nif workers are offered a plan, they tend to take advantage of this \nbenefit and save for their retirement.\n  We cannot continue to have a national retirement policy that results \nin the majority of Americans not having adequate savings for what is \nsupposed to be their golden years. This is unacceptable. The \nlegislation that I am introducing today addresses this need by \nencouraging employers to not only offer plans, but to provide \ncontributions to their lower paid workers. While each of these \nprovisions standing alone would improve coverage and our national \nsavings rate, combined, there is a strong synergic effect among the \nprovisions, making passage of all three imperative.\n  The first provision expands and makes permanent the current Savers'\n\n[[Page S6871]]\n\nCredit that was signed into law last year. Under this new provision, \nemployees earning up to $15,000, $30,000 for married couples, will \nreceive $0.50 for every dollar that they save in their 401(k) or IRA. \nThe credit rate gradually phases down for those with incomes between \n$15,000 and $27,500, $30,000 and $55,000 for married couples. \nCurrently, the Savers' Credit drops from 50 percent to 20 percent once \na worker makes $15,001. We get rid of this cliff by phasing the credit \nout so as to not have disincentives to save more.\n  For those taxpayers without income tax liability, we will provide a \ntax credit of 50 cents on the dollar for their contributions through a \nnew series of indexed government bonds. These bonds are not \ntransferable and not redeemable until the worker retires to avoid \nabuses and to guarantee the funds are saved for retirement. By giving \nnew savers bonds, it will encourage them to save more and help them \nrealize the benefits of long term savings plans.\n  The second provision of the bill requires all employers with more \nthan 10 employees, who do not currently offer their employees a \nqualified retirement plan, to provide their workers with the option of \na payroll deduction IRA. Presently, all employers remit payments to \nfinancial institutions for a variety of reasons, including the deposit \nof payroll taxes, it is something that they already have to do. This \nprovision would simply ask them to set up accounts at a financial \ninstitution so that workers can to send part of their own paychecks \ndirectly to an IRA set up at a financial institution of the employer's \nchoice.\n  To offset any administrative cost, a tax credit of $200 for the first \nyear and $50 for subsequent years is provided to the employer, though \nin most cases there will be no additional expense. Employers are also \nallowed to remit the employee's contributions to their IRAs on the same \nschedule as they currently remit payroll tax deposits to the same \nfinancial institutions or the IRS.\n  The benefits to the employee are clear. A payroll deduction IRA will \nallow workers to save small amounts out of each paycheck instead of \nmaking periodic or annual contributions to an IRA. As little as $10 a \nweek saved could result in an employee saving over $750 dollars a year \nwhen combined with the Savers Credit. Saving is a learned response, the \nfirst step is to get people to save the first dollar and experience the \nbenefits of compounding interest.\n  The final section incorporates the Senate passed provision that was \ndropped in the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n2001 conference that provides small businesses with a tax credit for \ntheir contributions to the retirement accounts of their non-highly \ncompensated employees. This provision, which has been pushed by \nChairman Baucus and others for many years, will greatly increase the \namount that employers contribute to workers' retirement plans.\n  Essentially it allows employers to receive a 50 percent tax credit on \ncontributions up to 3 percent of an employee's annual compensation, but \nonly to the non-highly compensated. To keep the costs of the proposal \ndown, it is only available for a limited time, 3 years, to new plans. \nThis should encourage many employers to not only offer a plan for the \nfirst time, but creates a noteworthy incentive to contribute to these \nemployees' accounts.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to bridge this enormous \ngap in pension coverage in our country. We must be realistic about how \nmuch we can accomplish in one shot. Coverage hasn't improved in 30 \nyears. We must therefore continue to advance proposals that will make \ngradual but meaningful improvements. We cannot allow ourselves to \noperate under the fiction that the system is currently working for all \nAmericans. At a time when Social Security solvency is at issue, we must \nfind ways to reduce the reliance of all our seniors on these benefits \nfor their retirement needs. It was never the intent of Social Security \nto be a retiree's sole source of retirement income. This legislation \nwill begin the slow process of increasing our national pension \ncoverage. Because these benefits will not accrue over night, we must \nact now while the spotlight is still on retirement policy. I hope all \nmy colleagues will join me in passing this important legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n        Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 2734. A bill to provide emergency assistance to non-farm small \nbusiness concerns that have suffered economic harm from the devastating \neffects of drought; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce emergency \nlegislation to help small non-farm businesses across this Nation that \nare in dire straits because of drought conditions in their State. They \nneed assistance, particularly access to working capital to pay the \nbills and meet payroll, but they can't get it because they are falling \nthrough the cracks of Federal disaster loan programs.\n  Why? Well, this is hard to believe, but it is because a drought is \nnot considered a disaster under the Small Business Administration's \ndisaster loan program, and under the Department of Agriculture's \ndisaster program, which does consider a drought a disaster, only \nagriculture-related businesses are eligible for disaster assistance.\n  This assistance is critical to the survival of thousands of small \nbusinesses that make their living in tourism and recreation industries, \nas well as other industries dependent on water. Droughts are a cruel \nphenomenon of nature. They are out of the control of a small business \nowner, and it isn't fair that they aren't eligible for Federal disaster \nassistance but the victims of floods, fires, and hurricanes are.\n  With a very small change, we can make all the difference to affected \nsmall businesses. Specifically, I propose amending the Small Business \nAct in order to make a drought a disaster.\n  More than 30 States are struggling with drought right now, according \nto the National Drought Mitigation at the University of Nebraska, and \nfar more than agricultural, forestry and livestock businesses are hurt. \nIf you talk to the governors of your States, I am sure they will tell \nyou how bad the situation is. In northern Massachusetts, we have been \nin a drought since last fall. In South Carolina, the conditions are so \nbad that small businesses dependent upon lake and river tourism have \nseen revenues drop anywhere from 17 to 80 percent. The victims range \nfrom fish and tackle shops to rafting businesses, from restaurants to \nmotels, from marinas to gas stations. For those who are listening and \ndiscount the serious impact of drought on small businesses, ask the \nrafting businesses that went bankrupt in Texas in 1996. The rivers were \nso low that these established businesses lost everything.\n  I thank my colleagues who are cosponsors, Senators Hollings, \nLandrieu, Baucus, Bingaman, Daschle, and Johnson. I invite my other \ncolleagues with droughts in their States to cosponsor this bill and \ncall on the Administration to work with our Committee in passing this \nemergency legislation before we go home for the break in August. These \nsmall businesses cannot wait.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2734\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I have heard my name being used a lot in \nthis Chamber this afternoon, and I plan to make a comprehensive \nstatement tomorrow that outlines my views on the Hatch-Waxman \namendments contained in S. 812.\n  I might mention, I am very concerned about those amendments. I \nbelieve that the original Schumer-McCain bill was a bill that did not \nimprove the Hatch-Waxman Act which was enacted in 1984. Of course, over \nthe course of the last 18 years, it has been recognized as a very \nhighly respected consumer protection law.\n  The reason is because that law has saved consumers between $8 billion \nand $10 billion every year since 1984--over the last 18 years. The \nreason it has saved them so much money is that it is a delicately \nbalanced bill between the pioneer companies, that is, the large \npharmaceutical companies, and the generic drug industry.\n  When we passed Hatch-Waxman, the generic industry had about 15 \npercent of the total drug business in this country. Today it has close \nto 50 percent. That is because of that delicate balance achieved \nthrough the Hatch-Waxman law . And I see that this underlying bill may \nvery well disturb that delicate balance and disrupt a law that has \nworked well for consumers for many years.\n  I want to make sure that the bill approved by the Senate is a good \nbill, if, in the end if we are going to be amending the Hatch-Waxman \nAct. I put a lot of effort into that bill before it was passed in 1984.\n  It is an important law. It is a law that has really helped America. I \nhave to say, if we disrupt that balance and we all of the sudden take \naway the incentives to put that $30 billion a year into research and \ndevelopment costs to develop these lifesaving drugs, we will not have \nthe drugs to put into generic form later. And, we could lose these \nbusinesses--they could all go offshore if we do not handle this exactly \nright.\n  So what has been in some measure demagogued today on the floor--if we \ndo not watch that, we will wind up making questionable changes to a law \nthat now saves the lives of millions of Americans and does so at \naffordable costs.\n  I will spend some time on that tomorrow because I think it needs a \ncomprehensive discussion. I will say this: The underlying bill, what \nused to be Schumer-McCain to Kennedy-Edwards, has moved to a degree in \nthe right direction but certainly not nearly enough. Frankly, I would \nlike to make sure that the law bill that I put so much blood, sweat, \nand tears into over the years leading up to 1984 when it was passed, \nwill not be disrupted because of politics on this floor, especially \nsince that bill has worked so well for the American people.\n  My purpose this afternoon, however, is to discuss the Medicare \nprescription drug issue which we will be debating in the very near \nfuture. I have been working with four of my Senate colleagues--Senators \nGrassley, Jeffords, Breaux, and Snowe--for the last year on a Medicare \nreform and prescription drug bill. It is called the Tripartisan bill \nbecause it has Republicans, Democrats, and the sole Independent in the \nSenate.\n  This legislation, the 21st Century Medicare Act, better known as the \nSenate Tripartisan Medicare prescription drug proposal, was introduced \nyesterday after months and months of hard work. This bill was \nintroduced because the five of us crossed party lines and worked \ntogether. It was introduced because all five of us want a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit to be signed into law this year. We are tired \nof waiting for legislation that we could have passed 2\\1/2\\, 3 years \nago, but every time it is brought up, politics is played with this \nlegislation rather than doing what is right for our senior citizens and \nothers in dire need of this legislation.\n  Medicare beneficiaries deserve nothing less than to get it done this \nyear, but others in this body, in my opinion, feel differently.\n  Here we are on the verge of considering Medicare prescription drug \nlegislation on the Senate floor without the Finance Committee ever \nbeing even a small part of it. Now I heard comments made that the \nFinance Committee has gone back and forth with this for years. That is \nnot true. This is the first time we have really had a chance of passing \na bill through the Senate that I think could very easily be accepted by \nthe House, or in a conference certainly basically accepted by the House \nand the Senate.\n  The Finance Committee members, under the leadership of Chairman Max \nBaucus, have been meeting for weeks to try and draft a consensus \nMedicare prescription drug bill. But due to artificial deadlines \nimposed upon us by the powers that be, we are not going to be given an \nopportunity to even consider a Medicare prescription drug bill in the \nFinance Committee itself before the full Senate considers the Medicare \ndrug legislation.\n  Why even have a Finance Committee--which everybody would acknowledge \nis one of the great committees in the United States Congress--\n\n[[Page S6874]]\n\nwhen bills that are under its jurisdiction are brought up on the floor \nwithout even a hearing or a markup?\n  There were no delays. We could have had this markup and we could have \npassed this bill out today. We could have done it last week if we had \nhad a markup. Sadly, politics is dictating policy, and I find that \ncompletely unacceptable, especially when it involves an issue as \nimportant as Medicare prescription drug coverage.\n  By putting politics before policy, we are not doing what is in the \nbest interest of our senior citizens and our citizens as a whole.\n  I have also heard comments today that this is being filibustered. \nNobody wants to filibuster this bill. That is always an old wives' tale \nthat comes up when you do not have good arguments on your side.\n\n  I would like to take this opportunity, though, to talk about the \ntripartisan bill. When drafting this legislation, we tried to reach out \nto everyone who has a stake in this issue. It has required many hours \nof meetings, meetings among ourselves, with our staffs, CBO, CMS, \nseniors groups, insurance providers, PBM representatives, technical \nexperts, and other interested parties. Let me assure you this has been \na unified effort, one which has required some give and some take from \nall of us.\n  I truly believe this tripartisan bill is, in fact, the only bill \ncapable of passing not only the Senate but the Congress in 2002.\n  We have worked with CBO constantly in order to come up with an \naffordable solution, and CBO has told us that our bill will cost $370 \nbillion over 10 years. As far as I know, the Daschle-Graham-Miller bill \ndoes not have a CBO score, but I expect it to be extremely expensive. \nAs a matter of fact, the Daschle-Graham-Miller bill, as I know it \ntoday, would be well over $800 billion over 10 years, and it has a \nsunset provision. So this isn't even a permanent benefit. I know my \nseniors in Utah will be surprised to hear that we're even considering \nsuch a bill.\n  In addition, there are no sunsets within our bill. Our Tripartisan \nbill is a permanent solution, not a temporary one, and CBO informs us \nthat once our bill is implemented fully, 99 percent of all seniors will \nhave drug coverage, which is truly remarkable.\n  So, the question is, how does a temporary solution truly help seniors \nin the long run? I do not think it does. Our Tripartisan bill provides \nall Medicare beneficiaries with affordable prescription drug coverage \nbecause we let innovation and competition determine the prices, not of \nGovernment bureaucrats. That is how we keep prices for drugs \ncompetitive.\n  I do not think it is a good idea to let the Government set the price, \nwhich is what will happen if the Daschle-Graham bill becomes law, and I \ndo not think it has a chance of becoming law. I do not think it will \nget the necessary votes to become law. But our bill could, with honest \ndecent work by all of us.\n  We also provide additional subsidies to low-income seniors so that \nthey, too, can afford to pay for their drugs. I find it absolutely \nappalling that there are people in our country who have to choose \nbetween buying food and buying prescription drugs. The Tripartisan \ngroup's goal is to put an end to that and provide additional help to \nthose seniors who really need it.\n  In fact, all seniors need it. For example, the 10 million \nbeneficiaries with incomes below 135 percent of poverty will have 80 to \n95 percent of the prescription drug costs covered by this plan, with \nabsolutely no monthly premium. These seniors are exempt from the \ndeductible and will pay well under $5 for their brand name \nprescriptions and their generic prescriptions. Enrollees at this income \nlevel who reach the catastrophic coverage limit will have full \nprotection against all drug costs, with no coinsurance.\n  We also take care of the 11.7 million lower income beneficiaries with \nincomes below 150 percent of the poverty level. Enrollees between 135 \npercent and 150 percent of the Federal poverty level will also receive \na more generous Federal subsidy that on average lowers their monthly \npremiums to anywhere between 0 and $24 a month on a sliding scale. It \nalso more than halves the cost of their annual drug bills.\n\n  All other enrollees will have access to discounted prescriptions \nafter reaching the $3,450 benefit limit and a critically important \n$3,700 catastrophic benefit, which protects seniors from high, out-of-\npocket drug costs. This is hardly a doughnut hole. My friend and \ncolleague Senator Snowe refers to it as more of a bagel hole.\n  It is also important to note that 80 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries will never experience a gap in coverage. As far as drug \ncoverage is concerned, we let Medicare beneficiaries choose from at \nleast two drug plans, allowing them to select a plan that suits their \nindividual needs. Seniors are in charge, not the Federal Government.\n  The Daschle-Graham bill, on the other hand, has a one-size-fits-all \ndrug plan that is offered to Medicare beneficiaries. That is the type \nof solution that will lead us down a dangerous path, and before you \nknow it the Federal Government, not the private marketplace, will be \nsetting drug prices. We need to avoid that scenario at all costs.\n  Finally, our plan gives seniors a choice of Medicare coverage. \nSeniors may remain in traditional Medicare or they may opt for the new, \nenhanced Medicare fee-for-service program which is designed to look \nmore like private health insurance and less like a program that is \nstuck in the mid-1960s.\n  We all believe that Medicare needs to be improved. Medicare has \nhardly changed since it was first created in 1965 and Medicare needs to \nbecome a 21st century program. So our bill provides seniors with a \nchoice in Medicare coverage. Beneficiaries may stay in traditional \nMedicare or they may opt for the new, enhanced fee-for-service Medicare \nplan.\n  I want to emphasize that we do not force seniors to enter into the \nnew, enhanced fee-for-service plan. We just offer it to beneficiaries \nas an option. If Medicare beneficiaries want to stay in traditional \nMedicare, that is fine. Our bill allows them to do so. If they decide \nthey do not like the new enhanced Medicare plan, they can switch back \nto traditional Medicare. We need to give seniors choices concerning \ntheir health care coverage. They need to be able to keep the Medicare \nbenefits seniors have today, but seniors must also be given improved \nhealth care choices.\n\n  I emphasize, once again, that CBO tells us that should our bill \nbecome law, 99 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries will have drug \ncoverage. That would be tremendous for this country. We ought to do it \nthis year. We should not be playing politics with it. We should not be \nsetting up the Senate so this bill fails, so one side or the other can \nclaim the other side refused to pass a bill this year.\n  I believe providing Medicare beneficiaries with their choice of \ncoverage is key, and the Tripartisan group worked together for months \nto ensure that seniors get quality drug coverage for an affordable \nprice.\n  I will conclude by saying we must make 2002 the year that Medicare is \nbrought into the 21st century. This is the year that Medicare reform \nand prescription drug legislation should be passed by the Congress and \nsigned into law. Our bill does more than just provide drug coverage. It \nincludes Medicare reforms. It provides assistance to Medicare Choice.\n  We can start this process by allowing the Senate Finance Committee to \ndo its job and consider Medicare prescription drug legislation before \nit is debated on the Senate floor. Bypassing the Senate Finance \nCommittee and going directly to the Senate floor sends a message to the \nAmerican people that we are more interested in playing political games \nthan letting the legislative process work.\n  We need to have a markup in the Senate Finance Committee as soon as \npossible. We have Medicare bills to consider, both the Graham-Miller \nbill and the Tripartisan bill. We should have our Senate floor debate \nafter the Finance Committee has approved legislation. It should not be \nthe other way around. I believe Senators Graham and Miller are very \nsincere, fine people. They are good Senators. They believe in what they \nare doing. But if they do, we ought to have it come up in committee and \nvote. We are willing to have the Tripartisan bill voted upon. We have \nat least 12 votes out of 21 on the committee. That is probably the \nreason why the majority leader is determined not to bring up these \nmatters in the Finance Committee.\n\n[[Page S6875]]\n\n  I am hopeful we will be able to work this out and provide affordable \nprescription drug coverage for seniors through legislation considered \nby the Senate Finance Committee. This is a top priority of mine and \nmany of my colleagues in the Senate. We have been hearing from seniors \nfor years about their need for Medicare prescription drug benefits. Why \nare we playing political games with such an important issue?\n  I encourage my colleagues to work with us, to work with the \nTripartisan group and others. I believe there is a majority, a \nsignificant majority, if we were allowed to do what is right, who would \nvote for the Tripartisan bill so seniors would finally get what they \ntruly deserve, prescription drug coverage for the Medicare Program and \nbring Medicare into the 21st century once and for all.\n  Medicare beneficiaries deserve that opportunity. We owe it to them. \nThis bill would allow that to happen.\n  I have been told this debate will take 2 weeks. I don't know why it \nhas to take 2 weeks. We have three, four, or five different plans. We \ncan vote on them. I personally hope we can vote on them. I believe if \nwe are allowed to vote on them and people will get rid of the political \naspects, we will pass a bill that will work this year for the benefit \nof seniors in the years to come. The Tripartisan bill does not have a \nsunset. The Tripartisan bill would continue on forever as far as we are \nconcerned, to the benefit of all seniors in this country. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/16/senate-section/article/S6875-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
