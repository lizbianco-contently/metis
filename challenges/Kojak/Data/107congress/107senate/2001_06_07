Under the previous order, there will now \nbe 1 hour of debate on the Dodd amendment No. 459 as modified, equally \ndivided and controlled.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President,\n  Mr. President, as I understand it, there is 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the President. I am somewhat disappointed that we \nhave not scheduled a vote on this amendment. But I am told that on the \nexpiration of an hour that I will have to set this amendment aside, and \nthat the minority floor leader of this bill is opposed to a vote \noccurring on this amendment. I hope that we will have an opportunity to \ncast a vote in this body on the amendment that I have offered on behalf \nof myself, Senator Biden of Delaware, and Senator Reed of Rhode Island.\n  There is at least one other Member, or maybe two, who want to be \nheard in support of this amendment. I ask the Chair on the expiration \nof 10 minutes that I be notified to make sure I reserve time for others \nwho want to be heard on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me explain this amendment once again. I explained it when I \noffered it yesterday afternoon, and again early last evening.\n  This is a very straight forward, simple amendment. I said yesterday \nthat if there is one word that could be used to describe the underlying \nbill, it is the word ``accountability''--we want greater \naccountability. I would add ``responsibility''--``accountability and \nresponsibility.'' Students, parents, school principals, teachers, \nsuperintendents, and boards of education all have to be more \naccountable and more responsible if we are going to improve the quality \nof public education in our country.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that, while there has been improvement \nin recent years in classrooms, there is room for more improvement. We \nneed to raise the next generation of young people to be prepared to \nmeet the challenges of the 21st century and be competitive in a global \neconomy.\n  In years past, a child raised in Connecticut, West Virginia, \nMassachusetts, or New Hampshire, competed, if you will, with children \nin the neighboring town or the neighboring county, maybe the \nneighboring State.\n  Today, our children compete with children all over the world. So we \nneed to prepare a generation like no other in the history of this \nNation. Therefore, the issue of a sound, firm, good elementary and \nsecondary education is critical.\n  This bill mandates a number of things. We, will mandate, for the very \nfirst time, that every child be tested every year from third grade \nthrough eighth grade. That is a Federal mandate in this bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will note--and the Senator is familiar with this--just \nto make it clear, the Federal Government already mandates that children \ntake a test in three grades. This just adds three more grades.\n  Mr. DODD. I accept that point. We do. My point being, my amendment \nhas been called intrusive. Because I have suggested that the States be \naccountable and responsible, it is said that I am proposing a new \nFederal intrusion into what has historically been a local and State \ndecisionmaking process. Yet, as my colleague from New Hampshire has \npointed out, we already mandate tests. And, this bill mandates even \nmore tests.\n  We also mandate standards for teachers at the local level. We are \ngoing to tell school districts that if schools do not perform at a \ncertain level, we, the Federal Government, will require them to close \nthe school. We require the States to establish statewide content and \nperformance standards, and tests that are the same for all children in \nthe State.\n  The point is, we are mandating decisions at the local level. Down to \nthe level of detail of telling third graders, and their parents, when \nthey will be taking tests.\n  My amendment says that if we are going to ask for accountability and \nresponsibility from students, parents, school principals, teachers, and \nschool boards, is it unreasonable to ask States to be accountable? \nSince 1965, we have mandated comparable educational opportunity for \nstudents within school districts. This amendment simply says that there \nshould be comparable educational opportunity throughout the State.\n  Why do I say that? Of the total education dollar spent in our public \nschools, 6 cents comes from the Federal Government, 94 cents comes from \nState and local governments. In this bill, we are mandating that \nschools and school districts do a better job. If they do not, there are \nconsequences. It is a Federal mandate. But the resource allocations are \nnot really there, nor are we insisting at a local or State level that \nthey meet their obligations.\n  My amendment says States must take on responsibility. If we are \nasking students, and parents, and teachers, and schools, and school \ndistricts to do better, why not the States?\n  Many States are working hard at this. But, nevertheless, many \nchildren, simply by the accident of their birth, have a disparate level \nof educational opportunity. They are born or raised in a school \ndistrict where the resources are not there. A child born in a more \naffluent school district has an educational opportunity that is vastly \ndifferent.\n  I see it in my own State. I represent the most affluent State in \nAmerica on a per capita income basis, the State of Connecticut. I also \nhave communities in my State that are some of the poorest in America. \nHartford, our capital, was just rated as the eighth poorest city in \nAmerica.\n\n  So, even in my small State, there are children who attend some of the \nbest schools in America because we support education through a local \nproperty tax, and others, just a few miles away, who have much less \neducational opportunity, for the same reason.\n  Just as we are going to test children, and schools, and districts, \nshould we not also test States? It doesn't seem to\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\nme that providing comparable opportunity to all children is too much to \nask.\n  As I pointed out earlier, there are a number of Federal mandates that \nwe already include in law. We withhold funds from States or school \ndistricts if they do not pass certain laws concerning children and \nguns, for example, in addition to the mandates I discussed earlier. I \nam not drawing judgments, but pointing out that this law is full of \nmandates, supported by both sides.\n  We bear a responsibility at the Federal level to do a good job to see \nto it that dollars taxpayers have sent to us go back to support \neducation in the ways in which title I and the rest of ESEA. In this \nbill, we say that school districts should do a better job, that parents \nand teachers and school superintendents should do a better job. \nShouldn't States be included in that community of accountability and \nresponsibility? That is all I am suggesting with this amendment.\n  We leave it to the discretion of the Secretary of Education to \ndetermine to what extent administrative funds would be withheld. We \ngive these States 6 years to at least demonstrate they are moving in \nthe direction of offering ``comparable'' educational opportunity. The \nwords I have chosen have been in the law for 36 years.\n  I see I have used 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair notifies the Senator from \nConnecticut 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair very much for that notice. I could have \ngone on. As you can see, I was building up a head of steam.\n  I see my friend from New Hampshire is in the Chamber. There are \nseveral colleagues--at least one I know of--who want to be heard on \nthis subject. I want to reserve some time for them.\n  Would my colleague from New Hampshire like to be heard at this time? \nI know he wanted to respond to some of these very thoughtful and \npersuasive arguments I am making.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time I reserve my time because last \nnight I was so eloquent, I am just at a loss for words today.\n  Mr. DODD. So I have heard.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? The Chair hears none. \nThe absence of a quorum has been suggested. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There being no objection, the quorum call \nis rescinded.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. While I am waiting for one of my colleagues to enter the \nChamber, I will just take few more minutes to share some additional \nthoughts on why I believe this amendment is worthwhile. And I will \nanticipate some of the arguments my good friend from New Hampshire will \nraise in his eloquent opposition to this amendment so that my \ncolleagues may have the benefit of these thoughts.\n  I am confident my colleague is going to call this a cookie-cutter \napproach, that I want to establish, at a Federal level, what every \nclassroom in America is going to look like. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth. What this amendment requires is that every child in a \nState have a comparable educational opportunity with other children in \nthat same State. Last evening, I cited the supreme court decision in \nthe State of New Hampshire, which makes the case more eloquently than I \ncould, saying that in the State of New Hampshire children, regardless \nof the community in which they are raised, ought to have an equal \nopportunity. I stress the word ``opportunity.'' I do not believe any of \nus has an obligation to guarantee any person in America success. That \nhas never been the American way.\n  What we have always believed, since the founding days of our \nRepublic, is that equal opportunity has been the magnet which has drawn \nthe world to our shores. Where people had been denied opportunities for \na variety of reasons--religious, ethnic, gender, whatever--America has \nbeen the place where they get judged on their abilities.\n  There are countless stories of people, coming from the most humble of \norigins, who have risen to the very heights in their chosen field of \nendeavor. I could cite the example of the Presiding Officer as a case \nin point, if he wouldn't mind my making personal reference to it. \nProviding an equal opportunity to everybody, that is all this is. What \nbetter key to a success than an education? If you don't have a good \neducational opportunity, it is very difficult to achieve your full \npotential.\n  My great-grandmother, when she came to this country with my great-\ngrandfather, was about 16 years old. They were married. They came from \na small community on the western coast of Ireland. The first thing she \ndid--she couldn't read or write--was to get herself elected to the \nlocal school board in the 19th century because she understood that \neducation was going to be the key. She had been raised in a country \nwhere she couldn't go to school because of her religion. She understood \nthat an opportunity for herself and her family--her nine children, my \ngrandfather being the ninth child--was going to be education.\n  Educational opportunity is what I am focusing on. As we have been \nsaying to school districts across America for 36 years, you must \nprovide comparable educational opportunity for each child within that \nschool district. I am expanding that equation to say in each State \nbecause the States really bear the responsibility for funding education \nthrough decisions made by the legislatures. How do they fund education? \nIt is a State decision and a local decision. We are mandating things at \nthe local level and we are leaving out the States.\n  I am suggesting that States also have a responsibility to meet their \nobligations. If we are going to mandate performance and not provide the \nfunding for it and exclude the States from being accountable, then we \nare going to be back here a few years from now asserting that the \nFederal Government mandated something, but did not fund it.\n  I see my friend from Maine, Senator Collins, on the floor who \nbelieves passionately in our responsibility for funding special \neducation. I agree with her. In fact, we have all fought hard to see \nthat we meet that obligation.\n  The underlying bill we are considering mandates that children do \nbetter in schools. We set standards that are going to have to be met. \nWe are going to have to provide resources for this. Some communities do \nnot have the resources; others do. To mandate a level of performance \nand not provide the resources for children to achieve that level of \nperformance is dangerous.\n  I see my colleague from New Jersey. How much time remains on the \nproponents' side of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The proponents have 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am honored that the President pro \ntempore is in the chair. It is great to see him there.\n  I also am pleased that I have this opportunity to stand in support of \nthe Dodd-Biden amendment, which is designed to make sure that every \nchild in America has access and the equal promise of a quality \neducation. The Dodd-Biden amendment on school service comparability is \na terrific initiative. This amendment is structured so all children \nhave access to comparable quality education--not identical, but quality \ncomparable education.\n  It is a goal that all of us surely have to believe is as important as \nequal test results. Equal opportunity is just as important as equal \noutcomes as measured by standardized tests.\n  This amendment is more than common sense, too. It actually fulfills \nthe promise that we as a nation make to all of our children--that we \nwill provide every child in America with access to a quality education \nand the American promise that flows from that, regardless of race, the \nfamily's income, or where they live.\n  Title I kids should have access to every opportunity every other \nchild in America has. It should not be a function of where they are \nborn or where they live. As my colleagues have already described, this \namendment would\n\n[[Page S5910]]\n\nencourage States to ensure that all students receive a comparable \neducation in several critical areas: class size, teacher \nqualifications, curriculum, access to technology, and school safety. \nThese are just commonsense areas where we ought to be providing for \nevery child a similar educational experience.\n  They allow for the full potential of all of our children. Every child \nhas a right to a qualified teacher. All of us believe that. Every child \nhas a right to a challenging curriculum. Every child has a right to go \nto school in a safe and quality school building. In my State of New \nJersey, there are many schools 100 years old, with an average age of 57 \nyears. In our urban areas, it is a serious problem.\n  A ZIP Code should not determine the quality of a child's education. I \nhope this is a basic premise on which we can all agree. Unfortunately, \nin my State and around the country ZIP Codes often do determine the \nquality of education a child receives. Children in one town where there \nis a serious tax base for them to operate under receive a high-quality \neducation. In other towns, adjacent to those very same communities, \nthey receive a dramatically lower quality education because they don't \nhave the resources to provide for those quality teachers, the quality \nschools, the kinds of curricula that will make a difference.\n  The reality is that property taxes in this country often determine \nwho gets a quality education and the resources available to provide \nthose services. This amendment strikes at the heart of that to try to \nbring equality, comparability, not identical results and services, but \ncomparable ones.\n  Inequality by geography, race, and class is close to a national \ndisgrace. If you see the difference from one place to another in \nschools across the country, it is hard to understand how we can \ntolerate it. It robs children of equal access to the American promise. \nUnless we address this problem, as the Dodd amendment would begin to \ndo, that inequality in our educational system will grow wider and wider \nthrough time, perpetuating a sense of unfairness in our society. We \nneed to address it up front. This amendment does that.\n  Title I was designed to be the engine of change for low-income school \ndistricts. This amendment would add fuel to that engine, requiring \nStates to ensure that all students receive a comparable education--\nagain, not identical, comparable--regardless of where they live or \ntheir family's income, race, or nationality.\n  In my State of New Jersey, we have been struggling with this promise \nfor the better part of 30 years, providing equal access to a quality \neducation. Thirty years ago we had a case before our State supreme \ncourt, Abbott v. Burke, that found the education offered to urban \nstudents to be ``tragically inadequate'' and ``severely inferior.'' \nThis was a landmark case. The court ordered the most comprehensive set \nof educational rights for urban schoolchildren in the Nation.\n  In New Jersey, we are proud of this ruling. Under Abbott, urban \nstudents have a right to school funding at spending levels of \nsuccessful suburban school districts what they call ``parity \nfunding''--this is what the Dodd-Biden amendment is working towards; \neducationally adequate school facilities; and intensive preschool and \nother supplemental programs to wipe out the disadvantages. These are \nthe basic educational services that every child should expect to have \naccess to and that every child needs to succeed in our society.\n  Fortunately, Abbott has been a success. It is not perfect. We haven't \nmade all of those transitions to comparable outcomes, but New Jersey \nhas made real progress in equalizing the education provided to students \nin our communities. The Federal Government must also play an active \nrole in ensuring that the children who need the most, get the \nmost. Title I has gone a long way. What this amendment is doing is \nasking States on a national basis to do what New Jersey has already \ndone.\n\n  A substantial portion of the debate on this education bill has been \nabout accountability. We demand accountability from students, teachers, \nschools, everybody under the sun, but we also need to demand \naccountability from the States with regard to providing comparable \nfunding, comparable services for our kids so they can get to those \nequal outcomes. For example, starting in third grade, we will begin \ntesting all students, with drastic measures for failing scores. We \nrequire equal outcomes on test scores, but we will not provide equal \nresources. I find that hard to believe. That is not consistent with \nAmerica's sense of fairness. We demand accountability of students, \nteachers, and schools, but we do not address the glaring disparity \nbuilt into the system of how we provide resources to those schools.\n  I support high standards. I support accountability, but \naccountability measures alone are not sufficient to provide an adequate \neducation. We must ensure that every school and every child has the \nlevel of resources necessary for a rigorous education and necessary to \nmeet those standards.\n  It is in this light that I strongly support the Dodd-Biden amendment, \nbecause it goes right at that equality of opportunity, through \nresources, that is critical to ensuring equality of outcomes.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from New Jersey for his very eloquent \nstatement. In my State of Connecticut a real effort has been made to \naddress this issue, as in New Jersey. In Minnesota as well. Many of our \nStates are working hard at this but, as the Senator from New Jersey \nsaid, there is still a huge gap in terms of educational opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Let me just in 3 minutes lend my support to this very important \namendment. I will try to do this a little differently. I think this \namendment that is offered by Senator Dodd, joined by Senator Biden, is, \nat least to me, obvious. This is an amendment offered by a Senator who \nspends a lot of time in schools. Not every Senator does. Senator Dodd \nis in schools all the time in Connecticut and probably around the \ncountry.\n  What Senator Dodd is saying is this comparability amendment has to do \nwith making sure we deal with--and I am sure that the most noted author \nof children's education, Jonathan Kozol, is smiling. This is all about \nhis book ``Savage Inequality.'' What the Senator is saying is let us \nhave some comparability when it comes to class size, access to \ntechnology, safe schools, curriculum, and teachers.\n  I would just say to Senator Dodd that as we have gone forward with \nthis bill, I have had all of these e-mails from around the country from \nall of these teachers, sometimes parents, sometimes students, but these \nteachers are the ones who know, these are the teachers who are--I think \nthe Senator's sister is a teacher in fact--in the inner-city schools. \nThey are in the trenches. They have stayed with it. They are totally \ncommitted. They are saying: For God's sake, please, also in the Senate, \nabove and beyond talking about annual testing, give us the tools to \nmake sure the children can achieve. Please talk about the importance of \ngood teachers, qualified teachers. Please talk about the importance of \naccess to technology. Please talk about the importance of good \ncurriculum, of small class size. Please talk about the importance of \ndividing school buildings. Please talk about the importance that \nschools should be safe. Please talk about all of the resources that \nwill make it possible for all the children in America to have the same \nopportunity to learn.\n  That is what this amendment is about. That is why this amendment is \nso important.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, if I \nmay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we discussed this amendment a little bit \nyesterday--in fact, considerably yesterday--and I presented most of my \nthoughts. I know some other Members on my side are going to come down \nand talk about it. This amendment is an incredibly pervasive amendment \nand will have a fundamental effect on the Federal role in education. It \nwill, in my\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\nopinion, create an atmosphere where the Federal Government is \nessentially nationalizing the standards throughout the country for what \neducation will be.\n  The way it does this is as follows: It says that every school \ndistrict in a State must be comparable, and it is up to the State to \ndecide that comparability. But if the State doesn't decide the \ncomparability, then the Federal Government starts to withdraw the \nfunds. And it also sets up the standards for what must be comparable. \nIt is a Federal standard--what must be comparable under this amendment. \nThe standard includes class size, qualifications of teachers by \ncategory of assignments, curriculum, range of courses offered, \ninstructional material, instructional resources.\n  You essentially are saying the Federal Government is going to require \ncomparability--comparability meaning that everybody does it essentially \nthe same way--throughout the country, or at least throughout every \nState, within every State. Logically, the next step is to do it across \nthe country from State to State.\n  As I mentioned last night, why should the State of Connecticut be \nallowed to spend more on its children than the State of Mississippi? \nShould it not all be comparable? Under the logic of this amendment, \nthat is the next step. Connecticut should send money to Mississippi. \nThe same amount you spend per child in Connecticut should be spent on \nthe child in Mississippi.\n  But more importantly than that, or equally important to that, this \ngoes to the heart of what I think is the essential of quality education \nwhich is the uniqueness and creativity of the local community to \ncontrol how their children are educated. One town in a State is going \nto have a certain set of ideas on how education should be provided \nversus another town in that State.\n  Granted, they are all going to have to get their children to a \ncertain level of ability in the core subject matter--English, math, \nscience--in order that the children be competitive. But how they get \ntheir children up to that level of competency is left up to the school \ndistrict under our bill. The local school district has the flexibility. \nAnd then the ancillary aspects of the school system are left up to the \nschool districts--ancillary being integral in the sense of foreign \nlanguages, for example, computer science teaching, sports programs, \ncommunity outreach programs.\n  But under this amendment, that would no longer be the case. There \nwould have to be comparability. Every town and community within the \nState would have to do it the same way in all these different areas of \ndiscipline.\n  So in one part of the State you might have a community that believes, \nbecause of the ethnic makeup of the city or the community, they need \nspecial reading instruction in one language --say, Spanish or Greek--\nbecause they have a large community of immigrants, of people who have \nimmigrated to our country, and in another part of the State they may \nnot have that issue but they may have an issue of wanting to get their \nchildren up to speed in the area of the industry which dominates that \nregion--say, forestry. For example, they might want to have a special \nprogram in how to do proper silviculture. You could not do that \nanymore. You could not have those different approaches to education \nwithin the school system. They would all have to be comparable under \nthis amendment.\n  It makes absolutely no sense that we as the Federal Government should \nset that sort of standard on the States and on the local communities.\n  Then there are a couple of very specific issues where this amendment \nclearly creates a huge threat. The first is charter schools. This \namendment essentially eliminates the capacity to have charter schools \nbecause charter schools, by definition, differ. That is why charter \nschools are created. They are different. That is what you have with a \ncharter school. You get together a group of parents, teachers, and kids \nand say: We are going to teach differently than local schools. We are \ngoing to do it with public money. We are talking about public charter \nschools here. But we are going to do it differently. Those schools \nwould be wiped out because you could not be different. You would have \nto be comparable. And the magnet schools would be wiped out, schools \nthat are designed specifically to educate in special subject matters \nsuch as science.\n  You have these famous science high schools across this country. I \nthink they have one in New York City called Stuyvesant. They have one \nin North Carolina which has been hugely successful. And they have one \nright here in the Washington region called Thomas Jefferson. Magnet \nschools would be wiped out because they are different. You are not \nallowed to be different under the amendment. That is the theme of this \namendment. If you do not have sameness, you do not have fairness.\n  I have to say I do not believe that is true at all. I think you get \nfairness by producing results. You get fairness by producing results, \nnot by controlling the input but by controlling the output.\n  If a child goes through the system and learns effectively, then you \nhave fairness. If a child does not go through the system and learn \neffectively, then you do not have fairness.\n  What this underlying bill does and what the President proposes is to \nrequire that children learn effectively, not require that all children \nbe taught exactly the same way, because one does not necessarily learn \nthat way. There are a lot of school systems that feel that way.\n  Then we have another major issue which is called the collective \nbargaining system. In one part of a State, for example, they might have \nan agreement with their local teachers union that says: We are going to \nhave 20 kids in a classroom, but we are going to pay our teachers a lot \nmore because we think our teachers are able to handle 20 kids and are \ngood teachers.\n  In another part of the State, they might have 15 kids in the \nclassroom and pay their teachers less, or they might work on a \ndifferent day schedule, might work on a different structure of their \nday, or might work on a different responsibility from area to area \nwithin a State as to what teachers do.\n  They may have a program where teachers are required to, under their \ncontract, be involved in extracurricular activities, and in other parts \nof the State that might not be the case.\n  There are different retirement standards from community to community. \nSome communities may want their teachers to retire at an earlier age, \nand some communities may not. It all depends on the collective \nbargaining agreement.\n  Collective bargaining agreements would be inconsistent with this \namendment. In fact, it would be a Catch-22 for a State that does not \ncollectively bargain its teachers statewide. I do not know too many \nStates that do collectively bargain their teachers statewide. Most \nStates bargain community by community, not State by State. So this \nbecomes a totally--I do not know if it becomes unenforceable; maybe it \noverrides the collective bargaining agreement.\n  I do not know how the sponsor of the amendment intends to handle that \nvery significant problem, but it is a big problem because comparability \nclearly cannot work if there is a collective bargaining agreement in \none part of the State which presents one significantly different \napproach than another part of the State. They then cannot be comparable \nand consistent with the collective bargaining agreement.\n  This amendment is first, obviously, a philosophical anathema to my \nview of how to educate in this country, which is we should maintain and \npromote local control; we should not undermine local control by \nrequiring everybody to do everything the same.\n  That is the key problem with the amendment, but it also has huge \ntechnical implications for the creativity of local communities in the \narea of charter schools, magnet schools, different curricular activity \nthat might be appropriate to one region over another region or \ndifferent fiscal activity, structure.\n  For example, I suspect a school in southern California does not need \nthe same heating system as a school in northern California, and yet \nunder this amendment they have to have the same heating system. They \nwould have to actually have the same heating system because they would \nhave to have the same resources, the same buildings.\n  That is the way it is written. It says it has to be comparable. It \nsays the\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\nphysical facilities have to be comparable. Institutional resources have \nto be comparable.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on this point?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague. This is an important point. Again, I \nhave great affection for my friend from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am yielding for a question.\n  Mr. DODD. Yielding for a question. As my colleague must be aware--and \nthis is in the form of a question, Mr. President--we have had the word \n``comparable'' on the books regarding school districts for 36 years. \nThe law has said that within school districts, educational opportunity \nmust be comparable.\n  Is it not true, I ask my friend from New Hampshire, that magnet \nschools, charter schools, and science schools have all functioned \nwithin school districts with a Federal law that has required or \nmandated comparable educational opportunity?\n  I am not changing that. I am just extending the geography from school \ndistricts to States. I am not applying any new standards from those \nthat have existed in the law for more than three decades.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Connecticut \nraising that issue because the fact is he has taken the term \n``comparability,'' which is today used in an extremely narrow \napplication and in a very loose enforcement application--in other \nwords, it applies simply to communities and it applies to teachers \nessentially and to curriculum within the teaching community--it has \nbeen extremely loosely applied to communities, and the Senator from \nConnecticut has taken that word and has expanded it radically to \nessentially the whole State.\n  The Senator from Connecticut uses as an example, for example, the New \nHampshire Supreme Court decision in this area which did exactly that. \nIt expanded the issue of funding and equality of funding radically \nthroughout the whole State so everybody had to do it the same way, \nchanging the whole system of education within the State of New \nHampshire.\n  Senator Dodd is suggesting doing the same thing with the word \n``comparable'' on a statewide basis and having the Federal Government \ncome in and set what the term ``comparability'' means now in a much \nmore precise and mandatory way.\n  When he uses terms in his amendment such as ``comparability,'' among \nother things, shall include:\n\n       (i) class size and qualifications of teachers (by category \n     of assignment, such as regular education, special education, \n     and bilingual education) and professional staff;\n       (ii) curriculum, the range of courses offered (including \n     the opportunity to participate in rigorous courses such as \n     advanced placement courses), and instructional materials and \n     instructional resources to ensure that participating children \n     have the opportunity to achieve to the highest student \n     performance levels under the State's challenging content and \n     student performance standards;\n       (iii) accessibility to technology; and\n       (iv) the safety of school facilities. . . .\n\n  That is getting pretty specific and inclusive and much different from \nthe way comparability is used in present law. That is a fact.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield further, he has \njust recited very accurately the provision on page 2 of the amendment \nof things under ``Written Assurances'':\n\n       A State shall be considered to have met the requirements \n     [of this amendment] if such State has filed with the \n     Secretary a written assurance that such State has established \n     and implemented policies to ensure comparability of services \n     in certain areas.\n\n  If my colleague reads further down to ``class size,'' we do not say \nwhat class size, what qualifications. We all know, and I ask my \ncolleague this in the form of a question, is there anywhere in this \nlanguage where it sets class size, where it sets the standard by the \nFederal Government, other than saying the State should have \ncomparability of those standards without setting the standard?\n  Mr. GREGG. Absolutely. That is the whole point. If I may reclaim my \ntime. That is exactly what this does. It says that a State must have a \ncomparable class size across that State, which means a State such as \nCalifornia, which is a huge State and which may have variations in \nclass size depending on what communities have decided is best, both by \nnegotiating with their teachers union and working with their students, \ntheir parents, and their teachers those States now are not going to be \nable to do that any longer, those communities are not going to be able \nto do that any longer. They are going to have to set one class size for \nthe entire State, comparable across the State.\n  Curriculum: For example, I cannot imagine anything more intrusive \nthan having the States say unilaterally you have to have a comparable \ncurriculum on all the different categories of curriculum. There may be \nsome communities that do not believe they need a curriculum that deals \nwith some of these core issues. Obviously, on core issues such as math, \nscience, and English, they are going to have comparable curriculums. \nHopefully, you will not. Maybe they will not. Maybe some States will \nlet some type of American history be taught in one section and another \ntype of American history be taught in a different section. American \nhistory should be consistent.\n  There are other issues. What about languages? They might want to \nteach Japanese in San Francisco, but maybe in San Diego they want to \nteach Chinese or Spanish.\n  The comparability language is so pervasive that it basically takes \neverything and makes oneness, which was the point of the argument of \nthe Senator from Connecticut to begin with. I do not see how he can \nargue against his own position, which is he believes that in order for \npeople to be tested and to be held to a standard, then everybody has to \nhave equal access to the same opportunities of curriculum, class size, \nand structure--everything has to be essentially at the same level. That \nwas his argument, was it not?\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague let me respond without asking a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. On the Senator's time I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DODD. I think I am out of time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving my time, Mr. President, what is the time \nsituation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 14 minutes, \nand the Senator from Connecticut has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on my time, the point I am making --in fact, \nwe debated this yesterday--Is that the words ``comparable'' and \n``identical'' are not synonymous. ``Comparable'' allows for great \nlatitude. We have mandated comparability within school districts.\n  If you take the school districts of Los Angeles and New York, there \nare more students in each of those school districts than in 27 \ndifferent States. They have found it very workable to have reached \ncomparable levels of educational opportunity within a very diverse \nstudent population, in the city of New York and the city of Los \nAngeles, to cite two examples.\n  There are plenty of other school districts that have student \npopulations vastly in excess of the entire student populations of \nStates that have dealt with this requirement for years.\n  My point is, States bear a responsibility in educating children. This \nbill, and legislation preceding it over the years, has mandated that \nteachers, parents, students, school boards, and school superintendents \nbe accountable and responsible. We are asking it of ourselves at the \nFederal Government. My amendment merely says, should we not also ask \nour States to be accountable for the equal educational opportunity of \nall children? That is all.\n  We have laid out some basic commonsense standards without mandating \nwhat the standard should specifically. For example, individual science \nschools exist in Los Angeles and New York. My colleague mentioned \nStuyvesant High School. When the Federal Government said ``comparable'' \nin the school district of New York, it did not wipe out Bedford \nStuyvesant High School. That school has done well under a Federal \nmandate of comparability.\n  We are mandating there be better performance, but if we don't say to \nStates, as much as we are saying to school districts, that there has to \nbe a comparable educational opportunity, we are setting a standard that \npoor communities, rural and urban, will not meet.\n  In New Hampshire, the supreme court decision was most eloquent in\n\n[[Page S5913]]\n\npointing out it was wrong to mandate that a small, poor community be \nrequired to increase its property tax fourfold to meet those \nresponsibilities without the State stepping forward.\n  The court said that ``[T]o hold otherwise would be to . . . conclude \nthat it is reasonable, in discharging a State obligation, to tax \nproperty owners in one town or city as much as four times the amount \ntaxed to others similarly situated in other towns or cities.''\n  It is an eloquent statement.\n  In closing, I thank my colleagues from New Jersey and Minnesota for \ntheir support and ask all my colleagues to join me, Senator Biden, and \nSenator Reed, in supporting this amendment to provide equal educational \nopportunity for all children in a State. This amendment is supported by \nthe National PTA, the National Education Association, the Council of \nthe Great City Schools, which represents the largest 50 school \ndistricts in the country, and the Leadership Conference for Civil \nRights, which includes 180 prominent organizations, such as the AARP, \nthe American Association of University Women, the AFL-CIO, the American \nFederation of Teachers, the American Veterans Committee, Catholic \nCharities USA, the NAACP, the National Council of Jewish Women, the \nNational Council of La Raza, the National Urban League, the YMCA, the \nYWCA, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the Senator 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I am hopeful we can vote on this amendment. We debated \nyesterday afternoon, we debated yesterday evening, and this morning. I \nam fully prepared to have a vote and go to the next amendment and get \nthe education bill done. The President wants the education bill to be \npassed.\n  I know my colleague, the chairman of the committee, is anxious to \nmove this along. I am confident the Republican leader is as well. I am \nhopeful this amendment can be considered and voted up or down and that \nwe move to the next order of business.\n  I ask the question, Can we vote? We have debated the issue. I am \nprepared to debate longer, but I made my case on why I think \naccountability and responsibility belong to everyone, including the \nState.\n  I ask my colleague and friend from New Hampshire, is there any chance \nwe might have a vote on this amendment some time soon?\n  Mr. GREGG. No.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate the candor of that answer. People from New \nHampshire are noted for their brevity in coming right to the point. He \ndoes not gussy it up with trappings and garnishes.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his description.\n  This amendment goes to the heart of this bill. I don't think the \nimpact this amendment will have on changing the focus of the \nPresident's proposals on education as negotiated between a variety of \nparties involved in the negotiation can be understated.\n  There was an agreed to set of principles laid down. The basic \nphilosophy of those principles was that we were going to look at how \nthe child did, whether the child actually learned more, whether the \nlow-income child was in a better competitive position relative to peers \nand educational success. We were going to allow flexibility of the \nlocal school systems, subject to assuring through assessment standards \nand accountability standards that the children were improving.\n  That was the flow: Focus on the child, flexibility, expect academic \nachievement, and subject it to accountability so we knew it was \nworking. A lot of work went into this concept. The President's ideas \nare aggressive and creative and they will take the Federal Government \nin a different direction. We will go away from command and control and \ngo toward output. We will go away from trying to find out how many \nbooks are in a classroom, how big the classroom should be, and how many \nteachers are in the classroom to seeing how much a child is learning \nand making sure when that child learns they are learning something \nrelative to them and that they are staying with their peers. We will \ngive parents more authority and flexibility and capacity to participate \nin the education of their children and to have some say when their \nchildren are stuck in schools that are failing.\n  These are themes that are critical to improving Federal education. \nThis amendment goes in the exact opposite direction. I used the term \n``nationalization'' yesterday. I don't think that is too strong. This \nis an attempt to assert a national policy essentially on all school \ndistricts in this country. That is extremely pervasive and requires a \ncookie-cutter approach to education and takes away local control. \nTherefore, the amendment essentially does fundamental harm which is \nirreparable to this bill, in my opinion. That is why we have such \nsevere reservations.\n  I yield such time remaining to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will speak and give the floor to the Senator from Maine \nwhen she arrives.\n  I believe this amendment is one that we absolutely must defeat if we \nstick with the principles of flexibility of local control, of shifting \nthe power of review locally instead of federally. The underlying \nprinciple that is critically important to the BEST bill which the \nPresident has set out in his agenda, discussed often in this bill, is \nleaving no child behind.\n  There are basically two issues that bother me most about this \namendment. No. 1, as I mentioned, the power of review has shifted to \nthe Federal Government, the Department of Education, to Washington, DC, \nand, No. 2, this amendment would broaden the intrusiveness of local \ncontrol. Those principles are exactly opposite of what President Bush \nhas put forward, what most Americans believe, and that is local \ncontrol, less Government intrusiveness, and more accountability.\n  In terms of intent, the amendment is clearly positive. It is \nhonorable. The intent is that every student receives an equal \neducation. The problem is the specifics of how that intent is \naccomplished--again, more Federal oversight instead of local, and more \nintrusiveness.\n  What does it mean? It means in a State such as Tennessee, if there is \na rural school that has no limited-English-proficient students, they \nwill still have to have as many bilingual education teachers as a \nschool, say, in Nashville, TN. That sort of vagueness about what \ncomparability means ultimately is translated down into something very \nspecific which simply does not make sense to me when you look within a \nState--for example, Tennessee.\n\n  How will a State measure comparability of teacher qualifications, of \nseniority, of level of education? I ask, regarding the services \nidentified--teachers, instruction materials, technology service, the \nschool safety services, the bilingual education services--how do we \nknow those are the absolute answers to all students? We simply do not. \nI believe the only strings attached to Federal dollars should be those \nthat insist on demonstrable results.\n  I see the Senator from Maine has arrived. We only have about 4 \nminutes left, so I will yield to her. But let me just close and say \ninstead of funding institutions, instead of concentrating on services \nand inputs, instead of monitoring progress versus regulations, we \nabsolutely must focus on student achievement--something which this \namendment does not do. It aggravates the situation and moves in the \nopposite direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am happy to ask consent for 10 minutes \nevenly divided, if that is agreeable. This is a very important \namendment. Would that be sufficient time? I ask for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut is such a \nstrong advocate for our Nation's children. I have enjoyed working with \nhim on so many issues. But as much as I admire him and share his \ncommitment, I do rise in opposition to the amendment of Senator Dodd.\n  This amendment, although it is very well intentioned, is contrary to \nthe goal of this education reform bill which is to give more \nflexibility to local schools and to States while holding them \naccountable for what really\n\n[[Page S5914]]\n\ncounts, and that is student achievement, ensuring that every child is \nlearning, that no child is left behind.\n  Comparability of services is a concept that was created to make sure \nthat title I schools get services comparable to those received in \nnontitle I schools. But the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut \nsimply goes too far. It would, for example, require States to ensure \ncomparability among schools in class size, in qualifications of \nteachers by category of assignments such as regular education, special \neducation, bilingual education. It would mandate the same courses be \noffered, the range of courses, and how rigorous they are. It is \nextraordinarily prescriptive. It really turns on its head the whole \nidea of leaving to States and local communities the issues of \ncurriculum design and teacher qualifications.\n  For example, we know very well the needs of schools vary from \ncommunity to community. My brother, Sam Collins, is chair of the school \nboard in Caribou, ME, my hometown. Through his efforts and efforts of \nother local leaders, the school system has established a bilingual \neducation program in the elementary schools. It is a wonderful program. \nBut under the Dodd amendment, that program would have to exist in every \nschool in Maine. That is just not practical.\n\n  Similarly, in Portland, ME, we have a large number of students with \nlimited English proficiency. That means there is a great need for ESL \nteachers and bilingual teachers in that school system. But in other \nmore rural parts of Maine that need simply doesn't exist.\n  This amendment simply is impractical. It is just not workable, in \naddition to being contrary to the concept of allowing those who know \nour students best--our local school boards, our teachers, our parents, \nour principals, our superintendents of schools--to design the \ncurriculum and provide the courses and other needs for a local school.\n  Schools differ. One school may need a gifted and talented program; \nanother may need to improve its library; still another may need to \nestablish an ESL program. In short, one size does not fit all. Yet that \nis the implication and the premise of the amendment of the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  This amendment would shift the power away from local communities and \nlocal school boards to Washington. We want to, instead, empower local \ncommunities to make the right decisions and then, very importantly, \nhold them accountable for results. We want to change the focus from \npaperwork and process and regulation and, instead, focus on what really \nmatters, and that is ensuring that every child in America gets the very \nbest education possible.\n  We want to do that by holding schools and States accountable, not by \ntelling them what courses they need to have, not by prescribing every \nrule, every regulation. Let's trust our teachers and our local school \nboard members. Let's trust the local teachers and superintendents. They \nknow best what is needed.\n  I urge opposition to the amendment of my colleague, Senator Dodd. \nAgain, he is a strong advocate for our Nation's schools, and I have \nenjoyed working with him, but I believe his amendment goes too far and \nis misguided.\n  I retain the remainder of our time for our side, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we return to debate on the Dodd-Biden \namendment, I want to clarify for Members just what the amendment does \nand add two points that were not made yesterday.\n  The amendment conditions title I state administration funds--1 \npercent of total state funds--on a written assurance that \n``comparable,'' not identical, essential education services, such as \nteacher quality and access to technology, are provided across \ndistricts. States have up to four years to comply. If a state fails to \nsend a simple written assurance to the Secretary, their administrative \nfunds are withheld. Once a state sends a written assurance, any \npreviously withheld funds are returned. All a state has to do is file a \npiece of paper. I think the amendment is too modest frankly in not \nallowing the Secretary to engage in a more searching inquiry into \nwhether the written assurance actually reflects a comparable education \nbeing offered.\n  This amendment is still groundbreaking, however. Since 1965, we have \nrequired individual school districts to provide a written assurance \nthat they are offering a comparable regular education in title I and \nnon-title I schools. We have never asked states to assure that \ncomparable services are provided among schools in different school \ndistricts. This amendment does. Whereas all title I program funds are \nconditioned on local compliance currently, only title I state \nadministration are conditioned under the Dodd-Biden amendment.\n  There are two additional points, which were not raised yesterday, \nthat I would like to add. First, state after state repeatedly has found \nitself back in state court because of its failure to provide a \ncomparable educational opportunity across districts. A State Supreme \nCourt orders improvement. Some improvement is made. But then progress \nquickly erodes. And the parents of poor children have to go back to \ncourt. Since 1968, there have been five iterations of the Serrano case \nin California, six of the Abbott case in New Jersey, and five of the \nEdgewood case in Texas.\n  This amendment is significant in not just requiring states to provide \na comparable opportunity, but in actually reaching into the state's \nfederal pocketbook if it resists. Maybe when there are federal \nfinancial consequences for state resistance to State supreme courts, \nstates will do a better job of complying with judicial orders.\n  Second, the Senator from New Hampshire yesterday repeated an old and \noutdated argument that ``education is not a formula where more dollars \nequal better results.'' We have known for a long time though that money \nwell spend does make a difference. In fact, the last time we \nreauthorized ESEA, we had a series of hearings on this issue.\n  We heard as far back as 1993, that increased education spending \ntargeted to critical areas like teacher quality have a profound effect \non student achievement. This is what we heard from Dr. Ronald Ferguson \nof Harvard University after studying teacher quality and student \nassessment results in every Texas school district.\n\n       A measure of teachers' literacy skills explains roughly 25 \n     percent of the variation among Texas school districts in \n     students' average reading and math scores on statewide \n     standardized exams. . . . Better literacy skills among \n     teachers, fewer large classes, and more teachers with five or \n     more years experience all predict better [test] scores.\n\n  Deep down every United States Senator knows what every parent and \nteacher knows--that resources matter in education. If resources didn't \nmatter, we wouldn't mind sending our children and grandchildren to the \npoorest schools. If resources didn't matter, people wouldn't fight \n``Robin Hood'' plans that equalize spending by taking from the wealthy \ndistricts to give to the poor. Now I don't think we should equalize \nspending down by taking money from some communities and giving it to \nothers. I think we should equalize up by sending more targeted \neducation resources to the communities that are deprived. I hope the \nPresident and the other side will join us in that effort to boost \neducation spending overall.\n  Every child deserves a fair chance.\n  I am rather amazed at these statements that are made on the floor \nabout how this undermines the President's initiatives, because to the \ncontrary, this does not interfere with any of the President's \ninitiatives. I think it gives much more life to the President's \ninitiative, because Senator Dodd's amendment is going to encourage \nStates to provide additional focus and attention to the most needy \nstudents in the State. That is completely consistent with what the \nPresident has stated.\n  I am rather surprised, frankly, by the reaction of our Republican \nfriends because this has been on a list of amendments to be considered \nfor 3 weeks. This is the first amendment about which I have heard our \nRepublican friends indicate we will not get a vote on it. I do not know \nwhat kind of signal that sends. It has been on the list for 3 weeks, \nand 5 minutes ago I heard for the first time the spokesperson for the \nRepublican Party say we are not going to vote on it.\n\n[[Page S5915]]\n\n  I do not know what kind of message that sends in our attempt to try \nto move this legislation, but it certainly is not a useful one or a \nconstructive one.\n  I ask my friends on the other side to reread the language of the \namendment. It says:\n\n       A State shall be considered to have met the requirements . \n     . . if such State has filed with the Secretary a written \n     assurance that such State has established and implemented \n     policies to ensure comparability among schools . . . .\n\n  All they have to do is file the statement. This is not like the \nexisting legislation that requires the Secretary to have approval on \nState tests. That is real power. Or that the Secretary has to approve \nthe State's findings in terms of standards. That is real power. Or the \nfact the Secretary will make a judgment on a State's application for \nStraight A's authority. That is real power. Those are decisions that \nwill be made here in Washington.\n  But to confuse that kind of authority and power with the language \nhere is most unfortunate. Why are they so excited about this? I can't \nunderstand why they are so excited so early in the morning about this \nlanguage? All this amendment says is that States have to file a written \nassurance. That's it. That's compliance.\n  I reiterate that we have had hearings on this issue in the past. We \nhad days of hearings on school finance. The record of those hearings is \nprinted in Senate 103-254. This is not a new concept. This is not a new \nidea. We have accepted the concept of comparability at the local \nlevels. All this is doing is saying what I think the President wants to \ndo; that is, he wants accountability statewide.\n  We want accountability for the children so they are going to work \nhard and study hard. We want accountability for the teachers to make \nsure we are going to have teachers who are going to get professional \ndevelopment. We want accountability for States in developing standards, \nand accountability that the States are going to develop tests that are \ngoing to be high-quality tests.\n  We have accountability here in the Congress to try to afford the \nresources to be able to help these children.\n  All the Senator from Connecticut is saying is let's have \naccountability. Let's have accountability for the States as well to be \na part of a team. Most parents would want their children to learn. \nLearning should be a partnership with the local, State, and the Federal \nresponse in areas of the neediest children in this country.\n  I think this enhances the President's initiative. This carries it to \nan additional level. I hope he would be on the phone calling our \nfriends and saying let's have a unanimous, favorable vote for this \nparticular provision.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 459, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I send a modification of my \namendment to the desk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 459), as further modified, is as follows:\n       On page 135, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       (d) Section 1120A (20 U.S.C. 6322) is amended by inserting \n     the following after subsection (d):\n       ``(e) Comparability of Services.--\n       ``(1) In general.--(A) A State that receives funds under \n     this part shall provide services in schools receiving funds \n     under this part that, taken as a whole, are at least \n     comparable to services in schools that are not receiving \n     funds under this part.\n       ``(B) A State shall meet the requirements of subparagraph \n     (A) on a school-by-school basis.\n       ``(2) Written assurance.--(A) A State shall be considered \n     to have met the requirements of paragraph (1) if such State \n     has filed with the Secretary a written assurance that such \n     State has established and implemented policies to ensure \n     comparability among schools.\n       ``(B) A State need not include unpredictable changes in \n     student enrollment or personnel assignments that occur after \n     the beginning of a school year in determining comparability \n     of services under this subsection.\n       ``(3) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to require a jurisdiction to increase its property \n     tax or other tax rates.\n       ``(4) Effective date.--A State shall comply with the \n     requirements of this subsection by not later than the \n     beginning of the 2005-2006 school year.\n       ``(5) Waivers.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A State may request, and the Secretary \n     may grant, a waiver of the requirements of this subsection \n     for a period of up to 2 years for exceptional circumstances, \n     such as a precipitous decrease in State revenues or other \n     circumstances that the Secretary deems exceptional that \n     prevent a State from complying with the requirements of this \n     paragraph.\n       ``(B) Contents of waiver request.--A State that requests a \n     waiver under subparagraph (A) shall include in the request--\n       ``(i) a description of the exceptional circumstances that \n     prevent the State from complying with the requirements of \n     this subsection; and\n       ``(ii) a plan that details the manner in which the State \n     will comply with such requirements by the end of the waiver \n     period.\n       ``(6) Technical assistance.--The Secretary shall, upon the \n     request of a State and regardless of whether the State has \n     requested a waiver under paragraph (5), provide technical \n     assistance to the State concerning compliance with the \n     requirements of this subsection.\n       ``(7) Sanctions.--If a State fails to comply with the \n     requirements of this subsection, the Secretary shall withhold \n     funds for State administration until such time as the \n     Secretary determines that the State is in compliance with \n     this subsection.''\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I discussed the amendment with my good \nfriend from New Hampshire. The way I have dealt with the modification \nis to take out the section that speaks to the specific kinds of \ncomparability issues such as class size, teachers, and the like. My \nintention was not to suggest we ought to have identical class size \nstandards set by the Federal Government or to mandate how States should \nprovide equal educational opportunity, but rather to ensure that they \ndo provide it. Therefore, I have left the language basically as it has \nbeen for 36 years when dealing with school districts; that is, achieve \ncomparability of educational opportunities, except to apply it to \nStates, as well.\n  As I pointed out, we have school districts in this country that have \nstudent populations in excess of the population of 27 States, and they \nhave been able to deal with comparability, without, to use the example \nthat concerned my friend from New Hampshire, infringing upon charter \nschools or magnet schools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the request be \nmodified to add 1 additional minute on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friend and \ncolleague from Massachusetts on this issue. He makes the point very \nclearly. This is not radical. We are asking for accountability and \nresponsibility by everybody when it comes to education. We are assuming \nit here at the Federal level with the underlying bill. We are requiring \nit of young children in the third grade and on, their parents, \nteachers, schools, and school boards. I am only saying that States must \nbe part of this equation. That is all this is--to provide for \ncomparable educational opportunity at the State level as we have \nrequired for 36 years at a district level. We leave to the Secretary \nthe discretion about how much to withhold administrative funds--not \nfunds to children--if necessary. For States to provide assurances that \nthey are moving to achieve comparability is not radical. That is common \nsense. We are asking to test everybody in America. We ought to ask the \nStates to take a little test as well.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I withdraw my request for the nays and yeas.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me summarize the problem. I appreciate \nthe fact that the Senator from Connecticut has modified his amendment.\n\n[[Page S5916]]\n\nI appreciate him doing that and taking out some of the language that is \nmost onerous in the amendment. But the amendment still accomplishes \nessentially the same thing, which is creating a Federal standard \nrequiring every State to set up comparability standards. There are a \nlot of States in this country and a lot of communities in this country \nwhich do not agree that comparability is appropriate; that believe the \nStates should have flexibility from community to community to decide \nhow they operate their school system. Local control is the essence of \neducation. If a State decides it wants comparability, or its supreme \ncourt decides that, or the State legislature decides that, fine. That \nis certainly their responsibility and their right. They operate school \nsystems. They pay for 97 percent of the school systems, and they should \nbe able to do that. They do that. The Supreme Court did that in the \narea of funding. But it is not the role of the Federal Government to \ncome in after paying 6 percent of the cost of the school system and say \nto States that every State has to have comparability within their \nState. It is a huge intrusion of the Federal role in the role of \neducation.\n\n  For that reason, it goes, as I mentioned earlier, directly in the \nopposite direction from what the theme of this bill is. I am not going \nto reiterate that because I just said it 10 or 15 minutes ago. But that \nis the problem of the amendment. It is incredibly intrusive, and it \ngoes in the direct opposite direction from where this bill is going.\n  That is why we on our side strongly oppose it and believe it is \ninconsistent with the agreement that was reached. We need to think \nabout it a little bit longer before we decide how we are going to \ndispose of it.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Connecticut withdrawing his request for \nthe yeas and nays. Maybe as we move down the road, we can figure out a \nway to more appropriately handle this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of our time on this amendment.\n\n\n Amendment Nos. 356, 401, 434, 513 as modified, 642, 643 as modified, \n363 as modified, 638 as modified, 354 as modified, 418 as modified, and \n             633 as modified En Bloc, to Amendment no. 358\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are now going to go to the Nelson-\nCarnahan amendment. But today I am happy to report that we have another \npackage of cleared amendments. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that \nit be in order for these amendments to be considered en bloc, and any \nmodification, where applicable, be agreed to, the amendments be agreed \nto, en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, en \nbloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we must never let any of our children \nslip through the cracks of the education system. That's why a yardstick \nof performance is needed. It's why rigorous accountability and \nincreased testing have become cornerstones of the education debate. I \nstrongly support testing to help us measure the progress of our \nNation's students.\n  Missouri is at the forefront of using testing to drive education \nreform. Since 1993, Missouri educators have worked hard to shape a \ntesting structure called the Missouri Assessment Program.\n  These tests measure progress in math, communication arts, science, \nand social studies as well as a variety of skills. Each of the four \ncore subject areas is tested in three grade levels. In each of these \ngrade levels, every child is tested.\n  I commend Missouri educators on creating a superb testing instrument.\n  Each child's development is gauged on an individual, case-by-case \nbasis as well as in relation to other students across the Nation.\n  By contrast, under President Bush's plan, States would be required to \ntest every child annually in grades 3-8.\n  In Missouri, this would require tremendous cost.\n  In communication arts, for example--which tests reading, as well as \nwriting ability, punctuation, spelling, and thought organization--\nMissouri currently tests kids in grades 3, 7, and 11. Under the new \nrequirement, the State would have to develop new tests for grades 4, 5, \n6, and 8. The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education \nestimates that initial development costs would be approximately $3.5 \nmillion and ongoing development costs would be an additional $1.2 \nmillion per year.\n  About another $5 million would be required to develop new math tests, \nand a new science test would be even more expensive. These estimates do \nnot even include the costs of implementing, scoring, and analyzing \nthese tests. In the end, the annual costs for Missouri may exceed $15 \nmillion per year.\n  The ESEA legislation that we are now debating, however, would provide \nfor the entire Nation $400 million per year for developing and \nimplementing the new tests. But the truth is that we don't know exactly \nhow much the new tests will cost.\n  The National Association of State Boards of Education has estimated \nthe total national costs to be between $2.7 billion and $7 billion over \n7 years.\n  The reality is that when it comes to the cost of these new tests, we \nare looking at a huge question mark. And we face the possibility that \nthere could be a tremendous gap between funding available for these new \ntests and funding needed. This uncertainty places an unfair burden on \nour local districts and schools.\n\n  Last month, I joined my Senate colleagues in supporting full funding \nfor the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA.\n  As did my colleagues, I heeded the cry of local educators and parents \nwho told us that Congress had not fulfilled its promise to fund 420 \npercent of IDEA. They told us that this failure had drained local \ndistricts of already scarce funds. They told us that these \ncircumstances hurt the students in our schools. After years of delay, \nwe raised our collective voice to recognize that Congress cannot place \nunfunded mandates on our schools.\n  Now, numerous letters have been pouring into my office from \nsuperintendents across Missouri, voicing concern about the cost of the \nnew tests. Let me share some of them with you.\n  One is from David Legaard, the superintendent in Smithville, who \nwrote:\n\n       The Smithville R-II School District supports your efforts. \n     Our school district cannot afford to pay for mandated federal \n     testing programs.\n\n  Don Lawrence, the superintendent in Savannah, MO, wrote:\n\n       Rest assured the local school districts in the state of \n     Missouri do not have access to additional funds to pay for \n     national school testing.\n\n  We should not make the same mistake with testing as we did with IDEA. \nWe simply cannot put our State and local governments in the position of \ndraining local resources to pay for new, unfunded Federal requirements.\n  The amendment I am offering today with my colleague, Senator Ben \nNelson, will ensure that our schools don't bear an unfair burden. The \nidea behind this amendment is straightforward: if new tests are \nrequired by the Federal Government, they should be paid for by the \nFederal Government. States would not be obligated to give the tests in \nany year that the Federal Government fails to provide 100 percent of \nthe funding.\n  The Carnahan-Nelson amendment builds on the Jeffords amendment, which \npassed by a 93-7 margin. I was pleased to support that amendment, but \nin our view it did not provide sufficient protection to State \ngovernments and local educators.\n  The Jeffords amendment provides that States must conduct the new \ntests so long as the Federal Government provides $400 million for \ndesign and implementation costs. The problem is, what happens if the \ncost is twice that amount, or ten times that amount, as some groups are \nestimating? Who will pick up the additional costs?\n  The answer is that our local schools, supported by local tax dollars, \nwill have to pick up the tab for the federally mandated tests. We think \nthat is the wrong policy.\n  Some have argued that this is an ``antitesting'' amendment because it \nlinks a State's obligation to conduct the new tests with full Federal \nfunding.\n  The bill before the Senate already links a State's obligation to test \nto Federal funding. Our amendment merely changes the amount of Federal \nfunding required from the arbitrary figure of $400 million to 100 \npercent of the true cost of testing.\n  Our schools should not have to forego the purchase of textbooks, or \nincreases in teachers' salaries, or the renovation of classrooms so \nthat they can put in place the new tests. If the Federal Government is \ngoing to impose this new requirement, the Federal Government should \nprovide the resources to do it.\n  In addition, our amendment covers science tests, which the current \nbill does not.\n  And, our amendment requires the Secretary of Education to calculate \nthe total costs of complying with the testing mandate so legislators \nknow whether the Federal Government is meeting its obligation to our \nlocal schools.\n  The Governor of Missouri, Bob Holden, has strongly endorsed the \nEliminate Unfunded Mandates amendment. He comments:\n\n       I feel strongly that implementing new testing requirements \n     without the adequate funds in place would be a disservice to \n     the children in Missouri and across the nation . . . If the \n     Federal Government is going to require new testing measures, \n     then the Federal Government should pay 100 percent of all \n     costs.\n\n  Governor Holden's sentiment is echoed in an endorsement letter from \nthe Democratic Governors' Association, which notes that the Carnahan-\nNelson amendment would help ``fulfill [a] historic commitment to \nAmerica's children.''\n  Many Senators have extolled the virtues of testing during this \ndebate. Many have spoken in favor of local control over education \nfunds. If you want to ensure that testing will take place and that our \nlocal schools can spend their own dollars on their own priorities, then \nyou should vote for the Carnahan-Nelson amendment.\n  I am pleased that Senator Baucus and Senator Hollings support this \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that they be added as cosponsors.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S5919]]\n\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                            State of Missouri,\n\n                                 Jefferson City, MO, May 20, 2001.\n       Dear Members of the Senate: I write in strong support of \n     the Carnahan-Nelson amendment to the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act (ESEA).\n       This amendment would ensure that the federal government \n     meets its commitment to states by fully funding the cost of \n     the new ESEA testing requirements. If the federal government \n     did not meet this commitment, states would be released from \n     the obligation to implement the new requirements. The \n     amendment also would require the Secretary of Education to \n     commission and annual report on testing costs.\n       I feel strongly that implementing new testing requirements \n     without the adequate funds in place would be a disservice to \n     the children in Missouri and across the nation. Under these \n     circumstances, state and local governments would be forced to \n     choose between implementing the new testing requirements and \n     cutting costs in other vital education programs. We simply \n     cannot place our schools in the position of choosing between \n     hiring new teachers, purchasing new textbooks, renovating \n     schools and implementing the new tests. If the federal \n     government is going to require new testing measures, then the \n     federal government should pay 100% of all additional costs.\n       This point is especially germane in states that have \n     already implemented strong testing programs. I am proud to \n     note that Missouri has already made great strides in relation \n     to testing and accountability. The Missouri Assessment \n     Program, which assesses students in six subject areas, is the \n     result of painstaking efforts on the part of Missouri \n     educators. I believe that this testing program makes Missouri \n     a leader in the nation in terms of effective testing.\n       Thank you for your attention to this critical matter, and I \n     encourage you to vote in favor of the Carnahan-Nelson \n     amendment. I look forward to working hand-in-hand with \n     Congress and the Administration to ensure that our state \n     testing systems are as effective as possible and that we do \n     our utmost to support the education of our nation's children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bob Holden,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Democratic Governor's Association,\n\n                                     Washingotn, DC, May 22, 2001.\n     Hon. Jean Carnahan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washingotn, DC.\n       Dear Senator Carnahan: On behalf of the nation's Democratic \n     Governors, I am writing in support of the amendment being \n     offered by Senators Carnahan and Nelson to S. 1, the Better \n     Education for Students and Teachers Act (BEST). This \n     amendment would ensure that the federal government meets its \n     commitment to states by fully funding the cost of the new \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) testing \n     requirements.\n       The amendment would replace the $400 million cap authorized \n     for FY 2002 for developing and implementing tests, in the \n     underlying bill, instead requiring the federal government to \n     pay 100% of all state testing costs not currently required \n     under federal law. If the federal government does not meet \n     this commitment, states would be released from the obligation \n     to implement the new testing requirements. The amendment \n     would also require the Secretary of Education to annually \n     calculate the total costs of testing.\n       In addition, the amendment would add a protection that \n     would prohibit the federal government from sanctioning a \n     state for falling behind schedule in designing and \n     implementing tests if the federal government has not provided \n     full funding.\n       While we are pleased to support the Carnahan/Nelson \n     amendment, we are hopeful that any final version of \n     legislation to reauthorize the ESEA will apply a funding \n     trigger more broadly, specifically to include Title I. This \n     is the main source of federal assistance for disadvantaged \n     students and the federal government needs to back its efforts \n     to strengthen accountability with adequate new investment.\n       We would also prefer that final legislation link federal \n     funding accountability to consequences imposed on states and \n     local schools unable to meet proposed annual performance \n     measures, such as fiscal sanctions and school reorganization. \n     Relieving states from the cost of implementing new tests does \n     not alter the mandated levels of improvement in student \n     performance.\n       Democratic Governors urge Congress to fulfill the historic \n     commitment to America's children that the BEST Act represents \n     by fully funding authorized levels of IDEA, Title I, and \n     teacher quality, as well as for testing. We believe that the \n     Carnahan-Nelson amendment helps to ensure this, and we urge \n     that the Senate adopt the amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Gov. Tom Vilsack,\n\n                                                    State of Iowa,\n                                         DGA Vice-Chair of Policy.\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. I am happy to yield the floor for the Senator from \nNebraska to make further comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to ask the \nSenate's support for the Carnahan-Nelson amendment. As my colleague has \nstated, it is a simple, straightforward measure that would require the \nFederal Government to pay 100 percent of the costs of all new federally \nmandated tests that would be required by the pending bill.\n  In any year that the Government fails to provide funding to the \nStates, the States simply would not have to administer the tests, and \nthe States could not be sanctioned for falling behind schedule in \ndeveloping their systems of assessment.\n  Six years ago, Congress passed, and the President signed, the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act. The bill passed the Senate by a vote of \n98-1. This was cause for celebration among the Nation's Governors. We \nhad been urging Congress for a long time to enact this kind of \nlegislation. I took a great deal of personal satisfaction when the law \nwas signed because as the Governor of Nebraska, I had invested years \nurging its passage.\n  As Governor, I testified before committees in both the House and the \nSenate on the problems that were caused by unfunded Federal mandates.\n  I became interested in curbing unfunded Federal mandates the very \nfirst year I sat down to work on my new State budget. As the years went \nby, I often wondered if I had actually been elected Governor of \nNebraska or simply branch manager for the Federal Government. I cannot \ncount the number of times that I had to cut my part of the budget, say \nno to a good project or turn down a group of Nebraskans with good ideas \nbecause all my available revenue was tied up complying with yet one \nmore unfunded Federal mandate handed down by Washington.\n  When the bill passed, I breathed a sigh of relief. In the Senate--\nalso at that time under new leadership--the unfunded Federal mandates \nbill was designated as S. 1, signifying the priority placed on the \nlegislation. Coincidentally, S. 1 is the designation placed on the bill \nwe are currently considering. Senators from both sides of the aisle at \nthat time praised the unfunded mandates bill. One Senator said:\n\n       The result of these mandates is that local governments are \n     forced to abandon their own priorities, to offer fewer \n     services to the public, and to ultimately charge higher taxes \n     and utility rates . . . The solution to the problem of \n     unfunded mandates is to require Congress to pay for any \n     mandate it places on State and local governments.\n\n  Another Senator said:\n\n       This legislation will increase accountability.\n\n  There has been a lot of talk about accountability during the current \ndebate on this bill. We are asking teachers, parents, and schools for \naccountability. We are going to hold States accountable for the money \nthe Federal Government will be spending. But where is the \naccountability from Congress and the White House for the dollars that \nStates are going to have to spend for the testing requirements of this \nbill?\n  I commend Senator Jeffords for his efforts to provide at least \npartial funding for the testing that this bill will require, but I do \nnot believe it will be enough.\n  This bill will require the States to administer 12 different tests \nfor students in grades 3 through 8. It will also require each State to \nparticipate in the NAEP test annually in grades 4 and 8, which accounts \nfor 4 more tests. That is a total of 16 tests per year. As we can see \nfrom this chart, not all States currently administer tests with that \nkind of frequency. Fewer than a third of the States administer reading \nand math tests at all six grade levels each year. Another four States \nconduct reading and math tests at five of those grade levels, three \nStates at four levels, and nine States at three levels. The remaining \n19 States test students annually in reading and math at two or fewer \ngrade levels. If we don't count participation in NAEP, we are requiring \nStates to develop and administer another 216 tests. If we add in NAEP, \nwe are requiring the States to administer 316 tests per year. You get \nthe idea of the magnitude of testing involved in this bill.\n  As the other Senator from Minnesota explained several days ago, if \nthe goal of these tests is to improve education, then you can't give \ncut-rate tests. An inexpensive, off-the-shelf test will not be able to \naccurately tell us how well or how poorly our students are doing. Given \nthe stakes involved, States are not going to be able to administer \ntheir\n\n[[Page S5920]]\n\ntesting on the cheap. These tests are going to cost the States a great \ndeal of money, and they should.\n  In Nebraska, early in my tenure as Governor, we explored the costs of \ntesting students in four core curriculum subjects. We received an \nestimate that ranged from $305 million for a basic test, and up to $13 \nmillion for one that would meet the standards for a good assessment in \na single test. That was almost 10 years ago.\n  Our own experts in Congress, the Congressional Research Service, have \nsaid that complete information on the costs associated with student \ntesting is impossible to obtain. The National Governors' Association \nestimated that these testing requirements could cost States at least \n$900 million. The National Association of State Boards of Education has \nestimated that they could cost between, as my colleague from Missouri \nsaid, $2.7 and $7 billion, well above the $400 million provided for in \nthe bill.\n\n  The chart behind me shows the estimated cost to each State. No one \ncan for sure say how much this will cost the States, as the Senator \nfrom Maine acknowledged yesterday with her amendment. I am willing to \nwager that the roughly $400 million per year that is in the bill, \ndespite the best efforts of the Senator from Vermont, simply will not \nbe enough.\n  I understand that the administration has also circulated some numbers \nthat show that the costs might be less than what is contained in the \nbill. If that is the case, I will be pleased. But if it isn't the case, \nI hope the Senate will in fact adopt the amendment Senator Carnahan and \nI have proposed.\n  Our amendment simply requires the Federal Government to pay 100 \npercent of the cost of all new federally mandated tests. If 100 percent \nof the cost is less than what is currently in the bill, then perhaps we \ncan use the leftovers to hire and train more teachers, which many think \nmight be a good answer to the problem in any event. If 100 percent of \nthe cost is more than the $400 million in the bill, then we have a real \ndilemma.\n  As the bill now stands, States will be responsible for every \nadditional penny that these tests cost. As we have seen, potential \ncosts can be very high.\n  In my State of Nebraska right now, there is not a lot of extra money \navailable. I am sure there is not a lot of money available in the State \nof Missouri or the State of Florida, but there is no shortage of \ncritical needs in the education field in every State. We are facing a \nteacher shortage in Nebraska that is of crisis proportions. Forty \npercent of our teachers, more than 8,000 of them, are going to be \neligible to retire in the next 10 years. Our State won't be able to \nreplace the excellent teachers who are retiring if too much of our \nState's money for education will be used to give tests instead of \nraising teacher's pay and other educational priorities.\n  Nebraska won't be able to meet these critical needs because the extra \nmoney simply isn't there and won't be there. The only alternative in my \nState may be to shift the cost to the taxpayers through higher property \ntaxes. I am here to tell my colleagues that isn't acceptable in \nNebraska.\n  In talking with some of my colleagues about this amendment, I have \nheard some additional concerns that I will address. I would like to be \nclear that neither I nor the Senator from Missouri oppose testing or \nsetting high standards for students. While I was Governor, I severed as \nchairman of the National Education Goals Panel, which is part of the \nGoals 2000 effort, which called for setting high and measurable \nstandards for students. I led in the State, despite some determined \nopposition, for developing strong educational standards in Nebraska.\n  Nor do we have any desire to weaken the accountability provisions of \nthis bill. Our amendment doesn't do that. If our schools aren't \npreparing every child to succeed in the 21st century, then we are \nobligated to fix them.\n  I have no doubt that Nebraska's teachers, students, and schools can \ncompete with any of those in any State in our Nation. This amendment \nwould only prevent the Federal Government from sanctioning a State for \nfalling behind schedule if it doesn't receive full funding for the cost \nof testing.\n  I have also been told that some Senators are worried about writing a \nblank Federal check to the States. They are concerned about a race to \nthe top in terms of cost.\n  As the bill is now written, the Senate doesn't seem to be concerned \nabout writing a blank check on each of the State's bank accounts \nwithout their permission. I see the irony of that, and I hope others \ndo, too. But to address the concerns of my colleagues, we have added \nprovisions that require the Secretary of Education, as my colleague has \npointed out, to provide a report every year to both the authorizing and \nappropriating committees that details the costs of testing. If States \nare somehow gaming the system, we will know about it the first time it \nhappens, and then we can correct it if it is necessary.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, this is a simple, \nstraightforward amendment. It requires the Federal Government to pay \nthe full cost of the tests mandated by the bill. Unless we commit to do \nso, States will have to sacrifice funding for their own identified \npriorities or be forced to once again shift the cost to taxpayers in \nthe form of higher property taxes.\n  I opened my remarks with a quote from a Senator who was describing \nthe Unfunded Mandates Reform Act that this body passed 6 years ago. I \nthink it might be worth repeating, as I come to a close. The Senator \nsaid:\n\n       The result of these mandates is that local governments are \n     forced to abandon their own priorities, to offer fewer \n     services to the public, and to ultimately charge higher taxes \n     and utility rates . . . The solution to the problem of \n     unfunded mandates is to require Congress to pay for any \n     mandate it places on State and local governments.\n\n  I do not think I could say it better, and I may not have said it \nbetter today.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Is there a sufficient \nsecond?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Carnahan and Senator \nNelson for bringing this amendment to the attention of the Senate. What \nwe are focusing on, which is enormously important, is the issue of \ntesting and accountability.\n  Their amendment brings to focus whether we are going to give \nassistance to the States and local communities to develop good quality \ntests. We have had a good debate on the issue of quality of tests. The \nSenate has gone on record in a bipartisan way to make sure we are going \nto have good quality tests. The Senators rightfully raise the question \nof whether our testing requirements are affordable and how are we going \nto make sure the States are not going to be in the situation where they \nwill be left holding the bag, so to speak. It is a very important \npolicy issue.\n  Having said that, I do think we have made some progress on this \nissue. I know it is not sufficient for Senator Carnahan and Senator \nNelson, but I want to briefly review how we reached the figures that \nare included in the legislation. We listened to the recommendation of \nthe NASB, the National Association of School Boards.\n  They made the recommendation that the development of these tests were \ngoing to amount to anywhere from $25 to $125 a student. The legislation \nprovides some $69 per student. NASB said that development costs could \nbe anywhere from $25 to $50. In this legislation, we provide only $20 \nper student.\n  What have we done? We accepted the Jeffords amendment that says, \nunless we are going to have the funding for the testing program at NASB \nrecommended levels, we will not expect the States to have to comply \nwith that program. That is currently included in the Jeffords \namendment, and there was very broad support for the Jeffords amendment.\n\n  Under the Wellstone amendment, we have also added additional \nresources of some $200 billion a year that will come to $2.8 billion to \nmake sure we are going to get quality. It is a legitimate question of \nwhether we are going to get the appropriations.\n  The two Senators are making a very important point that if we are \ngoing to do this right, we have to get the resources to do it right. \nThere is no guarantee we will get those additional\n\n[[Page S5921]]\n\nfunds, but there is a sufficient guarantee with the amendment of \nSenator Jeffords that we will get the figures which I referred to \nearlier.\n  We have accepted the Collins amendment which requires a GAO report by \nMay of 2002. That will provide an estimate of test development costs, \nas well as administration costs, and we will still have 3 years before \nthe requirements for these tests are actually implemented to use that \ninformation if we are finding we are going to fall further behind. That \nis an additional protection.\n  A final point I will make is in the development of this approach \nwhich puts us squarely in the middle of the NASB recommendations at \n$69, when they have estimated the range goes from $25 to $125--it is \nright in the middle--and it is at the low end of administrative costs, \nthere is a recognition that there has to be involvement of the State \nbecause the evaluations are an important additional ingredient in the \nStates interest in making sure the children learn and have productive \nresults.\n  Therefore, their recommendation understands there is a considerable \namount of State staffing and teachers' time which would normally be \nused that the Federal Government does not necessarily require under the \nadministration's proposal.\n  I think we are addressing this issue. I commend the Senators because \nit is an enormously important issue, to make sure we are going to get \nthis right. The last thing we want to do is discourage a lot of \nchildren and find out these tests are being used as punishment. There \nare instances currently where they are being used as punishment, rather \nthan detecting what the children do not know and then using those tests \nto provide supplementary services and changes in the curriculum to help \nadvance the children in education.\n  I am satisfied we have sufficient protections for the development of \nthese tests. We have the stopgap protection of the GAO report that will \ncome in a reasonable period of time, so if we are falling further \nbehind, we will be able to take action.\n  I have in my hand the current annual spending on tests per student by \nthe 50 States. Under this proposal, it is $69. There is not a single \nState that is even close to $20 today. There are some States as low as \n$1.37. I will not read the names of the States, but reading from the \nbottom of the page: $1.37, $2.93, $6.65, $17.16, $12, $14, $8.69, $2, \n$15, $12, $9, $15, $7, $5, and the list goes on. That reflects all 50 \nStates.\n  We are at least quadrupling, maybe as much as quintupling financial \nsupport for quality testing with the guarantee under the Jeffords' \namendment.\n  No matter how this vote comes out, I give assurance of our strong \ninterest in this. We will continue to work with my two colleagues on \nthis issue because it is incredibly important and it reaches the heart \nof this whole issue of accountability.\n  We want to get it right. We are going in a different direction, and \nwe are going into uncharted waters. We do not want to have the children \nbear the burden of our mistakes. This is something we needed to \naddress. I hope they feel we are addressing it. I know they prefer to \nhave the absolute guarantee. I respect that position, but I hope our \ncolleagues will feel that in the legislation, as we have developed it, \nwe have responded to their concern.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nunderlying amendment and to support and reinforce many of the comments \nthe Senator from Massachusetts made on this particular amendment.\n  I, too, applaud the authors for this amendment because it is clear \nthat in our goal to leave no child behind, it is going to require more \nassessments, measurable standards. You have to examine to make the \ndiagnosis, and to do that, and do it effectively, it is going to \nrequire a series of assessments that can be compared year to year in a \nlongitudinal way to track. It can be used to compare whether it is \nschool to school so we know what works and does not work, or State to \nState. Those tests are going to require something.\n  The concern of both Senate sponsors of this amendment is that those \nresources be available because they are mandates, and they are new \nmandates. They are mandates that we in a bipartisan way agree with in \nassessment, expectation, and accountability of leaving no child \nbehind. That being the case, and that being the goal, the questions are \ntwofold: No. 1, is there adequate funding proposed? And that is the \nessence of this bill; there is a fear that there is not. No. 2, have we \nbeen able to improve the bill, through the amendment process in the \nunderlying bill, to such a degree that such funds are available? We \nclearly believe so.\n\n  The underlying amendment I speak in opposition to, says, ``a State \nshall not be required to conduct any assessments under paragraph 3 in \nany school year if''--and the provisions are listed after that. I will \nstop right there. ``A State shall not be required to conduct any \nassessment under paragraph 3 . . . if''--and I will stop there.\n  That brings to heart two arguments: No. 1, is testing important, is \nmeasuring results important, is assessment important? I believe very \nstrongly they are important.\n  In a bipartisan way, we worked aggressively to underscore that these \nassessments are important and there should be no ``if\" after it.\n  No. 2, is the funding adequate itself? It comes back to their \nprovision that 100 percent of the cost of the assessments must be \nguaranteed or you do not do the assessments. That comes to the question \nto which Senator Kennedy spoke. We believe the bill has been improved \nand those funds are available.\n  The first point, we should do nothing in the amendment process in the \nbill that will in any way say we are anti-achievement, anti-measurable \nstandards, anti-accountable, anti-high expectation. I believe this \namendment is just that. The Carnahan-Nelson amendment potentially \nnullifies any new testing requirements for a State. These testing \nrequirements, the measurable results have been arrived at through the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, through much \ndebate and a bipartisan working group, debated regarding establishing \nimportance and how these would be carried out and what sort of \nstandards would be met. By potentially stripping away those provisions \nwe are tearing out the heart of this bill, tearing out the heart of \nwhat President Bush feels so strongly about, that we leave no child \nbehind.\n  Remember, the amendment says, a State shall not be required to \nconduct any assessments . . . if. That is enough for me to argue \nagainst this amendment.\n  Annual measurements are important. In the underlying bill, we start \nin the third grade. It is third through the eighth grade, giving an \nopportunity to make sure the money we invest in this bill is spent \nproperly. Over the last several weeks we have invested huge, huge \namounts of money through the authorization process, and we will see a \nlot more in appropriations. The President of the United States is \ncommitted to spending more in education this year than any President in \nthe past if it is coupled with reform. Those accountability provisions \ncannot be gutted, cannot be torn out of this bill. There should be no \n``if.''\n  Second, is the question of funding. Again, we should never put \ndollars in front of children. The Senator from Massachusetts mentioned \nthe Jeffords amendment which passed on the second day the bill was \nbrought to the floor. He mentioned the Wellstone amendment. He \nmentioned the Collins amendment which looks at a GAO study to look at \nthe specific issue of testing what should be required in terms of those \ntests and the evaluation of those tests. In the Jeffords amendment and \nthe Wellstone amendment, again, over $2.8 billion will be made \navailable for this testing.\n\n  We have an amendment which addresses the fundamental concern, a \nlegitimate concern, that this is a serious mandate, so serious that, \nfirst and foremost, there should be no ``if'' after the clause.\n  Second, the hypothetical that if Congress does not end up with \nappropriate funding as required by what we passed in the way of reform \nin the bill itself--I share concern with my colleagues, in the bill as \namended, the States may delay, already, implementation of the tests, \nare not required to conduct any assessments because assessments have to \nbe in there, but delay implementation of the tests until the \nappropriate funding is available, and this is already in the bill.\n\n[[Page S5922]]\n\n  Every State is addressing this issue of funding and the requirement \nof having assessments in a different way. In my State of Tennessee, we \nalready test students for math and reading in the third grade, the \nfourth grade, the fifth grade, the sixth grade, the seventh grade, and \nthe eighth grade. At least $50 million will be coming to Tennessee for \nthese assessments. Tennessee will have the flexibility today to use \nthat $50 million. It could be more than that, but we can improve the \ntest and make it longitudinal to compare a student and see how they \nprogress over time. That flexibility is there.\n  Last, and I will close, I think we all agree on the importance of \nmeasurable results and the assessments so we will know how our children \nare doing. This amendment is unnecessary to my mind. The $2.8 billion \nadded in the amendment process already addresses this issue.\n  Every State has the opportunity in the amendment to opt out of \nstandards, measurable results, achievement, the high expectations that \nare the heart and soul of the bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment when it comes to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I associate myself with the Senator from Tennessee. It was an \nexcellent statement summarizing the views I also hold. I associate \nmyself with the statement of Senator Kennedy.\n  We are ready to yield back our time and go to a vote if the other \nside is prepared. We yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I suggest to the Senator from Tennessee \nthat he has already announced this was, in fact, a mandate. It is an \ninadequately funded mandate at that. I reiterate, what we have in cost \nis a best guess estimate. There is no certainty. The current bill \nprovides protection only if $400 million is all that is needed. Beyond \nthat, we have no guarantee. We have no guarantee that the Wellstone \namendment or others will have money appropriated.\n  This amendment, I might also suggest, is not an anti-testing \namendment. The only circumstances where States will be released from \nthe testing requirement is if the Federal Government fails to provide \nfull funding. Anyone who makes an anti-testing argument about this \namendment is implicitly saying that the Federal Government is not going \nto pay the full cost of the tests. If you say the Federal Government is \nnot going to pay the full costs of the tests, I ask in return, what \npart of local budgets do you plan to cut to make up the difference? Are \nyou going to cut teachers' salaries or textbooks or other resources \nthat are stretched too thin?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 385. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

We are grateful for all the \nsupport we are receiving from all of our Members. We are going to \ncontinue to press ahead.\n  I look forward to the consideration of the amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 487 To Amendment No. 358\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate to urge that no less than \n   95 percent of Federal education dollars be spent in the classroom)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF SENATE ON THE PERCENTAGE OF FEDERAL \n                   EDUCATION FUNDING THAT IS SPENT IN THE \n                   CLASSROOM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Effective and meaningful teaching begins by helping \n     children master basic academics, holding children to high \n     academic standards, using sound research based methods of \n     instruction in the classroom, engaging and involving parents, \n     establishing and maintaining safe and orderly classrooms, and \n     getting funds to the classroom.\n       (2) America's children deserve an educational system that \n     provides them with numerous opportunities to excel.\n       (3) States and localities spend a significant amount of \n     education tax dollars on bureaucratic red tape by applying \n     for and administering Federal education dollars.\n       (4) Several States have reported that although they receive \n     less than 10 percent of their education funding from the \n     Federal Government, more than 50 percent of their education \n     paperwork and administration efforts are associated with \n     those Federal funds.\n       (5) According to the Department of Education, in 1998, 84 \n     percent of the funds allocated by the Department for \n     elementary and secondary education were allocated to local \n     educational agencies and used for instruction and \n     instructional support.\n       (6) The remainder of the funds allocated by the Department \n     of Education for elementary and secondary education in 1998 \n     was allocated to States, universities, national programs, and \n     other service providers.\n       (7) The total spent by the Department of Education for \n     elementary and secondary education does not take into account \n     what States spend to receive Federal funds and comply with \n     Federal requirements for elementary and secondary education, \n     nor does it reflect the percentage of Federal funds allocated \n     to school districts that is spent on students in the \n     classroom.\n       (8) American students are not performing up to their full \n     academic potential, despite significant Federal education \n     initiatives and funding from a variety of Federal agencies.\n       (9) According to the Digest of Education Statistics, only \n     54 percent of $278,965,657,000 spent on elementary and \n     secondary education during the 1995-96 school year was spent \n     on ``instruction''.\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\n       (10) According to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics, only 52 percent of staff employed in public \n     elementary and secondary school systems in 1996 were \n     teachers, and, according to the General Accounting Office, \n     Federal education dollars funded 13,397 full-time equivalent \n     positions in State educational agencies in fiscal year 1993.\n       (11) In fiscal year 1998, the paperwork and data reporting \n     requirements of the Department of Education amounted to \n     40,000,000 so-called ``burden hours'', which is equivalent to \n     nearly 20,000 people working 40 hours a week for one full \n     year, time and energy which would be better spent teaching \n     children in the classroom.\n       (12) Too large a percentage of Federal education funds is \n     spent on bureaucracy, special interests, and ineffective \n     programs, and too little is effectively and efficiently spent \n     on our America's youth.\n       (13) Requiring an allocation of 95 percent of all Federal \n     elementary and secondary education funds to classrooms would \n     provide substantial additional funding per classroom across \n     the United States.\n       (14) More education funding should be put in the hands of \n     someone in a classroom who knows the children personally and \n     frequently interacts with the children.\n       (15) Burdensome regulations, requirements, and mandates \n     should be refined, consolidated or removed so that school \n     districts can devote more resources to educating children in \n     classrooms.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate to \n     urge the Department of Education, the States, and local \n     educational agencies to work together to ensure that not less \n     than 95 percent of all funds appropriated for carrying out \n     elementary and secondary education programs administered by \n     the Department be spent to improve the academic achievement \n     of our children in their classrooms.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I rise today to discuss \nmy amendment, which is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, but it has a \nvery important point to make. It states that not less than 95 percent \nof all funds that are appropriated for carrying out elementary and \nsecondary education, administered by the Department of Education, be \nspent to improve the academic achievement of our children in the \nclassroom; in other words, 95 percent of the money in this bill should \ngo to the classroom for our children, which is where it should go.\n  As a former teacher, I think I would understand perhaps as well as \nanyone in this body how important it is to get those funds directly \ninto the classroom where the kids can benefit.\n  I thank Representative Sam Graves of Missouri for offering a similar \namendment to the House education bill over there which ensures that 95 \npercent of education money is spent locally.\n  Congressman Graves' amendment was passed overwhelmingly in the House. \nI believe the Senate should go on record supporting local control of \nFederal education dollars as well.\n  It might sound like an anomaly--local control of Federal education \ndollars--but if the Federal education dollars are going to be sent to \nthe State, then give the State the flexibility to spend them. Let the \nlocal people make the decisions wherever possible.\n  The other side of the aisle has been offering up amendment after \namendment after amendment calling for more funding for numerous \neducation programs. Many of these amendments have been adopted over the \npast several days and hours. But if we are going to allocate more money \nfor education, then I think we need to make a statement, which I do in \nmy amendment, that it is vital to ensure that the money be spent in the \nclassroom for the children. That is the appropriate way to spend those \ndollars.\n  After all, if the Federal Government is going to spend billions of \ndollars on education, then those dollars should go not to some \nbureaucracy, not to establish some mechanism to send those dollars into \nthe local schools, but, rather, getting the money directly to the local \nschools.\n  I think we all know the cost of getting dollars into the State from \nthe Federal Government--what it costs you to send the money to the \nlocal community--is pretty high. In fact, in New Hampshire it is about \n47 cents on the dollar, which is not a good return.\n  As a former New Hampshire teacher and school board chairman, I had \nthe opportunity to see this on both sides, both as a board member and \nas a teacher--and also as a parent for 26-plus years. I am convinced \nthat decisions regarding education are best executed at the local level \nand that we should not run our public schools from Washington, DC. We \ndo not need a national school board.\n  Some will say: With all these Federal dollars, how do you do it? We \ncan provide Federal dollars, if we must, but let's do it with as few \nstrings as possible to allow the local boards and the local parents to \nmake the decisions, the local communities.\n  Our public schools--and I say this as a former public school \nteacher--hold so much promise. I want to make sure the Senate goes on \nrecord today that a minimum of 95 cents of every education dollar \nshould go directly to those classrooms.\n  We need to give 95 cents of every dollar. It is a shame we can't give \n100 percent, a dollar for every dollar, to those teachers and students \nin New Hampshire and not to some bureaucrat or bureaucracy in \nWashington, DC.\n  We need to support education, not regulation, if we are going to \nspend the money. My amendment simply directs the Department of \nEducation to join our States and local school districts in an all-out \neffort to direct 95 percent of our Federal education dollars to the \nplace in which it belongs--the classroom. I don't think that is \nunreasonable.\n  It is important to understand that the Department of Education has \nnot been entirely responsible with the billions of dollars in \ntaxpayers' money we have been giving to them over the years. Some of it \nhas been spent responsibly, but a lot of it has not. Let me give a few \nexamples of some of the waste at the Department of Education.\n  I hate to bring it up, but it is important to understand that if you \njust continue to throw good money after bad, you never correct the \nproblem. There were 21 cases where grant checks were issued twice to \nthe same recipients, for a total cost to the taxpayers of America of \n$250 million. Auditors were able to recover the money eventually, but \nhow much time and how much cost was involved in recovering the $250 \nmillion? That is the point. It should not have happened. We are \ncareless.\n  We can eliminate a lot of these kinds of mistakes--and maybe some of \nit is deliberate; I don't know--by simply stipulating that it is the \nsense of the Congress and the Senate that 95 cents on every dollar go \nto the classroom, so when these kinds of things happen, these people \nknow they are going to be held accountable, that we mean business, that \nthe Senate means business, that 95 cents of every dollar is going to go \nto the classroom, not for this kind of nonsense with the duplication of \ngrant checks.\n  Some will say that was just a mistake; 21 mistakes is not a big deal. \nMaybe it was a mistake, but it is a careless mistake. If the \nbureaucracy knows it can be held accountable, they will be a little \nmore careful. What would happen if we hadn't found the mistakes? If we \nhad not had an auditor finding that mistake, it would have cost the \ntaxpayers $250 million.\n  I say to every American who is listening to me now, think of any \nschool district, yours in particular, wherever you live in America, and \nthink about the classroom, perhaps the one where your child is. Could \nyou use a little bit of that $250 million in your classroom, if you are \na teacher, or your child's classroom, if you are a parent? I can think \nof a lot of things I could have done with a few million dollars in my \nclassroom when I was teaching, whether it was more textbooks, perhaps \nraising teachers' pay. It is better than throwing it away in mistakes \nmade by a bureaucracy that has run roughshod over the whole educational \nsystem.\n  Let me cite another example of waste at the Department of Education. \nTwenty-one employees were allowed to write checks of up to $10,000 \nwithout supervision--no accountability--from May 1998 to September \n2000; 19,000 checks totaling $23 million were written by these people. \nWho is checking on that? Who is making sure that those 21 employees who \nwrote checks of up to $10,000 without supervision--who is checking to \nfind out whether that $23 million was the right amount of money?\n  We also have the example of 141 unapproved purchases in the \nDepartment of Education totaling more than $1 million-- purchases that \nwere made on Government credit cards for software, cell phones, \nInternet, computers. Even though DOD guidelines--Department of Defense \nguidelines--specifically say these things are not to be purchased on \ncredit cards, you have $1 million worth\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\nof purchases, 141 purchases totaling $1 million.\n\n  The point I make here is, the more rein and flexibility you give to \nthe bureaucracy, the more dollars you throw away; without a firm \naccountability, the more it is going to be wasted. If we pass this \namendment and we say the Senate has now spoken and has said that 95 \ncents will go to the classroom, when we hear about such things, people \nwill be a little bit concerned about it. They will be more self-\nconscious. They will be more careful. It is going to be a win-win, a \nwin for the kids in the classroom and a win for the taxpayers.\n  This year tax freedom day was May 3, 2001, according to the tax \nfoundation. Tax freedom day is the average day that Americans start \nworking for themselves as opposed to the Government. President Bush's \ntax cut package will certainly help in that regard, but as it stands \nnow, from January 1, 2001, to May 11, 2001, Americans work for their \nrespective local and State governments and the Federal Government. That \nis, from January 1 to May 11, every dollar you earn went to one of \nthose governments, local, State, or Federal. You didn't earn anything \nfor yourself. You started earning money for yourself on May 12.\n  I want every American to know that the money spent by the Federal \nGovernment should not be wasted, including the Department of Education. \nIf we put this restriction on, we are making a very strong statement \nthat we expect you to be accountable. We don't want to hear any more \nstories about 141 purchases totaling more than $1 million in unapproved \ncredit card purchases or grant checks issued twice to the tune of $250 \nmillion. We don't want to hear about it. We are not going to tolerate \nit. That is what we are saying if we support this amendment.\n  If you don't care, if you don't want the bureaucracy to be \naccountable and you couldn't care less whether we waste $250 million, \neven though taxpayers work hard until May 11 just to pay their bills, \nthen you should vote against my amendment. I encourage you to vote \nagainst my amendment if that is what you believe. If you think it is OK \nthat taxpayers can work until May 11 and not get a dime for themselves \nand you don't care about waste, fraud, or any other abuse in the \nbureaucracy, then vote against my amendment. But if you care about \ntaxpayers saving their hard-earned money and putting it to use for \nthemselves and you care about getting money directly to the classroom, \nto the kids, then you should vote for my amendment.\n  That is exactly the way the amendment should be evaluated. You are \neither for kids getting the money and saving taxpayers money, or you \nare in favor of wasting taxpayer money and do not care whether the kids \nget the money in the classroom or not. It is pretty simple.\n  The American people work very hard for that money. The Federal \nGovernment should not squander one cent of it. Actually, too many of \nour tax dollars are spent on bureaucracies at all levels of government, \nnot just the Department of Education. That waste is not going to end \ntomorrow. We must pledge to do better. We must tell the Department of \nEducation to give the money to the localities. Let them spend it as \nthey see fit. Don't spend it here in Washington, DC, with some \nbureaucracy to funnel the money.\n  Federal education dollars should not be spent to expand some bloated \nbureaucracy here in Washington. Lord knows, we have enough bloated \nbureaucracies here. Those precious dollars should go right to the \neducational opportunities of our kids. More education dollars should be \nspent directly in the classroom, and we need to shift the focus of our \neducation system back to the students.\n  This is a great way to do it. It is a simple statement. It is a sense \nof the Senate. It is not binding, but it is a sense of the Senate that \nsays: We want you to do that. We expect you to do that. If you don't do \nit at the Department of Education, then we may just have to come after \nyou. We expect you to save the money for the taxpayers and get the \nmoney to the students.\n  My amendment supports the proposition that the best education is the \neducation left to the local decisionmakers and that the best way to be \naccountable to our taxpayers is to eliminate the bureaucracy and the \nhigh cost of getting the money to the local community and getting it \nthere quickly and cheaply.\n  The Heritage Foundation issued a report recently titled ``U.S. \nDepartment of Education Financing of Elementary and Secondary \nEducation, Where the Money Goes.'' It is a very interesting report. It \nfound that as the United States prepares to enter the 21st century, its \neducational system is in crisis, the public education system. I agree \nwith that. We talk about the crisis in energy and in other matters. \nThere is a very interesting finding in this report. I will just give a \nbrief quote from it:\n\n       The vast majority of all Federal education funds does not \n     go to schools or school districts.\n  Think about that.\n\n       The vast majority of all Federal education funds does not \n     go to schools or school districts.\n\n  That seems to be a dichotomy if I ever heard one. Why wouldn't it? \nWhere is it going?\n\n       In 1995, 33 percent of the total $100 billion the federal \n     government allocated for education was spent by the \n     Department of Education . . . 40 percent of Department of \n     Education funds went to local educational agencies, 13.1 \n     percent of total federal education spending. Contrary to what \n     many Americans believe, the Department of Education funds \n     very few elementary and secondary education programs in their \n     local communities.\n\n  That is an outrageous finding--they are funding very few elementary \nand secondary education programs. What is the purpose of the Federal \nDepartment of Education if it is not going to give money to local \ncommunities for elementary and secondary education?\n  How do we get it to the classroom? What actually makes it to the \nclassroom? What gets to the classroom? Let's find out.\n  According to the Heritage Foundation:\n\n       Audits around the country have found that as little as 26 \n     percent of school district funds is being spent on classroom \n     expenditures.\n\n  Classroom expenditures are defined as expenditures for teachers and \nmaterials for their students--26 percent.\n  If that is acceptable to my colleagues, vote against my amendment. \nPlease vote against it because I want to be honest; I want to be \nstraightforward. If my colleagues think it is OK to take a dollar from \nthe taxpayer for education and 26 percent of that dollar goes to the \nkids and the rest does not, if that is OK with them, then please vote \nagainst my amendment. But if my colleagues really believe we ought to \nget the money to the kids, then vote for my amendment.\n  Do my colleagues want to increase the bureaucracy and have a lot of \npeople sitting around making decisions they should not be making and \nwasting money and having all these findings we just discussed a few \nmoments ago? Then vote against my amendment. If they want to eliminate \nthat and get the money directly to the kids, then they should vote for \nit.\n  My amendment makes several findings to support the conclusion that 95 \npercent of all funds we are going to spend on the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act be spent to improve the academic achievement of \nour children in their classrooms.\n  My amendment, in finding 4, states that:\n\n       Several States have reported that although they receive \n     less than 10 percent of their education funding from the \n     Federal Government, more than 50 percent of their education \n     paperwork and administration efforts are associated with \n     those Federal funds.\n\n  Fifty percent of the paperwork is associated with the Federal funds. \nWe always hear this talk about we are going to eliminate the \nbureaucracy, we are going to clear up the paperwork. It never happens. \nWe are going to reinvent Government.\n  How many times have we heard all these phrases? It is very simple. \nJust accept this resolution that it is unacceptable for anything less \nthan 95 percent to go to the classroom and then enforce it. When my \ncolleagues see all those bureaucracies popping up, let's get rid of \nthem and put the money into the classrooms.\n  We need to make sure that education money is not wasted on paperwork \nand administrative personnel. There always has to be a commission or a \nboard or a bunch of people sitting around juggling papers to determine \nthis requirement or that requirement, how much money goes here and who \nhas to administer it,\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\nand then another bureaucracy pops up to administer the previous \nbureaucracy.\n\n  Take a look at this. The Department of Education started less than 30 \nyears ago at $2 billion, $3 billion. It is now in the tens of billions \nof dollars to run it. Unfortunately, only 26 cents on the dollar gets \nto the kids.\n  My amendment, in finding 11, states:\n\n       In fiscal year 1998 the paperwork and data reporting \n     requirements of the Department of Education amounted to 40 \n     million so-called--\n\n  Only in Government would we hear a phrase such as this--\n\n     burden hours, which is the equivalent of nearly 20,000 people \n     working 40 hours a week for one full year. Time and energy \n     which would be better spent teaching children in the \n     classroom.\n\n  Burden hours, only in Washington. It is like getting on an elevator \nin Washington. Only in Washington does one get on an elevator to go up \nto the basement. If you do not believe me, get on the elevator anywhere \naround here and you find that to be true. Only in Washington, only in \nGovernment, do we have these kinds of phrases. It is nonsense. Burden \nhours, the equivalent of nearly 20,000 people working 40 hours a week \nfor 1 full year.\n  The Federal Government needs to decrease paperwork requirements and \ndata reporting. We have to stop talking about it and start doing it. \nThose Federal requirements may make for nice Government reports. There \nis a report right here. Here is the report on the bill. I am sure every \nSenator has read this word for word, sitting back in their offices at \nnight. They read it before they go to bed. They get up in the morning \nand read every word of it. Look at this stuff. There are tens of \nthousands of pages of background that go into this report.\n  Here is another one. Here is the bill. That is the report. This is \nthe bill. This is even bigger and larger. Look, page after page after \npage--more bureaucracy. The Department needs to look at reducing \nregulations and how Federal money is spent, reducing paperwork.\n  Madam President, I ask that the Senate go on record that not less \nthan 95 cents of every Federal education dollar be spent or used in the \nclassroom, and I do not think that is an unreasonable request.\n  Has my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask for the yeas and nays before I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. This side will be happy to yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has requested the yeas and nays.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. If I may be heard briefly. Madam President, we are willing \nto take a voice vote after listening to the Senator's statement to the \nSenate. However, it appears he wants to have a recorded vote. We have \nno objection to that if the Senator wants a recorded vote. We happen to \nsecond his request.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The Senator is correct; I request a \nrecorded vote. I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  Mr. REID. We yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 487. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo), the \nSenator from Utah (Mr. Hatch), and the Senator from Montana (Mr. Burns) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch) and the Senator from Montana (Mr. Burns) would each vote \n``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we are moving along. I am very \nappreciative of the cooperation we are getting. We now have a very \nimportant amendment by Senator Wellstone which is one of the most \nimportant that we will have during this debate. We have some good time \nallocated for a very good discussion. Senator Wellstone will open and, \nobviously, respond to questions. It is our intention, following Senator \nWellstone, to consider the amendment of the Senator from New York, Mrs. \nClinton, dealing with dilapidated schools, and Senator Feinstein \ndealing with school construction. And Senator Kerry, my colleague, has \ntwo on principals and alternative placements. Those are listed in the \nlist of amendments. I understand there may be amendments from the other \nside related to those. But we are trying to move this.\n  Obviously, if there are amendments related to it, we will deal with \nthem the way we have in the past, but I wanted to at least give our \nMembers an idea about what is coming up this afternoon. We are hopeful \nto continue to make good progress through the course of the afternoon.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I also believe Senator Hutchison has an \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate that. Senator Hutchison has a very \nimportant amendment. A number of our colleagues have been interested in \nthat subject matter. That has been going on for a number of days. They \nhave been very constructive resolutions. I hope perhaps after Senator \nClinton we might be able to consider that amendment. We will be in \ntouch with the Republican leader, and we will give her as much notice \nas we can, but we will try to see if we can't dispose of it after the \nClinton amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Daschle last night in the closing \nminutes of the Senate indicated that one of the things he wanted to do \nwas hold the votes as close to 20 minutes as possible. Today we have \ndone fairly well in that regard. The votes have run over. The first one \nwas 25 minutes and this one was 26 or 27 minutes. We are trying to make \nthe 20-minute mark that the majority leader has given us. I say to all \nthe staff listening and Senators who are watching, I hope they \nunderstand the 20-minute rule Senator Daschle is going to try to get us \ntrained to respond to. We have wasted so much time waiting for people \nto come. It is going to be necessary for some people to miss votes. I \nhope everyone will understand that this is the only way we can be \nconsiderate of others. There shouldn't be hard feelings. This will be \napplied as we are trying to do everything here on a bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I know the Senator will be here \nmomentarily. I will request the absence of a quorum until he is here to \npresent his amendment. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 466 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone, is recognized to call up amendment No. 466, \non which there shall be 4 hours to be equally divided and controlled.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am going to send the amendment to the \ndesk on behalf of myself and Senator Dodd, along with Senators Dayton, \nFeingold, Clinton, Hollings, Murray, Reed, and Corzine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is currently at the desk. Are \nyou modifying this?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The amendment is at the desk. I am sorry. I ask \nunanimous consent that the additional Senators be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n     Hollings, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Corzine, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 466.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To limit the conduct of certain assessments based on the \n provision of sufficient funding to carry out part A of title I of the \n            Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965)\n\n       On page 48, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n       ``(iii) no State shall be required to conduct any \n     assessments under this subparagraph in any school year if, by \n     July 1, 2005, the amount appropriated to carry out this part \n     for fiscal year 2005 does not equal or exceed \n     $24,720,000,000;''.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment, I think in a lot of \nways, is kind of a test case of whether or not we are passing a reform \nbill. I will have a lot to say about this, and other Senators will as \nwell. I am certainly hoping that colleagues on the other side--whether \nthey are Republicans or Democrats--who disagree will come to this \nChamber to express their dissent so that I can know what possible \narguments can be made against this amendment.\n  There are many Senators who have said publicly in this Chamber, and \nback in their States, and in interviews with the media, that we have to \nhave this testing for the accountability--we can talk more about that \nlater--but that, in addition, we also have to have the resources to \nmake sure that the children, the schools, and the teachers have the \ntools to do well.\n  The testing is supposed to assess the reform. The testing is not \nsupposed to be the reform. I remember at the very beginning, a long \ntime ago, I said: You cannot realize the goal of leaving no child \nbehind or you cannot talk about an education reform program if it is on \na tin cup budget; you have to have the resources.\n  I have heard many Senators say: We are for the testing for the \naccountability, but we are also going to invest in these children and \nmake sure there are the resources. That is point 1.\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\n  Point 2: Senator Dodd and Senator Collins came to this Chamber with a \nvery important amendment which authorized a dramatic increase in \nresources for the title I program. It was a bipartisan amendment. There \nwere, I believe, 79 Senators who voted for this amendment.\n  This amendment was a Paul Simon amendment. It turns out the Senator \nfrom Illinois is in the Senate Chamber. This amendment was an education \namendment by Senator Dodd and Senator Collins. I say to the best friend \nI ever had in the Senate--Senator Paul Simon of Illinois--who is here, \nthat what I am now saying to every Senator is: 79 Senators voted for an \nauthorization, but that is not money. That is fiction.\n  This amendment says that by 2005--we committed in that amendment that \nwe would spend $24.72 billion for title I which would go to the benefit \nof children for extra reading help, for afterschool, for \nprekindergarten, all of which is critically important.\n  So what this amendment says is that the tests we are authorizing need \nnot be implemented unless we, in fact, appropriate the money at the \nlevel we said we would. This was the amount the Dodd amendment \nauthorized. We have been saying to our States: We are going to get you \nthe resources. So what we are saying in this amendment is that States \ndo not have to do this unless we make the commitment to the resources.\n  I have heard people talk about the need to walk our talk. I have \nheard Senator after Senator say that they are for accountability but \nthey are for resources. I do not know how Senators can vote against \nthis proposal. We said we were for authorizing this money. This \namendment is a trigger amendment. It says that we make this commitment \nto $24.72 billion for title I. And this amendment says, if we do not do \nthis, then the new tests need not be implemented.\n  If the States or school districts want to say we do not want to do \nthis because you have not lived up to your commitment, they do not have \nto do it.\n  I look back because sometimes our staff do the best work. So I am \nlooking back at Jill Morningstar to make sure I am right about this.\n  Now just a little bit about what this really is all about. This is \nthe heart of the debate. Right now, title I is a program for children \nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds. It is the major Federal commitment. We \nare funding it at a 30-percent level. The title I money is used for \nextra reading help. It can be used for prekindergarten. It can be used \nto help these children do better.\n  What this amendment is saying is, it does not do a heck of a lot of \ngood to test the children all across the country when we have not done \nanything to make sure they have the best teachers; that the classes are \nsmaller; that the buildings are inviting; that they come to \nkindergarten ready to learn; that they get additional help for reading.\n  The testing is a snapshot. It is one piece of the picture. It does \nnot tell us anything about what happened before or what happens after. \nWhat good does it do to have so many children in America right now who \nare crowded into dilapidated buildings, into huge classes, who have \nfour teachers a year, who do not have the same resources and benefits \nas a lot of other children, who come to kindergarten way behind, and we \nare going to test them and show that they are not doing well, which we \nalready know, but we are not going to have the resources to do anything \nto help them after they don't do well on the tests. Or even more \nimportantly, we are not going to have the resources to help them to \nmake sure that when we hold them accountable, they have the same \nopportunity as every other child in America to do well.\n  I am on fire about this amendment because this is the amendment that \nholds people accountable for the words they have been speaking. We must \nnot separate the lives we live as legislators from the words we speak. \nWe have been saying that we were going to have the resources, that we \nwere going to get them to the teachers and the schools and the \nchildren. And that is what this amendment says. This amendment says: \nDon't fool people by just doing an authorization.\n  This was so important what Senator Dodd did, so important what \nSenator Collins did, so important that 79 Senators voted for it, but \nreally what makes a difference is if we go on record and make it \ncrystal clear that unless we live up to what we already voted for and \nprovide the money--this would be $24 billion plus in the year 2005--\nthen in Rhode Island or Minnesota or other States, schools can say: You \ndidn't provide the money you said you were going to provide. You didn't \nprovide the resources you said you were going to provide. We choose not \nto do the testing.\n  They should have that option. Otherwise, this testing is an unfunded \nmandate. You are setting everybody up for failure.\n  I will quote a recent study by the Center for Education Policy. Here \nis the conclusion:\n\n       Policymakers are being irresponsible if they lead the \n     public into thinking that testing and accountability will \n     close the gap.\n\n  They are right. Do you think by jamming a test down the throats of \nevery school in every school district in every State in America--by the \nway, I am going to ask my conservative friends. I don't get this. Right \nnow, I haven't made a final decision, but I lean pretty heavily in the \ndirection that the Federal Government should not do this. I don't know \nwhere the Federal Government gets off telling school districts and \nschools they have to test every child age 8, age 9, age 10, age 11, age \n12, and age 13. What a reach on the part of the Federal Government.\n  It is quite one thing to say all of us in America live in a national \ncommunity and when it comes to discrimination, when it comes to human \nrights, when it comes to civil rights, when it comes to a basic diet \nthat every child should have, no State, no community should be able to \nfall below that. That is one kind of argument. But now we are going to \ntell every school district they have to do this? It is absolutely \namazing to me that we are doing so.\n  The point is, don't anybody believe that the test we make every child \ntake means that child now is going to have a qualified teacher. It \ndoesn't do anything about that. A test doesn't reduce class size. A \ntest doesn't make sure the children come to kindergarten ready. Part of \nthe crisis in education is the learning gap by age 5. Some children \ncome to kindergarten, then they go on to first grade, second grade, \nthird grade. Now we are going to test them, age 8.\n\n  One group of children, to be honest with you, actually has had 7 \nyears of school. They came to kindergarten. Then they had the 3 years \nplus that. Now they are third graders. Before that, they had 3 years of \nenriched child care. They came to kindergarten having been widely read \nto. They know colors and shapes and sizes. They know how to spell their \nname. They know the alphabet. They are ready to learn. They have had \nthe education. And then a lot of other children haven't. And they are \nbehind, way behind. This is during the period of time of the \ndevelopment of the brain, the most critical time. Then they fall \nfurther behind.\n  Testing doesn't change any of that. Testing doesn't do anything about \nmaking sure there is the technology there. Testing doesn't do anything \nabout whether or not you have 40 or 50 kids crowded into a classroom. \nBut if we were to make a commitment to some title I funding, then we \ncould get some additional help for reading; some additional help for \nafter school; for teachers to have assistance helping them with \nchildren, one-on-one help; prekindergarten.\n  How can Senators possibly vote against this amendment? They can't, \nnot if they have said they are committed to getting the resources to \nthese schools.\n  The Association of American Test Publishers, the people who develop \nvirtually every large standardized test used in our schools, say the \nsame thing. I quote from the Association of American Test Publishers:\n\n       In sum, assessments should follow, not lead, the movement \n     to reform our schools.\n\n  What they are saying is that the testing is supposed to assess the \nreform. The testing isn't the reform. And the reform is whether or not \nwe are going to have the resources to make sure these children have a \nchance to do well.\n  Senators, if we are going to say that it will be a national mandate \nthat every child in America will be tested and we will hold the \nchildren and the schools and everyone else accountable,\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\nthen it should be a national mandate that every child should have the \nsame opportunity to learn and do well in America. That is what this \namendment is about.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Democratic Governors' \nAssociation be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. They say:\n\n       While we are pleased to support the Carnahan Nelson \n     amendment, we are hopeful that any final version of \n     legislation to reauthorize ESEA will apply a funding trigger \n     more broadly, specifically to include title I. This is the \n     main source of federal assistance for disadvantaged students \n     and the federal government needs to back its efforts to \n     strengthen accountability with adequate new investment.\n\n  These Governors are saying this is part of your major Federal \ncommitment. With all due respect, you have to back accountability with \nnew investment, and we support the idea of this trigger amendment.\n  They are absolutely right. For some reason, these Governors are a \nlittle worried that we are going to mandate all this testing and then \nnot live up to our commitment of resources, for very good reason.\n  I would like to quote from an article given to me by my good friend \nfrom Florida, Senator Graham. This is by a Walter R. Tschinkel. He \ndiscusses Florida's system of grading schools. The Presiding Officer is \none of the people in the Senate most immersed in education. What does \nMr. Tschinkel find is the single most important variable in determining \nhow children do on test scores? Would anybody here be real surprised to \nhear that it is poverty? He found that for every percent that poverty \nincreases, the school score drops by an average of 1.6 points. He \nshowed that the level of poverty in a school in Florida predicted what \nthe school's achievement score would be with 80-percent accuracy.\n  May I ask, what are we doing here with this bill that is called BEST?\n  What are we doing? We are not doing anything to reduce poverty. We \nhave not made any commitment to title I money being there, which is \nwhat this amendment calls for. We are not doing anything when it comes \nto a commitment in prekindergarten and child care.\n  We are still funding Early Head Start at the 3-percent level and Head \nStart for 3- and 4-year-olds at the 50-percent level.\n  We are not doing anything about rebuilding crumbling schools. Shame \non us.\n  We are not doing anything about reducing class size. Shame on us.\n  Now what we are going to do is test these children and show these \nchildren in America again how little we care about them.\n  I have to cool down. It would be better if we had some debate. I want \nto hear how people justify not providing resources.\n  I am not surprised by a recent study by the Education Trust Fund \nwhich shows the extent of the gap between low-income and high-income \ndistricts. There are not too many Senators who have children in low-\nincome districts.\n  The study found that nationally low-poverty school districts spend an \naverage of $1,139 more than high-poverty school districts. In 86 \npercent of the States, there is a spending gap favoring wealthier \nstudents. The widest gap is in New York where the wealthiest districts \nspend on average $2,794 more per student.\n  As the Center for Educational Policy concludes:\n\n       Policymakers on the State and national levels should be \n     wary of proposals that embrace the rhetoric of closing the \n     gap but do not help build the capacity to accomplish this \n     goal.\n\n  That is what this amendment is about. This testing is nothing but the \nrhetoric of closing the gap. We are not closing the gap because we are \nnot providing the resources. This amendment says we go on record, we \nare committed, we are going to say to any State and school district: If \nwe do not live up to our commitment and provide the resources in 2005, \nwhich we have gone on record in supporting, then you do not have to do \nthe testing.\n  This amendment starts to take us in the direction of putting the \nmoney where our mouth is. Seventy-nine Senators agreed to authorize \ntitle I so that it would be fully funded in 10 years. Seventy-nine \nSenators should support this amendment.\n  By the way, I am being pragmatic. I do not even understand why we are \nnot providing the funding now. Why 10 years? What good does it do a 7-\nyear-old to provide funding in 10 years? She will be 17.\n  Childhood is only once. We should not steal their childhoods. In 10 \nyears we are going to do it. How does that help the 7-year-old? We are \ngoing to test her when she is 8 and show her--surprise--that she is not \ndoing well, but we may not be helping her for many years later.\n  I am just starting on this. This is 4 hours of debate now. Next week, \nthere might be 36 hours of debate on another amendment.\n  Again, we went on record. We said we were for this authorization. \nThis amendment just says let's do it. My colleagues say tests have \ntheir place. By the way, I want to also print in the Record--I hope \nevery Senator will read this. This is a high stakes testing position \nstatement. This is a statement by health care professionals which \ninclude people such as Robert Coles, a psychiatrist who has \nwritten probably 40 books about children in America. The man has won \nevery award known to humankind; Alvin Poussaint, another talented \nAfrican-American psychiatrist; Debbie Meyer who has done more good work \nin inner-city New York City than anybody in the country.\n\n  Do my colleagues want to know what they say in the statement? They \nsay two things. One, which ties into this amendment, is that we must \nmake sure we live up to the opportunity-to-learn standard; that every \nchild has the same opportunity to learn.\n  What I want to point out is they say from a public health point of \nview: What are you doing to these kids? They are talking about the \nstress on 8-year-olds taking all these tests, and they point out what \nis happening to schools.\n  I do not know; there must be 30 people who have signed this. They are \nthe best educators, the best child psychologists, award-winning \nauthors, and they say: What in God's name are you doing to these \nchildren? That is another amendment about testing next week with \nSenator Hollings. For right now, at the very minimum, what they are \nsaying is we ought to at least make sure we provide these children with \nthe opportunity to learn.\n  One hundred percent of major city schools use title I to provide \nprofessional development and new technology for students; 97 percent \nuse title I funds to support afterschool activities; 90 percent use \ntitle I funds to support family literacy and summer school programs; 68 \npercent use title I funds to support preschool programs.\n  The Rand Corporation linked some of the largest gains of low- and \nmoderate-income children doing better in education to investment in \ntitle I.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, the Brainerd Public School system has \nhad a 70- to 80-percent success rate in accelerating students in the \nbottom 20 percent of their class to the average of their class \nfollowing 1 year of intensive title I-supported reading programs.\n  My colleague, Senator Hatch from Utah, cited important research by \nthe Aspen Institute:\n\n       In the effort to raise the achievement of all American \n     students, an extremely serious barrier is the huge disparity \n     in resources for education across districts and States. It is \n     not unusual for per student expenditure to be three times \n     greater in affluent districts than poor districts in the same \n     State.\n\n  Mr. President, do you know that in my State of Minnesota, in St. \nPaul, schools where we have less than 65 percent of the students who \nare eligible for the free or reduced school lunch program, receive no \ntitle I money. We have run out. I could not believe it. I heard the \nSecretary of Education and some of my colleagues saying we have spent \nall this title I money; we have thrown dollars at the problem.\n  First of all, we are not funding it but at a 30-percent level and, \nsecond, title I represents about one-half of 1 percent of all the \neducation dollars that are spent, but it is key in terms of the Federal \nGovernment commitment. I am suggesting that it can make a huge \ndifference.\n  The problem is, we have had a dramatic expansion in the number of \nchildren who need help. The GAO study said that, but a lot of States, \nsuch as\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\nthe State of Minnesota, in a school that has 64 percent of the children \nwho are low income or who qualify for the reduced or free school lunch \nprogram get no help. Can my colleagues believe that?\n  I want to quote from Linda Garrett who is assistant director of title \n1 programs in the St. Paul schools. This is the irony of what we are \ndoing. We are pounding ourselves on the chest. This is bumper-sticker \npolitics. It is called the BEST. Test every child, say we are for \naccountability, and we are not going to provide the resources for the \nchildren, all the children, to have the same opportunity to do well. It \nis unconscionable.\n  Linda Garrett says:\n\n       The title I entitlement from the Department of Children and \n     Families Learning have remained level for the past 2 years, \n     and we have been notified to expect the same for the next \n     year. While the funding has remained level, the number of St. \n     Paul schools entitled to receive title I funding increased \n     and the number of eligible children increased. In 1998-1999 \n     the per pupil title I funding was $720; 1999-2000, $540; \n     2000-2001, $515, 2001-2002, we are now going to $445 per \n     pupil.\n\n  We have surpluses; we say we are for children; we say we are for \neducation; and we are providing less money.\n  There are 79 Senators who voted for the Dodd-Collins amendment. If \nyou voted for that amendment, you have to vote for this amendment. It \nis almost insulting. We are saying to these parents, we need to test \nyour children every year so you can understand how they are doing and \nwhat is working and what is not.\n  We are saying to the teachers: Teachers, you are afraid to be held \naccountable, so now we will hold you accountable with these tests. \nTeachers are not afraid to be held accountable. And the teachers and \nthe parents and the schools, especially the schools with low- and \nmoderate-income children, already know what is working and what is not \nworking. They already know they don't get the resources. They already \nknow the children come to kindergarten way behind. They already know \nthe buildings are dilapidated. They already know the classes are too \nlarge. They already know they don't have beautiful landscaping. They \nalready know they don't have the support assistance they need from \nadditional staff. They know all of that. They are just wondering when \nwe will live up to our words and provide some assistance. That is what \nthey wonder.\n  In my opinion, we are playing politics with children's lives. We all \nwant to have our picture taken next to them; we all want to be in \nschools with them; we are all for them except when it comes to reaching \nin the pocket and investing in resources.\n  I believe what we are doing to poor children in America, unless we \npass this amendment, is we are going to test children and show they are \nnot doing as well. Why would anybody be surprised?\n  The children in the inner city of south Minneapolis or west St. Paul \nare not doing as well as the children in the affluent suburbs with a \nhuge disparity of resources and a huge disparity of life chances. It is \nstaring us in the face in terms of what we need to do. We have not made \na commitment to them, and now we are going to club them over the head \nwith tests and humiliate them. I want Senators to debate me.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                            Democratic Governors' Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2001.\n     Hon. Jean Carnahan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Carnahan: On behalf of the nation's Democratic \n     Governors, I am writing in support of the amendment being \n     offered by Senators Carnahan and Nelson to S. 1, the Better \n     Education for Students and Teachers Act (BEST). This \n     amendment would ensure that the federal government meets its \n     commitment to states by fully funding the cost of the new \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) testing \n     requirements.\n       The amendment would replace the $400 million cap authorized \n     for FY 2002 for developing and implementing tests, in the \n     underlying bill, instead requiring the federal government to \n     pay 100% of all state testing costs not currently required \n     under federal law. If the federal government does not meet \n     this commitment, states would be released from the obligation \n     to implement the new testing requirements. The amendment \n     would also require the Secretary of Education to annually \n     calculate the total costs of testing.\n       In addition, the amendment would add a protection that \n     would prohibit the federal government from sanctioning a \n     state for falling behind schedule in designing and \n     implementing tests if the federal government has not provided \n     full funding.\n       While we are pleased to support the Carnahan/Nelson \n     amendment, we are hopeful that any final version of \n     legislation to reauthorize the ESEA will apply a funding \n     trigger more broadly, specifically to include Title I. This \n     is the main source of federal assistance for disadvantaged \n     students and the federal government needs to back its efforts \n     to strengthen accountability with adequate new investment.\n       We would also prefer that final legislation link federal \n     funding accountability to consequences imposed on states and \n     local schools unable to meet proposed annual performance \n     measures, such as fiscal sanctions and school reorganization. \n     Relieving states from the cost of implementing new tests does \n     not alter the mandated levels of improvement in student \n     performance.\n       Democratic Governors urge Congress to fulfill the historic \n     commitment to America's children that the BEST Act represents \n     by fully funding authorized levels for IDEA, Title I, and \n     teacher quality, as well as for testing. We believe that the \n     Carnahan-Nelson amendment helps to ensure this, and we urge \n     that the Senate adopt the amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Gov. Tom Vilsack,\n\n                                                    State of Iowa,\n                                         DGA Vice-Chair of Policy.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. How much time is under the agreement on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 hours under the control of each \nside.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Wellstone \namendment. I look forward to the debate over the next several hours. I \nthink the amendment comes back to some of the fundamental questions \nasked about this bill. It will give Members on both sides of the aisle \nthe opportunity to address the fundamental concept of the bill, the \nstructure of the bill, the why of the bill.\n  It comes down to accountability, to flexibility, being able to figure \nout what the problems are. We all recognize there is a problem with \neducation in this country. After diagnosing it, we need to intervene in \na way that we can truly leave no child behind.\n  This amendment addresses two issues: the whole concept of \naccountability using assessments and dollars and cents. The amendment \nstates that no State shall be required to conduct any assessments in \nany school year by 2005 if the amount appropriated to carry out this \npart for fiscal year 2005 is not equal to or exceeds $24 billion.\n  That summarizes the amendment. It can be broken into two arguments. \nOne is money and how important money is, and is money the answer. The \nother is assessment and the testing. It is a useful component of what \nis proposed by President Bush and what is in the underlying bill today, \nas amended, accountability and assessment--that measuring success or \nfailure is important if you want to intervene and make a difference.\n  The Senator from Minnesota asked essentially the question, as he \naddressed those issues, why test if we already know children won't do \nwell? There is not much disagreement today over whether we are leaving \nchildren behind. That has been the thrust of what President Bush \ncampaigned on, the thrust of the principles for education reform he has \ngiven to this body, and the thrust of the underlying BEST bill. I \nthought, as a body of Congress, we generally agreed it is important to \nmake a diagnosis if we are going to improve our student's education.\n  The comment of the Senator from Minnesota is, why test somebody if \nyou know they are not doing well? The implied corollary is, forget the \ntest, dump more money and make that cure the system--as if throwing \nmore money will make sure we leave no child behind.\n  On the first part of that argument, I think testing is important. I \nsay that as somebody who has a certain parallel, and the parallel of my \nlife, obviously, is medicine. The symptoms are there. The symptoms \ntoday are, we are failing, by every objective measurement we use today, \nversus our counterparts in other countries internationally. Whether we \nlook at the 4th grade or the 8th grade or the 12th grade, we are \nfailing as a society in educating our children. I suppose that is what \nthe Senator from Minnesota meant when he said we know we are leaving \nchildren behind.\n  As a physician, when someone comes to your office and complains of \nfatigue,\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\nthey do not feel quite right, perhaps shortness of breath, as a \nphysician and as a nation, it is hard for you to know how to address \nthe symptoms of a problem until a diagnosis is made.\n  We know children are being left behind. By any measure, there is a \nhuge achievement gap, which is getting worse in spite of more money, in \nspite of good intentions, in spite of additional programs. That gap is \ngetting worse, and we are leaving the underserved behind.\n  How do we correct that? Our side of the aisle worked with the other \nside of the aisle in a bipartisan way, to pass a bill through the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, that injects strong \naccountability into the bill.\n  I thought we had gone long beyond the accountability argument. \nApparently we have not. I think it is important to go through this \ndiagnosing, the assessments, so we can intervene and improve the \neducation of our children. We need to be able to determine through \nassessments how well each child progresses, or, unfortunately, does not \nprogress and falls behind--from the third to the fourth grade; from the \nfourth to the fifth grade; from the fifth to the sixth grade; from the \nsixth to the seventh; from the seventh to the eighth.\n\n  We all know those early years are important. We used to think maybe \nyou could catch up in college, or in high school you could catch up in \nmath or in science. I think now there is pretty much agreement if we \nneed to intervene, we need to intervene early so no child is left \nbehind.\n  Why do we need more assessments? If you assess a student in the \nseventh grade--say a young girl in the seventh grade--and that test \nshows she is not only last in the class, but last in the community. You \nfind out in the seventh grade that she cannot read because she has been \nlast in the class, and because she has been ushered along and advanced \nfrom year to year. Or you find she cannot add and subtract in the \nseventh grade.\n  People say: Come on, everybody can read and everybody can do \nfundamental math in the seventh grade. But we know from the national \nstatistics, in the fourth and eighth grade a significant number of our \nchildren are falling behind, both as we compare them to each other and \nas we compare them to other people globally, internationally, other \ndeveloped nations.\n  Therefore, I argue it does make sense to have these tests on a yearly \nbasis from third to eighth grade because you need the continuity. Also \nyou need tests designed in such a way that they are comparative--you \nneed to be able to compare what a child has learned in the third grade \nwith what he or she has learned in the fifth grade versus the seventh \ngrade versus the eighth grade.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me just finish for a few minutes and then I will be \nhappy to yield. I want to walk through several of these concepts.\n  As a physician what is it similar to? I mention somebody coming \nthrough that door to see, not Senator Frist, Dr. Frist; they come in \nand have these vague complaints. If I don't do tests--I can take a \npretty careful history. But until I do the physical exam, until I do \nsome tests--noninvasive tests, very simple tests--EKG, a scan called a \nMUGA scan, fairly simple tests today--I am not going to be able to \nspecifically know whether the problem is with the lungs or with the \nheart or whether that the problem is due to lack of conditioning or if \nit is due to general fatigue.\n  So if I have the seventh grade girl there, not only should we have \nmade the diagnosis earlier, but we need a test that can sufficiently \nmake the diagnosis: Is it mathematics? Is it reading? Is it lack of \nresources? Is it lack of an ability to use a computer or type on a \nkeyboard? We have to make the assessment. Then once, with that patient \ncoming in, I identify the heart, I know how to intervene. I have taken \nthe blood pressure, I find it is high blood pressure, there is \nsomething I can do to intervene. But if it is just fatigue, until I \nknow their blood pressure is up, how can I give a pill to bring the \nblood pressure down?\n  You can argue there is not enough money in the world to treat \neverybody's hypertension, and you can argue you cannot give everybody \nthe full battery of tests and give everybody a heart transplant or \neverything they need. But that is not an argument to me, or it defies \ncommon sense to say you should not come back and do the tests in the \nfirst place and ask the question and make the specific diagnosis. In \nfact, I argue if you have dollars, or a pool of dollars--it doesn't \neven have to be a fixed sum--if you want the best value for that \ndollar, instead of taking all that money and throwing it at the fatigue \nof the patient with a whole bunch of potential treatments that may make \nyou feel good, or invent programs to put them in, why not step back, \ninvest that $1 in making the diagnosis, in figuring out the problem, \nbecause that will set you, I believe, in a much more efficient way to \ndetermine treatment over time.\n\n  It means you make the diagnosis early enough so it might prevent that \nheart disease from progressing, that fatigue, maybe a little bit of \nchest. Maybe, if you diagnose it at age 40 and you find the blood \npressure because you have done the test and you intervene, that stops \nthe progression of the heart disease and that patient will live longer \nbecause of early intervention. It is therapeutic but also it is \npreventive medicine.\n  I say there is absolutely no difference with how we should address \nour education system today--if we look at accountability, we want \nbetter results, we want better value, we are failing, today, to say \nassessments are important, measurable results that can be looked at, \nthat can be used and thrown into our own individual database at a local \nlevel in order to decide how to address that specific problem, whether \nit is the seventh grade girl or whether it is a school we see is \nfailing miserably year after year, in spite of putting more resources \nin and getting more teachers and smaller class size and better books \nand more technology--that is the only way to get the answer.\n  Then you start drawing this linkage between dollars. We always hear \nfrom the other side of the aisle--this is a good example. I looked at \nthis. I don't know if it is $24 million or $24 billion or $24 trillion. \nTo me, it doesn't matter. But it really drives home the point that \nthere is a perception that you can throw money at a problem without \nmaking a diagnosis, without figuring out what the fundamental disease \nis--not the symptoms, we know what the symptoms are--but without \nfiguring out what the disease is you will never have enough money.\n  Although you can always argue for more money and, boy, I tell you, we \nhave really seen it in this bill. If there is one very valid criticism \nof this bill it is that every amendment that comes down here, we come \ndown to vote on, every amendment coming from the other side requires \nmore money. It is more money for programs, more money for technology, \nmore money for teachers, more money for assessments.\n  Focusing on money as the only response takes the target off what the \nAmerican people care about. It takes the spotlight off what the \nPresident of the United States cares about, what the President of the \nUnited States has demonstrated the leadership at the highest levels \nabout, and that is the child. That is the seventh grade girl who is \nsitting in that classroom who is failing and we are not willing to come \nin and do the reform.\n  Reform is a scary word. Reform means change to some people. But we \nhave to recognize when you say improve accountability, or reform, or \nmeasurable results--all of that basically says we have to change what \nwe are doing, figure out what is wrong, and fix it. And you cannot just \nsay throw money at the problem. You have to have the reform. That is \nwhere the assessment, accountability, measurable results, the figuring \nout what the problem is, is so critically important.\n  So to be honest with you, I am not surprised but, as I said earlier, \nI thought we had gotten beyond the fact that you have to have strong \naccountability in order to know how to improve a situation that we all \nknow is miserable. It is miserable. Today we are not addressing each \nchild. Today we are leaving people behind. It is going to take doing \nsomething different. It is going to take bringing true reform to the \ntable and that is why the assessment comes in.\n  We cannot argue with what is underlying this amendment, that you \ndon't\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\ndo the test because somebody has the symptoms. I argue you have to do \nthe test. That is first and foremost in order to figure out what the \ndisease is, to treat it, to get the best value for the dollar that we \nput in, that we make available. When we hear the rhetoric on the floor \nof playing politics with children's lives, they have to be very \ncareful, again, because the debate is so much further along than where \nit was 6 months ago, I think in large part because of President Bush \nand his leadership, putting this issue out front.\n  Let's not use that language of playing politics with children, but \nget reform and improvement in the system by putting additional \nresources in as we go forward, which this President and this Congress \nclearly have shown a willingness to do. But let's not just put more \nmoney in and then do away with tests, which in essence is what this \namendment does.\n  The latest results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress \nhave shown--they show it again and again--that money is not the answer \nand that new programs are not the answer.\n  One of the great benefits and advantages and, I think, very good \nparts of this bill is that it has an element of consolidation and \nstreamlining to reduce the regulatory burden, the inefficiencies, and \nthe sort of deadweight of having hundreds and hundreds of programs out \nthere--that there is an element of consolidation in the underlying \nbill.\n  We have heard it on the floor again and again. We spent $150 billion \non literally hundreds of Federal elementary and secondary education \nprograms over the last 35 years. In terms of progress compared to \nothers, we have not seen it.\n  That is why this bill is on the floor. That is why it is critical \nthat we address it in a way that recognizes not just the money but the \nmodernization, the demanding of accountability, the raising of \nexpectations for all children, for all schools, and for all teachers. \nThe answer is not just more dollars.\n  President Bush really led the debate or led the issue so that now we \nare back here debating accountability again and how important that \naccountability is. He called for strengthened accountability based on \nhigh State standards. Yes, it is annual testing of all students. And, \nyes, it starts with the third grade and goes through the eighth grade.\n  In the bill, there are also rigorous corrective actions for schools \nthat fail to meet those standards. Again, Senators have worked very \nhard in a bipartisan way to make sure that accountability is fashioned \nin such a way that you just do not make the diagnosis but you set up a \nsystem in which there can be early intervention and treatment.\n  We have several formulas on yearly progress, and indeed in a \nbipartisan way the initial formulas we used showed that we needed to \nfocus a little bit more on the underserved and on the less advantaged. \nWe changed those formulas just enough, I believe, to appropriately \nrefocus where it wasn't quite right in this initial underlying bill.\n  Yes, it is the State that sets the standards. Again, one of the big \nfundamental arguments that will come out again and again --and it has \nover the last several weeks--is whether it should be Washington, DC, or \nthe Federal Government running it out of Washington, or whether it be \nshould at the State, or local, district, or individual level. Again and \nagain, you can have Republicans saying it should be at the local level, \nand on the other side of the aisle--I don't want to overly generalize, \nbut if you look at the amendments and the way the voting is going, it \nis more the answer, here in Washington, A, for more regulations and \nprograms; and, B, more money--the flip side of where this bill is \nmoving, and maybe not quite as far as some of us would like. But that \nis local control, flexibility at the local level, trusting people back \nin counties all across Tennessee and in the State of Tennessee to be \nmaking decisions rather than here in Washington, DC.\n  Luckily, much of the debate has gone back to that individual child. \nThat is important because it involves parents. All of us know how \nimportant it is to have parents involved in children's education and \nthat ultimately nobody cares more about that child than the parent. We \nare going to have opportunities later to talk about choice and, if a \nchild is either failing or if the child is locked in a failing school, \nor if a child is locked in a disadvantaged or unsafe school, whether \nthe parents be given the opportunity to participate in the welfare of \ntheir child by giving them an option to move that child to a safer \nschool.\n\n  We will have an opportunity to come back and debate that either later \nthis week or next week.\n  In the same way, when we come to this underlying question of \nmeasuring what one is learning or not learning, I would argue that it \nis necessary. We haven't been doing it in the past. We have to make the \ndiagnosis. Again, it comes back to the individual child. It comes back \nto the parent. That is why we need to step in. That is why, when people \nuse the word ``mandate,'' I think it is important for us to say at \nleast the value of testing is agreed upon, and the individual child or \nthat individual parent will know where the deficiencies are and how \nthey can improve. Is it math--adding or subtracting? Is it science? Is \nit how to use a computer? We don't know today.\n  How we can we intervene and help? How can parents help? Again, I will \nbet that will happen, once these assessments have been made available, \nthat the first people to look at them will be that parent, that school, \nand that community. Why? Because the value is there. They will know \nthat.\n  Annual testing is simply the only way to get away from the symptoms \nof things not going quite right. To be specific, fortunately we know \nwhat can be done.\n  If you have $1--whatever it is, a Federal, or a local dollar, or a \ndollar at school--you know how best to invest that dollar, and not just \nthrow a dollar at the symptoms. But you will know how to invest that \ndollar, and it can be accomplished through this legislation. It is \nalready in the legislation.\n  I want to make sure we don't, with this particular amendment, allow \nthe opportunity to strip away all accountability in the bill. That is \nthe heart of this bill.\n  We are going to talk flexibility and local control and decisionmaking \nat the local level involving the parents. But the heart of this bill \ncomes back to accountability.\n  This amendment basically gives the opportunity to say, let's just cut \nthe heart out of this bill; let's cut out the accountability \nprovisions; get rid of it, and we can feel good; and let's in fact \nthrow a lot more money at it. That is simply not the approach of the \nPresident of the United States, which says spend more money but link it \nto modern situations and accountability.\n  These assessments we talked about before. We allow individual States \nto participate. It is not a Federal test.\n  As I go across the country to talk to people, they ask, Are you doing \na standardized test out of Washington, DC? No. It is coming down at the \nlocal level. These tests are at the State level.\n  I believe these accountability provisions increase choice for \nstudents. They increase the opportunity to empower people to make \ndecisions that will benefit their education, again from the standpoint \nof the parents, and the education of a family as we go forward so that \nwe can truly leave no child behind.\n  Let me simply close by saying that money is not the answer. That is \nwhat we come back to. We talk a lot about the accountability. Money is \nimportant. But as we look to the past, and Federal education, State \neducation, and local education, spending has increased dramatically. \nTotal national spending on elementary and secondary education has \nincreased by about 30 percent over the last 10 years. Federal spending \non secondary and elementary education has increased by 180 percent. \nFederal spending is only 6 percent of the overall pie. The Federal role \nhas increased by 180 percent over the last decade. Over the past 5 \nyears, Federal funding for elementary and secondary programs has \nincreased by 52 percent.\n  Yet in spite of all of those increases--people can say that is not \nnear enough, or maybe some people would say that is way too much--over \ntime, test scores have been national. The achievement gap between the \nserved and the underserved, the rich, the poor--however, you want to \nmeasure it--has gotten greater in spite of this increased spending.\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\n  I, for one, believe we are going to have to inject--I agree with the \nPresident of the United States, we are in the short term going to have \nto put more into public education K-12 than we have at any time in the \npast. I am confident we will do that. The President has said that. This \nCongress has said it.\n  The authorization levels the Senator from Minnesota talked about have \ngone sky high, and it looks as if next week they will go higher and \nhigher. There is no way. There is not enough money around to be able to \nfulfill all the pledges that are being made. That is what an \nauthorization is. But when it comes back to the appropriation process \nthat works pretty well in this body, I am confident that under the \nleadership of this President and the commitment that has been made, we \nwill put more into education than has been put in in the past.\n  Again, the debate, I am sure, will go on for several hours. It is a \ngood amendment to have a debate on because it does link the importance \nof accountability with money. It focuses, I believe, on the fact that, \nyes, it is going to take some more money, but I do not want to have \nthis element of--not bribery; that is too strong of a term--but \nbasically saying, if you cannot meet this figure of $24 billion, we are \ngoing to cut the heart out of the education bill that the American \npeople believe in, that clearly a group of bipartisan Senators, who put \nthese accountability provisions in the bill, believe in, and that this \nPresident believes in.\n  I believe that is a disservice to the underlying bill and to the \nintent of what this Congress and this President has in mind; and that \nis, to leave no child behind.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Nevada needs \nto speak, too, so I will just take a couple minutes to respond.\n  First of all, the Senator from Tennessee talks about the importance \nof accountability. I was an educator, a college teacher for 20 years. I \ndo not give any ground on accountability. The point is not to confuse \naccountability, testing, and standardized tests as being one in the \nsame thing.\n  We have had two amendments that have been adopted which I think will \nat least make the testing, and hopefully the assessment, accurate and \ndone in a better way.\n  This amendment does not say that you do not do the testing. I may \nhave an amendment next week that goes right to the heart of that \nquestion with Senator Hollings, and others, but that is not what this \namendment is about.\n  Everybody in this Chamber has been saying they are for accountability \nand that we are also going to get the resources to the kids. We have to \ndo both. You can't do this on a tin-cup budget. We have to walk our \ntalk. Seventy-nine Senators voted for this authorization. But that is a \nfiction. It does not mean anything in terms of real dollars.\n  This amendment says that with the accountability comes the resources. \nWe make a commitment that, unless we live up to what we said we would \ndo by way of title I money for our school districts and our children, \nthen those school districts and States do not have to do the testing. \nThat is all it says.\n  That is my first point. So the argument that somehow this is an \namendment that declares null and void testing is just not accurate. I \nam just trying to get us to live up to our words.\n  The second point I want to make is that my colleague said--and I have \nto smile--somehow this is all about decentralization, whereas Democrats \ntend to look to the Federal Government. I have to tell you one more \ntime, I do not know where the conservatives are, or whether the whole \npolitical world is being turned upside down, but I seem to find myself \nbeing a Senator who--I have not resolved this question, but at the \nmoment I do not think it is appropriate that the Federal Government \nmandate, tell, insist, require that every school district in America \ntest every child every year.\n  This is radical. It is amazing to me. I am surprised others have not \nraised this question. Human rights, civil rights, antidiscrimination, \nyes, but this? I think we are going to rue the day we did this.\n  There is a rebellion right now in the country that is developing. \nPeople are going to say: You voted to make us do this? Where did you \nget off thinking you were the ones who had the authority to do that? I \nthink this is a real Federal reach.\n  My third point is, this is a real disagreement we have with my \ncolleague from Tennessee. My colleague is a very gifted doctor, and \neverybody gives him full credit, of which he richly deserves, but this \nis not trying to find out if a child has a heart problem.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield for a question. But with \nall due respect, we already know--I have been in a school every 2 weeks \nfor the last 10\\1/2\\ years. We know what is not working and what needs \nto be done. It is absolutely no secret.\n  We know that children, when they come to kindergarten, are way \nbehind. We know children who have had no prekindergarten education. We \nknow of the dilapidated buildings. We know of the overcrowded \nclassrooms. We know of kids having three or four teachers in 1 year. We \nknow of kids who are taught by teachers who aren't certified. We know \nkids go without afterschool care. We know of the disparity of resources \nfrom one school district to another. We know what the affluent children \nhave going for them versus what the poor children have going for them. \nWe know all that. We know we fund Early Head Start at 2 percent, 3 \npercent. And we fund Head Start at only 50 percent for 4-year-olds. We \nknow we fund affordable child care for low-income children where only \n10 percent can participate. We know all that.\n\n  What do we need to know? Why do we need the test? I ask my colleague \nfrom Tennessee, what I just said, are these not realities? Is there one \nthing that I have said that is not a fact, that is not empirical, that \nis not a reality in the lives of children in America? If you can tell \nme, Paul, there is something you just said that is not accurate, then \nyou can argue against this amendment. If you cannot, then you cannot. \nThis amendment does not say no to testing. It just says with the \ntesting and accountability come resources.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a very brief \nquestion?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the question I want to address to my \ncolleague from Minnesota has to do with the testing. I think it is \nworth talking about because I have done the very best I could to make \nthe case that for the individual child it is important to make the \ndiagnosis. Just throwing money at it is not going to do it.\n  The question I would like the Senator to respond to is, having \nchildren assessed from the third to the eighth grade, what is wrong \nwith that? I will argue you have to do it. And that is my side of the \nargument, which I tried to make. But what is wrong with it? Why will we \nrue the day that we give the opportunity for a third grader or a fifth \ngrader or a seventh grader the opportunity to figure out why they are \nnot being served well? Why do you object to having third, fourth, \nfifth, sixth, or seventh graders assessed?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague for the question because then I \nthink Senators can have a clear picture of the amendment on which we \nare going to vote.\n  This amendment does not say it is wrong to do that. This amendment \ndoes not say it is wrong to do the testing. This amendment does not say \nit is wrong to do the testing every year. This amendment says, if you \nare going to have a Federal mandate that every child is going to be \ntested every year, you better also have a Federal mandate that every \nchild is going to have the same opportunity to do well.\n  One of the major commitments we have not made is the title I money. \nThat is why the Governors in their letter said we favor this trigger \namendment. We want to make sure that they also, with the tests, get the \nresources. That is all this amendment says.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for another brief \nquestion?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. First, the Senator from Minnesota just said he thinks we \nwill rue the day we decided to assess the\n\n[[Page S5933]]\n\nstudents. My assumption was that he feels all students should not be \ntested, that we already know what the problem is. I thought that was \nwhat he said. And I asked him was he against the assessment because \nthere was not enough money going for it, but that he agrees assessments \nare the right way to go? If so, that is very important. I do not \nbelieve that is what he implied in his earlier comments.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, fair enough. I will say to my \ncolleague publicly, I have a couple different views.\n  First, the amendment. First, let's be clear about the amendment. The \namendment, you will be pleased to know, does not say no to testing at \nall--not at all. It simply says we ought to live up to our commitment \non the resources. That is all. That is all it says. That is it. If we \ndo not, it says to States: Look, if you do not want to do it, you do \nnot have to. That is the amendment.\n  Above and beyond that, I will say two other things to my colleague \nfrom Tennessee, who I know has shown a very strong interest in \neducation over the years. In our State--I am sure it is the case in \nTennessee--we are doing the testing. In fact, by the way, by what we \npassed for title I several years ago, we are just starting to get the \nresults of that testing, for which I voted. We are doing the testing. \nThe only thing I am telling you is that there is a difference between \nour school districts and our States deciding they want to do it because \nit is the right thing to do and the Federal Government telling them \nthey have to do it. I just think it is an important distinction. I do \nnot know where I come down on that final question yet. I just think it \nraises an important philosophical question.\n  Then the second point I make is that there is also a distinction \nbetween what we did several years ago with title I, which is a Federal \nprogram, saying we also want to see the testing and the accountability \nversus telling every school district in Tennessee and every school \ndistrict in Minnesota you will test every child every year--not every \nother year--but every year. That is sweeping.\n  My amendment is not about that question. I just raised that question. \nI haven't resolved that question. I will tell you one thing I have \nresolved, which is what this amendment is about. The worst thing we can \ndo is to pretend we don't know what the problems are and not make the \ncommitment with both the IDEA program and title I, which are two of our \nmajor program resources, so that we basically set everybody up for \nfailure. That is the worst thing we can do.\n  If you want to argue that money is not a sufficient condition, I \nagree. I think it is a necessary addition. We can go through the Rand \nCorporation assessment of title I and other assessments of title I \nprograms. I can talk about Minnesota. You can talk about Tennessee. A \nlot of these resources are key to prekindergarten, key to extra reading \nhelp, key to afterschool programs. This is really important. That is \nall this amendment says.\n  Did I answer my colleague's question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I would like to ask the Senator to \nclarify again. The amendment is set up such that if $24 billion is not \nappropriated--for people not in the Senate, that is where much of the \naction really is, and I agree with the Senator in terms of the \nimportance of appropriations and authorization--this President has \nbasically said he is going to put more money into education than any \nother President has in the past. I think that is important.\n  But from the assessment end, the ransom for the assessments is that \nif $24 billion is not appropriated, the amendment cuts the heart out of \nthe education reform bill, which means we will not be able to determine \nwith assessments whether that seventh grade girl has learned how to \nread.\n  I am asking, if it is really just the money, why is he linking it to \nthe heart and soul of the bill?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We have a letter from the Democratic Governors that \nsays:\n\n       [Above and beyond] the Carnahan/Nelson amendment, we are \n     hopeful the final version of the legislation to reauthorize \n     ESEA will apply a funding trigger more broadly, specifically \n     to include title I. This is the main source of federal \n     assistance for disadvantaged students, and the Federal \n     Government needs to back its efforts to strengthen \n     accountability with adequate new investment.\n\n  The reason they are tied together is that they go together, for God's \nsake. You can't test every child without also making sure these \nchildren have an opportunity to do well on the tests. Of course, they \ngo together. This amendment simply says that the tests authorized need \nnot be implemented until after the title I appropriation has reached \nthe level we said.\n  We said, 79 of us, we are going to appropriate this money; we are \ngoing to make sure that with the accountability comes the resources for \nthe kids to do well. We went on record.\n  Now I have this amendment that says we make the commitment to \nMinnesota, Michigan, Tennessee, and everywhere else, if we don't live \nup to our end of the bargain and you decide you don't want to do the \ntest, you don't have to. By the way, many States are doing it. It is up \nto them.\n  I am becoming a decentralist. I am becoming the conservative \nRepublican in this debate, apparently.\n  Mr. FRIST. My great fear is, if this amendment passes, let's say we \nput $22 billion in, you have destroyed the accountability, the heart \nand soul of this bill, the opportunity to give that seventh grader the \nopportunity to have the diagnosis made of why she is failing.\n  I don't understand the relationship. Why would you punish the child \nand eliminate the opportunity to diagnose her problems based on \nfunding? Again, why would one hold this ransom for, again, huge amounts \nof money, if you are not trying to link the two directly? Unless you \nare trying to bring down the whole bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, if I wanted to try to bring down the \nwhole bill, I would have an amendment out here to bring down the whole \nbill. Maybe I will, and it won't be successful. I am still trying to \nactually improve the bill, just as we did on testing. I say to my \ncolleague, we already have accountability with title I. That is law \nright now that is on going.\n  My second point is, this is an honest difference. My colleague's \nconcern is that we won't have a test, that somehow that will be nixed. \nMy concern is that if we just do the tests and make every school, every \nschool district, every child take the test every year, 8, 9, 10, 11, \n12, and 13, but we do not live up to our end of the bargain of \nproviding the resources so that the children can do well on the test--\nextra help for reading, prekindergarten, after school--then the only \nthing we have done is we have set them up for failure. I don't want to \ndo that. I think that is cruelty.\n  I cite again the study from Senator Graham which showed that poverty \npredicts 80 percent of the students' scores right now. I am not \nsurprised. I have been to school every 2 weeks for the last 10\\1/2\\ \nyears. I know that. So far, I haven't heard any compelling reasons \nagainst this.\n  For Democrats, our party, we have been out publicly saying that we \nare committed to the resources that go with the testing. It is time to \nwalk the talk.\n  I know there are going to be some other Senators who will speak. I \nwant to go on to another aspect of this. I have spent some time on \nthis, but this is a little different. This has to do with why testing \nactually can do more harm than good if we don't give the schools the \nresources to do better. I have not made that argument yet.\n  I will start out quoting the Committee for Economic Development, \nwhich is a strong protesting coalition of business leaders who warn \nagainst test-based accountability systems that lead to narrow test-\nbased coaching rather than rich instruction. I will tell you what \nhappens. We don't give the schools the resources. In this particular \ncase, I am talking about title I. That is a real commitment on our \npart. They are going and you are going to do the testing, and the \ntesting is also going to determine consequences for those schools, \nwhether they are sanctioned, whether principals are removed.\n  Do you know what happens when they don't have the resources and this \nis what you do? It leads, I say as a teacher--I am not a doctor; my \ncolleague is a doctor--it leads to the\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n\nworst kind of education. Do you know what they are going to do? It is \nwhat they are doing right now. You drop social studies. You drop \npoetry. You don't take the kids to the art museum. And you have drilled \neducation where the teachers are teaching to the tests because they are \nunder such duress. That is exactly what happens.\n  For example, in Washington State, a recent analysis by the Rand \nCorporation showed that fourth grade teachers shifted significant time \naway from arts, science, health and fitness, social studies, \ncommunication and listening skills because they were not measured by \nthe test.\n  I do not know if I am making the case the way I want to make the \ncase, but the schools that are going to be under duress are the ones \nwhere the children have not had the same opportunity to learn. They \ncame to kindergarten way behind, and we are not making a commitment to \nearly childhood.\n  Now what happens is because of this--and I see my colleague from New \nJersey, and I will finish in 3 minutes so he can speak; I thank him for \nbeing here--now because of this duress, what we have is these schools \nare dropping social studies, art, trips to museums because they are not \ntested and the teachers are being asked to be drill instructors.\n  Guess what. Some beautiful, talented teachers are leaving teaching \ntoday because of this. This is crazy. We better give them the \nresources.\n  I say to my colleague from New Jersey, this is a classic example. The \nStevens Elementary School in Houston pays as much as $10,000 a year to \nhire Stanley Kaplan to teach teachers how to teach kids to take tests. \nAccording to the San Jose Mercury, schools in East Palo Alto, which is \none of the poorest districts in California, paid Stanley Kaplan $10,000 \neach to consult with them on test-taking strategies.\n  According to the same articles, schools across California are \nspending thousands to buy computer programs, hire consultants, and \npurchase workbooks and materials. They are redesigning spelling tests \nand math tests all to enable students to be better test takers.\n  Forget sense of irony. Forget childhood. Forget 8-year-olds \nexperiencing all the unnamed magic of the world before them. Forget \nteaching that fires the imagination of children. Drill education to \ntaking tests: it is educationally deadening. That is another reason why \nwithout the resources this is not a big step forward. This is a huge \nleap backwards.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime. My colleague may want to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. If I can take 2 or 3 minutes. Madam President, as I \nspelled out earlier, this amendment is the heart of what President Bush \nput on the table: strong accountability to ensure that we do not leave \nany child behind.\n  If this amendment is adopted, we are in a significant way putting at \nrisk the entire bill because accountability is the heart and soul of \nthe bill. This is where I think the real progress will be made; that \nis, making the diagnosis so we know how to invest education dollars and \nresources. This is the spirit of reform.\n  All of it depends on knowing where students are and being able to \nfollow their progress over time so we can intervene at an appropriate \ntime.\n  It is interesting. We talk about dollars. We will be talking about \nassessments and dollars, and in the amendment they are linked together. \nI do not think some sort of ransom should be placed over this bill. We \nhave the appropriations process that is going to deal with the reforms \nwe put into place.\n  If we go back to 1994, the Democrats passed a law which required \nStates to develop broad comprehensive reforms in content, curriculum, \nand performance standards. To align those reforms with all of the new \nassessments, much more would need to be added to the bill we are \ndebating today.\n\n  Immediately after passage of that law, the President's request in \n1994 for discretionary education funding included a $484 million \nspending cut. The Democratic President's request to cut spending was \ncoupled with those new reforms. In the end, the Democratic Congress \npassed an appropriations bill that contained a tiny 0.012-percent \nincrease. That is tiny. That is essentially flat, and therefore \nprovided no new funding for those new reforms.\n  I say all of that because they established new reforms in assessments \nand testing but did not match investment with assessments. This is the \nissue we have been talking about the last couple of hours.\n  The provisions in this bill are more modest. I favor what is in the \nbill now. I favor the principles the President put on the table, and I \nthink we are going to benefit children greatly with it. We have the \ncommitment of the President of the United States and at least this side \nof the aisle to increase education funding by 11 percent. It may be a \nlittle bit less; it may be a little bit more, but it will be about 11 \npercent.\n  It is ironic to me as we talk about assessments and measurements, \nthat the broad reforms in 1994 under different leadership had \nessentially flat funding. Yet under this President, we have reforms \nwhich are not quite as ambitious in terms of testing, but we have an \nincrease in education funding of over 11 percent. People ought to \nremember this historic perspective as we continue this debate.\n  I am thankful for the opportunity to talk about the assessments, the \nheart of this bill. Again, money is not the answer. We have tried it \nfor the last 35 years, and we are failing. We are failing our students; \nwe are failing the next generation. We have to couple reform with a \nsignificant increase in spending to which we have agreed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First, for my colleague to say if Senators vote for \nthis, the testing might not take place is as much as saying, therefore, \nwe are not going to live up to our word. If my colleagues vote for this \namendment, the testing will take place because I assume we are going to \nlive up to our word. Seventy-nine of us already voted for this.\n  All this amendment says is we are going to be clear to States and \nschool districts that we are going to live up to our commitment of \nresources. That is the first point.\n  The second point--my colleague from Tennessee left--to say this is \nmore modest than in 1994, my God, we are telling every school district \nin every State they have to test every child, every year, ages 8, 9, \n10, 11, 12, 13. That is not modest in scope.\n  At the very minimum, transitioning to the Senator from New Jersey, \nwhat I am saying is, if we are going to have a national mandate of \nevery child being tested, then we ought to have a national mandate of \nevery opportunity for every child to do well. I reserve the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I could not agree more with my \ndistinguished Senate colleague and friend from Minnesota. I rise in \nsupport of his amendment which ensures we not only test our kids, but \nwe actually provide promised resources we have talked about over and \nover in this body to improve educational quality. He believes and I \nbelieve, and I think common sense argues, that unfunded mandates that \nare put upon our local school districts only aggravate disparities we \nalready have about how our children are educated. We ought to make sure \nwe start putting money where we are putting mandates on our \ncommunities.\n  Before I discuss the amendment, let me thank Senator Wellstone for \nhis leadership on a whole host of these educational matters. It is \nterrific how he has spoken out about leaving no child behind. I am very \ngrateful for his dedication to quality education for all of our kids, \nand I am sure the country benefits.\n  I agree we need to build more accountability into the system. \nStudents, teachers, and administrators need to be held accountable for \nresults. I come from the business world. We look at bottom lines. We \nought to get to stronger and stronger results. Congress should be held \naccountable, too, and that is the purpose of this amendment.\n  Accountability measures focused only on our kids, schools, teachers, \nand administrators just do not seem enough to assure that our children \nget an adequate education.\n\n[[Page S5935]]\n\n  As the Senator from Minnesota has spoken about several times today, \n79 Senators supported an amendment to increase the authorization for \nthe title I provisions in this bill to move that up to $24 billion-plus \nin the year 2005. Seventy-nine Senators voted in support of that. With \nthat vote, we made a promise to millions of children who live in \ndisadvantaged areas that those promises of better schools and greater \nopportunities would be real. We need to make sure that was not an empty \npromise, political rhetoric, or cynical posturing.\n\n  We have been underfunding the title I program for years. Never in the \nentire history of the program, which began in 1965, has Congress fully \nfunded the program. Then we hear we are not getting the results we are \nsupposed to be getting when we do not put the resources that actually \ndeliver the goods on preschool or afterschool programs or reading \nprograms and the other issues about which people are talking. We \ncomplain but we do not put the resource there to make sure we can \ndeliver in those places where they don't have the resources to provide \nthe educational opportunities other places in the country have.\n  We have seen the educational dollar that the Federal Government \nprovides for education shrink from 12 cents to 7 cents, with some talk \nabout 6 cents. We shrink that and we wonder why we get disparate \nresults.\n  Title I is a critical program if we are to ensure all children in our \nsociety are provided with meaningful educational and economic \nopportunity. Title I is the engine of change for low-income school \ndistricts across this country. The program is used to train teachers, \nto provide new technology for students, to support literacy and \nafterschool programs, and to promote preschool programs, a whole host \nof items that will make a difference and to make sure every child has a \ncomparable education from one community to the next.\n  Together, these initiatives have proven effective where they have \nbeen applied, raising test scores and improving educational \nachievement. But we have to have the resources. It has been underfunded \nfor far too long and too many kids have been left behind. The engine of \nreform needs fuel.\n  Let me be clear. I support testing. I think it is a good idea. I am \nnot sure much of what we are putting in place is a good idea, but I \nsupport testing. By itself, testing is not enough. I am sure it gets \nour priorities right. What good does it do to test kids if we do not \nprovide the tools needed to respond to bad test results and, more \nimportantly, even prepare for the tests. It would be similar to \ndiagnosing an illness and refusing to prescribe the drugs needed to \ncure it. That does not make sense.\n  This amendment stands simply for truth in legislation. It is easy for \nCongress to authorize funding for programs. It makes political \ncampaigning a lot easier to go out and say: I stood in there and I \nstood for authorizing title I funds for all our kids. Many people in \nthe country hear we have done that and they think we have fully funded \nit. As my colleagues know, an authorization is little more than a \npromise, and all too often it is an empty promise.\n  In my view, when it comes to providing quality education for all of \nour children, we need to make sure the promise is real. We need to put \nthe money where the authorizing words state they should be. We must \nprovide our schools with the resources to help students achieve their \nfull potential. We must address the glaring disparity in resources that \nundermines America's sense of fairness and equal opportunity. We want \nto hold every child to high standards. We must provide every child with \nthe opportunity to meet them. We have to hold ourselves to high \nstandards.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota. Let's test our kids but get real and provide the resources \nwe have been promising to ensure quality education for all.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will give the Senate a bit of background. This \namendment tracks the amendment that Senator Dodd worked on with Senator \nCollins. The Senate went on record--79 Senators--saying we would make \nthis commitment to title I and over a 10-year period we would have \nfunding.\n  I don't think the Senator would disagree, as much as I was for it, in \nsome ways I very much regret we could not have said full funding in 1 \nyear. For a 7-year-old, 10 years is too late.\n  In any case, this amendment says by 2005 the Senate went on record \nsaying we ought to be spending $25 billion on title I because that puts \nus on track for full funding, gets more resources to schools and our \nchildren, more help for reading. It can be prekindergarten; it can be \ntechnology; it can be more professional training for teachers; it can \nbe afterschool programs.\n  This amendment says, if we do not live up to our commitment, the \nStates and school districts, if they do not want to do the testing, do \nnot have to. It is up to them. No one is telling them they can't do it, \nbut it is entirely up to them. We have been saying over and over and \nover again, with accountability comes resources. I wanted to give my \ncolleague a bit of background.\n  My other point is, if we are going to have a mandate of every child \nbeing tested, we better also have a national mandate of every child \nhaving the same opportunity to do well. Since the title I program is \none of the major ways we at the Federal level make a commitment to low-\nincome, disadvantaged children, we ought to live up to our word. That \nis what this amendment says.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my good friend and colleague from Minnesota and \nexpress my appreciation to him for raising this amendment. This is not \na unique approach. We have taken on matters where we linked financing \nwith obligations. One of the constant complaints we receive as Members \nwhen we return home to our respective States and speak with our mayors \nand Governors, our local legislators, we often hear, regardless of the \njurisdiction--Minnesota, Connecticut, Michigan, New Hampshire, \nMassachusetts--you folks in Washington like to tell us what we need to \ndo, but you rarely come up with the resources to help us do what you \ntell us we have to do.\n  We have gone through an extensive debate as part of this discussion \non special education. We made a commitment as the Federal Government \nyears ago that said every child ought to have the opportunity for a \nfull education, as much as they are capable of achieving, and that \nspecial education students would be a part.\n  We promised we would meet 40 percent of the cost of that as a result \nof a Federal requirement. That commitment was made 25 years ago. It \ntook 25 years, until just recently, as a result of the efforts of the \nSenator from Massachusetts, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, \nSenator Collins, my colleague from Minnesota, and many others, who said \nwe were going to have to meet that obligation, financially supporting \nthe special education needs of the country. As a result of their \nefforts, we have included in this bill a mandatory spending requirement \nto meet those obligations.\n  I raised the issue about 12 years ago in the Budget Committee and \nlost on a tie vote.\n  Why do I bring that up and discuss it in the context of this \namendment? If we fail to adopt this amendment that the Senator from \nMinnesota has suggested, in 5, 10, 15 years, we will have a similar \ndemand made by the very people asking us today to fulfill the financial \nobligations that we owe as a result of mandating special education \nneeds.\n  People may not like that comparison, but that is a fact. We are \nsaying to these students, across the country, disregarding States and \nin a sense localities, here are some standards we expect you to meet. \nWe are willing to authorize, as we did by a vote of 79-21, some \nsubstantial sums of money to allow for full funding of title I as a \nresult of the heroic efforts of my friend and colleague from Maine, \nSenator Collins, along with 78 others in this Chamber. We went on \nrecord, with a rather overwhelming vote. This was not a 51-49 vote. \nAlmost 80 Members of the body said full funding of title I is something \nwe ought to do.\n  If this bill is going to work, we ought to fully fund this program. \nWe said over 10 years.\n  I would have preferred if it was a more brief period of time, but we \nhave to accept the realities. I think it is important to note that it \noccurred. It is a\n\n[[Page S5936]]\n\ntrue expression of the desire of Members here, regardless of party or \nideology. As a result of the demands we will make in this legislation, \nwe are fully prepared to do something that kids on the corner often say \nto each other: Put your money where your mouth is.\n  We have had a pretty good mouth when it comes to telling the country \nwhat they ought to do. The question is whether or not we will put the \nmoney up to back up and support the demands we are making here.\n  I think the amendment offered is one that is important. It says, \nobviously, if you want to live up to those commitments--we are asking \nschools to be accountable, to be responsible--then we should as well. \nWe cannot very well demand a third grader be responsible or fourth \ngrader or fifth grader or some impoverished rural district or urban \ndistrict--as we demand accountability from a superintendent of schools, \na principal, a teacher--and then we duck our responsibility here.\n  There is a long and painful history where demands have been made by \nthis government on our localities and our States and then we have \nfailed to back up those demands by failing to provide the resources to \naccomplish them.\n  This is about as critical an area as can be, education. I do not want \nto see us coming out of this with a self-fulfilling prophecy of \nfailure. I don't want us to know going in, as a result of the paucity \nof resources, that young children living in some of the toughest areas \nof the country are deprived of the resources necessary so they can \nmaximize their potential. As we begin this testing process, year in and \nyear out, as we watch the scores not improving because the title I \nfunds are not there--and by the way they work. Title I funds work as we \nknow based on all sorts of examinations and studies that have been \ndone. Therefore, it seems to me we want to have funding.\n  My colleagues and I were at recent meetings at the White House. I \ndon't believe we should go into the details of those meetings. The \nPresident was gracious enough to invite us to those. He cares about \neducation a lot. I have no doubt that President Bush cares about it. He \nmade that point when he was Governor. He provided evidence of it. He \nhas spoken out about it numerous times and gone to schools all across \nthe country. So the fact that we are of different political parties or \npersuasions is not the point, obviously. I am willing to believe that \nhis slogan that he used a lot during the campaign of ``leave no child \nbehind'' is sincerely and deeply felt.\n  All I am suggesting, as are the Senator from Minnesota and others who \nsupport this, is to see those achievements. I believe this President \nwants to see these kids do better. That is what we all want.\n  We spend less than 2 percent of the entire Federal budget on \nelementary and secondary education--less than 2 percent. I think that \nwould probably come as a shock to most Americans who send their tax \ndollars to Washington to discover that less than 2 cents on every \ndollar the Federal Government spends actually goes to elementary and \nsecondary education. I am excluding higher education.\n  We have all heard the speeches given around the country of how \nimportant this is, that any nation that ever expects to improve or grow \nhas to have an educational system that creates the opportunities for \nits people. So this is about as important an issue as there is. When \nyou talk about economic growth, economic stability, education is about \nas important an issue as you can discuss. If we fail to have an \neducated generation, all the rhetoric, all the decisions by the Federal \nReserve Board, all the decisions by the Treasury, all the decisions \nmade by Wall Street, will not mean a lot if we do not have an educated \npopulation able to fill the jobs and perform the work needed to keep \nthis economy and our country strong.\n\n  This is the first step. If we get this wrong, then the likelihood we \nwill succeed at every other point is reduced dramatically, in my view. \nI do not think that is a unique perspective. I suspect if you were to \nask the 100 Members of this body whether or not you could have true \neconomic development and true economic stability and success without a \nstrong educational system, I do not know of a single Member of this \nbody who would accept that as a likely conclusion.\n  What we are saying is, if that is the case, then should we not link \nthis issue of providing the resources necessary to the title I program, \nwhich has proved to be so successful, and to say that before we start \ndemanding these tests and so forth we are going to see to it that these \nyoung people, and these communities, are going to have the resources to \nget the job done? That, it seems to me, is only fair and right. If the \nresources are not going to be there, does anyone doubt, can anyone \nstand up and say if the resources are not there, that these children, \nthe most needy in the country--in rural and urban America, most of \nthem--are going to be able to do better on these tests?\n  If you do not have the resources to make these environments better, \nthere is no doubt about the outcomes. You are not going to hire the \nteachers who are qualified. You are not going to have the tools \nnecessary. That is just a fact.\n  There is more empirical evidence to support that statement than \nanything I know of. Over and over again we are told it will not work if \nyou do not have the tools. No matter how strong the desire, no matter \nhow ambitious these parents or these children may be, they have to have \nthe tools. You cannot be in a classroom with 40 kids and learn. A \nteacher cannot teach.\n  You cannot get ready for the 21st century economy without a wired \nschool and the ability to access the technology available.\n  You cannot have teachers who know nothing about the subject matter \nteaching math, science or reading. They cannot do it. Don't expect a \nchild anywhere to learn under those circumstances.\n  The fact is, in more schools around the country, those are the \nrealities. I wish I could magically wave a wand and automatically \nguarantee that there will be these tools available. But none of us \npossesses that kind of power. You have to have the resources to do it.\n  So to go out and test a bunch of kids who have not had the support \nand backing necessary for them to be accurately tested has structured a \nvery cruel arrangement for this Congress and this administration to \nimpose. It is going to produce predictable results. So I think the \nSenator from Minnesota has properly asked us to do what any mayor, any \nGovernor, any school board or principal or superintendent would ask of \nus. I think what they are saying to us--my colleague from Minnesota can \ncorrect me--they are saying: Look, we accept the challenge you imposed \non us. I know my friend from Minnesota and I have heard from a number \nof people who have questioned the wisdom of this annual testing idea as \na way of somehow proving whether or not kids are doing better. I get \nvery uneasy about what teachers are going to be teaching. It is what I \ncall turning our schools into test prep centers where you spend half \nthe year or more of it getting the kids ready to do well on the tests \nbecause the teachers, the superintendent, the principal, the Governor--\neverybody wants to look good and pass the test. I don't know whether \nyou learn anything or not, but you pass the test. I get nervous about \nan educational system that is more geared to passing some test so more \nof the ``political'' people can have bright stars attached to their \nnames.\n\n  I think testing is valuable, but your educational system is geared \ntoward those testing requirements rather than educating children. I \ncertainly think math and reading are very important--but I also think \nscience is important, I think history is important, I think geography \nis important, I think languages are important. My fear is in some ways \nwe are going to get so focused on a couple of disciplines which are \ncritical--very critical, essential, Madam President--but at the expense \nof a lot of other areas which are also critical for the full and proper \ndevelopment of a child's educational needs.\n  You do not have to be an educational genius to know what can happen \nif you are just geared to getting the class to pass the Federal test in \norder to keep the school open. I am very worried about that.\n  But I will put that aside. I will put my worries aside for a minute. \nI am not the only one worried. This is not just Democrats and \nRepublicans who\n\n[[Page S5937]]\n\nare worried. I think parents out there who may not know all the nuances \nof this bill are worried. People who work hard in school every day will \ntell you they know what they are going to end up doing. But we will put \nthat aside for a second.\n  At the very least, if we are going to demand this in tests, it seems \nwe have to have the kid prepared, at least give them a chance to do \nwell.\n  If the resources are not there for them to do well, then I think we \nall know what the results are going to be. That is really what this \namendment is all about. Maybe it is more complicated than that. But I \ndon't think it is.\n  Take the environment, or transportation, or any subject you want. No \none would suggest that you can anticipate high performance without the \nresources being there to help you achieve it. Yet in the education \nfield we seem to be indulging in a fiction that somehow we can set the \nstandard and demand the test, hold back the resources, and expect the \nstudents to reach it. I don't know where else you could ever imagine \nthat kind of result to occur.\n  We seem to be anticipating 50 million children around America, if the \nbill is passed and signed by the President shortly thereafter, having \nto meet these tests. It is fewer than 50, because we are talking about \ngrades 3-8. Whatever that number is of kids in elementary and secondary \nschool--perhaps it is 30 million who are in our elementary schools. So \n30 million kids will start to be tested. You are not going to have the \nresources necessary to help the hardest hit schools in America ensure \nthat the children are well prepared.\n  I realize this amendment is troublesome to people. They prefer that \nwe don't demand this. But just as we demanded special education for \nchildren without resources, until finally people were banging on the \ndoors of Washington and saying, ``You people promised to help us do \nthis,'' I suggest we get ahead of their argument and provide the \nresources as a result of the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota, \nand then go forward with it.\n  I am prepared to support this. But I say to my friend from Minnesota, \nas hesitant as I am about supporting testing in the third, fourth, \nfifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth grades--by the way, if it were one \ntest, I wouldn't mind. This is Federal. Forget about the State and \nlocal. On average, there are about five tests that kids have to go \nthrough during a year. I am willing to accept that. But I have the \noutrageous demand that we provide the resources to these schools so \nthese kids have a chance to demonstrate what they are capable of.\n  If you are telling me that I can't have the resources to at least \ngive them a chance to prove how bright they can be, don't ask me to \nrequire a kid to take a test that they can't possibly pass and set them \nup for failure in life.\n  We only debate this bill once every 6 years. I suspect many of us on \nthe floor today may not be here the next time the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act is debated. If it were debated every year, I \nmight wait until next year to try it. But if we don't provide the \nfunding in the language here that provides for it, a half a decade or \nmore will go by before we are back again discussing this.\n  I don't want in this last debate for the next 5 or 6 years, where we \nmandate this testing and mandate these standards from Washington to \nevery school district in America, to then stick our hands in our \npockets and walk away and tell them we are not going to give them the \nresources necessary to achieve success. I am confident they can \nachieve.\n  We have no obligation to guarantee any American success. But we do \nhave an obligation to guarantee every American the opportunity to \nachieve his or her potential. That is a responsibility that I think I \nbear as a Member of this body. I am going to be hard pressed to vote \nfor a piece of legislation that demands success without giving these \nkids the opportunity to prove what they are capable of.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has offered us an amendment which would \ncomplete the circle by requiring the tests but providing the resources \nthat will allow us to judge fairly whether or not these children, their \nparents, and their schools are meeting their obligations. I thank my \ncolleague for offering the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I know other people desire to speak. I would like to \ntake 20 seconds to say to the Senator from Connecticut that, try as I \nmight, I cannot say it as well as he did. I thank him. We thank each \nother all the time. But what he said was so powerful. Honest to God, it \nwas so powerful. I really do believe having national testing without \nany guarantee of equal opportunity to pass the test, and the \nopportunity to do well, is ethically unjust. What we are trying to say \nwith this amendment is let's give these children the opportunity to do \nas well as they can. I thank him.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield to no one in this body in my \nbattle to seek full-funding for the title I program. I joined with the \nSenator from Connecticut and the Senator from Maine on the amendment to \nauthorize full funding for title I. I have supported additional funding \nin this bill, in terms of professional development, bilingual programs, \nafterschool programs, school construction, and the other programs. We \nare going to make every effort to ensure that reforms are accompanied \nby resources.\n  But I have to really take issue with some of the points that have \nbeen raised this afternoon, including the statements from my good \nfriend from Connecticut. We are already testing. Forty-six States \ncurrently administer annual reading and math tests in two or more grade \nlevels.\n  Adequate yearly progress in current law, as well as in this \nlegislation, will be based upon the tests that were held last year. \nThat legislation is currently in place. It is happening in my State. I \nwill spend some time later in my conversation to go through the scores \nof States that already test in grades 3-8. That is already taking \nplace.\n  No one argues with the point about ensuring that all students will be \nprepared to take these tests. However, it is not quite that easy, even \nwith the full funding for title I. We are not providing full funding \nfor the Head Start Programs--only 40 percent. We are not providing full \nfunding for the Early Start Programs. All are enormously important for \nour children to progress. But a number of States are doing a very good \njob.\n  On the idea that we were going to effectively end any assistance to \nthose States after we accepted the amendments from the Senator from \nVermont in terms of effectively saying if we don't get the funding for \neffective tests, that we are not going to be obligated to do it, we \nhave accepted the Wellstone amendment in terms of quality; we have \naccepted the Wellstone amendment for increased funding; we are going to \nmake the battle in terms of funding for those programs.\n  But those tests which the States are using under this legislation are \nhappening today in 46 States. The question is, How are we going to have \nthose tests? What I think the Senators from Minnesota and Connecticut, \nand I think on all sides of the aisle, want is not punishment for \nstudents but instruments by which we can determine what children are \nlearning and what they are not learning: We want tests that will be \nresponsive to curriculum reform with well-trained teachers in those \nclassrooms. It is going to take some time. But we have recognized that \nwe are going to try to use quality tests in an effective way to enhance \nchildren's learning.\n  I am not going to take a good deal of time, although I had the good \nopportunity in Massachusetts last week to appear at a conference \nsponsored by Mass Insight, and also to meet with Achieve--a nationally \nknown organization that has been working on accountability for several \nyears.\n  When I met with Achieve, they reported that 22 schools in \nMassachusetts have made significant progress using tests and \ndemonstrating, with measurable results, how students have been making \nprogress. Those tests are being used well and effectively. No one \nstands to defend poor quality tests that may, in fact, be detrimental \nto children. But, the Senator from Minnesota's premise that if we do \nnot get to the full funding for the Title I program within 4 years, \nthat we cannot\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\nprovide for high-quality tests and good school reforms, is flawed. \nChoosing not to commit to developing good instruments of educational \nassessment and high standards that will drive curriculum reform, \nteacher reform, educational reform, and accountability in those \ncommunities, I think, just misses the point.\n  Our bill in the Senate requires States to develop assessments in \ngrades 3 through 8 in math and literacy, with the understanding that \nthose subjects are vital to the future educational success of children. \nIf students do not know how to read, they cannot learn. If they do not \nknow mathematics, they cannot continue their education, and they will \nnot be able to survive in the modern economy. So, we have made a \ncommitment in this bill to ensure that States develop and implement \ntests in those subject areas.\n  But in the 1994 reauthorization of ESEA, we required States to \nadminister tests for school accountability at least three times: one in \ngrades 3-5, once in grades 6-9, and once in grades 10-12. Some States \nhave done a very good job of developing these assessments. Some have \nnot done so well. But this bill seeks to build upon the progress made \nby those States who have developed high-quality assessments, and ensure \nthat the additional assessments developed by States are of the highest \nquality.\n  I question the logic of discouraging high-quality assessment that \nwill provide data to help improve education, if in Congress may not be \nable to secure 100 percent of the resources for reforms across the \nboard in Title I. I cannot understand this, as much as I fight for \nincreased funding for enhanced professional development, afterschool \nprograms, technology, literacy programs, and scores of other reforms \nessential to improve student achievement.\n  There are not many Members of the Senate who like increased funding \nas much as I do. However, we should not use tests as a scapegoat if we \nare not able to achieve all that we advocate for. We should not take \nout our frustrations that stem from insufficient funding for Title I, \non what have been recognized as effective instruments that measure \nstudent achievement, and help teachers tailor instruction to meet the \nneeds of students. That should not be our goal.\n  I respect the opinion of my friend from Minnesota, and understand \nthat he does not regard assessments as having a critical role in school \nreform. I know that he feels too many teachers teach to the test, and \nthat too many tests are used punitively, rather than constructively. I \nbelieve that his concerns are at the heart of this amendment. However, \ngood tests can play an important role in school reform.\n  Earlier in our consideration of this bill I mentioned examples of \nassessments working in tandem with efforts to reform schools, as has \noccurred in my own State of Massachusetts, at the Jeremiah Burke High \nSchool. The Burke school lost its accreditation 6 years ago because of \nthe low-level of education that was being offered at that school. This \nyear, the school has one of the lowest dropout rates in the city of \nBoston. And every single student has been accepted to college. High \nexpectations, high standards, and the assessments needed to measure \nprogress.\n\n  At the Burke school, they use tests to identify student weaknesses, \nand develop what is almost an individualized curriculum and academic \nprogram for each student in need of extra help. This is not a school \nthat has great financial resources, but to the credit of the principal, \nthe Burke school was received with great excitement by parents and the \nlocal community for the academic progress that has been made in the \nschool.\n  I am not prepared to accept an amendment that would propose to throw \naway meaningful and important tools to gauge student achievement if \nCongress cannot secure full-funding for all of the reforms included in \nthis bill. I do not think that is wise education policy. I think such \nan amendment effectively undermines this legislation.\n  I take a backseat to no one in the fight to increase funding for \nTitle I and other programs. But no member in this body thinks we'll \nmeet the rate of increase for Title I called for in this amendment.\n  We should not discard the tools that can help promote school success. \nI think that we should accept the basic assessment provisions in this \nlegislation, and take steps to monitor and watch State's progress \ntoward fulfilling the promise of those provisions. We are going to have \nto ensure that States develop and implement effective, quality tests.\n  We have taken steps, with the Collins amendment, to review and \nfinancially evaluate the costs associated with producing effective \ntests. I can commit that as long as I am chairman of the Education \nCommittee, we will have vigorous, vigorous oversight on this particular \nissue. We will take the steps that are necessary to alter and change \nthis situation if States do not have the resources to effectively \ndevelop or use assessments.\n  But to eliminate provisions to provide for instruments that are being \nused as tools for reform by teachers throughout the country would be \nwrong. We should promote teachers' understanding of what children are \nlearning, and we should promote parents' understanding of what children \nare learning. Denying parents the opportunity to understand how their \nchildren's school is performing makes no sense.\n  At the appropriate time, I intend to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, first of all, let me be real clear. I \nhave said that in my own mind it is an interesting question as to \nwhether or not the Federal Government ought to be telling every school \ndistrict in every State to do this. I have never said I am opposed to \naccountability. I was a college teacher for 20 years, and I do not tend \nto give ground on this issue.\n  The reason I have had amendments to try to make this testing of high \nquality is because, if this is going to be done, it has to be done the \nright way. But there is more to this legislation.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts says we are already doing this with \ntitle I. That is right. This legislation requires every school district \nto test every child--not just title I children, every child, every \nyear.\n  I have heard Senator after Senator after Senator say we ought to, \nalong with the mandate of testing every child, have the opportunity for \nevery child to do well. That is all this amendment says.\n  I cannot believe what I have heard in this Chamber, which is that we \nare not going to live up to what we said. Seventy-nine Senators voted \nfor the authorization. We were going to fully fund title I in 10 years. \nIt was going to be up to the level of $25 billion in 2005. Right now we \nare only funding 30 percent of the children who are eligible. And now \nmy colleague comes to the floor and says that is all fiction, that it \nis never going to happen.\n  If it is never going to happen, why, in God's name, do we want to \npretend it is going to happen? Whatever happened to the idea that every \nchild should have the same opportunity to succeed and do well?\n  I will say it one more time. I have heard a million people--I am the \none who first said it--say you cannot achieve the goal of leaving no \nchild behind on a tin-cup budget. You cannot pretend to have education \nreform on a tin-cup budget. I have heard Senator after Senator after \nSenator say we are going to do both accountability and resources. All \nthis amendment says is, not that States and school districts cannot \ntest--they can; not that they don't want to go ahead with testing--they \ncan. What we are saying is, if we do not live up to our commitment to \nprovide the money for more help for kids for reading, more \nprekindergarten education, more afterschool education, then the State \ncan say they do not want to do the testing.\n  We ought to live up to our end of the bargain. I cannot believe we \nare acting as if the test brings about better teachers; that testing \nleads to smaller class sizes; that testing means kids come to \nkindergarten ready to learn; that testing means children get the help \nthey need. None of that is happening the way it should. And title I is \npart of our commitment.\n  Can't we at least live up to our words? That is all this amendment \nsays. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Is the Senator from Minnesota\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\nyielding time to the Senator from Rhode Island?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-five and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield 10 minutes to my colleague from \nRhode Island. I also say, in 30 seconds right now, for month after \nmonth after month, I have been hearing how we are going to get a \ncommitment from the administration of resources. We have no commitment \nof any resources in this bill when it comes to title I. I am trying to \nmake sure we live up to our promises.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Wellstone \namendment and a strong supporter of the amendment. I believe what \nSenator Wellstone is doing is calling our collective bluff. We talk \nabout high standards, high accountability for every school in America. \nWe talk about not leaving any child behind. We talk about authorizing \nsignificant amounts of money for title I. In fact, we have all come \ntogether, 79 of us, to vote for a substantial increase in title I \nspending--authorization, not appropriation, under the leadership of \nSenator Dodd and Senator Collins.\n  What he is saying is, if we are all in favor, if we have all voted \nfor it, let's make sure we do it. Let's make sure we do it in \nconjunction with the testing, not after the fact, not testing first, \nmoney later. Let's do it together.\n  That is very wise public policy. It reflects what we have all been \ntalking about for weeks and weeks now. I have heard in the course of \nthe debate analogies to other realms of endeavor, talking about the \nefficacy, the importance of testing. We know testing is important. \nThere is no one in the Senate who does not recognize that if you test \nstudents to see if they are making progress, you have to evaluate the \ntest scores of schools to see if they are adequate. No one is arguing \nwith that logic.\n  Let's look at, for example, a medical situation. If you showed up in \none hospital, you would get the same test as another hospital across \ntown. But in one hospital, you are discovered to have a serious heart \nproblem. They don't have a lot of money, so they give you some chewing \ngum. The other hospital across town has lots of money, so they give you \nbeta blockers and all sorts of exercise counseling, \nnutrition, everything under the sun. You are besieged by counselors and \ntherapists, people organizing your life so that you can deal \neffectively with this discovery. It is the same test, however, with \nmuch different results. Senator Wellstone is arguing, we will have \nthose tests, but we want the same results.\n\n  Frankly, it is about money. It is about resources. The difference, as \nhe pointed out so well, between the performance of students on tests is \ninextricably, invariably linked to the income levels of those students \nand, as a result, the income levels of those schools. We all know the \nbasic source of funding for public education in the United States is \nthe property tax. Inner cities with declining property values put less \ninto their programs than affluent suburbs. The reality is, if we really \nwant the system to work, if we want the tests to work, to do more than \njust identifying failure, if we want to guarantee success, we have to \nput these resources in. That is the heart of the amendment.\n  I have also heard--and we hear this every time we engage in a debate \non education--we are doing so much worse compared to other countries, \nparticularly European countries. We very well may be. The answer, \nhowever, might not be testing. The answer might be having a \ncomprehensive health care system for every child. It might be to have a \nprogram of daycare for every child, a very elaborate parental leave \nprogram for every family. Maybe if we did those things, our test scores \nwould look very good relative to France or Germany or Great Britain or \nother countries. So be very careful and wary of these comparisons \ninternationally.\n  We know that we can improve the quality of our education if we have \naccountability, and that requires some testing. But we also should know \nand recognize, as Senator Wellstone does, that accountability in \ntesting without real resources won't make the difference we want to \nachieve. That is not unique to Senator Wellstone.\n  A recent Aspen Institute report noted:\n\n       In the effort to raise the achievement of all American \n     students, an extremely serious barrier is the huge \n     disparities in resources for education across districts and \n     states. It is not unusual for per student expenditures to be \n     three times greater in affluent districts than in poorer \n     districts of the same state.\n\n  That accounts for many of the reasons why some students succeed and \nothers fail. The real test, in fact the essence of democracy in \nAmerica, is not what we say but where we send our children to school. \nMany parents recognize that when they purchase homes in areas that have \ngood public schools versus those areas that are not funded as robustly.\n  Now, in addition, the Center for Education Policy concludes, in a \nrecent report, that policymakers ``should be wary of proposals that \nembrace the rhetoric of closing the gap but do not help build the \ncapacity to accomplish that goal.''\n  Testing is just one aspect of that capacity building. We have to have \ngood professional development, good parental involvement, and resources \nso that the school building itself is a place that children will want \nto go to and not try to shun and leave as quickly as they can.\n  The Wellstone amendment is very straightforward. It simply states \nthat the new tests authorized under title I need not be implemented \nunless title I appropriations have reached $24.72 billion by 2005. That \nwas the amount authorized by the Dodd-Collins amendment for the year \nthe tests are scheduled to go into effect, also 2005.\n  This amendment has widespread support: The American Association of \nSchool Administrators, the Council of Great City Schools, the Hispanic \nEducation Coalition, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education \nFund, the NAACP, the National Association of Black School Educators, \nthe National Council of La Raza, the National Education Association, \nthe National PTA, and the National School Boards Association--all of \nthese groups representing those individuals closest to the issue of \neducation. The school boards, the PTAs, they recognize the logic and \nthe wisdom of the Wellstone amendment.\n  I hope we can recognize that logic, that we can support this \namendment. And, frankly, if our intentions are good, and I believe they \nare, this amendment will be merely hortatory. If our intentions are \ngood, we will appropriate the money. We will reach those targets. \nTesting will go into effect. But if it is the intention or the mishap \nthat we vote for testing but we don't vote for resources to title I, \nthen rather than ruing that day, we should vote for this amendment and \nprovide a real check.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the amendment. I yield back my \ntime to Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, let me say a few words about this \namendment. Then I will speak on the bill in general.\n  Just reading the Wellstone amendment helps to clarify the argument \nand the signal this amendment sends. It says:\n\n       No State shall be required to conduct any assessments under \n     this subparagraph in any school year if, by July 1, 2005, the \n     amount appropriated to carry out this part for fiscal year \n     2005 does not equal or exceed $24,720,000,000.\n\n  That is, let's fully fund--however we define ``fully fund''--title I \nbefore we require this accountability and these assessments. The signal \nof this amendment, the not-too-subtle message is that the problem in \nour educational system in this country is there is not enough money. \nThat is the less-than-subtle message the Senator from Minnesota would \nsend out to school districts across this Nation: We are not going to \nhave accountability; we are not going to require testing; we are not \ngoing to have assessments under this title until we triple the funding.\n  If money were the issue, if simply spending more money would solve \nour education problems in this country, we would have no education bill \nbefore us.\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\n  If one looks at the last decade, particularly in terms of the Federal \nGovernment's involvement, it has been about a 180-percent increase over \nthe previous decade. Nationally, we have increased spending on \neducation by about 30 percent, if one looks at every source of spending \non education.\n  There have been dramatic increases in education spending, but there \nhas been no--I repeat--there has been no correlation to increased test \nscores and increased student achievement.\n  While I do not doubt the sincerity of the Senator from Minnesota, I \nquestion the logic and the message this amendment sends forth.\n  In the 1994 ESEA reauthorization, Congress required assessments in \nthree grades. Those provisions were in effect no matter how much or how \nlittle Federal funding was provided. The fact is, we did not pay for \nthe testing that we at that time required. In the bill before us, I \nbelieve we are more than increasing spending sufficient to meet the new \nmandates that are being placed upon the States.\n  The Senator from Minnesota says we are setting schools up for \nfailure. I suggest that what we are really doing is freeing schools and \nfreeing States to make the kind of reforms to focus resources where \nreal academic achievement can be realized.\n  I have talked to education officials in the State of Arkansas. I have \ntalked to education officials in our State department, and they support \nthe President's education initiative. They support the provisions \nregarding testing. It does not scare them. They realize this is the way \nwe measure; this is the way we assess; this is the best means we have \nto really demonstrate that education is working, that children are \nlearning, and that the investments being made in Federal, State, and \nlocal resources are good investments.\n  This amendment strikes at the very heart of the President's plan. We \ncurrently provide almost $9 billion for title I, and since title I has \nbeen around, we have seen no correlating rise in test scores among \nstudents being served. Why then would it be suggested we should require \nthat we eliminate the most important accountability provisions of the \nbill and not put those accountability provisions in effect until we \ntriple title I funding?\n  Total national spending on elementary and secondary education has \nincreased 129 percent over the last decade, but Federal spending has \nincreased by over 180 percent over the last decade. Since Republicans \ngained control of the House and Senate in 1995, Federal spending on \nelementary and secondary education has increased from $14.7 billion in \n1996 to $27.8 billion in 2002. That is an almost doubling of the \nFederal funds for elementary and secondary education.\n  I suggest we should not try to portray one party or another party as \nbeing committed to education but look at the facts, look at the \ncommitment that has been demonstrated in resources. But increasing \nfunding is simply not the answer in and of itself. There are a lot of \nstatistics that can demonstrate that. Let me share a few of them.\n  These statistics came from the most recent 1998 National Assessment \nof Educational Progress, the NAEP test, demonstrating that with the \n$120 billion that has been invested, poor kids still lag behind those \nof more affluent backgrounds in reading. In 4th grade, 8th grade, 12th \ngrade, the areas in which we require testing, we can see that gap is as \nreal and as evident as it ever was.\n  The whole reason the Federal Government involved itself in local \neducation was justified by our commitment to narrowing the gap between \naffluent homes, advantaged children, and those from less affluent homes \nand disadvantaged backgrounds. The experiment has been a monumental \nfailure. We have invested billions of dollars, and yet we have not \nnarrowed that gap. It is not time to reduce the resources but to ensure \nwith those resources there are genuine and real reforms that accompany \nthe resources.\n  This is a graph demonstrating ESEA funding versus the NAEP reading \nscores. A chart such as this clearly demonstrates there is a lack of \ncorrelation between increased spending and automatic improvement in \nreading scores or academic achievement. The appropriation for ESEA \nprograms is in the billions of dollars. The red line demonstrates how \ndramatically those increases have occurred. The green line demonstrates \nthe national fourth grade reading scores, which have effectively, since \n1991, been level. There has been increased spending without a \ncomparable increase--in fact, any demonstrable increase--in reading \nscores nationally.\n  If we look at math, we find exactly the same story. These are ESEA \nfunding versus NAEP math scores. There is a flat line on math \nachievement and a dramatic increase in appropriations for ESEA. We \nsimply cannot find the evidence which shows that with increased \nspending, given the resources, the results are going to be there.\n  This bill dramatically increases spending, but to its credit and to \nthe President's credit for taking the lead on this issue, it says \nincreased resources must be accompanied by real reforms, real \nassessments, real accountability. That is what this legislation does.\n  The United States spends more per student than most other advanced \nnations in the world. This chart clearly demonstrates, even if we look \nat advanced nations in Europe--Denmark, Switzerland, France--and \nAustralia, we are expending more money, sometimes dramatically more \nmoney, than other developed nations.\n  If spending were the answer, if the more we spent per student the \nbetter the test scores were going to be, the greater the academic \nachievement, hence, the greater opportunity those children would have \nin the future, then we should be leading the world in academic \nachievement. After all, we are spending more per student than any other \nadvanced nation in the world.\n  What are the academic results internationally? A 1999 chemistry \nknowledge achievement on the TIMSS eighth grade test shows we are \nlagging way behind Hungary, Finland, Japan, Bulgaria, Slovak Republic, \nSouth Korea, Russian Federation, Australia--we are way down in our \nachievement in the area of chemistry. We are spending more, but we are \nnot producing more.\n  This chart shows the 1999 algebra knowledge achievement test in the \narea of math in the eighth grade. Once again, we are near the bottom of \nthe industrialized nations of the world. South Korea cannot compare \nwith how much we are spending per student in this country, and yet they \ndramatically outperform American students. There simply is not the \ncorrelation between spending and academic achievement that many would \nlike to draw.\n  This next chart is 1999 geometry knowledge achievement in the eighth \ngrade. Once again, looking at the industrialized nations around the \nworld from Japan to Australia, they far outperform American eighth \ngrade students in math and in science.\n  Does it mean we should spend less? No. It means we should spend more \nwisely. It means we must accompany increased spending with real reform, \nwith accountability, with assessment, with local control and \nflexibility. Truly one size does not fit all.\n  There is one message the Arkansas Department of Education sent to my \noffice: Do not handcuff us; do not continue down the road of \nprescriptive national formulas on what we must do. Give us the \nflexibility to make local reforms and, hence, improve student \nachievement.\n  The evidence is clear that this amendment, well intended as it may \nbe, is greatly misguided. We have a bill before us that, if we were to \nenact it without undermining its very underpinnings and pulling its \nvery heart out, could move us in a dramatically new and better \ndirection on education.\n  It provides important provisions on greater parental choice, not as \nmuch as many would like but greater parental choice. The charter States \nand the straight A provisions, although much watered down, still \nprovide a new and bold opportunity for a few States to experiment with \nreal reform, unhindered by Federal prescriptive programs.\n  New standards; the requirement of testing grades 3-8; participation \nin the NAEP; testing 4 and 8; ensuring that not only are the States \ntesting but the tests they are utilizing are meaningful and are giving \nan accurate depiction of what schools are succeeding and what schools \nare failing; what States have reforms that are working and what States \nare not doing the job.\n\n[[Page S5941]]\n\n  On improvement in teacher quality, I applaud and commend the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire for his lead on improving \nteacher quality and ensuring that money is wisely invested in \nprofessional development, not giving a one-size-fits-all but providing \na flexible funding stream to meet the particular teacher quality needs \nthat school districts have across this country.\n  Finally, with those reforms, with increased parental flexibility, \nlocal school flexibility, with attention on individual children, with \nthe requirements on testing, with the consolidation of the plethora of \nFederal programs, with all of those reforms, there is the increase in \nspending. That should be the proper Federal role.\n  We have a great opportunity before the Senate. We have been on the \nbill for weeks and weeks. We have debated scores of amendments. The \ngenuine and real thrust of the President's education program has thus \nfar been kept intact. The challenge before the Senate this week and \nnext will be to beat back those amendments that turn back to the failed \npractices of the past, turn back to the misguided notion that more \nmoney means better education. That is our challenge, to keep that part \nof this bill alive, to honor the pledge the President of the United \nStates made to the American people to take us in a new and dramatically \nbetter direction on education. I am still hopeful and optimistic, but \namendments such as this threaten a return to the failed status quo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes from the \nopposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I also ask unanimous consent the Senator from Michigan \nbe allowed to speak for 5 minutes, followed by the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I indicated my opposition to the Wellstone amendment, \nbut I take a moment to correct the record of my good friend from \nArkansas.\n  We spend $400 billion a year in K-12; and $8 billion on title I. The \nfact that some students have not made progress is not the fault of the \nTitle I program. Instead, it is a reflection of the fact that States \nhave not provided the leadership in terms of assistance and resources. \nThat is where accountability comes in.\n  No one is saying money is the answer to everything, but it is a clear \nindication of a nation's priorities. Although we have a difference in \nterms of this particular legislation, I stand shoulder to shoulder with \nthe Senator from Minnesota and others who say we ought to work for the \nfull funding because we are only reaching a third of the students.\n  I remind my friend from Arkansas what happened in Texas. Look what \nhas happened in school funding from 1994 to 2001. Texas has increased \ntheir funding for education statewide by 57 percent. Look at the \nstudent achievement. Student achievement has increased by 27 percent. \nResources have been expended in developing standards and assessments, \nacademies that assist low-achieving students, professional development, \nand smaller class sizes. That is how the resources have been spent. \nThey have been getting results.\n  I agree what we want to do is, with scarce resources, give the tried \nand true policies which have demonstrated effectiveness in the past and \nmake them available to local communities so they make decisions and \nhold them accountable within that community. That is what this \nlegislation will do.\n  The testing is also a part of this process. I agree it should be. I \nam not prepared to put it at risk because we don't reach the actual \ndollar figure included in the Senator's amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a unanimous consent, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Briefly, Mr. President, I will respond to my friend \nfrom Arkansas and his charts, comparing our country to other countries.\n  One of my concerns in comparing countries is that we in the United \nStates do not stress that we have very different values regarding \nuniversal free education for all children, kindergarten through the \n12th grade. We take all. Whatever child walks in the door, whether that \nchild has had breakfast, whether they have had a good night's sleep, \nwhether they even had a bed or home in which to sleep the night before. \nWe take all children. I believe that is a strength of the United States \nof America.\n  I have had the opportunity to travel around the world and speak with \nthose involved in education in other systems and know if we were to \nmake certain adjustments and only let children over the eighth grade \nwho have met a certain level proceed, or do as done in other countries, \nthat would have a different effect from what we do in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Certainly. I ask it come from the opposition time.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Would the Senator from Michigan concede that although \nthere are differences between European nations and the students they \neducate in the upper grades, the statistics I showed giving \ninternational comparisons in the eighth grade in both Europe and the \nUnited States, all students are being educated, that it demonstrates we \nare achieving less on those international test scores than comparable \nstudent bodies in European nations?\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I may reclaim my time, I concur, from watching the \nstudy and what has been done, that we, while doing well at the fourth \ngrade level in the TIMSS international studies, by the eighth grade we \nare losing children. We need to be toughening curriculum and we need to \nfocus on accountability. Many times comparisons that are done are not \nfair and accurate given the value we have on public education.\n  Two further comments. First, saying resources should not be coupled \nwith accountability and don't make a difference is to ignore what has \nhappened today for our children in schools. It is not about the \ndollars. It is about lowering the class size. I have a friend in Grand \nRapids, MI, who teaches high-risk students and last year had over 30 \nstudents; this year, 15. Surprise, the children went from F's and D's \nto A's and B's. That is because there was more time for the teacher to \nteach and the children to learn. It is not about money; it is about \nchildren learning and teachers being able to teach smaller classes.\n  As an example, that same school has books that have situations that \ndon't exist anymore, countries that don't exist anymore, discussions \nabout NASA from years ago. They need to be updated.\n  I have one final point in support of the amendment of my colleague. I \nwas not here 25 years ago when IDEA passed, when special education was \nbrought forward. However, I do know as someone who has been in a State \nlegislature and has been an active parent with my two children growing \nup, special education, while setting very important requirements, had, \nalso, the promise that the Federal Government would pay 40 percent of \nthe costs to help the schools so they would not have to take dollars \naway from other programs, other children, in order to provide these \nimportant special education services.\n  What happened? The Federal Government has never hit 15 percent--never \nhit 15 percent--even though the promise was 40 percent. The reason I \nbelieve this amendment is important is we cannot do this again to the \nschools. The fact we are not keeping our promise on special education \ncosts my Michigan schools $420 million this year--$420 million that is \ntaken from the ability to lower class size, the ability to upgrade our \ntechnology and focus on math and science in our schools, to fund \ncritically important special education programs.\n  We should not do this again. This amendment will guarantee that, in \nfact, we will not just talk about requirements; we will make sure the \nresources are there so our children can truly succeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous consent \nagreement, the Senator from Washington is to be recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask how much time we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents of the amendment have almost\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\n23 minutes, the opponents of the amendment have just over 60 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Minnesota allow us, Mr. President, \nafter the Senator from Washington speaks, to set aside his amendment so \nthe Senator from Texas could offer her amendment? And then after \noffering her amendment we could go back to the Wellstone amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Could I ask how much time the Senator from Texas \nrequires?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to take about 7 minutes, \nand the Senator from New York would be speaking on the amendment as \nwell for about 5 minutes. Could we have, perhaps, 15 minutes? Because \nSenator Collins from Maine is going to try to come down. After 15 \nminutes, then we would go back to the Wellstone amendment, close that, \nand our amendment would be voted on afterwards.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my understanding is this would be after \nthe Senator from Washington speaks? That will be fine.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from \nWashington speaks, the Senator from Texas be recognized to offer her \namendment, that we set aside Senator Wellstone's amendment, that she \noffer her amendment and be on her amendment for up to 15 minutes. Then \nwe will return to Senator Wellstone's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Senator Wellstone brings us an amendment \ntoday that really gets to the very heart of this bill, helping our \nschools ensure that no child is left behind. Some seem to think the \nheart of this bill is testing, but I have to say as a parent and former \neducator I know testing alone will not ensure that one additional child \nlearns to read. Testing alone will not help our Nation's students learn \nto add and subtract. The heart of this bill must be a true effort by \nthe Federal Government to serve as a partner to our States and to our \nlocal communities, offering every child a high-quality education and \ntrue chance to succeed.\n  In 1965, when the Federal Government first recognized its special \nresponsibility to provide additional resources to help the most \ndisadvantaged students, we determined a level of support that was \nnecessary to ensure that every child would succeed. Since that time, we \nhave failed over and over again to really give them that support. That \nis what this Wellstone amendment is about: ensuring we finally meet our \ncommitment to those children.\n\n  Over the course of this debate, many of my colleagues have said that \ntitle I has failed to help our children over the past 35 years. They \ncite stagnant test scores as proof that additional investments in title \nI are a waste. Frankly, that is ridiculous. The reality is, after \nadjusting for inflation, title I spending has been almost flat. \nMeanwhile, the job of our public schools has gotten much more \ndemanding, serving not only more students overall, but more students \nwith challenges in limited English proficiency and disabilities.\n  But these glib statements about title I having failed our \ndisadvantaged students are perhaps most disingenuous and frustrating \nwhen one considers the chronic underfunding of title I. Let me talk \nabout that for a moment and illustrate the absurdity of this argument \nthat title I has failed.\n  Let's assume that Congress decides we must build a bridge from the \nHouse to the Senate side of the Capitol; after building a third of that \nbridge, we begin sending people over that bridge. Not surprisingly, no \none makes it to the other side. Some Senators come to the floor and \nexpress shock and dismay that no one has crossed the incomplete bridge. \nAfter years of this kind of folly, we finally declare on the floor of \nthe Senate that the bridge is clearly a failure and it has to be torn \ndown.\n  That is what we have done with title I. We have determined that a \nneed exists. We have developed a solution. We have failed to implement \nthat solution. And then we have declared that the solution is not a \ngood one.\n  The promise of title I has never truly been fulfilled, and because of \nthat, the promise for millions of children has also not been fulfilled. \nBut this is not a matter of getting people across the Capitol. This is \nabout our children's lives. This is about giving them a true chance to \nsucceed. Title I has not failed our most disadvantaged children; we \nhave failed them by not fully funding title I. Title I provides some of \nthe most targeted and flexible funding. This is the kind of funding we \nneed to offer if children are going to have any chance of passing these \ntests.\n  Last week, when I was home in my home State of Washington, I met with \n31 superintendents in one meeting, and then I talked with countless \nother parents who stopped me in the grocery store or on the street or \nanywhere else they found me to express their enormous concern about \nthis bill. They know we are sending them a huge unfunded testing \nmandate, but they are not sure whether we are sending them much else. \nFrankly, neither am I.\n  I know this bill does not provide smaller classes. It doesn't provide \nsupport for school renovation or even all the money they will need to \ndevelop and implement the tests we are requiring. I also know this bill \nimposes serious consequences based on the results of these new tests, \nbut this bill does not give our children or our teachers or our schools \nthe tools they need to help the kids pass these tests.\n  What is our goal in this bill? Is it to impose an enormous unfunded \ntesting mandate on our schools? Is it to declare our schools are in \nneed of improvement or to shut them down? Is it to set our children and \ntheir teachers up for failure or is it to ensure that no child is left \nbehind by, yes, measuring their progress but also providing the \nresources that will help them make that progress?\n\n  I have heard my colleagues claim over and over again that the testing \nin this bill is simply a measure and it will help us identify the \nneeds. Will anyone really be surprised if these new tests show that \nmany children in our most poor schools are not succeeding? When will \nthey have sufficient evidence that the problem exists and be willing to \nthen take the steps necessary to solve it? We keep hearing people say \nthis bill is about accountability. I have news for them. Most of our \nNation's teachers, principals, and educators have always felt \naccountable to the people they serve in their own communities.\n  What about our accountability? When will we be held accountable for \nfollowing through on our commitments? We have gotten away with not \nfollowing through on this one for 35 years. Isn't it time we held \nourselves accountable and stopped picking on the teachers and the \nparents and the students who are struggling every day with insufficient \nresources?\n  About a month ago, 78 of our colleagues came down to this floor and \nvoted to invest this amount of funds in our most disadvantaged \nchildren. Was our goal that day just another empty promise? I expect at \nleast some of those same 79 votes will be registered in favor of \nSenator Wellstone's amendment since it simply affirms the commitment we \nhave made to these children.\n  This vote is a test. Are we willing to put our money where our mouths \nare? Any Senator who voted for the Dodd amendment but votes against \nthis amendment will have some explaining to do--not to me, by the way, \nbut to the children they are deceiving with false promises of help \nbacked up with only another test, not a smaller class, a well-prepared \nteacher, or an afterschool program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Wellstone amendment and show the \nNation's most disadvantaged students that we are committed to offering \nmore than just words of encouragement. We are committed to offering \nthem the support they need to succeed.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I could take a moment, I thank the \nSenator from Washington. Her work as a State legislator, as a school \nboard member and teacher, her familiarity with children and what is \nhappening in schools, with kids, with teachers, and for the amendment, \ncomes through all the time.\n  I thank her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous consent agreement, the \nSenator from Texas is recognized for 15 minutes on her amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside\n\n[[Page S5943]]\n\nany pending amendment and to call up amendment No. 540.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 540 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 540.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for education reform programs that provide same \ngender schools and classrooms, if comparable educational opportunities \n                are offered for students of both sexes)\n\n       On page 684, strike liens 1 through 5, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(L) education reform programs that provide same gender \n     schools and classrooms, if comparable educational \n     opportunities are offered for students of both sexes;''.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 540, as modified\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment to \namendment No. 540, a modification to be substituted for the text of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 540), as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend the provisions relating to same gender schools and \n                              classrooms)\n\n       On page 684, strike lines 1 through 5, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(L) programs to provide same gender schools and \n     classrooms, consistent with applicable law;\n       On page 684, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       ``(c) Award Criteria and Other Guidelines.--Not later than \n     120 days after the date of enactment of the Better Education \n     for Students and Teachers Act, the Secretary shall issue \n     specific award criteria and other guidelines for local \n     educational agencies seeking funding for activities under \n     subsection (b)(1)(L).\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is an amendment that several of \nus have worked on for quite a while trying to come up with the right \nformula.\n  I thank Senator Kennedy, and I especially thank the cosponsors of my \namendment, Senator Collins, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Clinton, for \ntrying to come up with a solution to a problem that we have seen over \nmany years; that is, obstacles put in place against public schools \nbeing able to offer single-sex classrooms and single-sex schools.\n  We are trying to open more options to public school than are \navailable in private school because we want public schools to be able \nto tailor their programs to what best fits the needs of students in \nthat particular area.\n  Most of the time coeducational classes in schools are going to be the \nanswer. But sometimes in some circumstances we find that girls do \nbetter in a single-sex atmosphere and boys do better in a single-sex \natmosphere. We want parents who might not be able to afford private \nschool or might not have the option of parochial school to be able to \ngo to their school board and say: We would like to offer a single-sex \neighth grade math class for girls or we would like to offer a single-\nsex chemistry lab for boys or we might want a whole single-sex school, \nsuch as some that have had wonderful results.\n  I imagine my colleague, the Senator from New York, will mention this \nbecause one of the great success stories in single-sex public schools \nis the Young Women's Leadership Academy in East Harlem, NY, which just \nsaw its first high school graduation and schools such as Western High \nSchool in Baltimore that has been in place since the 1800s.\n  These are the kinds of schools that have weathered all the storms, \nfaced the lawsuits, and have gotten over it. We don't want those kinds \nof barriers.\n  If people want that kind of option, and parents come to the school \nboards wanting that option, that is easily obtain. Our amendment simply \nsays, under applicable law, schools can offer, under title VI, which is \nthe creativity title--the title that we hope will open more options for \npublic schools, single-sex schools and classrooms--we want to \nparticularly have the Department of Education, which is provided in \nthis amendment, to have 120 days to issue guidelines so the public \nschools that are interested in offering this kind of option will have \nclear guidelines on how they must structure the program to meet \napplicable law. That is simply what the amendment does. It has been \nagreed to by all of the entities that have been working on this issue.\n  I think this is very exciting. It is something I have worked on since \nSenator Danforth of Missouri left the Senate; he tried to get an \namendment passed when he was here that would have allowed single-sex \nschools and classrooms and made it easier to do that. But the \nDepartment of Education, frankly, has been the barrier. They have put \nthe roadblocks in front of the people who want to try to do this around \nthe country. Most people have been persuaded. Ones such as the East \nHarlem Young Women's Leadership Academy have prevailed, and they have \ndone very well.\n  However, we shouldn't have to overcome hurdles. We want public \nschools to meet all of the tests and all of the individual needs of \nstudents without having to go through a lot of redtape, a lot of \nbureaucracy, and many barriers. That is what this amendment will do.\n  I call on my colleague from New York, who has worked with me on this \namendment. I talked to her about my observations of the leadership \nschool in Harlem when we first put this amendment forward. She has been \na real leader in helping me work through the amendment and getting \neveryone to agree on what we could do to go forward. I appreciate that \nhelp. I yield to my colleague, the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague \nfrom Texas for her leadership on this and so many other issues. The \nremarks she made very well describe why I stand in support of this \namendment.\n  I believe public school choice should be expanded and as broadly as \npossible. Certainly, there should not be any obstacle to providing \nsingle-sex choice within the public school system. I thank the Senator \nfrom Texas for being a leader in promoting quality single-sex education \nand for working with me, as well as our colleagues from Maryland and \nMaine, and with the chairman of the Education Committee, to find a \ncompromise that would further the ability of our school districts \naround the country to develop and implement quality single-sex \neducational opportunities as a part of providing a diversity of public \nschool choices to students and parents but in doing it in a way that in \nno way undermines title IX or the equal protection clause of the \nConstitution.\n  We know, as the Senator from Texas has said, that single-sex schools \nand classes can help young people, boys and girls, improve their \nachievement.\n  In New York City, we have one of the premier public schools for girls \nin our Nation. In fact, yesterday the New York Times reported that the \nfirst class of girls graduating from the Young Women's Leadership \nAcademy in East Harlem in New York City--all 32 of the seniors--have \nbeen accepted by 4-year colleges, and all but one are going to attend \nwhile the other young woman has decided to pursue a career in the Air \nForce, which we know is also an opportunity for young women.\n  We have to look at the achievements of a school such as the one in \nNew York City that I mentioned, the Young Women's Leadership Academy, \nor other schools that are springing up around the country. We know this \nhas energized students and parents. We could use more schools such as \nthis.\n  With the negotiations we have engaged in over this amendment, there \nwas some disagreement that we had to work out about how to comply with \ntitle IX and with the Constitution because there has been confusion \naround our country in school districts about how they can develop \nsingle-sex educational opportunities without running afoul of the law \nor a constitutional prohibition.\n  This amendment clearly states that school districts should have the \nopportunity to spend Federal educational funds on promoting single-sex \nopportunities so long as they are consistent with applicable law. It \nalso makes\n\n[[Page S5944]]\n\nclear that the U.S. Department of Education should clarify to our \nschool districts what they can and cannot do. Their guidance should be \ndeveloped as soon as possible. The Senator from Texas and I will watch \nclosely to make sure this guidance is available to school districts.\n  Both title IX and the equal protection clause provide strong \nprotections so schools cannot fall back on harmful stereotypes. For \nexample, we have done away with the prohibition that used to keep girls \nout of shop classes. I can remember that--even out of prestigious \nacademic high schools because they were boys only. We have broken down \nthose barriers. We don't in any way want this amendment to start \nbuilding them up. We are trying to be very clear that we uphold title \nIX and the Constitution while we create more young women's leadership \nacademies that will make a real difference in the lives of young women \nand young men.\n  For example, we do not need another situation as we had with VMI, \nwhere young women were first prohibited from attending the school and \nthen were provided with an alternative that was not in any way the same \nas what was available to the boys.\n  The language offered here strikes the important balance between \nproviding flexibility to offer single-sex educational opportunities and \nproviding the legal safeguards pursuant to the VMI decision, and key \ntitle IX protections, to ensure that we do not turn back the clock.\n  What the Senator from Texas and I want to do is to provide more and \nmore opportunities for our young people to chart their own courses, to \nmake it clear that they are able to have their own futures in their \nhands by getting the best possible public school education.\n  So I am very grateful that we have come together today on behalf of \nthis important amendment which will send a clear signal that we want \npublic schools to provide choices. We want to eliminate sex-based \nstereotyping. We want to make it clear that every young girl can reach \nher fullest potential and should be able to choose from among options \nthat will make that possible; and the same for our young boys as well.\n  So I thank the Senator from Texas for not only putting forth this \namendment but for working so hard on making it really do what we intend \nit to do, so there will be the kind of opportunities for our children \nthat we in this Chamber favor and that we hope this bill will bring \nabout.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back the time.\n  There are approximately 5 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield up to 4 minutes to my \ncolleague and cosponsor of the amendment, Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, I commend the Senator from Texas \nfor her superior work on this issue. She and I have been working on it \nfor a very long time. I am delighted to see the bipartisan compromise \namendment reached today.\n  This action is long overdue and would correct a misinterpretation of \ntitle IX of the education amendments of 1972 that clearly was never \nintended.\n  Our amendment would ensure that local school districts can establish \nsingle-sex classrooms. I would like to share with my colleagues a \nwonderful example from Presque Isle High School in northern Maine of \nwhat can be accomplished with a single-sex classroom.\n  A gifted math teacher in Presque Isle by the name of Donna Lisnik \nbelieved that an all-girls advanced mathematics class would result in \nhigher levels of achievement by women. She was absolutely right. Donna \nestablished an all-girls math class, and the results were absolutely \noutstanding. Both the achievement of the girls, whether measured on SAT \nscores or by other tests, and the results, the number of girls \nparticipating in the class, soared. Everything was a plus.\n  I had the privilege of visiting Mrs. Lisnik's class. I saw firsthand \nthe enthusiasm the girls had for mathematics, how comfortable they \nfelt, and how they were accelerating.\n  However, unfortunately, in the previous administration, the \nDepartment of Education concluded that this very worthwhile and \neffective course did not correct historical inequities and, thus, \ndeemed it to be a violation of title IX requirements. As a result, \nPresque Isle had to open the course to both boys and girls. It was \nunfortunate that the school was prevented from pursuing a strategy that \nwas resulting in very high achievement levels for the girls attending \nthose classes.\n\n  Senator Hutchison's bipartisan compromise amendment will ensure that \nschools with innovative education programs, designed to meet gender-\nspecific needs, will not face needless obstacles.\n  This amendment is a great example of our working across party lines \nto do what is best for our children and for educational reform. It will \ngive schools the flexibility to design and the ability to offer single-\ngender classes when the school determines that these classrooms will \nprovide students with a better opportunity to achieve higher standards.\n  That is a goal we all share.\n  I see the Senator from Delaware is also seeking to speak on this \nissue, so I yield back to the Senator from Texas the remainder of my \ntime. Again, I commend her for her hard work on this issue. It has been \na pleasure to be her partner in this regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do want to say we would not have \ngotten to this point without Senator Collins' leadership and help. We \nadopted this amendment before. We are now back adopting it again \nbecause the bill that we passed before did not end up with a \nPresidential signature. So I thank her for being with us because of her \nexperiences in Maine and appreciate her support very much.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wellstone). The Senator has half a minute.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Delaware be \nyielded 1 minute, and then that I be recognized for 30 seconds to \nclose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas very much \nfor providing me the 1 minute. And I thank the Presiding Officer for \nsitting in for me so I might speak.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to \nthe amendment that is being offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. We in the Senate should be concerned foremost with what \nis going to work to raise student achievement. We want to provide the \nresources that will enable and foster and nurture that achievement. We \nalso want to make sure we take away barriers to that student \nachievement.\n  When I was sitting as the Presiding Officer during the debate, I \nrealized the nature of the amendment being offered, and I felt \ncompelled to applaud what we are endeavoring to do.\n  It reminds me that 10 years ago we faced a roadblock in my own State \nof Delaware because we were unable to do, on a small scale, what we \nseek to do with this amendment. I know it is not just our State but in \nthe 49 other States young men and young women will benefit if we are \nable to include this in the legislation that goes to the President, and \nthen if we follow up in the 50 States of America.\n  I applaud each of you for offering the amendment and thank you for \nthe opportunity to speak on its behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware, the \ndistinguished former Governor, who obviously has another example of how \nthese big barriers have hurt our ability to allow students to get the \nbest education for their particular needs.\n  So I just close by saying, now it is up to the Department of \nEducation. What we are saying in this Chamber today is: Drop the \nbarriers. Open the options for public schools. Give parents a chance to \nhave their child in public school have all the options that would fit \nthe needs of that particular child.\n  I again thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Collins who have been with\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n\nme on this amendment from the very beginning, and I thank our new \ncosponsors, Senator Clinton, Senator Carper, and Senator Kennedy, for \nworking with me to form this compromise.\n  The bottom line is that the Department of Education must step up to \nthe plate. I have discussed this with Secretary Rod Paige. He agrees. \nHe has committed to me that he will open the spigot, open the \nfloodgates, to allow this to be one of the options that will be \navailable to the parents of public schoolchildren in this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If it is agreeable to the Senator from Minnesota, we \ncould dispose of the amendment on a voice vote now. Would that be \nagreeable to the Senator?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That would be fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n540, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 540), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself just 3 minutes on the \namendment of the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to join in thanking the Senator \nfrom Texas. This issue is one of enormous importance. We have heard \nvery eloquent comments and statements about the opportunities that this \ntype of amendment can provide for young Americans.\n  We want to take advantage of those opportunities. As one who has been \nhere for some time, I have often seen where there appear to be \nopportunities, and where there has also been discrimination against \nindividuals. That has been true in a variety of different \ncircumstances. None of us wants to see this. We know that that is not \nthe intention of any of us who is supporting this particular program.\n  The Senator was enormously helpful and positive and constructive, as \nwas the Senator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, Senator Collins, Senator \nMikulski, and others, in making sure that we were, to the extent \npossible, not going to see a reenforcement or a return to old \nstereotyping which has taken place at an unfortunate period in terms of \nAmerican education. They have done that, the Senator has done that with \nthe amendment. That has been enormously important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment under consideration be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I did not realize that the Senator from \nMinnesota wanted to continue at this moment. I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Does the Senator have an amendment she is trying to \ndispose of?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I am trying to propose the amendment, but I will lay it \naside, and I am not asking for a vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 466\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I think we should probably go ahead and finish up on \nthe other amendment. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes and 57 minutes 30 seconds for \nthe other side.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I ask the other side how much time they intend to \nuse?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator wanted to yield the time \nback, I would urge my colleague from New Hampshire to yield his time \nback.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have a little time to summarize. If you all are \ngoing to use a few minutes, then at the end I will go ahead and finish. \nIf you have a lot to say, I want to respond to your comments. All \nright.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues who have come to the \nChamber and spoken on the amendment; quite a few Senators have. I thank \neach and every one of them for some very powerful words. I almost \nforget everybody, but Senator Dodd, Senator Murray, Senator Reed, \nSenator Corzine, Senator Stabenow, I thank all of them.\n  This amendment says that the tests that are authorized under title I \nneed not be implemented until after we live up to our goal of \nappropriating the $24 billion for title I. This is the amount the Dodd \namendment called for in authorization. I am not saying that Minnesota \nor any other State can't go forward. They can do whatever they want. \nWhat I am saying is, States have a right to say to us, if you don't \nlive up to your word to get us the resources to go with the testing, \nthen we decide whether we want to do this. The testing that is being \ndone post-1994 goes on. I am talking about the testing in this bill.\n  This amendment has endorsements from, among others, the Hispanic \nEducation Coalition, Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, \nNAACP, National Council of La Raza, National Education Association, \nNational Parent Teacher Association, National School Board Association. \nIn addition, we have a letter from Democratic Governors basically \nsaying, while we support the Carnahan/Nelson amendment, we are hopeful \nthat any final version to reauthorize ESEA will apply a funding trigger \nmore broadly, specifically to include title I, the argument being that \nthe Government needs to strengthen its accountability with adequate new \ninvestment.\n  Colleagues, there is a reason that all these organizations that \nrepresent the education community on the ground--I didn't include the \nNational Education Association as well--support this amendment, because \nwhat they are saying is: Don't set us up for failure. If you are going \nto mandate that every child in every grade will be tested every year, \ngrades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, then how about a Federal mandate that we \nwill have equality of opportunity for every child to be able to succeed \nand do well on these tests? To not do so is ethically unjust.\n  This bill, right now, without the resources, without this amendment \npassing, will test the poor against the rich and announce that the poor \nfailed. Federally required tests without federally required resources \nfor the children amounts to clubbing children over the head after we \nhave systematically cheated them. We already know in advance which \nchildren are going to fail. This is a plan, without this amendment \npassing, not for reform, not for equality, but for humiliation of \nchildren.\n  How in the world can we continue to have the schools? They don't have \nthe resources. They have the large classes. All too often, it is two or \nthree or four teachers in a given year, much less the children living \nin homes where they move two or three times a year. They come to \nkindergarten way behind, not kindergarten ready. Quite often, they \ndon't have qualified teachers. They don't have the technology. They \ndon't have the resources. Then, in the absence of making the commitment \nto making sure these children have a chance to do well, the only thing \nwe are going to do is require testing and fail them again.\n\n  This amendment is just saying, if we are going to have the testing, \nwe are going to provide the resources.\n  My friend Jonathan Kozol, who I think is the most powerful writer \nabout children in education today, says that testing is a symbolic \nsubstitute for educating. Don't substitute a symbol for the real thing. \nKids who are cheated of Head Start--we fund 3 percent of the children \nwho could benefit from Early Head Start, barely 50 percent of the \nchildren who are 4-year-olds. Children who are cheated of small \nclasses, cheated of well-paid teachers learn absolutely nothing from a \ntest every year except how much this Nation wants to embarrass and \npunish them. That is what is wrong with having the testing without the \nresources.\n  I hope the testing advocates do not assume that teachers are afraid \nto be held accountable. Frankly, that is libel against teachers. No \ngood teacher is afraid to be held accountable for what she or he does. \nI wish I had the time. I have e-mails from teachers all across the \ncountry about this.\n\n[[Page S5946]]\n\n  Accountability is a two-way street. What we have here is one-way \naccountability. We want to have the tests every year, but we don't want \nto be accountable to the words we have spoken. Seventy-nine Senators \nwent on record to vote for authorizing full funding for title I, for \ndisadvantaged children, in 10 years.\n  I see my colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, presiding. He would \nsay: Why 10 years? He is right. A 7-year-old will be 17 then. That is \ntoo late. You only have your childhood once. Nevertheless, we went on \nrecord, and that means that by 2005, we made a commitment of $25 \nbillion for title I, which right now is funded at a 30-percent level.\n  So Senator Dayton, in St. Paul, when you get to a school with fewer \nthan 65 percent low-income children, they don't receive any funding--we \nhave run out already--money that could be used, especially with the \nlittle children, for additional reading help, after school, \nprekindergarten. What this amendment is saying is that 79 Senators \nvoted for that authorization. If that is what you did, and it was a \ngood vote for the Dodd-Collins amendment--Senator Dodd was here \nspeaking --then let's live up to our words.\n  Let's say that unless that money is appropriated--and I can see \nSenators running ads: I voted to authorize full funding for the title I \nprogram for the children in my State--knowing that the authorization \nhas nothing to do with whether there is money.\n  This amendment makes the words real. Let's not fool around with \npeople. Let's live up to our commitment, and let's make it clear; yes \nto accountability, but we also are going to follow through when it \ncomes to living up to our commitment of resources.\n  I have heard Senators say if we talk the talk but we do not walk the \nwalk, we are going to fail our children. That is exactly what is wrong \nwith this bill that calls for the testing without the resources. \nTesting and publishing test scores is talking, only talking.\n  Giving title I, supporting what we should be doing--fully funding \nHead Start, making sure every child comes to kindergarten ready to \nlearn, getting the best teachers in the schools, providing additional \nhelp for reading--that is walking. That is what this amendment is. This \nis a walking amendment.\n  I say to Senators: It is time to walk. It is time to start walking. \nIt is time to start walking your talk. It is time to start living up to \nwhat you said when you voted for the full funding for title I.\n  Let's be accountable. I have heard the majority of Senators say they \nwere going to fight for the resources to go with the testing. Now is \nthe time to do so.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have listened to the Senator make a \nvery impassioned plea for funding the program, and I am all in \nagreement with it. I feel, however, as if we are describing two \ndifferent bills.\n  The pending Senate bill already includes accountability. The bill \nalready includes testing. And, at the present time, under current law \nthere are already 15 States that are testing students every year, in \ngrades 3 through 8, in math and reading. There are 46 States that are \ntesting their students annually in at least two grades. States are \ncomplying today with the 1994 law, and are being held accountable for \ntheir progress, under provisions that describe adequate yearly progress \nin Title I. This is nothing new.\n  The amount that those 15 States are spending on their statewide tests \nis low. Many States are not investing the resources that they really \nneed to ensure high-quality assessments. According to the Education \nCommission of the States, those 15 States only spend between $1.37 and \n$17.16 per student annually on their assessments.\n  Under our legislation, the Jeffords amendment would ensure $69--do we \nhear that?--$69 per student for States to develop their annual \nassessments by the 2005-2006 school year, in reading and math for \nstudents grades 3-8. According to the National Association of State \nBoards of Education, it takes between $25 and $125 per student to \ndevelop such assessments. $69 should be sufficient. Not $1, as exists \nnow, not $5, but $69.\n  The Wellstone amendment essentially eliminates requirements to \ndevelop those assessments, and eliminates the promise that those high-\nquality assessments may hold to produce the data that can drive school \nreform. We are cutting off our nose to spite our face. Senator \nWellstone is thinking that, sometime in the future, we will eventually \nbegin this process of assessment. In reality, assessments are in place \nnow.\n\n  To say if we do not get full funding, if we miss it by $500 million, \nwhat happens? We are not going to provide any of the accountability. If \nwe miss it by $300 million, we are not going to get it. With all \nrespect to my colleague from Connecticut, their amendment for full \nfunding was for 10 years. This amendment calls for full funding in 4 \nyears. I am all for full funding in 4 years, if Senator wants to offer \nan amendment that does not compromise essential reforms in the \nunderlying bill.\n  I have spoken with the President about this very subject. We ought to \nincrease funding for Title I, and double our present commitment to \ncover two-thirds of the children, and the other third during his \nadministration. I have said it publicly, and I said it to the President \nwithin the last 3 days.\n  I am going to continue to fight this fight, because I believe in the \nTitle I program. However, to say that at the end of the day we are not \ngoing to be able to implement high quality tests that help us in the \nreform process I do not understand. I just do not understand it because \ntests are nothing new, we are currently assessing student progress for \naccountability today, and more and more States are implementing a plan \nsimilar to that which is in this underlying bill. Many States are not \nimplementing tests that are of high-quality. They are not doing very \nwell. We have seek in this bill to address that point.\n  We are not talking about the future. We have addressed the issue of \nquality in the assessment process with the amendments that we have \ntaken. We want to improve upon States' current practice. We have tried \nto accomplish that with the amendments to date, but that goal will not \nbe met by the pending amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me try to clear up the confusion of my good friend \nfrom Massachusetts. First, part of what we talked about is whether or \nnot there should be full funding for the testing. I support the \nCarnahan amendment. It was not adopted. I think it should have been \nadopted.\n  The Senator talked about the Dodd amendment full funding in 10 years. \nThis amendment does not call for full funding by 2005. This amendment \ntracks the Dodd amendment. This amendment is a 100-percent reflection \nof what we have already gone on record supporting. I do not call for \nfull funding; $25 billion in 2005 is not full funding. This is exactly \nwhat the Dodd amendment calls for as we reach full funding in 10 years.\n  As to the testing, it is true we are already testing. As a matter of \nfact, this amendment does not talk about that testing. This amendment \ntalks about the fact that this bill, called the BEST bill, I say to my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, does not say title I children are tested. \nIt says every child in every school district in every State is tested \nevery year. That is quite a different piece of legislation in its \nscope. Finally, one more time, the National Council of LaRaza, National \nEducation Association, National Parent Teacher Association, National \nSchool Board Association, Democratic Governors--why in the world do you \nthink they support this? Because they have had enough of it. They have \nhad enough of us constantly putting more requirements on them without \nbacking it up with resources.\n  They are a little bit suspicious of the Congress. They think we are \ngreat when it comes to telling them to do this, this, and this, but \nthey do not think we fully fund what we ask them to do, and they are \nright.\n  That is why they support this, and they are right. They are saying if \nyou are going to have a national mandate that every child is tested, \nthen let's have a national mandate to make sure\n\n[[Page S5947]]\n\nevery child has an opportunity to do well on those tests and make sure \nyou live up to your commitment on the title I programs, which is one of \nthe major Federal commitments--it is not a large part of education \nmoney spent, but it is a real important piece when it comes to what our \ncommitment is.\n  This commitment just asks every Senator to walk the talk. You already \nwent on record saying you are for this. Now let's get real. This \namendment just says walk your talk.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  On page 43 under ``Assessments,'' this bill spells out the tests \nwhich I mentioned earlier are statewide. There are currently 15 States \nthat are testing reading and math annually in grades 3 through 8.\n  Accountability in current law is based, at least partly, on these \ntests that are currently being administered. Not all, but many of these \ntests are not of the highest quality. They are not aligned with \nstandards. They are not valid and reliable measures. I want to make \nthem better. We have in place in this legislation, with the amendments \nthat have been accepted--the Jeffords amendment, the Wellstone \namendments, the Collins amendment.\n  The best estimate has been provided by the National Association of \nState Boards of Education. They estimate that the cost of developing \nhigh quality State tests, aligned to standards, in grades 3-8 ranges \nfrom $25 to $125 per student. Our bill provides $69 per student. If \nStates do not receive the funds provided by the Jeffords amendment \nunder this bill for testing, they may suspend the development or \nimplementation of their tests.\n  The fact is, S. 1, when the President signs it, will contain \naccountability provisions that will be driven by, as it says on page \n43, existing tests under requirements that mirror current law. Many of \nthose tests are not of high quality. Some States are doing better than \nothers. I can understand why the President and our committee both want \nto do better. To eliminate the possibility to do better, by warding off \nassessments, does not make any sense to me.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if the Senate lives up to its word and \nwe do exactly what we say we are going to do in the appropriations, \nwhich is to provide the money for title I which provides the money for \nthe extra help for reading and afterschool and prekindergarten, nobody \nloses.\n  I am calling everybody on their bluff on the words they have spoken. \nI have not seen any firm commitment about money. I have not seen the \nadministration come forward with any commitment of resources to expand \ntitle I to make sure we do our very best for these kids. I don't think \nthis program called BEST, is the best, unless we live up to our \ncommitment.\n  This should be easy for Senators to vote for. It just means that in \nour appropriations we do exactly what we promised to do. How can anyone \nvote against what was already voted for? How can Members vote against \nan appropriation that is exactly the same thing Members voted for as an \nauthorization? What is wrong with saying, don't ask for me to vote for \ntesting every child throughout America in every school, which is what \nSenator Dodd said? Start as young as age 8, unless you are also going \nto give me a chance. Don't ask us to vote for a mandate of testing \nevery child without also letting us have an opportunity to pass \nlegislation which will assure we get the resources to the schools and \nthe teachers and kids so they can do well in these tests.\n  I don't believe that is an outrageous assumption. I stand for that. I \nhope we get this through.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I associate myself with the comments of the Senator from \nMassachusetts. There has been a significant amount of debate so I will \nnot carry it on. I reinforce the fact that the President has suggested \nwe extend the testing passed in 1994 to three additional grades. The \ntesting in 1994 required the curriculum be aligned and that the tests \nbe fairly pervasive. At the same time, when those tests were put in \nplace, there was no funding at all to support them.\n  This President has suggested that is not correct. He has put in place \n$3 billion of new funding for the purposes of underwriting the costs of \nthese tests. In addition, he has suggested the most significant \nincrease of title I funding for the actual problematic side than any \nPresident in the history of this country. He has suggested increases \nthat represent more than 50 percent of an increase in title I funding. \nSo the commitment is significant in the area of dollars.\n  Senator Kennedy hit the nail on the head. If this amendment passes, \nessentially we are stepping backward on the issue of assessment. And we \nare stepping backward, therefore, on the issue of finding out whether \nor not low-income kids are getting fair treatment in our school \nsystems. That is what this is about.\n  Will we have in place a procedure for determining whether or not our \nlow-income children are getting fair treatment? The only way to do that \nis through a testing regime in the form outlined in this bill. If we \nabandon that testing regime, for all intents and purposes, we are going \nback to the present status quo which has produced 35 years of failure. \nWe know it is not working. It is time to make the changes proposed in \nthis bill. Regrettably, the Wellstone amendment takes us backward, \nrather than forward, in that effort.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time on our side.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I rise today to focus the attention of \nmy colleagues and our country on the environmental health and energy \nefficiency of our Nation's schools.\n  Throughout this debate, we have come to the floor to propose \nsolutions for improving student achievement and ensuring that all of \nour children are provided with a world-class education. I am very \npleased that we have made a lot of progress in coming to consensus on \nsome basic tenets--that all children should be guaranteed an education \nfocused around high academic standards, that every child should be \ntaught by a quality teacher, and that we should hold educators \naccountable for making sure their students can meet these high \nstandards.\n  There is something we have not yet addressed; that is, to ensure that \nour children attend schools that are in good working condition and that \nare conducive to their learning and not detrimental to their health. I \nwas disappointed that we were not successful in our efforts to provide \nneeded Federal support for repairs and renovations to modernize our \nschools, and we have done a disservice to many of our children.\n  In the State of New York, for example, we have children who attend \nschools that are in deplorable condition. Approximately 67 percent of \nall the schools in New York have at least one inadequate building \nfeature. That can mean a leaky roof or poor plumbing or electrical \nshortages, windows that are broken, heating, ventilating, air-\nconditioning systems that just don't work. What I hope we can do is to \ntake a hard look at what the effects of these building conditions are \non our children. We have children in New York attending classes in \nschool buildings that average 50 years of age. In upstate New York the \naverage is 38. These are the problems that are brought to my attention \nevery single day--leaking roofs and bad filtration conditions that are \nbeginning to demonstrate health problems in the schools.\n  In central New York, the Council for Occupational Health and Safety \nbegan receiving complaints from teachers and students about a \nparticular school. When the director inspected the building, he \ndiscovered that the air filtration system was filled with hundreds of \ncolonies of fungus and that another part of the system was filled with \nstagnant water. At another school in Cohoes, NY, near Albany, the \nventilation problem in the city's middle school was so bad that the \nschool administration banned the use of chalk because the dust hung in \nthe air, making it difficult for students and teachers to breathe.\n  I recently received an e-mail from a father in Schenectady, NY. He \nwrote me the following:\n\n       My children attend school in the city of Schenectady. At \n     the 90-year-old elementary school they attend, peeling lead-\n     based paint, a malfunctioning heat system resulting in 80-90 \n     degree classroom temperatures, and general disrepair have \n     been the norm for years. There have been persistent roof \n     leaks, resulting in molds growing in the building. \n     Maintenance of playgrounds to conform to\n\n[[Page S5950]]\n\n     safety standards has been neglected. Many of these problems \n     continue to exist today. I believe that the primary cause of \n     this is the highly constrained financial resources that are \n     available in aging, low- to moderate-income urban \n     communities.\n\n  This morning, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported that \ntomorrow in Pittsford, NY, there will be a 3-hour public forum on the \nimpact that environmental hazards in school buildings have on teachers \nand students. This forum in Pittsford is part of a series of EPA \ninformational sessions on environmental problems in our schools. These \nstories from New York reflect a serious problem across our country.\n  A 1996 GAO study found that 15,000 schools in the United States have \nindoor pollution or ventilation problems affecting over 11 million \nchildren. Furthermore, as many as 25 million students nationwide are \nattending schools with at least one unsatisfactory environmental \ncondition.\n  This is something I don't think we can afford to ignore because \nindoor air can have an even greater effect on children than the air \nthey breathe outside. The EPA warns that Americans spend 90 percent of \nour time indoors. With children spending much of their day inside \nschools, that pollution can add up, and it can be a greater stress on \nthem than anything they encounter outside. We know that poor indoor air \nquality severely impacts children's health.\n  According to the American Lung Association, asthma accounts for 10 \nmillion lost schooldays annually and is the leading cause of school \nabsenteeism attributed to a chronic condition. Furthermore, a survey \nconducted by New York City Health Schools Working Group found that 40 \npercent of schoolchildren who had a preexisting condition, such as \nasthma, worsened from their being in school.\n  In addition to facing poor air quality, we also know that our \nchildren are exposed to chemicals, lead paint, and other hazardous \nsubstances. In fact, the GAO found in their 1996 study that two-thirds \nof schools were not in compliance with requirements to remove or \ncorrect hazardous substances, including asbestos, lead, underground \nstorage tanks, and radon. And experts believe that exposure during \nchildhood, when children are developing, may have severe long-term \neffects.\n  In Monroe County, NY, a group called Rochesterians Against the Misuse \nof Pesticides have been doing surveys of indoor and outdoor pesticide \nuse by schools since 1987. That latest survey in 1999 showed that \nschools in Rochester were using 72 different pesticides. That is, as \none member of the group said, a real chemical soup to which our \nchildren are being subjected.\n  What I am hoping is that we can build on the work that has been done \nin some places, such as Rochester, and the Healthy Schools Network in \nAlbany, NY, and try to find out more about what happens to our \nchildren's health inside our schools.\n  The American Public Health Association recently passed a resolution \ncalling for further research on the extent and impact of children's \nenvironmental health and safety risks and exposures at schools and \nprevention measures, including research sponsored by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education.\n  My amendment would authorize $2 million for a study conducted by the \nDepartment of Education in conjunction with the Centers for Disease \nControl and the Environmental Protection Agency to evaluate the health \nand learning impacts of sick and dilapidated public school buildings on \nthe children who attend those schools.\n  This study would specifically call for researchers to determine the \ncharacteristics of our public schools that contribute to unhealthy \nenvironments, including the prevalence of such characteristics as the \nones I have just mentioned in our elementary and secondary school \nbuildings. How can we better monitor the situation and what steps can \nwe take or help our local school districts take to remedy this \nsituation?\n  Hand in hand with our environmental health is the issue of energy \nefficiency because many of the problems are from old ventilating \nsystems, old heating systems that are not in working order and cause \nhealth problems, as well as costing more in energy than should be the \nnorm.\n  In this amendment, we are asking that we help our schools deal with \ntheir energy costs. The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that \nschools can save 25 to 30 percent of the money they currently spend on \nenergy--namely, about $1.5 billion--through better building design and \nuse of energy-efficient appliances, renewable energy technologies, and \njust plain improvements to operations and maintenance.\n  I recently visited the John F. Kennedy Elementary School in Kingston, \nNY. It is leading the way in our State in making schools more energy \nefficient and saving money. In fact, last year, the Kingston School \nDistrict saved $395,000 through energy-efficient upgrades.\n  When I was there, I released a brochure that we are sending to every \nschool superintendent in New York called ``Smart Schools Save Energy, \nPromoting Energy Efficiency in New York State Schools,'' with a lot of \ngood ideas about how to go about making the schools energy efficient \nand saving money to be used on computers or other important needs of \nthe school.\n  What we have been told is that many school personnel want to do what \nis being recommended in this brochure and is known to many school \ndistricts, but they need a little bit of help to do it. They need that \nstartup grant money that will enable them to make the changes that will \nsave them money. This amendment would provide grants to States to help \ndistricts make their buildings healthier and more energy efficient.\n  By incorporating provisions of legislation I recently introduced, the \nHealthy and High Performance Schools Act of 2001, this amendment would \nprovide funds for States to provide information and materials to \nschools, help States organize, and conduct programs for school board \nmembers, school district personnel, architects, engineers, and others, \nand would help bring our schools up to code, the codes that will make \nour schools healthier and a better investment when it comes to energy \nusage, to install insulation, energy-efficient fixtures, and the like.\n\n  With these Federal funds, we can make our schools more energy \nefficient which can save money which can then be used to reinvestment \nin our children's education that all of us in this body support.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy and Gregg for the opportunity to offer this \nimportant amendment. I also reference the energy legislation that has \nbeen introduced by Senators Murkowski and Bingaman which include \nprovisions to bring this about.\n  I appreciate the opportunity for the entire Senate to vote on this \namendment which will be a healthy vote as well as an energy-efficient \nvote on behalf of our children. No parent should have to worry about \nsending a child to school because it is a health risk. No school \ndistrict should have to worry more about paying the lighting bill or \nthe heating bill than paying their teachers.\n  Understanding the effects of unhealthy classrooms and school \nbuildings and moving toward energy efficiency goes hand in hand with \nthe high standards we set in this bill. I urge all of my colleagues to \nvote for healthy schools, energy-efficient schools, and better \neducational outcomes for all of our children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be laid aside and await a \nvote which I hope we will be able to schedule for next week. I yield \nback the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \ngiving focus to two extremely important issues. One deals with the \ninefficiencies in many of the older schools, in urban and rural areas. \nThis is something that should be done. It is not being done. It is \nparticularly important to consider since we have been unable to accept \na school construction amendment that would deal with the modernization \nof our schools.\n  With all the challenges we are facing in energy efficiency, having \nvisited so many of the schools in many of the older communities in my \nown State, this is something that can make an enormous difference. I do \nnot know whether the Senator has had the experience, but in \nMassachusetts we had an energy expert come in and look at our\n\n[[Page S5951]]\n\nhome down on Cape Cod. The recommendations they made and the savings \nthat could be achieved were truly remarkable. We are not getting that \nkind of evaluation which is available in the private sector in the \nschool districts. We hope school districts will go ahead.\n  The Senator's amendment recognizes there are other priorities for \nschool boards, and there is a national interest in having greater \nefficiency.\n  In the area of health, this is enormously important. I think all of \nus--I know the Senator has--worked in the area of lead paint poisoning \nand the impact that has particularly on smaller children, situations \nwhere older children bring the lead paint dust back to their homes, and \nthey can be consumed by infants and the potential health hazards to \nthese children is dramatic.\n  There is asbestos, radon, and new chemicals which we all know about \nin the industrial areas that are being given attention in OSHA. The \nschools are increasingly exposed to these challenges. It is having an \nimpact.\n  I commend the Senator for bringing this up. In Woburn, MA--the \nSenator probably read the book ``A Civil Action,'' or saw the movie on \nit. We had the greatest concentration of children's leukemia in the \ncountry. It was in a very narrow area. This was adjacent to conditions \nwhich were illustrated in ``A Civil Action.'' The families who were \ninvolved were similar in situations.\n  We knew a certain distance upstream from where the wells were they \nwere dumping these old wooden casks which had been filled with acids \nused in tanneries in Lynn where they process it, and some magnificent \nleather products were produced there. But they were dumping, and these \nwells were anywhere from 10 to 15 miles downstream. There were open \nwells, and families were using the wells, and the children were getting \nleukemia. It was as certain as we are standing here, it was related to \nthese chemical problems. We had the best toxicologists in the world \nexamine the water, and they could not find anything wrong with it--\nnothing. The best from CDC, the best universities and toxicologists, \nhave never been able to detect a particular ingredient that caused it, \nbut we knew it was happening.\n\n  The Senator is pointing out what I have seen. We know it is happening \nin some schools. The children are getting sick, it is affecting their \nability to learn. We can benefit from this effort.\n  I thank the Senator and look forward to supporting this amendment \nwhen we have a chance. I urge our colleagues to accept it. I thank her \nfor bringing it to the floor this evening.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Madam President, every year, thousands of youth die in \nthe United States, not from cancer or car accidents, but by their own \nhand, they make the choice that they want to die, and they take their \nown life. Statistics show that suicide is the 3rd leading cause of \ndeath among those 15 to 25 years of age, and it is the 6th leading \ncause of death among those 5 to 14 years of age. 5 year old children, \nkilling themselves! But it's the truth. Statistics show that more than \n13 of every 100,000 teenagers took their life in 1990, and that \nnumber's rising every year. Many think that these are isolated \nincidents, but they aren't. It is estimated that 500,000 teenagers try \nto kill themselves every year, and about 5,000 succeed.\n  In my home State of Alaska, suicide is the greatest cause of death \namong high school age youths. In fact, Alaska's suicide rate is more \nthan twice the rate for the entire United States. Recent studies have \nshown that girls are more likely to report suicide thoughts, plans, and \nattempts than are boys. Among Alaskan girls, 24.9 percent have \nseriously thought about suicide, 20.5 percent have made a plan for \nsuicide, and 10 percent have reported a suicide attempt. Among Alaskan \nboys, 12.5 percent have seriously thought about suicide, 10.8 percent \nhave made a plan for suicide, and 5.3 percent have reported a suicide \nattempt. Alarmingly, Alaska Native teens attempt suicide at four times \nthe rate of non-Native teens.\n  Only recently have the knowledge and tools become available to \napproach suicide as a preventable problem with realistic opportunities \nto save lives. Last month the Surgeon General issued a ``National \nStrategy for Suicide Prevention.'' The ``National Strategy'' requires a \nvariety of organizations and individuals to become involved in suicide \nprevention and emphasizes coordination of resources and culturally \nappropriate services at all levels of government--Federal, State, \ntribal and community.\n  One of the objectives included in the Surgeon General's ``National \nStrategy'' is developing and implementing suicide prevention programs. \nHis goal is to ensure the integration of suicide prevention into \norganizations and agencies that have access to groups that may be at \nrisk. The objectives also address the need for planning at both the \nState and local levels, the need for technical assistance in the \ndevelopment of suicide\n\n[[Page S5954]]\n\nprevention programs and the need for ongoing evaluation. The amendment \nI am proposing today would help implement these objectives. It would \nallow for state and local educational agencies to create suicide \nprevention programs through the Safe and Drug Free School and \nCommunities Program. Research has shown that many suicides are \npreventable; however, effective suicide prevention programs require \ncommitment and resources. I feel that the Federal Government should \nprovide the resources and support to States and localities.\n  My amendment would allow the Secretary of Education to award $25 \nmillion worth of grants to elementary and secondary schools for the \npurpose of: (1) developing and implementing suicide prevention \nprograms; and (2) provide for the training of school administrators, \nfaculty and staff with respect to identifying the warning signs of \nsuicide and creating a plan of action for helping those at risk.\n  This is a small step in the right direction. It is time that we do \nsomething to fight the suicide epidemic. With an unacceptably high \nsuicide rate, more attention must be focused on both the causes and \nsolutions to this growing tragedy. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. America's youth are crying out for help.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 624, as Modified\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts and the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire for accepting amendment No. 624, an amendment to continue the \nBlue Ribbon Schools program and authorize a demonstration program to \ninvestigate how we can implement the best practices of Blue Ribbon \nSchools in schools that this bill identifies as needing improvement.\n  The United States Department of Education awarded the first Blue \nRibbon designations to middle and high schools in 1982. The first \nelementary schools received the designation in 1985. Since that time, \nwe have identified thousands of exemplary schools that have undergone a \nthorough self-assessment involving parents, teachers, and community \nmembers; evaluated their practices in areas such as school leadership, \nprofessional development, curriculum, and student support services; and \nproven that these practices work through performance on standardized \ntests and other indicators. I think every member of this body can \nattest to the quality of the Blue Ribbon Schools in his or her state.\n  The legislation before the Senate would create two new awards \nprograms, the Achievement in Education Awards and the No Child Left \nBehind Awards. Mr. President, I did not offer this amendment in \nopposition to the Department offering these awards. In fact, I support \nthe recognition of schools that significantly improve student \nachievement. However, these two awards are outcomes-based, focused on \nwhich schools improve test scores from one year to another. The Blue \nRibbon program offers a contrast. It recognizes schools that work with \nparents and community members to identify shortcomings within the \nschool and design programs to successfully address those shortcomings. \nI believe that we should continue to recognize these schools.\n  For the Blue Ribbon Program to continue and thrive, we must commit to \napplying the information we gather from Blue Ribbon designees to offer \nschools in need of improvement. This process works. Beaufort Elementary \nSchool was included in a list of the 200 worst schools in South \nCarolina during the 1994-95 school year. Yet instead of relying on an \nacademic or bureaucratic improvement process, the school constructed a \nroad map for reform using the successful practices of Blue Ribbon \nSchools. Less then six years later, Beaufort Elementary received a Blue \nRibbon designation of its own, symbolizing a 180-degree turnaround. \nAnother school that has successfully used this process to generate \npositive school reform is Handle Middle School in Columbia, SC. I hope \nall of my colleagues will take the time to read the May 21, 2001 issue \nof Time magazine that recognizes Hand Middle School as the Middle \nSchool of the Year. The article does a much better job than I could of \ndescribing a school that implemented changes based on the successful \npractices of Blue Ribbon schools and rallied the community to create a \nbetter, more productive learning environment for students. These \nschools now serve as a model for other low-performing schools who are \nworking tirelessly to reverse their fortunes.\n  I have included new authorization in my amendment to allow the \nDepartment of Education to initiate demonstration projects that would \nuse the best practices of Blue Ribbon Schools to turn around schools \nthat fail to make average yearly progress. This is an area that the \nDepartment has neglected since the inception of the Blue Ribbon \nProgram. As we speak, filing cabinets full of Blue Ribbon applications \ncontaining information on research-based educational practices that \nwork are doing little else but gathering dust. Let's take this \ninformation and get it out to schools in need of improvement and see \nhow it works.\n  This is not a bureaucratic or regimented process. This is not a \nprocess that involves Federal or state governments mandating one \napproach over another. This is not a process that attempts to reinvent \nthe wheel. This would be a process that disseminates information on \npractices that we know are effective. I envision schools first \nidentifying an area for development--whether it be a new reading \ncurriculum, teacher mentoring or a dropout prevention program. Next, \nthey are able to examine records from Blue Ribbon Schools that have \nimplemented similar programs and decide which approach best fits their \nown needs. Because these programs come from Blue Ribbon Schools, they \nare researched-based and have been favorably reviewed by educational \nexperts. I have also required the Secretary to report to Congress on \nthe effectiveness of these demonstration projects 3 years after the \ndemonstration begins, so we will know if this process is working.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank our colleagues for their cooperation. We have \nbeen making important progress. I am not sure we can say yet tonight \nthat the end is quite in sight, but hopefully we can say that at the \nearly part at the end of the day on Tuesday we might be able to see a \nglimmer of hope for reaching a final disposition of this legislation.\n  I thank all colleagues for their cooperation, and I thank my friend \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, and, as always, the Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before going to morning business, I \ncompliment the managers of this legislation. It is obvious they are \nboth veterans and understand the legislative process. We have made \ngreat progress the last 2 days.\n  As Senator Kennedy has said, next week we should be able to finish \nthis bill with a little bit of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5954-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REED.

Madam President, I rise today to speak with grave \nconcern about a report released by the Justice Department yesterday on \nour Federal Government's administration of the death penalty. In that \nreport and in his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee \nyesterday, Attorney General John Ashcroft said that he now concludes \nthat ``there is no evidence of racial bias in the administration of the \nfederal death penalty.'' I am seriously, seriously concerned about and, \nfrankly, disappointed by the Attorney General's statements. The report \nhe released yesterday is not the in-depth analysis of the federal death \npenalty ordered by his predecessor, Attorney General Reno, and \nPresident Clinton.\n\n[[Page S5955]]\n\n  This is a very urgent matter because the Federal Government, in a \nmatter of days, is about to resume executions for the first time in \ndecades, including that of Juan Raul Garza. He is scheduled to be \nexecuted by the United States of America on June 19. Mr. Garza's case \nhas not received the level of intense scrutiny or legal representation \nthat his more notorious death row colleague, Timothy McVeigh, has \nreceived. But Mr. Garza's case, and his possible execution, should \ncause the Attorney General, President Bush, and our Nation even deeper \nsoul-searching than that which has begun with respect to the scheduled \nexecution of Mr. McVeigh.\n  A survey on the Federal death penalty system was released by the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice in September 2000. That report showed racial and \nregional disparities in the Federal Government's administration of the \ndeath penalty. In other words, who lives and who dies in the Federal \nsystem appears to relate to the color of the defendant's skin or the \nregion of the country where the defendant is prosecuted. Attorney \nGeneral Reno, Deputy Attorney General Holder, and President Clinton all \nsaid they were ``troubled'' or ``disturbed'' by the results of that \nreport.\n  In fact, Attorney General Reno was so troubled by the report that she \nimmediately ordered the collection of additional data from U.S. \nattorney offices and, most importantly, the National Institute of \nJustice to conduct an in-depth examination in cooperation with outside \nexperts.\n  I would like to take a moment to read what Attorney General Reno said \nthat day in September:\n\n       There are important limitations on the scope of our survey. \n     The survey only captures data currently available beginning \n     when a U.S. attorney submits a capital eligible case to the \n     review committee and to me for further review. This survey, \n     therefore, does not address a number of important issues that \n     arise before the U.S. attorney submits a case: Why did the \n     defendant commit the murder? Why did the defendant get \n     arrested and prosecuted by Federal authorities rather than by \n     state authorities? Why did the U.S. attorney submit the case \n     for review rather than enter a plea bargain? . . . More \n     information is needed to better understand the many factors \n     that effect how homicide cases make their way into the \n     Federal system, and once in the Federal system, why they \n     follow different paths. An even broader analysis must \n     therefore be undertaken to determine if bias does, in fact, \n     play any role in the Federal death penalty system.\n       I've asked the National Institute of Justice to solicit \n     research proposals from outside experts, to study the reasons \n     why, under existing standards, homicide cases are directed to \n     the state or Federal systems, and charged either as capital \n     cases or non-capital cases, as well as the factors accounting \n     for the present geographic pattern of submissions by the U.S. \n     Attorney's Offices. The department will also welcome related \n     research proposals that outside experts may suggest.\n\n  In December, President Clinton, citing this ongoing review by the \nJustice Department, then delayed the execution of Mr. Garza until June \n19 to allow the Justice Department time to complete its review. \nPresident Clinton also ordered the Justice Department to report to the \nPresident by April of this year on the results of its further review. \nPresident Clinton anticipated that this would have been sufficient time \nfor the President to review the results of the review before deciding \nwhether to proceed with Mr. Garza's execution on June 19.\n  On January 10 of this year, before the new administration took \noffice, the NIJ began its in-depth analysis by convening a meeting of \noutside experts, defense counsel and prosecutors to discuss the \nquestions that should form the basis for the research proposals.\n\n  Later in January, during his confirmation hearing, Attorney General \nAshcroft promised to continue and not terminate the NIJ study.\n  At that hearing, I asked him if he would support the effort of the \nNational Institute of Justice already underway to undertake the study \nof racial and regional disparities in the Federal death penalty system \nthat President Clinton deemed necessary.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft said, unequivocally and emphatically, \n``yes.''\n  I then asked him whether he would continue and support all efforts \ninitiated by Attorney General Reno's Justice Department to undertake a \nthorough review and analysis of the Federal death penalty system.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft said, ``. . . the studies that are under \nway, I'm grateful for them. When the material from those studies comes, \nI will examine them carefully and eagerly to see if there are ways for \nus to improve the administration of justice.''\n  I then followed up with yet a third question on this subject: ``So \nthose studies will not be terminated?''\n  Attorney General Ashcroft responded: ``I have no intention of \nterminating those studies.''\n  In response to written questions I provided to him following his live \ntestimony, I asked the Attorney General a number of related questions \nabout the need to eliminate racial or regional bias from our system of \njustice. He replied that he believed the Department of Justice should \nundertake ``all reasonable and appropriate research necessary to \nunderstand the nature of the problem.''\n  It is clear that Attorney General Ashcroft said he would continue and \nnot terminate the NIJ study initiated by the Reno administration. I was \npleased to hear him make this commitment.\n  But, since the new administration took office, no steps have been \ntaken to move forward with the NIJ study. Rather, the Attorney General \nnow believes it would take much too long to conduct this in-depth \nanalysis of disparities and that it would provide indefinite answers. \nTo say that the NIJ research should not be undertaken because it may \ntake more than a year and provide inconclusive answers is just \nbaffling. I am absolutely confounded by the Attorney General's \nunwillingness to take such a simple step to ensure fairness and to \npromote public confidence in the Federal system.\n  Now, Attorney General Ashcroft did say yesterday that he would order \nthe National Institute of Justice to study the effectiveness of \nFederal, state and local law enforcement in the investigation and \nprosecution of murder in American and how death penalty cases are \nbrought into the Federal system. While this review may provide some \nadditional insight into the functioning of our criminal justice system, \nit is not the NIJ review of racial and geographic disparities ordered \nby Attorney General Reno.\n  The supplemental report released yesterday lacks credibility: it is a \ncase of ``we looked at ourselves and there's no evidence of bias.'' \nInstead of completing a thorough analysis of the racial and regional \ndisparities with outside experts, as outlined by Attorney General Reno, \nAttorney General Ashcroft collected the additional data--also ordered \nseparately by Attorney General Reno--threw in some statements that \nthere is no evidence of bias and released it as a supplemental report. \nThis report does not dig behind the raw data in the way that an in-\ndepth research and analysis could do.\n  To her credit, Attorney General Reno recognized the need for input \nfrom outside experts. That is why she ordered the National Institute of \nJustice to undertake the review of racial and regional disparities. \nWhile I commended Attorney General Reno for her action in ordering \nfurther studies, I thought she should have gone one step further and \nestablish an independent, blue ribbon commission to review the Federal \nsystem. That's what Governor George Ryan did in Illinois, and the \nindependent panel there has been doing some goodwork. I've introduced a \nbill that applies Governor Ryan's example to the Federal Government, \nthe National Death Penalty Moratorium Act. We should demand the highest \nstandards of fairness and credibility in our Nation's administration of \nthe ultimate punishment.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft's actions are wholly unsatisfactory and \ninconsistent with the promises he made to the Senate and the Nation \nduring his confirmation hearing.\n  I was pleased to hear Attorney General Ashcroft say on Friday, May \n11:\n\n       Our system of justice requires basic fairness, \n     evenhandedness and dispassionate evaluate of the evidence and \n     the facts. These fundamental requirements are essential to \n     protecting the constitutional rights of every citizen and to \n     sustaining public confidence in the administration of \n     justice. . . . It is my responsibility to promote the \n     sanctity of the rule of law and justice. It is my \n     responsibility and duty to protect the integrity of our \n     system of justice.\n\n  The basic fairness, evenhandedness and dispassionate evaluation of \nthe evidence and facts, about which he spoke,\n\n[[Page S5956]]\n\nextend to the troubling racial and regional disparities in the Federal \nsystem, as documented by the Department of Justice September 2000 \nreport.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I oppose the death penalty. I have never \nmade any bones about that. But this is not really about just being \nopposed to the death penalty. This is about bias-free justice in \nAmerica. I am certain that not one of my colleagues in the Senate--not \na single one--no matter how strong a proponent of the death penalty, \nwould defend racial discrimination in the administration of that \nultimate punishment. The most fundamental guarantee of our Constitution \nis equal justice under law, equal protection of the laws. To be true to \nthat central precept of our national identity, we have to take \nextremely seriously allegations that the death penalty is being \nadministered in a discriminatory fashion.\n  So I urge the Attorney General, in the strongest possible terms, to \nreconsider his actions and direct the National Institute of Justice to \ncontinue its study, with outside experts, of the racial and regional \ndisparities in the Federal death penalty system. I also urge him to \nprovide the NIJ whatever resources may be needed to complete this \nstudy. This is the only course consistent with the promises he made \nduring his confirmation hearing.\n  Furthermore, with Mr. Garza's execution still scheduled to take place \nand the NIJ study at a standstill, I urge the Attorney General to \npostpone Mr. Garza's execution until these questions of fairness are \nfully answered. The case of Mr. Garza--a Hispanic and convicted in \nFederal court in Texas--implicates the very issues at the center of the \nunfairness reflected in the DOJ report. It would be wholly illogical \nand unjust to go forward with plans for the execution of Mr. Garza and \nsubsequent executions until the NIJ's study is completed and fully \nreviewed. It would be a great travesty of justice, as well as a great \ndiminution in the public's trust in the Federal criminal justice \nsystem, if the Federal Government executed Mr. Garza and the NIJ later \ncompleted its study, which corroborated racial or regional bias in the \nadministration of the Federal death penalty.\n  The integrity of our system of justice demands no less.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Many people \ndon't know that the pages go to school from 6:00 a.m. until the Senate \nopens, and are here even past the time the Senate gavels out. In the \npast few weeks we have had several late evenings, sometimes not leaving \nuntil after midnight. While most of the Senate employees go home and go \nto sleep, the pages do not. After work the pages have homework and \nstudying to do. Their work is never done.\n  They do an invaluable service for the United States Senate and get \nlittle acclaim. However the experience is extraordinary and one they \nwill remember for the rest of their lives.\n  Over the past semester the pages have been witness to several \nhistorical events. The State of the Union, the passing of the largest \ntax cut in history and being a part of an evenly divided Senate.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to recognize each page and the \nState that they represent.\n  Republicans: Kendall Fitch, South Carolina; Jackie Grave, Missouri; \nElizabeth Hansen, Utah; Joshua Hanson, Indiana; JeNel Holt, Alaska; \nAdrian Howell, Mississippi; Eddie McGaffigan, Virginia; Mary Hunter \n(Mae) Morris, Alabama; Jennifer Ryan, Idaho; Megan Smith, Kentucky; O. \nDillion Smith, Vermont; Garrett Young, New Hampshire;\n  Democrats: Libby Benton, Michigan; Steve Hoffman, Vermont; Alexis \nGassenhuber, Wisconsin; Kelsey Walter, South Dakota; Michael Henderson, \nSouth Dakota; Kathryn Bangs, South Dakota; Tristan Butterfield, \nMontana; Lyndsey Williams, Illinois; Joshua Baca, New Mexico; Andrew \nSmith, Texas.\n  Congratulations to you all on a successful semester as a Senate page. \nWe wish you the best of luck as you encounter all future challenges. \nThank you for your patronage and service to the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5956-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF MR.

On June 8, \n2001, Bill will be retiring from the Clark County District Attorney's \noffice after nearly 30 years of service.\n  When Chief Deputy District Attorney William T. Koot retires on \nFriday, the people of Clark County, NV, will lose a wonderful advocate.\n  Bill has been the heart and soul of the Clark County District \nAttorney's Office for decades. The leadership that he has provided, the \nexamples that he has set, the standards of integrity that he has \ninsisted upon for himself and for others, are immeasurable. He is a \nterrific trial lawyer, an outstanding legal scholar, a leader in the \ncommunity, an effective prosecutor, and most importantly, a good \nfriend.\n  Bill's legacy of service to the State of Nevada is long and \nremarkable. He joined the Office of the District Attorney in 1972, \nafter having served 3 years in the United States Marine Corps and \nacquiring his law degree from the University of San Diego.\n  During his nearly 30 years of service, Bill has tried literally \nthousands of cases. Of his 132 jury trials, Bill has successfully \nprosecuted and obtained 93 guilty verdicts. He has supervised with \ndistinction dozens of prosecutors, and during the past 6 years, he has \nheaded the office's major violators unit.\n  As Clark County District Attorney Stewart Bell has said, Bill Koot \nwill truly be missed. I extend to him my most sincere congratulations \nand the appreciation of all Nevadans for his good work on our behalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5956-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5956-S5957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             KIDS AND GUNS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the June issue of the journal Pediatrics \nreports the results of a disturbing study on children and guns. A \njournal article describes an experiment conducted by researchers from \nEmory University School of Medicine and Children's Healthcare of \nAtlanta-Egleston Hospital. The researchers wanted to determine how \nsixty four eight to twelve year old boys would behave when they found a \nhandgun in a presumably unthreatening environment.\n  Researchers placed groups of two or three boys in a room with a one \nway mirror. Two water pistols and an actual .380 caliber handgun were \nconcealed in separate drawers in the room. When left alone for a mere \n15 minutes, nearly three quarters of the groups found the handgun. Of \nthose groups, more than three quarters handled the guns. And 16 boys--\none out of every four in the study--actually pulled the trigger. And \nnone of these boys knew that the gun was not loaded. Perhaps most \ndistressing is the fact that more than 90 percent of those who handled \nthe gun or pulled the trigger had some form of gun safety instruction.\n  Despite this study and countless other examples of the potentially \nlethal implications of mixing kids and guns, the National Rifle \nAssociation\n\n[[Page S5957]]\n\nhas not strayed from its mantra. When asked about the Emory study, an \nNRA spokesman was reported to have said simply ``You can certainly \nassume that the findings are artificial.''\n  But I think Emory's Dr. Arthur Kellermann, a co-author of the study, \nhad it right. Dr Kellerman said, ``Since we can't make kids gun proof, \nwhy can't we make guns kid proof?'' That makes sense to me. So while \nthe NRA is free to bury its head in the sand, we are not. We in the \nCongress have a moral responsibility to stand up for what's right, \nclose the loopholes in our gun laws, and make our nation a little safer \nfor our children and our grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5957-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5957-S5959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING CASE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we are all familiar with the recent \ndevelopments in the Oklahoma City bombing case. Last month, just 6 days \nbefore Timothy McVeigh was to be executed, we learned that the FBI had \nwithheld thousands of pages of documents from McVeigh's defense team. \nThe execution was then postponed until June 11 to give McVeigh and his \nlawyers time to review the evidence that should have been provided to \nthem before the trial began.\n  The bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building 6 years ago left \n168 people dead and hundreds more injured.\n  The Federal Government spent millions investigating and prosecuting \nMcVeigh, and millions more on his defense. The prosecution and the \ncourts bent over backwards to ensure that he got a fair trial--one in \nwhose outcome all Americans would have confidence. A member of the \nprosecution team once called McVeigh's trial ``a shining example . . . \nof how the criminal justice system should work.''\n  I have great respect for the dedicated team of prosecutors and law \nenforcement agents who worked on the Oklahoma City bombing case. I \nhonor their commitment and I commend their accomplishments. But I agree \nwith the trial judge that the FBI's belated discovery of thousands of \npages of documents that were not turned over to the defense was \n``shocking.'' And I believe that this shocking incident holds some \nlessons for us about our criminal justice system.\n  First, something we all know, even if we do not want to admit: \nMistakes happen. Even in the highest of high profile cases, where the \nworld is watching every step of the way, and even when the government \ndevotes its most talented personnel and spares no expense, you cannot \neliminate the possibility of human error or, as appears to be the case \nhere, an unreliable computer system.\n  That should tell us something about other less infamous cases. The \naverage case, even the average death penalty case, does not get the \nbenefit of intense media scrutiny, and is not litigated by the best \nlawyers in the land. In the average death penalty case in Alabama, for \nexample, the defense does not get millions of public dollars. \nSometimes, defense lawyers are paid less than the minimum wage for \ndefending a man's life. Too often, in the average death penalty case, \ncorners are cut.\n  We saw what comes of corner cutting last month, when Jeffrey Pierce \nwas released from prison in Oklahoma. He served 15 years of a 65-year \nsentence for a rape he did not commit, because a police chemist claimed \nhis hair was ``microscopically consistent'' with hair found at the \ncrime scene. Turns out it was someone else's hair. Whoops: Mistakes \nhappen.\n  The second lesson to be learned from the McVeigh case is this: \nProcess matters. The new documents that the FBI discovered may have no \nbearing on McVeigh's guilt or sentence, but that does not excuse the \nFBI's initial oversight in failing to produce them.\n  The right to a fair trial is not some arcane legal technicality. It \nis the bedrock constitutional guarantee that protects us all against \nwrongful convictions. The fair trial violation in Jeffrey Pierce's case \ndid have a bearing on his guilt or innocence, and cost an innocent man \n15 years of his life.\n  Finally, the McVeigh case reminds us that however much we may long \nfor finality and closure in criminal cases, our first duty must always \nbe to the truth. While I am dismayed by the FBI's failure to produce \nevidence 6 years ago, I would be far more troubled if it had tried to \ncover up its mistake. It appears that the FBI and the Department of \nJustice acted responsibly under the circumstances, by turning over the \nmaterials in an orderly manner and giving McVeigh time to consider his \nresponse. The Government's willingness to acknowledge its mistake and \nuphold the rule of law was proper and commendable.\n  It also stands in sharp contrast to the actions of certain State and \nlocal authorities. The sad truth is that in America in the 21st \nCentury, with the most sophisticated law enforcement and truth-\ndetection technologies that the world has ever seen, there are still \nsome law enforcers who would rather keep out critical evidence, and \nhide the system's potential mistakes from the public, than make sure of \nthe truth. There are still people playing ``tough on crime'' politics \nwith people's lives, at the expense of truth and justice.\n  A prosecutor's duty is to the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but \nthe truth. That duty does not end just because the defendant has been \nconvicted. As Attorney General Ashcroft said in announcing the \npostponement of McVeigh's execution: ``If any questions or doubts \nremain about this case, it would cast a permanent cloud over justice, \ndiminishing its value and questioning its integrity.''\n  One cannot think of the Oklahoma bombing case without thinking of the \nhundreds of victims whose lives that bomb shattered. We as a society \ncannot give the families back their loved ones, but we can and should \ngive them closure. As the Attorney General acknowledged, you cannot \nhave real closure without a fair and complete legal process that \nensures that all of the evidence has been properly examined.\n  We cannot achieve infallibility in our criminal justice system, and \nwe cannot spend millions of dollars on every trial. No one suggests \nthat we should. But if we want real justice for those defendants, like \nJeffrey Pierce, who happen to be innocent, and real closure for victims \nof violent crime, we must ensure that we as a society do not cut \ncorners in the administration of criminal justice. That requires, at a \nminimum, that we provide competent counsel to capital defendants and \nmake DNA testing available in all cases where it could demonstrate the \ndefendant's innocence.\n  Process matters, for victims and defendants alike, and I hope that we \nwill take real action in this Congress to pass the Innocence Protection \nAct and stop cutting the corners.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a recent Wall Street \nJournal article discussing the growing support for stronger protections \nagainst wrongful executions.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Despite McVeigh Case, Curbs on Executions Are Gaining Support\n\n                           (By John Harwood)\n\n       Washington.--Americans last year elected an enthusiastic \n     proponent of capital punishment to the White House. And \n     they're applauding the resumption of federal executions next \n     month, when mass murderer Timothy McVeigh is scheduled to die \n     by lethal injection.\n       Yet, paradoxically, the dawn of George W. Bush's presidency \n     is bringing a swing in the pendulum away from executions in \n     America. Though most Americans continue to back capital \n     punishment, support has been dropping in recent years in \n     tandem with declining rates of violent crime. Advances in DNA \n     testing and scandals involving the prosecution of major \n     offenses have underscored the fallibility of evidence in \n     capital cases.\n       One state, Illinois, has placed a moratorium on the death \n     penalty. Others, including Arkansas and North Carolina, have \n     indirectly curbed its application by beefing up standards or \n     taxpayer funds for the representation of indigent defendants. \n     The number of people annually sentenced to death in the U.S. \n     has fallen in three of the last four years for which \n     statistics are available, to 272, in 1999, since peaking at \n     319 in 1994 and 1995.\n       Just last week, the Texas House voted to create the state's \n     first standards for court-appointed lawyers. The Texas Senate \n     had already passed similar legislation. The Supreme Court \n     this fall is scheduled to revisit whether to bar the \n     execution of mentally retarded inmates. In the Republican-\n     controlled Congress, support is building for stronger \n     protections against the execution of defendants who may be \n     innocent.\n\n\n                           shift in oklahoma\n\n       The pendulum swing is occurring even in Oklahoma City, \n     where Mr. McVeigh bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal \n     Building six years ago, killing 168 people. There is early \n     evidence that Oklahoma convicts are receiving fewer death \n     sentences in the wake of the\n\n[[Page S5958]]\n\n     state's decision to improve legal counsel for poor defendants \n     and expand access to DNA testing. Recent allegations of \n     misleading testimony by an Oklahoma police chemist who served \n     as a frequent prosecution witness, as well as the FBI's \n     mishandling of records in the McVeigh case, are only adding \n     to pressure for better safeguards.\n       ``The politics of the death penalty are clearly changing . \n     . . because of the blunders of the system,'' says Oklahoma \n     Gov. Frank Keating. Though he staunchly supports capital \n     punishment, the conservative Republican says he favors \n     establishing a higher standard of proof in capital cases, \n     even if that makes death sentences more difficult to obtain.\n       Just five years ago, such a change was unthinkable. But it \n     reflects a broader reconsideration taking place across the \n     spectrum of criminal-justice issues.\n       Since crime rates began to soar in the 1960s, voters and \n     politicians have responded with an increasing array of get-\n     tough measures, from more-aggressive police practices to \n     longer sentences to sterner jails. But now, questions about \n     the wisdom of America's get-tough approach are coming from \n     state officials straining to finance the prison boom, leaders \n     of poor neighborhoods depleted by the incarceration of rising \n     numbers of drug offenders and criminologists concerned about \n     the long-term effect of inmates of harsher jail practices.\n       ``Maybe we have gone too far,'' says U.S. Rep. Ray LaHood, \n     a member of the GOP leadership on Capitol Hill, whose \n     downstate Illinois district includes a federal prison. He is \n     co-sponsoring the Innocence Protection Act, which would \n     encourage states to provide capital defendants with \n     ``competent counsel'' and death-row convicts with access to \n     DNA testing.\n       Mr. LaHood says federal judges--both Republicans and \n     Democrats--are urging him to ease stiff ``mandatory-minimum'' \n     drug-sentencing laws and the 1987 U.S. sentencing guidelines \n     that took away most discretion from judges. One of those \n     judges, Michael Mihm of Peoria, Ill., a Ronald Reagan \n     appointee, says that with experience on the bench, he has \n     concluded that some mandatory minimums are excessive. At \n     sentencing time, ``I am saying, `All right . . . could we \n     accomplish all of the legitimate concerns of the society with \n     10 years rather than 20, with 10 years rather than 30?' ''\n       ``We're filling up our prisons,'' Mr. LaHood adds. More \n     than 1.9 million people reside in the nation's prisons and \n     jails. ``When people think about the number of prisons,'' the \n     congressman says, ``they really wonder if this is what we \n     should be doing.''\n\n\n                          looking at minimums\n\n       President Bush himself has raised similar questions about \n     prison policy. ``Long minimum sentences may not be the best \n     way to occupy jail space and/or heal people from their \n     disease,'' he told a CNN interviewer just before taking \n     office in January. ``And I'm willing to look at that.'' The \n     administration is expected to propose sentencing changes \n     later this year.\n       On capital punishment, the shift has occurred in spite of \n     Mr. Bush, not because of him. In Texas, he presided over 152 \n     executions, more than any other U.S. governor in the last \n     quarter-century. He said earlier this month that the one-\n     month delay in Mr. McVeigh's execution is ``an example of the \n     system being fair,'' as he has long maintained.\n       But that hasn't stopped the development of an unusual \n     community of interest across the political spectrum as debate \n     has shifted from whether capital punishment should exist to \n     how it is applied in practice. Opponents want stronger \n     safeguards because it will mean fewer executions. Supporters \n     will tolerate fewer executions as a means of stemming the \n     erosion of public confidence in the death penalty. The result \n     is an emerging consensus resembling a goal former President \n     Bill Clinton once articulated concerning abortion, which he \n     said should be ``safe, legal and rare.''\n       It isn't the first time that post-World War II America has \n     reconsidered capital punishment. Before public attention \n     focused on the rising crime rates of the 1960s, and amid that \n     decade's optimism about liberal social goals, support for \n     capital punishment dropped below 50%, notes Pew Center \n     public-opinion analyst Andrew Kohut. The supreme Court halted \n     executions across the country in 1972, declaring the death \n     penalty's application arbitrary and capricious.\n       But that was followed by years of steadily increasing \n     support for capital punishment, as crime levels rose. In the \n     1970s, state legislatures scrambled to pass new death-penalty \n     statutes designed to meet the Supreme Court's constitutional \n     objections. Today, capital punishment is legal in 38 states. \n     In 1977, Utah became the first state to resume executions \n     after the high-court ruling, and 30 others have followed \n     suit.\n       In the late 1980s, moderate Democratic strategists said \n     fielding a presidential nominee who supported the death \n     penalty was crucial to the party's hopes of recapturing the \n     White House after three consecutive Republican victories. \n     They found such a candidate in then-Arkansas Gov. Clinton, \n     who left the campaign trail at one point in 1992 specifically \n     to preside over the execution of murderer Ricky Ray Rector.\n       Public support for the death penalty crested at 80% in \n     1994, following another decade of rising violent-crime rates. \n     Legislation passed that year by a Democratic-controlled \n     Congress and signed by Mr. Clinton made some 60 additional \n     categories of crime, such as major narcotics trafficking, \n     subject to the federal death penalty. Two years later, an \n     antiterrorism bill signed by Mr. Clinton placed new \n     limitations on federal appeals by death-row inmates, while \n     the new GOP majority in Congress cut federal funding that \n     aided defense lawyers in capital cases in many states.\n\n\n                          Themes of the 1990s\n\n       But the tide of opinion turned under the influence of two \n     of the most powerful themes running through American society \n     in the late 1990s. One was improving social trends, including \n     a steady drop in rates of murder, rape and assault. Fear of \n     violent crime likewise fell. The other was technological \n     advancement, which in the forensic field led to DNA evidence \n     being used to exonerate some long-serving inmates, including \n     some on death row.\n       In 1996, two death-row prisoners in Illinois were freed \n     after an investigation by journalism students at Northwestern \n     University led to DNA testing that exonerated the inmates. A \n     year later, the American Bar Association called for a \n     national moratorium on the imposition of the death penalty.\n       Increasing opposition to capital punishment among religious \n     leaders helped fuel the shift in opinion. Catholic bishops \n     have called for the abolition of capital punishment as part \n     of the ``ethic of life'' that leads to their opposition to \n     abortion. In early 1999, then-Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan \n     commuted the death sentence of one inmate after receiving a \n     personal plea from the Pope. Last year, televangelist Pat \n     Robertson, a former-Republican presidential candidate, called \n     for a moratorium on capital punishment, after earlier \n     unsuccessfully lobbying Mr. Bush to spare the life of \n     convicted Texas murderer Karla Faye Tucker.\n       Messages in popular culture, including films such as ``The \n     Green Mile'' and ``Dead Man Walking,'' also helped soften \n     attitudes by depicting the humanity of prisoners facing \n     execution. Sixteen months ago, opponents of capital \n     punishment claimed a striking breakthrough when Republican \n     Gov. George Ryan of Illinois imposed a death-penalty \n     moratorium in the sate amid mounting evidence of botched \n     cases.\n       In Congress, legislation that would create financial \n     incentives for states to expand access to DNA testing and set \n     standards for legal representation of defendants in capital \n     cases is gathering support in both parties. In the Senate, \n     its 19 co-sponsors include four Republicans and last year's \n     Democratic vice presidential candidate, Joseph Lieberman, who \n     declined to back the bill a year earlier. Its 191 co-sponsors \n     in the House include several members of the GOP's \n     conservative wing.\n       GOP Rep. Mark Souder of Indiana, one of the co-sponsors, \n     says, ``I support he death penalty, [but] I'm a little \n     uncomfortable. We want to be more sure.''\n       There's no sign of White House support for such \n     legislation, which if implemented could have the effect of \n     significantly decreasing the number of death sentences handed \n     down. But one Bush adviser says the president ``would \n     probably have to sign'' a death-penalty-reform bill if it \n     reached his desk.\n       Moderate GOP lawmaker Sherwood Boehlert of New York says \n     Mr. Bush should affirmatively embrace the cause to ``soften'' \n     his image after his narrow presidential-election victory. \n     Among other things, such a move could help tamp down \n     hostility among black voters, who are far more inclined to \n     oppose the death penalty than are whites. Though African-\n     Americans make up just 12% of the nation's population, they \n     represent 43% of American inmates now on death row.\n       States aren't waiting for action from Washington. Florida \n     this year became the 15th state to bar the execution of \n     mentally retarded inmates, in legislation now awaiting the \n     promised signature of Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's brother. \n     Gov. Jim Gilmore of Virginia, whom Mr. Bush made chairman of \n     the Republican National Committee earlier this year, signed a \n     statute to improve access to DNA testing. In Texas, Mr. \n     Bush's gubernatorial successor has also signed DNA \n     legislation, while lawmakers in Austin move forward on \n     improvements in the state's indigent-defense system.\n       Perhaps most striking, neighboring Oklahoma, the focus of \n     national attention because of the McVeigh execution plans, \n     began taking similar steps four years ago. A state board \n     controlled by Gov. Keating hired Jim Bednar to run the state \n     agency that provides lawyers for poor defendants. Mr. Bednar \n     had formerly sought the death penalty as a state \n     prosecutor and presided over its imposition as a judge.\n       In the past, if a lawyer assigned to represent an indigent \n     defendant ``had vital signs, he was determined to be \n     competent,'' says Mr. Bednar. ``In theory I'm not opposed to \n     the death penalty. But it's the practice we need to look at. \n     The system is flawed.''\n       He began to overhaul the indigent-defense agency by winning \n     funding increases to hire better-quality lawyers. The agency \n     is now sending the message that attorneys for poor inmates \n     ``are really going to show up and do our job,'' Mr. Bednar \n     says.\n       Because of stiffer opposition, prosecutors are becoming \n     ``more hesitant to seek the death penalty,'' he adds. In \n     fiscal year 1998, as Mr. Bednar was beginning to reorganize \n     his agency, prosecutors in the area served by his Norman \n     office, which covers roughly the western half of the state, \n     sought death sentences in 36 cases. They obtained the \n     punishment in four cases. Last year, prosecutors\n\n[[Page S5959]]\n\n     sought 26 death sentences and obtained only one.\n       Doubts about the validity of some prosecution evidence--\n     sown most recently by the scandal involving alleged flaws in \n     the work of Oklahoma City police chemist Joyce Gilchrist--may \n     have also made juries more reluctant to impose the death \n     penalty in the state. Oklahoma Attorney General Drew \n     Edmondson, whose office is reviewing the cases of all 121 \n     death-row inmates in the state to see if additional DNA \n     testing is called for, has declined to set an execution date \n     for any of the 12 against whom Ms. Gilchrist had testified. \n     Ms. Gilchrist, who was suspended by the Oklahoma City police \n     department in March and now faces a state investigation of \n     her work, said in an interview, ``I stand by my testimony.''\n       Republican Gov. Keating says further steps are needed. He \n     proposes a higher standard of proof--``moral certainty'' of \n     guilt--for capital cases, instead of the families absence-of-\n     reasonable-doubt standard used in criminal trials. ``The \n     people now expect moral certainty,'' says Mr. Keating. ``No \n     system can survive if it's fallible.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5959-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Madam President, on June 10th families in Bellingham, WA \nand throughout my home State will mark the 2-year anniversary of a \npipeline explosion that killed three young people.\n  That tragic explosion changed three families forever. It shattered a \ncommunity's sense of security. It showed us the dangers posed by aging, \nuninspected oil and gas pipelines. That disaster in Bellingham led me \nto learn about pipeline safety, to testify before Congress, to \nintroduce the first pipeline safety bill of the 106th Congress, and \nultimately to pass legislation in the Senate in September 2000 and \nagain in February of this year.\n  The Senate has done its job. Twice the Senate has passed the \nstrongest pipeline safety measures to ever pass either chamber of \nCongress. Now it's time for the House and President Bush to do their \npart.\n  The bill we passed in the Senate is a major step forward. It isn't \neverything everyone could want, but it is a significant move in the \nright direction. Specifically, the bill: Improves the Qualification and \nTraining of Pipeline Personnel, Improves Pipeline Inspection and \nPrevention Practices, Requires internal inspection at least once every \nfive years, Expands the Public's Right to Know about Pipeline Hazards, \nRaises the Penalties for Safety Violators, Enables States to Expand \ntheir Safety Efforts, Invests in New Technology to Improve Safety, \nProtects Whistle blowers, and Increases Funding for Safety Efforts by \n$13 billion.\n  Here we are, 2 years after that disaster in Bellingham and the \nlegislation we've passed in the Senate still hasn't become law. That is \ninexcusable. The Bush Administration just issued an energy plan that \ncalls for 38,000 new miles of pipeline. As I told the Vice President in \na letter recently, before we build thousands of miles of pipelines \nthrough our backyards, our neighborhoods and our communities, we must \nmake sure those pipelines are safe.\n  Unfortunately, the President's energy plan offered some rhetoric \nabout pipeline safety, but no clear progress. I believe he missed an \nopportunity to articulate the Administration's specific proposals to \nmake pipelines safer. I hope President Bush will agree that we \nshouldn't replace our current energy crisis with a pipeline safety \ncrisis.\n  Let me offer three ways President Bush can show his commitment to \npublic safety. The first one is simple. We shouldn't backtrack on \nsafety. Comprehensive new legislation which has passed the Senate and \nis pending in the House should represent the new minimum of safety \nstandards. President Bush should not send us a proposal that is less \nstringent than this bill. President Bush should not undo the progress \nwe made last year. And I hope he'll show a sensitivity to safety and \nenvironmental concerns that have been absent from his discussions on \nthis issue to date.\n  Second, President Bush should signal his support of pipeline safety \nlegislation, which I hope will ultimately take the form of him signing \na bill into law.\n  Finally, President Bush's Department of Transportation should \ncontinue to issue administrative rules to make pipelines safer. The \nClinton administration took several important administrative steps. I \nhope the Bush administration will show the same level of commitment.\n  We do need to address our energy needs, but not at the expense of our \nsafety. Let's make pipelines safe first, before we lay down more \npipelines.\n  If we learned anything last year, it's that we must not wait for \nanother tragedy to force us to act. We must pass a comprehensive \npipeline safety bill this year.\n  In the coming weeks and months, as a member of Senate Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I will continue to do everything I can to \nimprove pipeline safety by making sure that pipeline regulators have \nthe resources they need to do their jobs effectively.\n  I know that we can't undo what happened in Bellingham, but we can \ntake the lessons from the Bellingham tragedy and put them into law so \nthat families will know the pipelines near their homes are safe. Two \nyears after the Bellingham disaster they deserve nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5959-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NATIONAL CORRECTION OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES WEEK\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON.

What may also not be known is that Taiwan \nimports over 1.6 times as many goods from the United States as does the \nPeople's Republic of China. Taiwan is a vital economic partner for the \nUnited States.\n  Taiwan's economy offers its people one of the highest standards of \nliving in Asia, including universal education, excellent medical care, \nand a well-developed social welfare policy. Moreover, Taiwan's \nConstitution is exemplary, guaranteeing full political freedoms and \nbasic human rights to all citizens. As Taiwan continues its democratic \ndevelopment, President Chen and the people of Taiwan deserve our most \nsincere praise for their exemplary adherence to individual liberty and \nfreedom.\n  In the future, Taiwan's continued achievements and development will \nreinforce its regional position and strengthen the good relationship \nbetween our two countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5960-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5960-S5961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CHAMPLAIN COLLEGE, BURLINGTON, VERMONT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. I rise today to talk about a unique \neducation program nestled in the hills of Burlington, VT. Champlain \nCollege is one of the many higher education institutions in my home \nState and it has distinguished itself as a leader in career-oriented \neducation. Under the leadership of President Roger Perry, Champlain \nCollege provides its students with innovative distance learning and \nworkforce development programs to build the skills of Vermonters. While \nI have long known of the quality offerings of Champlain College, I was \nvery pleased to see a story in the Los Angeles Times recently about one \nprogram in particular that serves single parents on welfare who want to \nearn a college degree.\n  With the recent reform by the Federal Government of our Nation's \nwelfare system, many individuals are seeking training that can lead to \nbetter jobs and ultimately to increased wages. In response to this \ngrowing need, an 11-year-old program at Champlain College aimed at \nmoving single parents off welfare is receiving attention nationwide. \nThe impressive statistics from this public-private partnership clearly \nindicate its success--less than 10 percent of those participating in \nthe program drop out; most in the program earn a 2-year associate \ndegree; and, many even go on to receive a 4-year bachelor's degree. \nAccording to President Roger Perry, more than 90 percent of the single \nparents who graduate from this program have not returned to the welfare \nprogram. This program is helping single parents break the welfare cycle \nand show their children the importance of getting a college degree as a \nstep toward supporting themselves and their family. Its success also \nreinforces Champlain College's role in Vermont as a leader in career-\noriented education. I commend President Roger Perry, the faculty and \nstaff, and especially the students for continuing to make Champlain \nCollege a model for quality higher education.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following article from the May 13, \n2001 issue of the Los Angeles Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 13, 2001]\n\n                         (By Elizabeth Mehren)\n\nVt. College singles Out Parents Education: Unique Curriculum That Helps \n      Welfare Mothers Get Job Training Has Become a National Model\n\n       BURLINGTON, Vt.--What galls Dulcie Christian is when her \n     Champlain College classmates say they didn't get their papers \n     done because they were out drinking all night.\n       ``I think, well, I was up all night with two sick kids and \n     I did get mine done,'' Christian said. ``Plus, I did the \n     laundry.''\n       As a participant in an unusual state-supported college \n     program geared to move single parents off welfare, Christian, \n     33, is well aware of how her life diverges from the \n     conventional undergraduate path. There's no room for wild \n     parties. And instead of spring breaks in Jamaica, Christian \n     uses time off to double up on hours working at the local \n     Social Security office. Her old Subaru just better hold \n     itself together, because there's no deep-pockets daddy to \n     bail her out. More than once, in a pinch, Christian has \n     brought Justin, 9, or Shelby, 5, to class with her.\n\n\n                        Fewer Than 10% Drop Out\n\n       For Christian and the 60 or so other single parents \n     enrolled at Champlain this semester, the challenges are \n     immense. And yet, said program director Carol Moran-Brown, \n     ``The retention rate for these single parents is higher than \n     the school average. You wouldn't believe the motivation.''\n       With federal welfare reform providing an impetus for \n     recipients to train for better jobs, the 11-year-old program \n     at this private college has emerged as a national model.\n       Typically, college officials say, fewer than 10% of these \n     students drop out; most in the program earn a two-year \n     associate of arts degree and many go on for a four-year \n     bachelor's degree. More than 90% of the single-parent \n     graduates have not returned to welfare rolls, said Champlain \n     College President Roger H. Perry.\n       Those are strong indicators, Perry said, that the program \n     is achieving its goal of helping to shatter the cycle of \n     single parents living off government assistance.\n       State money pays the salaries of Champlain's two full-time \n     social workers devoted to single-parent students--almost \n     always women, through the occasional single dad enrolls. \n     State subsidies also fund the day care that enables these \n     parents to take classes at the 1,400-student campus. The \n     program is labor intensive, with workshops and weekly social \n     hours at which single parents trade everything from outgrown \n     snowsuites to names of kid-friendly professors.\n       For a group often made up of first-generation college \n     students, social workers focus on time and stress management, \n     as well as study skills. The students and social workers \n     often meet daily, discussing what's going on \n     academically--and also addressing such outside issues as \n     abusive boyfriends, nasty landlords and sick babies. \n     Budgets are a big topic, as many single parents struggle \n     to get by on welfare payments while attending the four-\n     year college. When it all becomes too much, ``that's when \n     I show up at their door, saying, `I'm concerned about you, \n     what's going on? Can I lend a hand?' '' social worker \n     Felicia Messuri said.\n       Champlain is a career-oriented school where most students \n     easily step into jobs upon graduation. But Moran-Brown said \n     the 97% job placement rate in the single-parent program \n     stands out. A state study is underway to determine how well \n     the single-parent graduates do over time--and how their \n     experience compares to single parents who do not finish \n     college.\n       Last year, Champlain received $96,000 in state money to run \n     the program. An experimental seven-year federal waiver \n     allowing Vermont to use special support funds for the single-\n     parent college program expires in June. Eager to continue the \n     program, the state Legislature passed a measure allowing the \n     state's social welfare agency--Prevention, Assistance, \n     Training and Health Access--to allocate discretionary funds \n     for single parents in college.\n       At Champlain, single-parent students pay full $10,000-a-\n     year tuition. But they are eligible for grants and loans. \n     Under state rules, their welfare checks are not in jeopardy \n     if they also hold down jobs.\n       When state supplements for transportation, caseworker \n     salaries and incidentals are factored in, supporting each \n     single-parent college student costs about $500 per year above \n     the normal welfare allotment, Moran-Brown said. ``It's \n     cheap,'' she said.\n\n\n                 parents and kids do homework together\n\n       In Vermont, an unemployed single parent with one child \n     usually receives about $557 each month, she said.\n       Noting that the endeavor benefits the state and students \n     alike, PATH's deputy commissioner, Sandy Dooley, said her \n     office views the single-parent college program as ``a work-\n     force development strategy'' that could easily be replicated \n     elsewhere.\n       For 23-year-old Cindy Sarault, it was dissatisfaction with \n     a $5.65-an-hour job as a grocery clerk that pushed her to \n     study accounting at Champlain. Now she and her 5-year-old \n     daughter, Brooke, often do homework together.\n       Like Sarault, classmate Heidi McMann, 21, got pregnant as a \n     high school senior. After two years as a low-wage office \n     assistant, McMann signed on at Champlain to study computer \n     networking.\n       ``Partly it was about getting somewhere in life, so I could \n     get a decent job,'' she said. ``But also I wanted Taylor, my \n     daughter, to learn from me, not just see me working in dead-\n     end, low-wage positions forever.''\n       Only a few miles from campus, in the small apartment she \n     shares with her two children, Christian agreed that a big \n     payoff is ``setting an example of how important school is.''\n       As the first member of her family to graduate from high \n     school, Christian said it never crossed her mind to continue \n     her own education. ``I thought college was for people who can \n     write papers,'' she said.\n       Then someone mentioned the single-parents program at \n     Champlain. She tried a class and liked it so much she quit \n     her clerical job. To the horror of her working-class parents, \n     she went on welfare and sought out state child-care \n     subsidies.\n       Soon Christian was set on a career in social work, and \n     earning a 3.97 grade point average. Graduation is a year \n     away, and Christian has a job lined up at the Social Security \n     Administration. She said that after juggling school, a job \n     and two kids, she is unfazed by the prospect of paying off \n     college debt of at least $25,000.\n       For her, the biggest obstacle has been ``making it through \n     the tough times, when\n\n[[Page S5961]]\n\n     the money is short and your temper is short because you're \n     worrying about the money, and the kids have problems at \n     school and you have problems at school. You just want to \n     crawl off somewhere. But you can't.''\n\n\n                 ``I do think I'm breaking the cycle''\n\n       At school, Christian said, she talks about her kids \n     constantly. At home, she talks about school. Better yet, her \n     kids see her hunkering down with a book, and it makes them \n     want to do the same. When they complain that they don't like \n     a teacher, Christian says, guess what, she doesn't like all \n     her professors either. Then they all do their homework \n     together.\n       ``So I do think I'm breaking the cycle,'' Christian said. \n     ``It feels great.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5961-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

I am proud to announce that one of the classes \nthat competed was from Polson High School in Polson, MT.\n  The students that participated are: Curt Bertsch, Luke Bradshaw, Brad \nBriney, Amy Herak, Jackie Johnson, Ray Kneeland, Mindy Koopmans, Maggie \nLiebschutz, Tim Mains, Levi Mazurek, Ashley Miedinger, Joey Moholt, \nCuinn Morgen, Nolan Mowbray, Toby Nelson, Kevin O'Brien, Kati O'Toole, \nBecky Owen, Stephen Pitts, Jeri Rafter, Kate Tiskus, Luke Venters, and \nJason Wies.\n  I would also like to recognize, their teacher, Bob Hislop. Bob brings \nstudents to the national competition almost every year; his efforts \nhave been a major asset to Polson High School and the State of Montana.\n  For the students involved, the national competition was the \nculmination of months spent studying the Constitution. It lasted three \ndays, and was modeled after a Congressional hearing. Students were the \n``witnesses,'' and they made oral presentations before a panel of \njudges--the ``committee.'' Afterwards, the judges asked questions \ndesigned to probe each competitor's knowledge of several different \nConstitution-related categories.\n  In addition, the Polson High group got an opportunity to meet members \nof Congress and visit sites of historic and cultural significance in \nWashington, D.C. The competition may have been the highlight, but for \nmost students the trip itself was an educational and exciting \nexperience.\n  The ``We the People'' program is directed by the Center for Civic \nEducation, and it has been extremely successful. Several studies show \nthat students who participate in We the People are substantially better \ninformed about American Politics than those who do not. They are also \nmore likely to register to vote, be more confident in their rights as \ncitizens, and be more tolerant of other's viewpoints.\n  Let me again congratulate the Polson High group for their hard work. \nMontana is proud of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5961-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5961-S5962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         J. WESLEY WATKINS III\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is with a feeling of deep \nregret that I bring to the attention of the Senate the death of my \nfriend, J. Wesley Watkins III. He died on Monday, June 4, at George \nWashington University Hospital. He was 65 years old and was a victim of \ncancer.\n  Wes and I were classmates at the University of Mississippi. As a \nmatter of fact, we were cheerleaders for the Ole Miss football team in \n1956-1957, and I succeeded him as head cheerleader in 1957.\n  During the 1960's Wes became actively involved in the effort to \nextend all the benefits of citizenship to African Americans. He was a \nleader in our State in this cause, and he demonstrated great courage \nand determination.\n  He had an engaging personality, a winning smile, and he loved people. \nIt was always a pleasure to be with him. He truly will be missed by his \nmany friends. I'm glad I was one of them.\n  His hard work to assure equal rights and help make a difference in \nthe lives of others who needed help is described in a newspaper article \nabout his death. I ask that a copy of the obituary that appeared on \nWednesday, June 6, in the Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n   J. Wesley Watkins III, 65, Dies; Civil Liberties Lawyer, Activist\n\n                            (By Bart Barnes)\n\n       J. Wesley Watkins III, 65, a Washington-based lawyer who \n     specialized in civil rights and civil liberties issues in a \n     career that spanned almost 40 years, died of pneumonia June 4 \n     at George Washington University Hospital. He had cancer.\n       At his death, Mr. Watkins was a senior fellow at the Center \n     for Policy Alternatives and founding director of the Flemming \n     Fellows Leadership Institute, a program that assists and \n     trains state legislators on such issues as family and medical \n     leave, community reinvestment and motor-voter registration.\n       He was a former director of the American Civil Liberties \n     Union of the National Capital Area, a Washington-based \n     southern regional manager of Common Cause and a management \n     consultant to various nonprofit organizations.\n       In the late 1960's and the 1970s, he had a private law \n     practice in Greenville, Miss. His cases included winning the \n     right for African American leaders to speak to on-campus \n     gatherings at previously all-white universities; the seating \n     of a biracial Mississippi delegation at the 1968 Democratic \n     National Convention and removal of various barriers and \n     impediments to voting.\n       Mr. Watkins, a resident of Washington, was born in \n     Greenville and grew up in Inverness, Miss. He attended the \n     U.S. Naval Academy, graduated from the University of \n     Mississippi and served in the Navy at Pearl Harbor from 1957 \n     to 1959. He graduated from the University of Mississippi Law \n     School in 1962. During the Kennedy and Johnson \n     administrations, he was a Justice Department lawyer and tried \n     cases throughout the South.\n       In 1967, he returned to Greenville as a partner in the law \n     firm of Wynn and Watkins. Until 1975, he was the attorney for \n     the Loyal Democrats, the movement to establish a biracial \n     Democratic Party in a state where black residents had been \n     effectively excluded from the political process for \n     generations. The loyalists were seated at the Democratic \n     National Convention in Chicago as the official Democratic \n     Party of Mississippi. In the years after 1968, Mr. Watkins \n     held negotiations with Mississippi's Old Guard Democrats that \n     led to a unified Democratic Party by the national convention \n     of 1976.\n       Hodding Carter III, the former editor of Greenville's Delta \n     Democrat Times newspaper and a Mississippi contemporary of \n     Mr. Watkins's, described him as ``one of those southerners \n     who loved this place so much that he had to change it. He had \n     to do what he knew was the right and necessary thing in a \n     very hard time. He had to break with so much that was basic \n     to his past.'' Carter is president of the John S. and James \n     L. Knight Foundation in Miami.\n       In 1975, Mr. Watkins returned to Washington and joined the \n     Center for Policy Alternatives and helped found the Flemming \n     Leadership Institute.\n       There, Linda Tarr-Whelan, the organization's board \n     chairman, called him a ``larger-than-life figure with a thick \n     Mississippi accent, a magnetic personality and a gift for \n     telling stories.''\n       He habitually wore cowboy boots and a ten-gallon hat. When \n     chemotherapy treatments for his cancer caused some of his \n     hair to fall out, Mr. Watkins simply shaved his head and \n     started wearing an earring.\n       In the 1980s, Mr. Watkins was task force director for the \n     Commission on Administrative Review of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, which also was known as the Obey Commission. \n     He was a former legislative assistant to Rep. Frank E. Smith \n     (D-Miss.).\n       He Served on the boards of Common Cause, Americans for \n     Democratic Action and Mid-\n\n[[Page S5962]]\n\n     Delta Head Start, and most recently he was a board member of \n     Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington.\n       He was a former vestryman and a teacher in the Christian \n     education program of St. Mark's Episcopal Church in \n     Washington.\n       His marriage to Jane Magruder Watkins ended in divorce.\n       Survivors include his companion, Anita F. Gottlieb of \n     Washington; two children, Gordon Watkins of Parthenon, Ark., \n     and Laurin Wittig of Williamsburg, two sisters, Mollye Lester \n     of Inverness and Ann Stevens of Newark; a brother, William S. \n     Watkins of Alexandria; and four grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5962-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5962-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5962-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:48 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 37.

Not only instances of unusual gallantry, but also of \n     extraordinary fidelity and essential service in any way shall \n     meet with a due reward''; and\n       Whereas, the Purple Heart is the oldest military decoration \n     in the world in present use and the first award given to a \n     common soldier; a Purple Heart is an eloquent and forceful \n     symbol of each man and woman who has stepped forward in a \n     time of national crisis to defend the values of the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, the Purple Heart is a combat decoration awarded in \n     the name of the President of the United States to members of \n     the armed forces who are wounded by an instrument of war in \n     the hands of the enemy; and\n       Whereas, an effort is currently underway to petition the \n     United States Postal Service to authorize the issuance of an \n     official United States postal stamp displaying the image of \n     the Purple Heart medal; and\n       Whereas, in recent years, the United States Postal Service \n     has issued stamps honoring comic strips, movie monsters, and \n     cartoon characters but has opted not to issue a Purple Heart \n     stamp honoring American soldiers wounded in battle; and\n       Whereas, the Purple Heart stamp would serve as a permanent \n     and long-overdue honor for the one million eight hundred \n     thousand recipients of the Purple Heart, half of whom are \n     still alive today, and to remind the nation of the monumental \n     sacrifices veterans have made in the service and defense of \n     the United States of America.

Bush, the president of the \n     United States Senate, the speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Louisiana \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-84.

Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-85.

Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to recognize the final \n     week in April of every year as Minister Appreciation Week and \n     does hereby commend and congratulate all ministers of the \n     United States of America for their important service to the \n     people of the nation. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the presiding officer of each house of the \n     United States Congress and to each member of the Louisiana \n     delegation of the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-86. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Georgia relative to agricultural \n     equipment; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                         Senate Resolution 193\n\n       Whereas, water well drilling contractors are extremely \n     small construction contractors who drill water wells for \n     individuals, cities, counties, industry, and farmers; and\n       Whereas, federal law requires all persons operating \n     vehicles in excess of 26,000 pounds transporting people or \n     property to have a commercial driver's license (CDL); and\n       Whereas, this act is primarily for the common or contractor \n     carrier; and\n       Whereas, agricultural vehicles are exempt from the \n     requirements of the commercial driver's license statute; and\n       Whereas, water well drilling contractors rarely travel more \n     than 150 miles from their home office, which is one of the \n     criteria of agricultural vehicles contained in the commercial \n     driver's license statute; and\n       Whereas, these contractors rarely travel across state \n     boundaries; and\n       Whereas, the requirements of the commercial driver's \n     license statute are extremely difficult to pass; and\n       Whereas, it is a tremendous burden on these small \n     businesses to find, hire, and pay employees who have a \n     commercial driver's license; and\n       Whereas, this requirement adds a great deal of unnecessary \n     expense to the price of a well for the well owner. Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That the members of this body \n     respectfully reuest that the United States Congress enact \n     legislation reclassifying water well drilling vehicles and \n     equipment as agricultural equipment under the federal \n     commercial driver's license laws. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate is authorized \n     and directed to transmit appropriate copies of this \n     resolution to the Clerk\n\n[[Page S5966]]\n\n     of the United States House of Representatives and the \n     Secretary of the United States Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-87. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to special \n     education and children with disabilities; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 97\n\n       Whereas, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     (IDEA) passed by the United States Congress, finds that \n     disability is a natural part of the human experience and does \n     not take away or minimize the right of those individuals to \n     participate in, or contribute to, society; and\n       Whereas, Congress further found that improving educational \n     results for disabled children is an essential part of our \n     national policy of ensuring equal opportunity, full \n     participation, independent living, and economic self-\n     sufficiency for disabled individuals; and\n       Whereas, currently there are special education students in \n     every school in this State and with the rising cost of \n     special education, it is a heavy burden on Hawaii's already \n     financially challenged public education system; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Education's January 2001 \n     Quarterly Report on the Status of the State's Progress in \n     meeting the Requirements of the Felix v. Cayetano Consent \n     Decree (hereinafter DOE Quarterly Report) reported a total of \n     22,962 students identified for special education services, \n     13,146 children registered for services with the Child and \n     Adolescent Mental Health Division (CAMHD), and 1,962 children \n     identified for zero-to-three related mental health services; \n     and\n       Whereas, the DOE Quarterly Report further reported that of \n     the $154,035,838 appropriated to the Department of Education \n     for the 2000-2001 school year, $75,838,006 already was \n     expended by December 31, 2000 and of the $102,227,071 \n     appropriated to the Department of Health's CAMHD, $76,111,621 \n     was already expended by December 31, 2000; and\n       Whereas, according to the Court Monitor's Felix Consent \n     Decree Quarterly Status Report, August 2000 to November 2000, \n     over the six-year period from 1994 to 2000, the number of \n     children served by the Department of Education increased from \n     12,000 to over 22,000 while the number provided mental health \n     services by CAMHD increased from 1,800 to 11,000; and\n       Whereas, these dramatic increases have resulted in an \n     increase in the combined mental health and special education \n     costs by over $150 million, prompting the Court Monitor to \n     note that ``[n]o other state or school district in the United \n     States of America has undergone such expansion and dramatic \n     redesign in six years''; and\n       Whereas, despite earnest efforts to control the Felix \n     program costs, and the over $250 million combined \n     appropriations to the Department of Education and Department \n     of Health for the current fiscal year, the Governor has \n     requested the 2001 Legislature to appropriate $107 million in \n     emergency funds to address Felix program costs overruns; and\n       Whereas, Congress in Title 20, section 1411(a) of the \n     United States Code committed to providing up to forty percent \n     of the cost states would incur in providing special \n     education; and\n       Whereas, in fiscal year 1999-2000 federal funding of the \n     Department of Education special education program amounted to \n     a meager 10% of cost and has never exceeded 14% in any given \n     year. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-first Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2001, the House of \n     Representatives concurring, That the Hawaii Congressional \n     delegation is urged to coordinate efforts in the United \n     States Congress to obtain funding for forty percent of the \n     cost of special education and related services for children \n     with disabilities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the President pro tempore of the \n     United States Senate, the Vice President of the United \n     States, and the members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-88. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State Louisiana relative to Louisiana farmers; to the \n     committee on appropriations.\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 64\n\n       Whereas, many farmers in Louisiana are suffering the \n     consequences of low prices for their commodities, illustrated \n     by a market in which the price of soybeans is at a twenty-\n     seven year low, the price of cotton is at a twenty-five year \n     low, the price of wheat and corn is selling at a fourteen \n     year low, and the price of rice is at an eight year low; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana farmers are trying to overcome the \n     onslaughts of nature, characterized by a devastating drought \n     in 2000 which followed a disappointing crop year in which \n     many farmers were left in financial trouble; and\n       Whereas, the existing federal farm bill has not adequately \n     addressed the current circumstances and needs of farmers in \n     Louisiana as well as farmers across the United States; and\n       Whereas, hopes for a widespread opening of foreign markets \n     and the implementation of measures to stimulate commodity \n     exports have not materialized; and\n       Whereas, it is estimated that $9 billion above the \n     projected budget baseline is needed in federal farm payments \n     this year to assist farmers if they are to survive; and\n       Whereas, an increase in farm payments is critical to the \n     agriculture industry given agriculture's vital importance to \n     the sustenance of all people and to the economy of our state; \n     and\n       Whereas, many farmers have no other choice but to rely on \n     assistance payments to stay in business. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the congress of the United states to increase federal aid to \n     Louisiana farmers. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United states House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the Congress of \n     the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-89.

Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to use the powers at its \n     disposal to commission the United States Department of Energy \n     to establish a national energy policy, which should pursue a \n     long-term remedy to these problems by providing incentives \n     for immediate domestic natural gas exploration and \n     production, including opening untapped natural gas reserves. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the president of the United States, the secretary of the \n     United States Senate, the clerk of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the secretaries of the Department of Energy \n     and the Department of the Interior, and to each member of the \n     Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-90.

Bush's Tax Relief Plan will \n     contribute to raising the standard of living for all \n     Americans, including the people of Guam; and\n       Whereas, President Bush's Tax Relief Plan will increase \n     access to the middle class for hard-working families, treat \n     all middle class families more fairly, encourage \n     entrepreneurship and growth, and promote charitable giving \n     and education; and\n       Whereas, under President Bush's Tax Relief Plan, the \n     largest percentage reductions will go to the lowest income \n     earners; now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That I Mina'Bente Sais Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     does hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, urge our \n     elected representatives in the United States Congress, \n     including Guam's Delegate to the U.S. Congress, to support \n     and pass the Tax Relief Plan introduced by President George \n     W.

I hope that President Bush will recognize \nthe message sent by the overwhelming support for this legislation, and \nwill put to rest the idea that the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act might \nexpire or be weakened.\n  ILSA has been one of America's best weapons in our war against \nterrorism, because it is aimed at cutting off the flow of money that \nterrorist groups depend on to fund their attacks and operations.\n  Over the past 5 years, ILSA has effectively deterred foreign \ninvestment in Iran's oil fields: of the 55 projects for which Iran \nsought foreign investment, only 6 have been funded, and none have been \ncompleted.\n  That's what ILSA's all about: it limits the ability of Iran and Libya \nto reap oil profits that can be spent funding terrorism and for weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  Even with ILSA in place, Iran continues to supply upwards of $100 \nmillion to Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas--which claimed \nresponsibility for the suicide bombing last week in Tel Aviv that \nkilled 20 Israeli children.\n  Can you imagine how much more Iran would be spending on terrorism\n\n[[Page S5970]]\n\nand weapons of mass destruction if they had billions more in oil \nprofits rolling in?\n  The truth is, ILSA is needed now more than ever.\n  Despite the election of the so-called ``moderate'' President Mohammad \nKhatami in 1997, Iran remains the world's most active state sponsor of \nterrorism, and has been feverishly seeking to develop weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  And on the eve of another election in Iran, Khatami continues to \nvilify the United States, and in his most recent call for the \ndestruction of Israel, referred to Israel as ``a parasite in the heart \nof the Muslim world.'' These are not the words of a moderate, worthy of \nAmerican concessions.\n  As far as Libya is concerned, we all learned recently that the Libyan \ngovernment was directly involved in the bombing of Pan Am 103--one of \nthe most heinous acts of terrorism in history.\n  Yet Libya obstinately refuses to abide by U.N. Security Council \nresolutions requiring it to formally renounce terrorism, accept \nresponsibility for the government officials convicted of masterminding \nthe bombing, and compensate the victims' families.\n  Some say we should lift sanctions on rogue nations like Iran and \nLibya first, and decent, moral, internationally-acceptable behavior \nwill follow.\n  I say that is twisted logic.\n  If these nations are serious about entering the community of nations, \nand seeing their economies benefit from global integration, they must \nchange their behavior first.\n  They must adapt to the world community, the world community does not \nneed to adapt to them.\n  The bottom line is that these sanctions must remain in place until \nIran ends its support of international terrorism, and ends its \ndangerous quest for catastrophic weapons.\n  For Libya, it means full acceptance of responsibility for the Pan Am \n103 bombing and full compensation for the families of the victims.\n  If that day arrives, ILSA will no longer be needed and will be \nterminated. Unfortunately, that day is not yet in sight.\n  Finally, I would urge the Bush Administration, as it reviews American \nsanctions policies, to consider that letting ILSA expire would send the \nwrong message to Iran and Libya.\n  This is not the time to weaken sanctions and permit investment that \ncan be used to fund terrorist acts like the one we saw in Israel last \nweek.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in support of \nrenewing the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act to protect American interests in \nthe Middle East. Despite promising changes within Iranian society, \nIran's external behavior remains provocative and destabilizing. Iran \ncontinues to aggressively foment terrorism beyond its borders and \ndevelop weapons of mass destruction as a matter of national policy. \nConsistent calls from its leaders for Israel's destruction, and the \nIranian government's bankrolling of murderous behavior by Hezbollah, \nHamas, and other terrorist groups, should make clear to all friends of \npeace where Iran stands, and what role it has played, in the \nconflagration that threatens to consume an entire region.\n  Of grave concern are recent revelations that implicate Iran's most \nsenior leaders in the 1996 terrorist attack on Khobar Towers, which \ntook the lives of 19 U.S. service men. If true, America's response \nshould extend far beyond renewing ILSA.\n  The successful conclusion of the Lockerbie trial, which explicitly \nimplicated Libya's intelligence services in the attack, does not \nabsolve Libya of its obligations to meet fully the terms of the U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions governing the multilateral sanctions \nregime against it. Libya has not done so. Libya's support for state \nterrorism, as certified again this year by our State Department, and \nits aggressive efforts to develop chemical and potentially nuclear \nweapons, exclude Libya from the ranks of law-abiding nations.\n  Lifting sanctions on Iran and Libya at this time would be premature \nand would unjustly reward their continuing hostility to basic \ninternational norms of behavior. Overwhelming Congressional support for \nrenewing the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act reflects a clear, majority \nconsensus on U.S. relations with these rogue regimes. Were the foreign \nand national security policies of Iran and Libya truly responsive to \nthe will of their people, our relationship with their nations would be \nfar different. But Libya's Qaddafi and Iran's ruling clerics hold their \ncitizens hostage by their iron grip on power. Supporting their \nreplacement by leaders elected by and accountable to their people \nshould be a priority of American policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 995. A bill to amend chapter 23 of title 5, United States Code, to \nclarify the disclosures of information protected from prohibited \npersonnel practices, require a statement in non-disclosure policies, \nforms, and agreements that such policies, forms and agreements conform \nwith certain disclosure protections, provide certain authority for the \nSpecial Counsel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing amendments to the \nWhistleblower Protection Act, WPA, that will strengthen protections for \nfederal employees who disclose waste, fraud, and abuse. I am proud to \nbe joined by Senators Levin and Grassley, two of the Senate's leaders \nin protecting employees from retaliatory actions. The Senators from \nMichigan and Iowa were the primary sponsors of the original 1989 Act, \nas well as the 1994 amendments, both of which were passed unanimously \nby Congress.\n  One of the basic obligations of public service is to disclose waste, \nfraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities. The WPA was \nintended to protect federal employees, those often closest to \nwrongdoing, from workplace retaliation as a result of making such \ndisclosures. The right of federal employees to be free from workplace \nretaliation, however, has been diminished by a pattern of court rulings \nthat have narrowly defined who qualifies as a whistleblower under the \nWPA, and what statements are considered protected disclosures. These \nrulings are inconsistent with congressional intent. There is little \nincentive for federal employees to come forward because doing so could \nput their careers at substantial risk.\n  The bill we introduce today will restore congressional intent \nregarding who is entitled to relief under the WPA, and what disclosures \nare protected. In addition, it codifies certain anti-gag rules, extends \nindependent litigating authority to the Office of Special Counsel, OSC, \nand ends the sole jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Federal Circuit over whistleblower cases.\n  In the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, CSRA, Congress included \nstatutory whistleblower rights for ``a'' disclosure evidencing a \nreasonable belief of specified misconduct, with certain listed \nstatutory exceptions--classified or other information whose release was \nspecifically barred by other statutes. Unexpectedly, the court and \nadministrative agencies created several loopholes that limited employee \nprotections. With the WPA, Congress closed these loopholes by changing \nprotection of ``a'' disclosure to ``any'' disclosure meeting the law's \nstandards. However, in both formal and informal interpretations of the \nAct, loopholes continued to proliferate.\n  Congress strengthened its scope and protections by passing 1994 \namendments to the WPA. The Governmental Affairs Committee report on the \n1994 amendments refuted prior interpretations by the Federal Circuit \nand the Merit Systems Protection Board, MSPB, as well as subsequent \nenforcement action by the Office of Special Counsel that there were \nexceptions to ``any.'' The Committee report concluded, ``The plain \nlanguage of the Whistleblower Protection Act extends to retaliation for \n`any disclosure,' regardless of the setting of the disclosure, the form \nof the disclosure, or the person to whom the disclosure is made.''\n  Since the 1994 amendments, both OSC and MSPB generally have honored \ncongressional boundaries. However, the Federal Circuit continues to \ndisregard clear statutory language that the Act covers disclosures such \nas those made to supervisors, to possible wrongdoers, or as part of an \nemployee's job duties.\n\n[[Page S5971]]\n\n  In order to protect the statute's foundation that ``any'' lawful \ndisclosure that the employee or applicant reasonably believes is \ncredible evidence of waste, fraud, abuse, or gross mismanagement is \ncovered by the WPA, our bill codifies the repeated and unconditional \nstatements of congressional intent and legislative history. It amends \nsections 2302(b)(8)(A) and 2302(b)(8)(B) of title 5, U.S.C., to cover \nany disclosure of information ``without restriction to time, place, \nform, motive or context, or prior disclosure made to any person by an \nemployee or applicant, including a disclosure made in the ordinary \ncourse of an employee's duties that the employee or applicant \nreasonably believes is credible evidence of'' any violation of any law, \nrule, or regulation, or other misconduct specified in section \n2302(b)(8).\n  The bill also codifies an ``anti-gag'' provision that Congress has \npassed annually since 1988 as part of the appropriations process. It \nbans agencies from implementing or enforcing any nondisclosure policy, \nform or agreement that does not contain specified language preserving \nopen government statutes such as the WPA, the Military Whistleblower \nProtection Act, and the Lloyd Lafollette Act, which prohibits \ndiscrimination against government employees who communicate with \nCongress. Gag orders imposed as a precondition for employment and \nresolution of disputes, as well as general agency policies barring \nemployees from communicating directly with Congress or the public, are \na prior restraint that not only has a severe chilling effect, but \nstrikes at the heart of this body's ability to perform its oversight \nduties. Congress repeatedly has reaffirmed its intent that employees \nshould not be forced to sign agreements that supercede an employee's \nrights under good government statutes. Moreover, Congress unanimously \nhas supported the concept that federal employees should not be subject \nto prior restraint from disclosing wrongdoing nor suffer retaliation \nfor speaking out.\n  The measure also provides the Special Counsel with greater litigating \nauthority for merit system principles that the office is responsible to \nprotect. Under current law, the OSC plays a central role as public \nprosecutor in cases before the MSPB, but cannot choose to defend the \nmerit system in court. Our legislation recognizes that providing the \nSpecial Counsel this authority to seek such review, in precedential \ncases, is crucial to ensuring the promotion of the public interests \nfurthered by these statutes.\n  Lastly, the bill would end the Federal Circuit's monopoly over \nwhistleblower cases by allowing appeals to be filed in the Federal \nCircuit or the circuit in which the petitioner resides. This restores \nnormal judicial review, and provides employees in states such as my \nhome state of Hawaii, the option of a more convenient forum, rather \nthan necessitating a 10,000 mile round trip from Hawaii to Washington, \nD.C.\n  This bill will begin the needed dialogue to guarantee that any \ndisclosures within the boundaries of the statutory language are \nprotected. As the Chairman of the Federal Services Subcommittee, I plan \nto hold a hearing on the Whistleblower Protection Act and the \namendments we are proposing today.\n  Protection of Federal whistleblowers is a bipartisan effort. \nEnactment of the original bill in 1989 and the 1994 amendments enjoyed \nunanimous bicameral support, and I am pleased that Representatives \nMorella and Gilman will introduce identical legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives in the near future. I also wish to note that our bill \nenjoys the strong support of the Government Accountability Project and \nthe National Whistleblower Center, and I commend both of these \norganizations for their efforts in protecting the public interest and \npromoting government accountability by defending whistleblowers.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in the effort to ensure that the \ncongressional intent embodied in the Whistleblower Protection Act is \ncodified and that the law is not weakened further. I ask unanimous \nconsent that letters in support of our bill from the National \nWhistleblower Center and the Government Accountability Project and the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 995\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on International Security, \n         Proliferation, and Federal Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The National Whistleblower Center is \n     pleased to announce its support for your bill to update and \n     strengthen the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA). We would \n     like to commend your leadership in introducing this \n     significant and important legislation.\n       The National Whistleblower Center was established because \n     of the critical role that credible whistleblowers play in the \n     effective functioning of our system of checks and balances. \n     Despite this critical role, federal whistleblowers have not \n     always enjoyed the same rights as other citizens. The Center \n     has therefore maintained an on-going vigilance and commitment \n     to preserving the integrity of the whistleblower process.\n       In recent years, protections for whistleblowers have \n     eroded. This is mainly due to recent decisions in cases \n     before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, \n     which presently holds a monopoly on appeals under the WPA. \n     The Center is therefore enthusiastic in its support of the \n     provision in your bill that offers employees an additional \n     venue for appeals.\n       Your bill would also codify so-called ``anti-gag'' language \n     that has been included each year for the past twelve years in \n     appropriations bills. The language has been needed to avoid \n     ambiguity in the government's efforts to prevent improper \n     disclosures of information. The ambiguity created a chilling \n     effect for employees who otherwise had the right to make \n     proper disclosures to Congress and elsewhere. This provision \n     would clear a major hurdle in protecting the rights of \n     employees to disclose instances of wrongdoing by government \n     officials.\n       The Center is concerned that, in the larger picture, \n     improvements in the whistleblower protection system require \n     more fundamental changes. For instance, there should be \n     tougher provisions to hold accountable those managers who \n     retaliate against whistleblowers. In addition, those who \n     bring their cases under laws other than the WPA have had much \n     greater success. This is in part because of adverse decisions \n     by the Federal Circuit, but it also suggests that the WPA is \n     not as whistleblower-friendly in practice as we hoped it \n     would be when we passed and amended the WPA. These are issues \n     to be addressed down the road, and the Center would be happy \n     to provide you the benefit of our experience in these \n     matters.\n       Nonetheless, your bill, if passed, would make an important \n     and necessary contribution toward improvements in the \n     protection of whistleblowers under the WPA. Again, we commend \n     your leadership in the introduction of this bill, and we look \n     forward to working with you and your co-sponsors during the \n     hearing process and throughout the legislative process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kris J. Kolesnik,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Government Accountability Project,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on International Security, \n         Proliferation and Federal Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Government Accountability Project \n     (GAP) commends your leadership in sponsoring legislation to \n     revive and strengthen the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA). \n     This is the primary civil service law applying merit system \n     rights to good government safeguards. Your initiative is \n     indispensable to restore legitimacy for the law's unanimous \n     congressional mandate, both in 1989 when it was passed \n     originally and in 1994 when it was unanimously strengthened. \n     We similarly appreciate the partnership of original \n     cosponsors Senators Levin and Grassley. They remain visible \n     leaders from the pioneer campaigns that earned this \n     legislative mandate.\n       GAP is a non-partisan, non-profit public interest \n     organization whose mission is supporting whistleblowers, \n     those employees who exercise free speech rights to challenge \n     betrayals of the public trust about which they learn on the \n     job. We advocated initial passage of whistleblower rights as \n     part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, and have led \n     outside campaigns for passage of the WPA, as well as \n     analogous laws for military service members, state, municipal \n     and corporate employees in industries ranging from airlines \n     to nuclear energy. Last year GAP drafted a model \n     whistleblower law approved by the Organization of American \n     States (OAS) for implementation of the Inter-American \n     Convention Against Corruption.\n       Unfortunately, your leadership is a necessity for the Act \n     to regain legitimacy. In 1994 on paper it reflected the state \n     of the art for whistleblower rights. Despite pride in helping \n     to win its passage, GAP now must warn those seeking help that \n     the law is more likely to undermine than reinforce their \n     rights. This is because the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, \n     which has a monopoly on appellate judicial review, has \n     functionally erased basic statutory language and implicitly \n     added new provisions that threaten those seeking help. Your \n     legislation both solves the specific problems, and includes \n     structural reform to prevent their recurrence by restoring \n     normal judicial review. Congress had to approve both the 1989 \n     and 1994 legislation to cancel previous instances of judicial \n     activism by this same court. This pattern must end for the \n     law again to become functional.\n       Your bill also incorporates an appropriations rider \n     approved for the last 13 years, known as the ``anti-gag \n     statute.'' This provision requires agencies to notify \n     employees that any restrictions on disclosures do not \n     override their rights under the WPA, or other open government \n     laws such as the Lloyd Lafollette Act protecting \n     communications with Congress. The rider has worked. It has \n     proven effective and practical against agency attempts to \n     impose secrecy through orders or nondisclosure agreements \n     that cancel Congress and the public's right to know. It is \n     time to institutionalize this success story.\n       Even if implemented as intended, the 1989 and 1994 \n     legislation was a beginning, rather than a panacea. More work \n     is necessary to disrupt the deeply ingrained tradition of \n     harassing whistleblowers. Based on our experience, issues \n     such as the following must be addressed for the law to \n     fulfill its promise--closing the ``security clearance \n     loophole'' that permits merit system rights to be \n     circumvented through removing clearances that are a condition \n     for employment; providing meaningful relief for those who win \n     their cases; preventing retaliation by creating personal \n     accountability for those who violate the merit system; and \n     giving whistleblowers access to jury trials to enforce their \n     rights.\n       Your legislation is a reasonable and essential first step \n     on the road to recovery for whistleblower rights in the merit \n     system. It sends a clear message that congress was serious \n     when it passed this law in 1989 and strengthened it in 1994. \n     Congressional persistence is a prerequisite for those who \n     defend the public to have a decent chance of defending \n     themselves. We look forward to working with you and your co-\n     sponsors in passing this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tom Devine,\n       Legal Director.\n     Doug Hartnett,\n       National Security Director.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Akaka and \nGrassley today in sponsoring amendments to the Whistleblower Protection \nAct that will strengthen the law protecting employees who blow the \nwhistle on fraud, waste, and abuse in federal programs. I sponsored the \nWhistleblower Protection Act in 1989 which strengthened and clarified \nthe intent of whistleblower rights in the merit system. But recent \nholdings by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit \nhave corrupted the intent of Congress, with the result that additional \nclarifying language is sorely needed. The Federal Circuit has seriously \nmisinterpreted key provisions of the whistleblower law, and the bill we \nare introducing today is intended to correct those misinterpretations.\n  Congress has long recognized the obligation we have to protect a \nFederal\n\n[[Page S5973]]\n\nemployee when he or she discloses evidence of wrongdoing in a Federal \nprogram. If an employee reasonably believes that a fraud or \nmismanagement is occurring, and that employee has the courage and the \nsense of responsibility to make that fraud or mismanagement known, it \nis our duty to protect the employee from any reprisal. We want Federal \nemployees to identify problems in our programs so we can fix them, and \nif they fear reprisal for doing so, then we are not only failing to \nprotect the whistleblower, but we are also failing to protect the \ntaxpayer. We need to encourage, not discourage, disclosures of fraud, \nwaste and abuse.\n  Today, however, the effect of the Federal Circuit decisions is to \ndiscourage the Federal employee whistleblower and overturn \nCongressional intent. The Federal Circuit has misinterpreted the plain \nlanguage of the law on what constitutes protected disclosure under the \nWhistleblower Protection Act. Most notably, in the case of Lachance \nversus White, decided on May 14, 1999, the Federal Circuit imposed an \nunfounded and virtually unattainable standard on Federal employee \nwhistleblowers in proving their cases. In that case, John E. White was \nan education specialist for the Air Force who spoke out against a new \neducational system that purported to mandate quality standards for \nschools contracting with the Air Force bases. White criticized the new \nsystem as counterproductive because it was too burdensome and seriously \nreduced the education opportunities available on base. After making \nthese criticisms, local agency officials reassigned White, removing his \nduties and allegedly isolating him. However, after an independent \nmanagement review supported White's concerns, the Air Force canceled \nthe program White had criticized. White appealed the reassignment in \n1992 and the case has been in litigation ever since.\n  The administrative judge initially dismissed White's case, finding \nthat his disclosures were not protected by the Whistleblower Protection \nAct. The MSPB, however, reversed the administrative judge's decision \nand remanded it back to the administrative judge holding that since \nWhite disclosed information he reasonably believed evidenced gross \nmismanagement, this disclosure was protected under the Act. On remand, \nthe administrative judge found that the Air Force had violated the \nWhistleblower Protection Act and ordered the Air Force to return White \nto his prior status; the MSPB affirmed the decision of the \nadministrative judge. OPM petitioned the Federal Circuit for a review \nof the board's decision. The Federal Circuit reversed the MSPB's \ndecision, holding that there was not adequate evidence to support a \nviolation under the Whistleblower Protection Act. The Federal Circuit \nheld that the evidence that White was a specialist on the subject at \nissue and aware of the alleged improper activities and that his belief \nwas shared by other employees was not sufficient to meet the \n``reasonable belief'' test in the law. The court held that ``the board \nmust look for evidence that it was reasonable to believe that the \ndisclosures revealed misbehavior [by the Air Force] . . .'' The court \nwent on to say:\n\n       In this case, review of the Air Force's policy and \n     implementation via the QES standards might well show them to \n     be entirely appropriate, even if not the best option. Indeed, \n     this review would start out with a ``presumption that public \n     officers perform their duties correctly, fairly, in good \n     faith, and in accordance with the law and governing \n     regulations. . . . And this presumption stands unless there \n     is `irrefragable proof to the contrary'.''\n\n  The fact that the Federal Circuit remanded the case to the MSPB to \nhave the MSPB reconsider whether it was reasonable to believe that what \nthe Air Force did in this case involved gross mismanagement was \nappropriate. But, the Federal Circuit went on to impose a clearly \nerroneous and excessive standard on the employee in proving \n``reasonable belief,'' requiring ``irrefragable'' proof that there was \ngross mismanagement. Irrefragable means ``undeniable, incontestable, \nincontrovertible, incapable of being overthrown.'' How can a Federal \nemployee meet a standard of ``irrefragable'' in proving gross \nmismanagement? Moreover, there is nothing in the law or the legislative \nhistory that even suggests such a standard with respect to the \nWhistleblower Protection Act. The intent of the law is not for the \nemployee to act as an investigator and compile evidence to have \n``irrefragable'' proof that there is fraud, waste or abuse. The \nemployee, under the clear language of the statue, need only have ``a \nreasonable belief'' that there is fraud, waste or abuse occurring \nbefore making a protected disclosure. This bill will clarify the law so \nthis misinterpretation will not happen again.\n  The bill addresses a number of other important issues as well. For \nexample, the bill adds a provision to the Whistleblower Protection Act \nthat provides specific protection to a whistleblower who discloses \nevidence of fraud, waste, and abuse involving classified information if \nthat disclosure is made to the appropriate committee of Congress or \nFederal executive branch employee authorized to receive the classified \ninformation.\n  In closing, I want to thank Senator Akaka for his leadership in this \narea.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise with determination to join \nSenators Akaka and Levin introducing legislation on an issue that \nshould concern us all: the integrity of the Whistleblower Protection \nAct of 1989. I enclose editorials and op-ed commentaries, ranging from \nthe New York Times to the Washington Times highlighting the needs for \nthis law to be reborn so that it achieves its potential for public \nservice. Unfortunately, it has become a Trojan horse that may well be \ncreating more reprisal victims than it protects. The impact for \ntaxpayers could be to increase silent observers who passively conceal \nfraud, waste and abuse. That is unacceptable.\n  I was proud to be an original co-sponsor of this law when it was \npassed unanimously by Congress in 1989, and when it was unanimously \nstrengthened in 1994. Both were largely passed to overturn a series of \nhostile decisions by administrative agencies and an activist court with \na monopoly on the statute's judicial review, the Federal Circuit Court \nof Appeals. The administrative agencies, the U.S. Office of Special \nCounsel and the Merit Systems Protection Board, appear to have gotten \nthe point. They have been operating largely within statutory \nboundaries. Despite the repeated unanimous congressional mandates, \nhowever, the Federal Circuit has stepped up its attacks on the \nWhistleblower Protection Act. Enough is enough.\n  The legislation we are introducing today has four cornerstones, \nclosing loopholes in the scope of WPA protection; restoring a realistic \ntest for when reprisal protection is warranted; restoring the normal \nstructure for judicial review; and codifying the anti-gag statute \npassed as an appropriations rider for the last 13 years. Each is \nsummarized below.\n  As part of 1994 amendments unanimously passed by Congress to \nstrengthen the Act, the legislative history emphasized, ``[I]t also is \nnot possible to further clarify the clear language in section \n2302(b)(8) that protection for `any' whistleblowing disclosure truly \nmeans `any.' A protected disclosure may be made as part of an \nemployee's job duties, may concern policy or individual misconduct, and \nmay be oral or written and to any audience inside or outside the \nagency, without restriction to time, place, motive or content.''\n  Somehow the Federal Circuit did not hear our unanimous voice. Without \ncommenting on numerous committee reports and floor statements \nemphasizing this cornerstone, it has been creating new loopholes at an \naccelerated pace. Its precedents have shrunk the scope of protected \nwhistleblowing to exclude disclosures made as part of an employee's job \nduties, to a co-worker, boss, others up the chain of command, or even \nthe suspected wrongdoer to check facts. Under these judicial loopholes, \nthe law does not cover agency misconduct with the largest impact, \npolicies that institutionalize illegality or waste and mismanagement. \nLast December it renewed a pre-WPA loophole that Congress has \nspecifically outlawed. The court decreed that the law only covers the \nfirst person to place evidence of given misconduct on the record, \nexcluding those who challenge long term abuses, witnesses whose \ntestimony supports pioneer whistleblowers, or anyone who is not the \nChristopher Columbus for any given scandal.\n\n  There is no legal basis for any of these loopholes. None of these \nloopholes came from Congress. In fact, all\n\n[[Page S5974]]\n\ncontradict express congressional intent. Since 1978, the point of \nFederal whistleblower protection has been to give agencies the first \ncrack at cleaning their own houses. These loopholes force them to \neither remain silent, sacrifice their rights, or go behind the back of \ninstitutions and individuals if they want to preserve their rights when \nchallenging perceived misconduct. They proceed at their own risk if \nthey exercise their professional expertise to challenge problems on the \njob. They can only challenge anecdotal misconduct on a personal level, \nrather than institutionalized.\n  Our legislation addresses the problem by codifying the congressional \n``no exceptions'' definition for lawful, significant disclosures. The \nlegislation also reaffirms the right of whistleblowers to disclose \nclassified information about wrongdoing to Congress. National security \nsecrecy must not cancel Congress' right to know about betrayals of the \npublic trust.\n  In a 1999 decision, the Federal Circuit functionally overturned the \nstandard by which whistleblowers demonstrate their disclosures deserve \nprotection: lawful disclosures which evidence a ``reasonable belief'' \nof specific misconduct. Congress did not change this standard in 1989 \nor 1994 for a simple reason: it has worked by setting a fair balance to \nprotect responsible exercises of free speech. Ultimate proof of \nmisconduct has never been a prerequisite for protection. Summarized in \nlay terms, ``reasonable belief'' has meant that if information would be \naccepted for the record of related litigation, government \ninvestigations or enforcement actions, it is illegal to fire the \nemployee who bears witness by contributing that evidence.\n  That realistic test no longer exists. In Lachance v. White, the \nFederal Circuit overturned the victory of an Air Force education \nspecialist challenging a pork barrel program whose concerns were so \nvalid that after an independent management review, the Air Force agreed \nand canceled the program. Unfortunately, local base officials held a \ngrudge, reassigning Mr. White and stripping him of his duties. He \nappealed under the WPA and won before the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard. The Federal Circuit, however, held that he did not demonstrated \na ``reasonable belief'' and sent the case back. That raises questions \non its face, since agencies seldom agree with whistleblowers.\n  The court accomplished this result disingenuously. While endorsing \nthe existing standard, it added another hurdle. It held that to have a \nreasonable belief, an employee must overcome the presumption that the \ngovernment acts fairly, lawfully, properly and in good faith. They must \ndo so by ``irrefragable'' proof. The dictionary defines \n``irrefragable'' as ``uncontestable, incontrovertible, undeniable, or \nincapable of being overthrown.'' The bottom line is that, in the \nabsence of a confession, there is no such thing as a reasonable belief. \nIf there is no disagreement about alleged misconduct, there is no need \nfor whistleblowers.\n\n  The court even added a routine threat for employees asserting their \nrights. Although Congress has repeatedly warned that motives are \nirrelevant to assess protected speech, the court ordered the MSPB to \nconduct factfinding for anyone filing a whistleblower reprisal claim, \nto check if the employee had a conflict of interest for disclosing \nalleged misconduct in the first place. This means that while \nwhistleblowers have almost no chance of prevailing, they are guaranteed \nto be placed under investigation for challenging harassment. \nIronically, in 1994 Congress outlawed retaliatory investigations, which \nhave now been institutionalized by the court.\n  In the aftermath, whistleblower support groups like the Government \nAccountability Project must warn those seeking guidance that if they \nassert rights, they will be placed under investigation and any eventual \nlegal ruling on the merits inevitably will conclude they deserve \npunishment and formally endorse the retaliation they suffered. The \nWhite case is a decisive reason for those who witness fraud, waste and \nabuse to remain silent, instead of speaking out. Profiles in Courage \nare the exception, rather than the rule. Our legislation ends the \npresumptions of ``irrefragable proof'' and protects any reasonable \nbelief as demonstrated by credible evidence.\n  This is the third time Congress has had to reenact a unanimous good \ngovernment mandate thrown out by the Federal Circuit. This is also \nthree strikes for the Federal Circuit's monopoly authority to \ninterpret, and repeatedly veto, this law. It is time to end the broken \nrecord syndrome.\n  The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 contained normal ``all \ncircuits'' court of appeals judicial review under the Administrative \nProcedures Act. This was the same structure as all other employment \nanti-reprisal or anti-discrimination statutes. In 1982, the Federal \nCircuit was created, with a unique monopoly on appellate review of \ncivil service, patent and copyright, and International Trade Commission \ndecisions. Unfortunately, this experiment has failed. Our amendment \nrestores the normal process of balanced review. Hopefully, that will \nrestore normal respect for the legislative process.\n  In 1988, I was proud to introduce an appropriations rider to the \nTreasury, Postal and General Government bill which has been referred to \nas the ``anti-gag statute.'' It has survived constitutional challenge \nthrough the Supreme Court, and been unanimously approved in each of the \nlast 13 appropriations bills. This provision makes it illegal to \nenforce agency nondisclosure policies or agreements unless there is a \nspecific, express addendum informing employees that the disclosure \nrestrictions do not override their right to communicate with Congress \nunder the Lloyd Lafollette Act or other good government laws such as \nthe Whistleblower Protection Act.\n  The provision originally was in response to a new, open-ended concept \ncalled ``classifiable.'' That term was defined as any information that \n``could or should have been classified,'' or ``virtually anything,'' \neven if it were not market secret. This effectively ended anonymous \nwhistleblowing disclosures, imposed blanket prior restraint, and \nlegalized after-the-fact classification as a device to cover up fraud \nor misconduct. Since employees no longer were entitled to prior notice \nthat information was secret, the only way they could act safely was a \nprior inquiry to the agency whether information was classified. That \nwas a neat structure to lock in secrecy when its only purpose is to \nthwart congressional or public oversight. I am proud that the anti-gag \nstatute has worked, and the strange concept of ``classifiable'' is \nhistory. After 13 years and over 6,000 individual congressional votes \nwithout dissent, it is time to institutionalize this merit system \nprinciple.\n  It should be beyond debate that the price of liberty is eternal \nvigilance. I want to recognize the efforts of those whose stamina \ndefending freedom of speech has applied that principle in practice. \nSenator Levin has been my Senate partner from the beginning of \nlegislative initiatives on this issue. His leadership has proved that \nwhistleblower protection is not an issue reserved for conservatives or \nliberals, Democrats or Republicans. Like the First Amendment, \nwhistleblower protection is a cornerstone right for Americans.\n  Nongovernmental organizations have made significant contributions as \nwell. The Government Accountability Project, a non-profit, non-partisan \nwhistleblower support group, has been a relentless watchdog of merit \nsystem whistleblower rights since they were created by statute in 1978. \nThanks to GAP, my staff has not been taken by surprise as judicial \nactivism threatened this good government law. Kris Kolesnick, formerly \nwith my staff and now with the National Whistleblower Center, worked on \nthe original legislation while on my staff and continues to work in \npartnership with me.\n  In the decade since Congress unanimously passed this law, it has been \na Taxpayer Protection Act. My office has been privileged to work with \npublic servants who exposed indefensible waste and mismanagement at the \nPentagon, as well as indefensible abuses of power at the Department of \nJustice. I keep learning that whistleblowers proceed at their own risk \nwhen defending the public. In case after case I have seen the proof of \nAdmiral Rickover's insight that unlike God, the bureaucracy does not \nforgive. Nor does it forget.\n  It also has been confirmed repeatedly that whistleblowers must prove \ntheir commitment to stamina and persistence in order to make a \ndifference\n\n[[Page S5975]]\n\nagainst ingrained fraud, waste and abuse. There should be no question \nabout Congress', or this Senator's commitment. Congress was serious \nwhen it passed the Whistleblower Protection Act unanimously. It is not \nmere window dressing. As long as whistleblowers are defending the \npublic, we must defend credible free speech rights for genuine \nwhistleblowers. Those who have something to hide, the champions of \nsecrecy, cannot outlast or defeat the right to know both for Congress, \nlaw enforcement agencies and the taxpayers. Every time judicial or \nbureaucratic activists attempt to kill this law, we must revive it in \nstronger terms. Congress can not watch passively as this law is gutted, \nor tolerate gaping holes in the shield protecting public servants. The \ntaxpayers are on the other side of the shield, with the whistleblowers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the October 13, 1999 \narticle from The Washington Times and the May 1, 1999 article from The \nNew York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 13, 1999]\n\n                         Silent Whistleblowers\n\n\n                  worker protections are under attack\n\n               (By Tom Devine and Martin Edwin Anderson)\n\n       Judicial activism is always suspect, but when it overturns \n     laws protecting the public's interest in order to shield \n     bureaucratic secrecy, it makes a mockery of the legal system \n     itself.\n       The issue has become a front-burner in Congress as it takes \n     a new look at a significant good-government law that twice \n     won unanimous passage. In the aftermath of extremist judicial \n     activism that functionally overturned the statute, a crucial \n     campaign has been launched this week on the Hill to enlist \n     members as friends of the court in a brief seeking Supreme \n     Court review of the circuit court decision.\n       At issue is a ruling made final in July by the Federal \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, which disingenuously overturned two \n     laws unanimously passed by Congress--the code of Ethics for \n     Government Service and the Whistleblower Protection Act. The \n     decision, White vs. Lachance, was the handiwork of a chief \n     judge whose previous job involved swinging the ax against \n     federal workers who dared to commit the truth.\n       At issue is the fate of Air Force whistleblower John White, \n     who lost his job in 1991 after successfully challenging a \n     pork-barrel ``quality management'' training program as \n     mismanagement. Government and private sector experts \n     concurred with Mr. White, and universities affected by it \n     began heading for the door. Even the Air Force agreed, \n     canceling it after outside experts agreed with Mr. White.\n       Thrice the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), an \n     independent federal agency, ruled in Mr. White's favor. Each \n     time the Justice Department appealed on technicalities. Now \n     the federal court went further than asked while speculating \n     that Mr. White's disclosures may not have evidenced a \n     ``reasonable belief''--the test for disclosures to be \n     protected.\n       The court camouflaged its death-knell for the whistleblower \n     law in banal legalese, defining ``reasonable belief'' as, \n     ``Could a disinterested observer with knowledge of the \n     essential facts reasonably conclude gross mismanagement?'' \n     But the bland explanatory guidance exposed a feudalistic duty \n     of loyalty to shield misconduct by bureaucratic bosses: \n     ``Policymakers have every right to expect loyal, professional \n     service from subordinates.'' So much for the Code of Ethics \n     for Government Service, which establishes the fundamental \n     duty of federal employees to ``put loyalty to the highest \n     moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, \n     party or Government department.''\n       The court also disarmed the whistleblower law, claiming it \n     ``is not a weapon in arguments over policy.'' Yet when it \n     unanimously approved 1994 amendments, Congress explicitly \n     instructed, ``A protected disclosure may concern policy or \n     individual misconduct.''\n       Worse was a court-ordered ``review'' as a prerequisite to \n     find a ``reasonable belief'' of wrongdoing. It must begin \n     with the ``presumption that public officers perform their \n     duties correctly, fairly, in good faith and in accordance \n     with the law. . . . [T]his presumption stands unless there is \n     `irrefragable' proof to the contrary.''\n       ``Irrefragable,'' according to Webster's Dictionary, means \n     ``incapable of being overthrown, incontestable, undeniable, \n     incontrovertible.'' The court's decision kills freedom of \n     speech if there are two rational sides to a dispute--leaving \n     it easier to convict a criminal than for a whistleblower to \n     be eligible for protection. The irrefragable presumption of \n     government perfection creates a thick shield protecting big \n     government abuses--precisely the opposite of why the law was \n     passed.\n       Finally, the court ordered the MSPB to facilitate routine \n     illegality by seeking evidence of a whistleblower's conflict \n     of interest during every review. Retaliatory investigations--\n     those taken ``because of'' whistleblowing activities--are \n     tantamount to witch-hunts and were outlawed by Congress in \n     1994. For federal employees, the Big Brother of George \n     Orwell's ``1984'' has arrived 15 years late.\n       Key to understanding the decision is the role played by \n     Chief Judge Robert Mayer. Previously, Judge Mayer served as \n     deputy special counsel in an era when MSPB's Office of \n     Special Counsel (under its Chief Alex Kozinski, now a 9th \n     Circuit Court of Appeals judge) tutored managers and taught \n     courses on how to fire whistleblowers without leaving \n     fingerprints. Congress passed the WPA in part to deal with \n     these abuses.\n       Now Judge Mayer's judicial revenge is a near-perfect \n     gambit, as his court has a virtual monopoly on judicial \n     review of MSPB whistleblower decisions.\n       Congress must act quickly to pass a legislative definition \n     of ``reasonable belief'' that eliminates the certainty of \n     professional suicide for whistleblowers and restores the \n     law's good-government mandate. It also needs to provide \n     federal workers the same legal access enjoyed by private \n     citizens; jury trials and all circuits judicial review in the \n     appeals courts.\n       It is unrealistic to expect federal workers with second-\n     class rights to provide first-class public service. Returning \n     federal workers to the Dark Ages is an inauspicious way to \n     usher in a new millennium.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 1, 1999]\n\n                    Helping Whistle-Blowers Survive\n\n       Jennifer Long, the Internal Revenue Service agent who \n     nearly lost her job two weeks ago after publicly blowing the \n     whistle on abuses at the agency, was rescued at the last \n     minute by the intervention of an influential United States \n     Senator. But the fact that her employers had no inhibitions \n     about harassing her is clear evidence that the laws \n     protecting whistle-blowers need to be strengthened. As they \n     stand, these laws merely invite the kind of retaliation that \n     Mrs. Long endured.\n       A career tax auditor, Mrs. Long was the star witness at \n     Senate Finance Committee hearings convened in 1997 by William \n     Roth of Delaware to investigate complaints against the I.R.S. \n     She was the only I.R.S. witness who did not sit behind a \n     curtain and use a voice distortion device to hide her \n     identity. She accused the agency of preying on weaker \n     taxpayers and ignoring cheating by those with the resources \n     to fight back. She has since said that she was subject to \n     petty harassments from the moment she arrived back at her \n     district office in Houston. Then, on April 15 of this year, \n     she was given what amounted to a termination notice, at which \n     point Mr. Roth intervened with the I.R.S. commissioner and \n     saved her job--at least for now.\n       Had he not intervened, Mrs. Long's only hope of vindication \n     would have been the remedies provided by the Civil Service \n     Reform Act of 1978 and the Whistle-Blower Protection Act of \n     1989. These two statutes prescribe a tortuous and uncertain \n     appeals process that in theory guarantees a whistle-blower \n     free speech without fear of retaliation, but in practice is \n     an exercise in frustration. Despite recent improvements, only \n     a handful of Federal employees, out of some 1,500 who \n     appealed in the last four years, have prevailed in rulings \n     issued by the Government's administrative tribunal, the Merit \n     System Protection Board. Overwhelmingly, the rest of the \n     cases were screened out on technical grounds or were settled \n     informally with token relief.\n       A few prominent whistle-blowers have won redemption outside \n     the system. Frederic Whitehurst, the chemist who was \n     dismissed after disclosing sloppiness and possible dishonesty \n     in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's crime laboratory, \n     won a sizable cash settlement because he had a first-class \n     attorney who mounted an artful public relations campaign. \n     Ernest Fitzgerald, the Pentagon employee who disclosed \n     massive cost overruns, survived because he was almost \n     inhumanly persistent and because his cause, like Mrs. Long's, \n     attracted allies in high places. But the prominence of an \n     issue does not guarantee survival for the employee who \n     discloses it. Notra Trulock, the senior intelligence official \n     at the Energy Department who tried to alert his superiors to \n     Chinese espionage at a Government weapons laboratory, has \n     since been demoted.\n       Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, has been \n     seeking ways to strengthen the 1989 law with the help of the \n     Government Accountability Project, a Washington advocacy \n     group that assists whistle-blowers. One obvious improvement \n     would be to give whistle-blowers the option to press their \n     claims in the Federal courts, where their cases could be \n     decided by a jury. To guard against clogging the system with \n     frivolous litigation, the cases would first be reviewed by a \n     nongovernment administrative panel. But the point is to give \n     whistle-blowers an avenue of appeal outside the closed loop \n     in which they are now trapped.\n       A reform bill along these lines passed the House in 1994 \n     but died in the Senate. With Mrs. Long's case fresh in mind, \n     the time has come for both Houses to re-examine the issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 996.

Carson Army Base, Peterson Air Force Base, and Shriever \nAir Force Base. There are over 30,000 active duty and reserve military \npersonnel in the city. There are nearly 23,000 retired personnel in the \n5th Congressional District, which is based around Colorado Springs, the \nthird largest DoD retired community in any Congressional District in \nthe country. There is, however, no National Military Cemetery.\n  The bill I am introducing today is a companion piece to legislation \nintroduced in the House by my friend and colleague, Joel Hefley. At my \nannual town meeting in El Paso County on June 1, I discussed this \nmatter with my constituents. There are many of them who feel strongly \nthat a cemetery is needed and I agree. This bill will allow the \nthousands of eligible Colorado Springs military personnel, both active \nduty and retired, to have a chance to find their final resting place in \nthe city so many of them love.\n  I am aware that the Veterans Administration is not known for prompt \nand easy cemetery construction. I am aware that there are some areas of \nthe country deemed to have cemetery needs more critical than Colorado \nSprings. But I do not think that should mean that the people of \nColorado Springs are denied the ability to chose a cemetery for \nthemselves and their loved ones that properly honors their \ncontributions to the nation.\n  I look forward to working on this bill and seeing its eventual \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 997. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct \nresearch, monitoring, management, treatment, and outreach activities \nrelating to sudden oak death syndrome and to establish a Sudden Oak \nDeath Syndrome Advisory Committee; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill that \naddresses an emerging ecological crisis in California that quite \nliterally threatens to change the face of my State, and perhaps others.\n  California's beloved oak trees are in grave peril. Thousands of black \noak, coastal live oak, tan and Shreve's oak trees, among the most \nfamiliar and best loved features of California's landscape are dying \nfrom a newly discovered disease known as Sudden Oak Death Syndrome, \nSODS.\n  Caused by an exotic species of the Phytophthora fungus, the fungus \nresponsible for the Irish potato famine, SODS first struck a small \nnumber of tan oaks in Marin County in 1995. Now the disease has spread \nto other oak species from Big Sur in the south to Humboldt County in \nthe north. In Marin, Monterey and Santa Cruz counties, desperate local \nofficials are predicting oak mortality rates of 70 to 90 percent unless \nthe deadly fungus is eradicated or its spread is arrested.\n  The loss of trees is fast approaching epidemic proportions, with tens \nof thousands of dead trees appearing in thousands of acres of forests, \nparks, and gardens. As the trees die, enormous expanses of forest, some \nadjacent to residential areas, are subject to extreme fire hazards. \nResidents who built their homes around or among oak trees are in \nparticular danger.\n  Sudden Oak Death Syndrome is already having serious economic and \nenvironmental impacts. Both Oregon and Canada have imposed quarantines \non the importation of oak products and some nursery stock from \nCalifornia. According to the U.S. Forest Service, removal of dead trees \ncan cost $2,000 or more apiece, and loss of oaks can reduce property \nvalues by 3 percent or more. In Marin County alone, tree removal and \nadditional fire fighting needs are expected to cost over $6 million.\n  Nor is the spread of the Phytophthora fungus limited to oak trees. \nThe fungus has also been found on rhododendron plants in California \nnurseries, on bay and madrone trees, and on wild huckleberry plants. \nDue to genetic similarities, this fungus potentially endangers Red and \nPin oak trees on the East coast as well as the Northeast's lucrative \ncommercial blueberry and cranberry industries.\n  If left unchecked, SODS could also cause a broad and severe \necological crisis, with major damage to biodiversity, wildlife habitat, \nwater supplies, forest productivity, and hillside stability. \nCalifornia's oak woodlands provide shelter, habitat and food to over \n300 wildlife species. They reduce soil erosion. They help moderate \nextremes in temperature. And, they aid with nutrient cycling, which \nensures that organic matter is broken down and made available for use \nby other living organisms.\n  Very little is known about this new species of Phytophthora fungus. \nScientists are struggling to better understand Sudden Oak Death \nSyndrome, how the disease is transmitted, and what the best treatment \noptions might be. The U.S. Forest Service, the University of \nCalifornia, the State Departments of Forestry and Fire Protection, and \nCounty Agricultural Commissioners have created an Oak Mortality Task \nForce in an attempt to half SODS's frightening march across California \nand into adjoining states.\n  The Task Force has established a series of objectives leading to the \nelimination of SODS, but very little can be accomplished without \nadequate support for ongoing research, monitoring, treatment and \neducation.\n  In September of last year, I called on the Department of Agriculture, \nUSDA, to provide financial assistance and to create its own task force \nto work with California's Oak Mortality Task Force. Outgoing \nAgriculture Secretary Dan Glickman answered the call by releasing $2.1 \nmillion in emergency funding and establishing a top-flight task force \nunder the direction of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection \nService, APHIS. This was a good first step, but it was just that.\n  That is why I am introducing today the Sudden Oak Death Syndrome \nControl Act of 2001. This legislation would authorize over $14 million \neach year for the next five years in critically needed funding to fight \nthe SODS epidemic. Combined with the efforts of state and local \nofficials, this legislation will help to prevent the dire predictions \nfrom becoming a terrible reality.\n  This bill is endorsed by the California Oak Mortality Task Force, the \nMarin County Board of Supervisors, the Trust for Public Land, \nCalifornia Releaf, and the International Society of Arboriculturists, \nWestern Chapter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 997\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the availability of oral health services by \nstrengthening the dental workforce in designated underserved areas; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend and \ncolleague from Wisconsin, Senator Russ Feingold, in introducing \nlegislation to improve access to oral health care by strengthening the \ndental workforce in our Nation's rural and underserved communities.\n  Oral and general health are inseparable, and good dental care is \ncritical to our overall physical health and well-being. Dental health \nencompasses far more than cavities and gum disease. The recent U.S. \nSurgeon General report Oral Health in America states that ``the mouth \nacts as a mirror of health and disease'' that can help diagnose \ndisorders such as diabetes, leukemia, heart disease, or anemia.\n  While oral health in America has improved dramatically over the last \n50 years, these improvements have not occurred evenly across all \nsectors of our population, particularly among low-income individuals \nand families. Too many Americans today lack access to dental care. \nWhile there are clinically proven techniques to prevent or delay the \nprogression of dental health problems, an estimated 25 million \nAmericans live in areas lacking adequate dental services. As a \nconsequence, these effective treatment and prevention programs are not \nbeing implemented in many of our communities. Astoundingly, as many as \neleven percent of our Nation's rural population has never been to the \ndentist.\n  This situation is exacerbated by the fact that our dental workforce \nis graying and the overall ratio of dentists to population is \ndeclining. In Maine, there currently are 393 active dentists, 241 of \nwhom are 45 or older. More than 20 percent of dentists nationwide will \nretire in the next ten years and the number of dental graduates by 2015 \nmay not be enough to replace these retirees.\n  As a consequence, Maine, like many States, is currently facing a \nserious shortage of dentists, particularly in rural areas. While there \nis one general practice dentist for every 2,286 people in the Portland \narea, the numbers drop off dramatically in western and northern Maine. \nIn Aroostook County, where I'm from, there's only one dentist for every \n5,507 people. Moreover, at a time when tooth decay is the most \nprevalent childhood disease in America, Maine has fewer than ten \nspecialists in pediatric dentistry, and most of these are located in \nthe southern part of the State.\n  This dental workforce shortage is exacerbated by the fact that Maine \ncurrently does not have a dental school or even a dental residency \nprogram. Dental schools can provide a critical safety net for the oral \nhealth needs of a state, and dental education clinics can provide the \nsurrounding communities with care that otherwise would be unavailable \nto disadvantaged and underinsured populations. Maine is just one of a \nnumber of predominantly rural States that lacks this important \ncomponent of a dental safety net.\n\n  Maine, like many States, is exploring a number of innovative ideas \nfor increasing access to dental care in underserved areas. In an effort \nto supplement and encourage these efforts, we\n\n[[Page S5978]]\n\nare introducing legislation today to establish a new State grant \nprogram designed to improve access to oral health services in rural and \nunderserved areas. The legislation authorizes $50 million over five \nyears for grants to States to help them develop innovative dental \nworkforce development programs specific to their individual needs.\n  States could use these grants to fund a wide variety of programs. For \nexample, they could use the funds for loan forgiveness and repayment \nprograms for dentists practicing in underserved ares. They could also \nuse them to provide grants and low- or no-interest loans to help \npractitioners to establish or expand practices in these underserved \nareas. States, like Maine, that do not have a dental school could use \nthe funds to establish a dental residency program. Other States might \nwant to use the grant funding to establish or expand community or \nschool-based dental facilities or to set up mobile or portable dental \nclinics.\n  To assist in their recruitment and retention efforts, States could \nalso use the funds for placement and support of dental students, \nresidents, and advanced dentistry trainees. Or, they could use the \ngrant funds for continuing dental education, including distance-based \neducation, and practice support through teledentistry.\n  Other programs that could be funded through the grants include: \ncommunity-based prevention services such as water fluoridation and \ndental sealant programs; school programs to encourage children to go \ninto oral health or science professions; the establishment or expansion \nof a State dental office to coordinate oral health and access issues; \nand any other activities that are determined to be appropriate by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n  The National Health Service Corps is helping to meet the oral health \nneeds of underserved communities by placing dentists and dental \nhygienists in some of America's most difficult-to-place inner city, \nrural, and frontier areas. Unfortunately, however, the number of \ndentists and dental hygienists with obligations to serve in the \nNational Health Service Corps falls far short of meeting the total \nidentified need. According to the Surgeon General, only about 6 percent \nof the dental need in America's rural and underserved communities is \ncurrently being met by the National Health Service Corps.\n\n  In my state, approximately 173,000 Mainers live in designated dental \nhealth professional shortage areas. While the National Health Service \nCorps estimates that it will take 33 dental clinicians to meet this \nneed, it currently has only three serving in my State.\n  The bill we are introducing today would make some needed improvements \nin this critically important program so that it can better respond to \nour nation's oral health needs.\n  First, it would direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ndevelop and implement a plan for increasing the participation of \ndentists and dental hygienists in the National Health Service Corps \nscholarship and loan repayment programs.\n  It would also allow National Health Service Corps scholarship and \nloan repayment program recipients to fulfill their commitment on a \npart-time basis. Many small rural communities may not have sufficient \npopulations to support a full-time dentist or dental hygienist. This \nwould give the National Health Service Corps additional flexibility to \nmeet the needs of these communities. Moreover, some practitioners may \nfind part-time service more attractive, which in turn could improve \nboth recruitment and retention in these communities.\n  Last year, after a six-year hiatus, the National Health Service Corps \nbegan a two-year pilot program to award scholarships to dental \nstudents. While this is a step in the right direction, these \nscholarships are only being awarded to students attending certain \ndental schools, none of which are in New England. Moreover, the pilot \nproject requires the participating dental schools to encourage Corps \ndental scholars to practice in communities near their educational \ninstitutions. As a consequence, this program will do nothing to help \nrelieve the dental shortage in Maine and other areas of New England.\n  The bill we are introducing today would address this problem by \nexpanding the National Health Service Corps Pilot Scholarship Program \nso that dental students attending any of the 55 U.S. dental schools can \napply and require that placements for these scholars be based strictly \non community need.\n  It would also improve the process for designating dental health \nprofessional shortage areas and ensure that the criteria for making \nsuch designations provides a more accurate reflection of oral health \nneed, particularly in rural areas.\n  Mr. President, the Dental Health Improvement Act will make critically \nimportant oral health care services more accessible in our Nation's \nrural and underserved communities, and I urge all of my colleagues to \nsign on as cosponsors. I also ask unanimous consent that letters \nendorsing the bill from the American Dental Association and the \nAmerican Dental Education Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                  American Dental Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washingtion, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the American Dental \n     Association and our 144,000 member dentists, I am delighted \n     to endorse the ``Dental Health Improvement Act,'' which you \n     introduced today. The Association is proud that the oral \n     health of Americans continues to improve, and that Americans \n     have access to the best oral health care in the world.\n       Having said that, we agree that dental care has not reached \n     every corner of American society to the extent it has reached \n     the majority of Americans. For those Americans who are unable \n     to pay for care, and those with special needs, such as \n     disabled individuals, those with congenital conditions, and \n     non-ambulatory patients, obtaining dental care can be \n     difficult.\n       Your legislation recognizes several of these problems and \n     goes a long way towards addressing them in a targeted and \n     meaningful way. The section on grant proposals offers states \n     the opportunity to be innovative in their approaches to \n     address specific geographical dental workforce issues. You \n     recognize the need to provide incentives to increase faculty \n     recruitment in accredited dental training institutions, and \n     your support for increasing loan repayment and scholarship \n     programs will provide the appropriate incentives to increase \n     the dental workforce in ``safety net'' organizations.\n       The ADA is very grateful for your leadership on these \n     issues. Thank you for introducing this legislation. We want \n     to continue to work with you on dental access issues in \n     general and on this legislation as it moves through the \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Robert M. Anderton,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   American Dental\n\n\n                                        Education Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2001.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins, I am writing on behalf of the dental \n     education community to commend you for developing and \n     introducing the Dental Health Improvement Act. This \n     legislation, when enacted into law, will expand the \n     availability of oral health care services for the nation's \n     underserved populations, strengthen the dental workforce, as \n     well as maintain the ability of dental schools to produce the \n     necessary manpower to provide oral health care to all \n     Americans.\n       The American Dental Education Association (ADEA) represents \n     the nation's 55 dental schools, as well as hospital-based \n     dental and advanced dental education programs, allied dental \n     programs and schools, dental research institutions, and the \n     faculty and students at these institutions. ADEA's member \n     schools are dedicated to providing the highest quality \n     education to their students, conducting research and \n     providing oral health care services to Americans from \n     medically unserved and underserved areas, the majority of \n     whom are uninsured or who are from low-income families. \n     Recent downward trends in student enrollment and a growing \n     shortage in dental faculty have caused ADEA serious concern \n     about our ability to fully and competently address these \n     responsibilities.\n       Therefore, I was delighted to see that the Dental Health \n     Improvement Act directly responds to many of these concerns. \n     If implemented, the Act would expand access to oral health \n     care to thousands of Americans for the first time. When \n     enacted, the provisions of the bill can be instrumental in \n     helping the more than 31 million Americans living in areas \n     that lack access to adequate oral health care services. It \n     can provide much needed help to dental education institutions \n     as we seek to address faculty shortages.\n       As you know, dental education institutions face a major \n     crisis in the graying of its faculty which threatens the \n     quality of dental education, oral, dental and craniofacial \n     research, and ultimately will adversely impact the health of \n     all Americans. Currently, there are approximately 400 faculty \n     vacancies. Retirements are expected to accelerate in both\n\n[[Page S5979]]\n\n     private practice as well as teaching faculties in the \n     nation's 55 dental schools. There is a significant decrease \n     in the number of men and women choosing careers in dentistry, \n     teaching and research. Your personal experience in Maine is a \n     perfect example.\n       Educational debt has increased, affecting both career \n     choices and practice location. Your bill will provide funds \n     to help with recruitment and retention efforts and helps \n     expand dental residency training programs to the 27 states \n     that do not currently have dental schools.\n       Also important are the incentives you have proposed to \n     expand or establish community-based dental facilities linked \n     with dental education institutions. The need for this is \n     obvious. More than two-thirds of patients visiting dental \n     school clinics are members of families whose annual income is \n     estimated to be $15,000 or below. About half of these \n     patients are on Medicare or Medicaid, while more than a third \n     have no insurance coverage or government assistance program \n     to help them pay for their dental care.\n       Dental academic institutions are committed to their patient \n     care mission, not only by improving the management and \n     efficiency of patient centered care delivery at the dental \n     school, but through increasing affiliations with and use of \n     satellite clinics. All dental schools maintain at least one \n     dental clinic on-site, and approximately 70% of U.S. dental \n     schools have school sponsored satellite clinics. Delivering \n     patient care in diverse settings demonstrates professional \n     responsibility to the oral health of the public.\n       Dental schools and other academic dental institutions \n     provide oral health care to underserved and disadvantaged \n     populations. Yet more than 11 percent of the nation's rural \n     population has never been to see a dentist. This bill can \n     have a positive impact on the population by establishing \n     access to oral health care at community based dental \n     facilities and consolidated health center that are linked to \n     dental schools. 100 million Americans presently do not have \n     access to fluoridated water. The bill provides for community-\n     based prevention services such as fluoride and sealants that \n     can cause a dramatic change for nearly a third of the \n     nations's population.\n       Thank you again for taking such a leadership role in the \n     area of oral health. Please be assured that ADEA looks \n     forward to working closely with you to bring the far-reaching \n     potential of the Dental Health improvement Act to fruition.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Richard W. Valachovic,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 999. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for \na Korea Defense Service Medal to be issued to members of the Armed \nForces who participated in operations in Korea after the end of the \nKorean War; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my esteemed colleague, \nSenator Pat Roberts of Kansas, to introduce a bill that would award the \nKorean Defense Service Medal to all members of the Armed Forces who \nparticipated in operations in Korea after the end of the Korean War. \nFifty years ago, American men and women were fighting a very tough war \nin Korea. We commemorate their heroism in many ways half a century \nlater, and pause at the beautiful memorial to those who served in that \nconflict located here in Washington. That war and those heroes, \nhowever, are only the first part of the story. The rest of the story is \nabout the more than 40,000 members of the United States armed forces \nwho have served in Korea since the signing of the cease-fire agreement \nin July 1953.\n  Technically speaking, North and South Korea remain at war to this \nday, and during the intervening cease fire, the uncertain ``peace'' has \nbeen challenged many many times. According to statistics I have read, \nthe North Koreans have breached the cease-fire agreement more than \n40,000 times since 1954 using virtually every method of limited attacks \nyou could think of. Some 1,239 U.S. service personnel have been killed \nin Korea during the past 47 years; 87 have been captured, held \nprisoner, and in many cases, tortured.\n  During the past five decades, our service men and women in Korea have \nperformed their duties in a virtual tinderbox waiting for a match. \nThere is no question about the danger of their assignment. Some 70 \npercent of North Korea's active military force, including about 700,000 \ntroops, more than 8,000 artillery systems, and 2000 tanks are within 90 \nmiles of the Demilitarized Zone, DMZ. Military experts estimate that a \nmassive North Korean attack could overrun South Korea's capital at \nSeoul in a matter of hours or days. A potential frontal assault by \nNorth Korean troops would have the backing of more than 500 short range \nballistic missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction in \naddition to conventional warheads.\n  It is amazing to me to have discovered that despite all of these \nfacts, the Department of Defense has not awarded service awards to \nthose who served in Korea during the Cold War. It should be noted that \nthere have been more casualties in Korea since 1954 that in Sinai, \nGrenada, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, and Kuwait, and yet \nservice awards have been presented to participants in each of those \noperations, but not to those who have served in Korea. General Thomas \nSchwartz, current Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Forces Korea has \nrecognized this injustice and supports the award I am proposing today.\n  Representative Elton Gallegly from California introduced this bill in \nthe House recently, and I am honored to do so here in the Senate. I \nurge my colleagues to join with me to attain swift passage of this \nmeasure which is a long overdue expression of recognition and gratitude \nto the thousands of American men and women in uniform who have put \ntheir lives literally on the front line for peace and freedom.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Kerry, and Mr. Corzine).\n  S. 1000. A bill to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nAct of 1990 to provide incentive grants to improve the quality of child \ncare; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Care \nQuality Incentive Act of 2001, which seeks to provide incentive grants \nto improve the quality of child care in this country.\n  The child care system in this country is in crisis; the need for \naffordable and accessible high quality child care far exceeds the \nsupply.\n  As long as an estimated 14 million children under age six, including \nsix million infants and toddlers, spend some part of every day in child \ncare, the availability of quality programs and settings will continue \nto be a serious issue facing this Nation.\n  With full-day child care costing as much as $4,000 to $10,000 per \nyear, per child, and with Federal assistance severely limited, many \nworking families cannot afford quality child care. For low-income \nfamilies with young children, the cost of child care can consume \nanywhere from 25 to 45 percent of their monthly income.\n  And the demand for all types of child care is likely to increase, as \nmaternal employment continues to rise, as well as the need to meet the \nrequirements of welfare reform. At the same time the need for care is \ngrowing, we must focus on the quality of care provided for our \nchildren.\n  Many studies, including research findings from the National Institute \nfor Child Health and Development, show that quality early care and \neducation leads to increased cognitive abilities, positive classroom \nlearning behavior, an increased likelihood of long-term school success, \nand consequently, a greater likelihood of long-term and social self-\nsufficiency.\n  High quality child care not only prepares children for school, it \nhelps them succeed in life. We must therefore be more diligent in our \nefforts to improve the quality of child care in this country.\n  Quality of care means providing a safe, healthy environment for our \nchildren; well-trained providers; good staff-to-child ratios so staff \ncan interact with the children in a developmental setting; low staff \nturnover that fosters a sense of security for the children; and age-\nappropriate activities that enhance learning.\n  When we look at the quality of our current system, the findings are \nappalling. A study of Federal, nonprofit, for-profit, and in-home child \ncare settings conducted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission \nfound that two-thirds of these child care settings had at least one \nmajor safety hazard. The study documented at least 56 deaths among \nchildren in child care settings since 1990, and reported that in 1997, \n31,000 children ages four and younger received emergency room treatment \nfor injuries in child care centers or schools.\n\n[[Page S5980]]\n\n  Another study in four States found that only 1 in 7 child care \ncenters provide care that promotes healthy development, while 1 in 8 \nchild care centers provide care that actually threatens the safety and \nhealth of children.\n  The results of a very recent study conducted by the Center for the \nChild Care Workforce are also startling. It finds that the child care \nindustry is losing well-educated teaching staff and administrators at \nan alarming rate and hiring replacement teachers with less training and \neducation.\n  This study, conducted over a six-year period from 1994 to 2000, found \nthat 76 percent of the teaching staff employed in the centers surveyed \nin 1996, and 82 percent of those working in the centers in 1994 were no \nlonger on the job in 2000. And of those teaching staff who left, nearly \nhalf had completed a bachelor's degree, compared to only one-third of \nthe new teachers who replaced them.\n\n  Furthermore, the study found that director turnover rates were \nexceedingly high, contributing to staff instability. Teaching staff and \ndirectors reported that high turnover among their colleagues negatively \naffected their ability to do their jobs.\n  We frequently hear of the critical shortage of qualified elementary \nand secondary school teachers. In contrast, the staffing crisis in \nearly care barely registers in the public awareness, but is equally \nimportant and worthy of our attention.\n  The inability of many child care centers to offer competitive \nsalaries is a serious obstacle to attracting and retaining qualified \nstaff. Despite recognition that higher wages contribute to greater \nstaff stability, compensation for the majority of teaching positions \nhas not kept pace with the cost of living over the last six years.\n  Wages, when adjusted for inflation, have actually decreased six \npercent for day care teaching staff, and K-12 teachers earn up to twice \nas much as child care providers with equivalent education and \nexperience. At present, there is little economic incentive to begin or \ncontinue a career in child care.\n  Researchers have consistently found that the cornerstone of quality \nchild care is the presence of sensitive, consistent, well-trained and \nwell-compensated caregivers. Yet many centers are unable to provide \nchildren with even this most essential component of early care.\n  This high rate of safety hazards and unstable workforce results \nsignificantly from low payment or reimbursement rates for the provision \nof child care. Prior to October 1996, states were required to make \npayments to (or subsidize) child care providers based on the 75th \npercentile of the market rate, or the level at which parents can afford \n75 out of 100 local providers.\n  However, with the passage of welfare reform legislation, this \nrequirement, which had not been effectively enforced in the first \nplace, completely vanished. Currently, federal Child Care Development \nFund regulations require states to conduct market rate surveys every \nother year, but there is no requirement for States to actually use the \nmarket rate surveys to set payment rates.\n  Indeed, according to a February 1998 report by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, 29 out of the 50 States and the District of \nColumbia did not make payment rates that were based on the 75th \npercentile of the current market rate, often asserting that budget \nconstraints prevented them from doing so.\n  Furthermore, a January 1998 General Accounting Office report noted \nthat while states conduct biennial market surveys, some set \nreimbursement rates based on older surveys. And when States set \nreimbursement rates significantly lower than actual costs, child care \nchoices for families become severely limited.\n  When States set low rates or fail to update rates, they force working \nfamilies into a difficult dilemma, they must either place their \nchildren into lower cost, lower quality child care programs that will \naccept the State subsidy or come up with extra dollars to supplement \nthe State subsidy and buy better quality child care.\n  The Children's Defense Fund, in a March 1998 report entitled, \n``Locked Doors: States Struggling to Meet the Child Care Needs of Low-\nIncome Working Families,'' noted that when rates are set below the \nmarket rate, child care providers are forced to cut corners ``in ways \nthat lower the quality of care for children.''\n  And when rates fall below the real cost of providing care, child care \nproviders who do not choose to reduce staff or lower salaries and \nbenefits, allow physical conditions to deteriorate, forgo educational \nbook, toy, and equipment purchases, may simply not accept children with \nsubsidies, or may go out of business. These dilemmas can be avoided if \nwe help States set payment rates that keep up with the market.\n  Recently, Rhode Island and many other States celebrated the sixth \nannual national Provider Appreciation Day, which presented us with an \nopportunity to honor one of the most under-recognized and under-\ncompensated professions. I am therefore pleased to be joined by Senator \nChris Dodd, a leader in improving child care, along with Senators \nKennedy, Murray, Kerry, and Corzine in introducing the Child Care \nQuality Incentive Act, which seeks to redouble our child care efforts \nand renew the child care partnership with the states by providing \nincentive funding for States to increase payment rates.\n  Our legislation establishes a new, mandatory pool of funding under \nthe Child Care and Development Block Grant, CCDBG. This new funding, \ncoupled with mandatory, current market rate surveys, will form the \nfoundation for significant increases in state payment rates for the \nprovision of quality child care.\n  Increasing payment rates for the provision of child care is the key \nto quality. Better payment rates lead to higher quality child care as \nchild care providers are able to attract and retain qualified staff, \nmaintain a safe and healthy environment, and purchase age-appropriate \neducational materials.\n  At the same time, increased payment rates expand the number of \nchoices parents have in finding quality child care, as providers are \nable to accept children whose parents had previously been unable to \nafford the cost of care.\n  While there is currently money available through the CCDBG that may \nbe spent for quality initiatives, most states opt to expand \navailability of care rather than focus on quality. This bill allows \nfunding to be used only for quality initiatives.\n  We have received overwhelming support for this bill from the child \ncare community, including endorsements from USA Child Care, the \nChildren's Defense Fund, Catholic Charities of USA, YMCA of USA, the \nNational Child Care Association, and a host of organizations and \nagencies across the country.\n  Children are the hope of America, and they need the best of America. \nWe cannot ask working families to choose between paying the rent, \nbuying food, and being able to afford the quality care their children \nneed. We've made a lot of progress in improving the health, safety, and \nwell-being of children in this country. But as we approach the 21st \ncentury, we need to do more. If we are serious about putting parents to \nwork and protecting children, we must invest more in child care help \nfor families.\n  Our youngest and most vulnerable citizens, our children, deserve \nbetter from us. I urge my colleagues to join Senators Dodd, Kennedy, \nMurray, Kerry, Corzine, and me in this endeavor to improve the quality \nof child care by cosponsoring the Child Care Quality Incentive Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1000\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Care Quality Incentive \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Recent research on early brain development reveals that \n     much of a child's growth is determined by early learning and \n     nurturing care. Research also shows that quality early care \n     and education leads to increased cognitive abilities, \n     positive classroom learning behavior, increased likelihood of \n     long-term school success, and greater\n\n[[Page S5981]]\n\n     likelihood of long-term economic and social self-sufficiency.\n       (2) Each day an estimated 13,000,000 children, including \n     6,000,000 infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day \n     in child care. However, a study in 4 States found that only 1 \n     in 7 child care centers provide care that promotes healthy \n     development, while 1 in 8 child care centers provide care \n     that threatens the safety and health of children.\n       (3) Full-day child care can cost $4,000 to $10,000 per \n     year.\n       (4) Although Federal assistance is available for child \n     care, funding is severely limited. Even with Federal \n     subsidies, many families cannot afford child care. For \n     families with young children and a monthly income under \n     $1,200, the cost of child care typically consumes 25 percent \n     of their income.\n       (5) Payment (or reimbursement) rates, which determine the \n     maximum the State will reimburse a child care provider for \n     the care of a child who receives a subsidy, are too low to \n     ensure that quality care is accessible to all families.\n       (6) Low payment rates directly affect the kind of care \n     children get and whether families can find quality child care \n     in their communities. In many instances, low payment rates \n     force child care providers to cut corners in ways that lower \n     the quality of care for children, including reducing number \n     of staff, eliminating staff training opportunities, and \n     cutting enriching educational activities and services.\n       (7) Children in low quality child care are more likely to \n     have delayed reading and language skills, and display more \n     aggression toward other children and adults.\n       (8) Increased payment rates lead to higher quality child \n     care as child care providers are able to attract and retain \n     qualified staff, provide salary increases and professional \n     training, maintain a safe and healthy environment, and \n     purchase basic supplies and developmentally appropriate \n     educational materials.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to improve the \n     quality of, and access to, child care by increasing child \n     care payment rates.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \ncertain provisions relating to the treatment of forestry activities; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Reforestation \nTax Credit Incentives Act of 2001, and I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Lincoln, Murkowski, Breaux, Hutchinson, Miller, Craig, \nLandrieu, Gordon Smith, and Collins.\n  The U.S. forest products industry is essential to the health of the \nU.S. economy. It employs approximately 1.5 million people, supports an \nannual payroll of $40.8 billion, and ranks among the top ten \nmanufacturing employers in 46 States. This includes the State of Maine \nwhere 89.2 percent of the land is forested. Without fair tax laws, \nfuture\n\n[[Page S5982]]\n\ngrowth in the industry will occur overseas and more and more landowners \nwill be forced to sell their land for some other higher economic value \nsuch as development. The loss of a healthy and strong forest products \nindustry will have a long-term negative impact on both the economy and \nthe environment.\n  The legislation I am introducing today partially restores the balance \nbetween corporate and private landowners in terms of capital gains tax \ntreatment, reducing the capital gains paid on timber for individuals \nand corporations. The bill is also intended to encourage the \nreforestation of timberland, whether it has been harvested or \npreviously cleared for other uses, such as agriculture.\n  Trees take a long time to grow, anywhere from 15 years to, more \ntypically in Maine, 40 to 50 years. During these years, the grower \nfaces huge risks from fire, pests, weather and inflation, all of which \nare uninsurable. This legislation helps to mitigate these risks by \nproviding a sliding scale reduction in the amount of taxable gain based \non the number of years the asset is held.\n  The bill would change the way that capital gains are calculated for \ntimber by taking the amount of the gain and subtracting three percent \nfor each year the timber was held. The reduction would be capped at 50 \npercent bringing the effective capital gains tax rate to 10 percent for \nnon-corporate holdings and 17.5 percent for corporations.\n  Since 1944, the tax code has treated timber as a capital asset, \nmaking it eligible for the capital gains tax rate rather than the \nordinary income tax rate. This recognized the long-term risk and \ninflationary gain in timber. In 1986, the capital gains tax was \nrepealed for all taxpayers. The 1997 tax bill reinstituted the lower \ncapital gains rate for individuals, but not for businesses. As a \nresult, individuals face a maximum capital gains rate of 20 percent, \nwhile businesses face a maximum rate of 35 percent for the identical \nasset.\n  As this difference in rates implies, private timberland owners \nreceive far more favorable capital gains tax treatment than corporate \nowners. In addition, pension funds and other tax-exempt entities are \nalso investing in timberland, which only further highlights the \ndisparity that companies face.\n  Secondly, reforestation expenses are currently taxed at a higher rate \nin the U.S. than in any other major competitor country. The U.S. \ndomestic forest products industry is already struggling to survive \nintense competition from the Southern Hemisphere where labor and fiber \ncosts are extremely low, and recent investments from wealthier nations \nwho have built state of the art pulp and papermaking facilities. While \nthere is little Congress can do to change labor and fiber costs, \nCongress does have the ability to level the playing field when it comes \nto taxation.\n  This legislation encourages both individuals and companies to engage \nin increased reforestation by allowing all growers of timber to receive \na tax credit. The legislation removes the current dollar limitation of \nthe $10,000 amount of reforestation expenses that are eligible for the \nten percent tax credit and that are allowed to be deducted, and \ndecreases from 7 to 5 years the amortization period over which these \nexpenses can be deducted.\n  Eligible reforestation expenses would be the initial expenses to \nestablish a new stand of trees, such as site preparation, the cost of \nthe seedlings, the labor costs required to plant the seedlings and to \ncare for the trees in the first few years, as well as the cost of \nequipment used in reforestation.\n  The planting of trees should be encouraged rather than discouraged by \nour tax system as trees provide a tremendous benefit to the \nenvironment, preventing soil erosion, cleansing streams and waterways, \nproviding habitat for numerous species, and absorbing carbon dioxide \nfrom the atmosphere, the major greenhouse gas causing climate change \naccording to the majority of renowned international scientists.\n  Tax incentives for planting on private lands will also decrease \npressure to obtain timber from ecologically sensitive public lands, \nallowing these public lands to be protected.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support for private landowners and for \nthe U.S. forest products industry that is so important to the health of \nour economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1003. A bill to ensure the safety of children placed in child care \ncenters in Federal facilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1004. A bill to provide for the construction and renovation of \nchild care facilities; and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, there is a great need to improve child \ncare in this country. America lags far behind all other industrialized \nnations in caring for and educating our pre-school aged children. We \nhave the opportunity to make improvements, and we need to act now. I \nrise today, to introduce two small, but vitally important child care \nbills: the Child Care Construction and Renovation Act and the Federal \nEmployees Child Care Act.\n  The Child Care Construction and Renovation Act is as much a small \nbusiness assistance bill as it is a child care bill. Child care \nproviders are small business owners. Almost every child care provider \nthat I have talked with over the past few years wants the opportunity \nto expand their services, increase their skills, and improve their \nfacilities. But the child care business is a financially unstable \nendeavor. Child care centers and home-based providers are finding it \nincreasingly difficult to recruit and retain staff, to buy the supplies \nand equipment that will promote healthy child development, and even to \nkeep their doors open.\n  The Shelburne Children's Center in Vermont closed a couple of years \nago because it could not afford to stay open. Nearly forty percent of \nall family-based child care and ten percent of the center-based care \nclose each year. Parents can only pay what they can afford, and far too \noften that is barely enough to keep a child care provider in business.\n  This legislation also creates financing mechanisms to support the \nrenovation and construction of child care facilities. First, it amends \nthe National Housing Act to provide mortgage insurance on new and \nrehabilitated child care facilities. It creates a revolving fund to \nhelp with the purchase or refinancing of existing child care \nfacilities. Second, it provides funds for local, non-profit community \ndevelopment organizations to provide technical assistance and small \ngrants to child care providers to help them improve and expand their \ncenter- or home-based child care facilities.\n  Without some government help, child care providers cannot expand \ntheir services to provide care for many families seeking affordable, \nquality care for their children. They cannot upgrade their equipment or \nmake improvements to better ensure the safety of children in their \ncare. Just as the government provides funds and services to encourage \nthe building and renovation of low-income housing, child care, with its \nlow-profit potential needs a similar helping hand.\n  The second bill which I am introducing today is the Federal Employees \nChild Care Act. The Federal Government is the largest American provider \nor employer-sponsored, on-site child care. Congress has acted \naffirmatively with an extensive commitment to on-site child care for \nits employees. The General Services Administration, (GSA), has \ndeveloped considerable expertise in helping agencies start and maintain \nquality child care services for the children of Federal employees.\n  However, there are some problems which we, as an employer, need to \naddress. As you know, federal property is exempt from state and local \nlaws, regulations, and oversight. What this means for child care \ncenters located on that property is that state and local health and \nsafety standards do not and cannot apply. This might not be a problem \nif federally-owned or leased child care centers met enforceable health \nand safety standards. I think most parents who place their children in \nfederal child care would assume that this would be the case. However, I \nthink Federal employees will find it very surprising to learn, as I \ndid, that, at many centers, no such health and safety apply.\n  I find this very troubling, and I think we sell our Federal employees \na bill of\n\n[[Page S5983]]\n\ngoods when federally-owed leased child care cannot guarantee that their \nchildren are in safe facilities. The Federal Government should set the \nexample when it comes to providing safe child care. It should not turn \nan apathetic shoulder from meeting such standards simply because state \nand local regulations do not apply to them.\n  In 1987, Congress passed the ``Trible amendment'' which permitted \nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branch agencies to utilize a \nportion of federally-owned or leased space for the provision of child \ncare services for federal employees. The General Services \nAdministration, (GSA), was given the authority to provide guidance, \nassistance, and oversight to Federal agencies for the development of \nchild care centers. In the decade since the Trible amendment was \npassed, hundreds of Federal facilities throughout the nation have \nestablished on-site child care centers which are a tremendous help to \nour employees.\n  The General Services Administration has done an excellent job of \nhelping agencies develop child care centers and have adopted strong \nstandards for those centers located in GSA leased or owned space. \nHowever, there are over 100 child care centers located in Federal \nfacilities that are not subject to the GSA standards or any other laws, \nrules, or regulations to ensure that the facilities are safe places for \nour children. Most parents, placing their children in a federal child \ncare center, assume that some standards are in place, assume that the \ncenters must minimally meet state and local child care licensing rules \nand regulations. They assume that the centers are subject to \nindependent oversight and monitoring to continually ensure the safety \nof the premises.\n\n  Yet, that is not the case. In a case where a Federal employee had \nstrong reason to suspect the sexual abuse of her child by an employee \nof a child care center located in a Federal facility, local child \nprotective services and law enforcement personnel were denied access to \nthe premises and were prohibited from investigating the incident. \nAnother employee's child was repeatedly injured because the child care \nproviders under contract with a Federal agency to provide on-site child \ncare services failed to ensure that age-appropriate health and safety \nmeasures were taken, current law says they were not required to do so, \neven after the problems were identified and injuries had occurred.\n  It is time to get our own house in order. We must safeguard and \nprotect the children receiving services in child care centers housed in \nFederal facilities. Our employees should not be denied some assurance \nthat the centers in which they place their children are accountable for \nmeeting basic health and safety standards.\n  The Federal Employees Child Care Act will require all child care \nservices located in Federal facilities to meet, at the very least, the \nsame level of health and safety standards required of other child care \ncenters in the same geographical area. That sounds like common sense, \nbut as we all know too well, common sense is not always reflected in \nthe law. This bill will make that clear.\n  Further, this legislation demands that Federal child care centers \nbegin working to meet these standards now. Not next year, not in two \nyears, but now. Under this bill, after six months we will look at the \nFederal child care centers again, and if a center is not meeting \nminimal state and local health and safety regulations at that time, \nthat child care facility will be closed until it does. I can think of \nno stronger incentive to get centers to comply.\n  The legislation makes it clear that State and local standards should \nbe a floor for basic health and safety, and not a ceiling. The role of \nthe Federal Government, and, I like to think, of the United States \nCongress in particular--is to constantly strive to do better and to \nlead by example. Federal facilities should always try to meet the \nhighest possible standards. In fact, the GSA has required national \naccreditation in GSA-owned and leased facilities, and has stated that \nalmost all of its centers are either in compliance or are strenuously \nworking to get there. This is the kind of tough standard we should \nstrive for in all of our Federal child care facilities.\n  Federal child care should mean something more than simply location on \na Federal facility. The Federal Government has an obligation to provide \nsafe care for its employees, and it has a responsibility for making \nsure that those standards are monitored and enforced. Some Federal \nemployees receive this guarantee. Many do not. We can do better.\n  I urge swift passage of these important child care bills and hope \nthat my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in this \neffort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Cleland, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1005. A bill to provide assistance to mobilize and support United \nStates communities in carrying out community-based youth development \nprograms that assure that all youth have access to programs and \nservices that build the competencies and character development needed \nto fully prepare the youth to become adults and effective citizens, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I join with Senators Stevens, \nKennedy, Cleland, and Dodd to introduce the Younger American's Act. We \nlaunched this effort at the end of the last Congress, with the help of \nGeneral Colin Powell. This legislation embraces the belief that youth \nare our Nation's most important responsibility and that their needs \nmust be moved to a higher priority on our Nation's agenda.\n  It is not enough that government responds to youth when they get into \ntrouble with drugs, teen pregnancy, and violence. We need to strengthen \nthe positive rather than simply respond to the negative. Positive youth \ndevelopment, the framework for the Younger American's Act, is not just \nabout preventing bad things from happening, but giving a nudge to help \ngood things happen. And we know that it works.\n  Evaluations of Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Boys and Girls Clubs, \nmentoring, and other youth development programs have consistently \ndemonstrated how well these programs work. These programs lead to \nsignificant increases in parental involvement, youth participation in \nconstructive education, social and recreation activities, enrollment in \npost-secondary education, and community involvement. Just as important, \nyouth actively participating in youth development programs show \ndecreased rates of school failure and absenteeism, teen pregnancy, \ndelinquency, substance abuse, and violent behavior.\n  We also know that risk taking behavior increases with age. One-third \nof the high school juniors and seniors participate in two or more \nhealth risk behaviors. That is why it is important to build a youth \ndevelopment infrastructure that engages youth as they enter pre-\nadolescence and keeps them engaged throughout their teen years. The \nYounger American's Act is targeted to youth aged 10 to 19. This \nencompasses both the critical middle-school years, as well as the \nincreasingly risky high school years.\n  The Younger American's Act is about creating a national policy on \nyouth. Up until now, government has responded to kids after they have \ngotten into trouble. We must take a new tack. Instead of just treating \nproblems, we have to promote healthy development. We have to remember \nthat just because a kid stays out of trouble, it doesn't mean that he \nor she is ready to handle the responsibilities of adulthood. Kids want \ndirection, they want close bonds with parents and other adult mentors. \nAnd I believe we owe them that. Ideally, this comes from strong \nfamilies, but communities and government can help.\n  In order to keep kids engaged in positive activities, youth must be \nviewed as resources; as active participants in finding solutions to \ntheir own problems. Parents also must be part of those solutions. This \nlegislation requires that youth and parents be part of the decision-\nmaking process.\n  The United States does not have a cohesive federal policy on youth. \nCreating an Office on National Youth Policy within the White House not \nonly raises the priority of youth on the Federal agenda, but provides \nan opportunity to more effectively coordinate existing Federal youth \nprograms to increase their impact on the lives of\n\n[[Page S5984]]\n\nyoung Americans. The efforts of the Office of National Youth Policy in \nadvocating for the needs of youth, and the Department of Health and \nHuman Services in implementing the Younger American's Act will be \nhelped by the Council on National Youth Policy. This Council, comprised \nof youth, parents, experts in youth development, and representatives \nfrom the business community, will help ensure that this initiative \ncontinually responds to the changing needs of youth and their \ncommunities. It will bring a ``real world'' perspective to the Federal \nefforts.\n  The Younger American's Act provides communities with the funding \nnecessary to adequately ensure that youth have access to five core \nresources: ongoing relationships with caring adults; safe places with \nstructured activities in which to grow and learn; services that promote \nhealthy lifestyles, including those designed to improve physical and \nmental health; opportunities to acquire marketable skills and \ncompetencies; and opportunities for community service and civic \nparticipation.\n  Block grant funds will be used to expand existing resources, create \nnew ones where none existed before, overcome barriers to accessing \nthose resources, and fill gaps to create a cohesive network for youth. \nThe funds will be funneled through States, based on an allocation \nformula that equally weighs population and poverty measures, to \ncommunities where the primary decisions regarding the use of the funds \nwill take place. Thirty percent of the local funds are set aside to \naddress the needs of youth who are particularly vulnerable, such as \nthose who are in out-of-home placements, abused or neglected, living in \nhigh poverty areas, or living in rural areas where there are usually \nfewer resources. Dividing the State into regions, or ``planning and \nmobilization areas,'' ensures that funds will be equitably distributed \nthroughout a State. Empowering community boards, comprised of youth, \nparents, and other members of the community, to supervise decisions \nregarding the use of the block grant funds ensures that the programs, \nservices, and activities supported by the Act will be responsive to \nlocal needs.\n  Accountability is integral to any effective Federal program. The \nYounger American's Act provides the Department of Health and Human \nServices with the responsibility and funding to conduct research and \nevaluate the effectiveness of funded initiatives. States and the \nDepartment are charged with monitoring the use of funds by grantees, \nand empowered to withhold or reduce funds if problems arise.\n  The Younger American's Act will help kids gain the skills and \nexperience they need to successfully navigate the rough waters of \nadolescence. My twenty-first century community learning centers \ninitiative supports the efforts of schools to operate after school \nprograms that emphasize academic enrichment. It's time to get the rest \nof the community involved. It's time to give the same level of support \nto the thousands of youth development and youth-serving organizations \nthat struggle to keep their doors open every day.\n  I remember a young man, Brad Luck, who testified before the H.E.L.P. \nCommittee several years ago. As a 14-year-old, Brad embarked on a two-\nyear mission to open a teen center in his home town of Essex Junction, \nVermont. He formed a student board of directors, sought 501(c)(3) \nstatus and gave over 25 community presentations to convince the town to \nback the program. Demonstrating the tenacity of youth, he then spear-\nheaded a successful drive to raise $30,000 in 30 days to fund the \nstart-up of the center. Today, the center is thriving in its town-\ndonated space. This is an example of the type of community asset \nbuilding supported by the Younger American's Act.\n  The Younger American's Act is about an investment in our youth, our \ncommunities, and our future. I want to thank America's Promise, the \nUnited Way, and the National Collaboration for Youth for their work in \nproviding the original framework for the legislation. I am proud and \nexcited to be part of this important initiative.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Jeffords for his \nleadership on this important legislation and it is a privilege to join \nhim as a cosponsor on this legislation. I also commend the thirty-four \nyouth organizations that comprise the National Collaboration for Youth \nand the more than 200 young people who have worked on this bill. They \nhave been skillful and tireless in their efforts to focus on the need \nfor a positive national strategy for youth.\n  Our goal in introducing the The Younger Americans Act is to establish \na national policy for youth which focuses on young people, not as \nproblems, but as problem solvers. The Younger Americans Act is intended \nto create a local and nation-wide collaborative movement to provide \nprograms that offer greater support for youth in the years of \nadolescence. This bill, modeled on the very successful Older Americans \nAct of 1965, will help youths between the ages of 10 and 19. It will \nprovide assistance to communities for youths development programs that \nassure that all youth have access to the skills and character \ndevelopment needed to become good citizens.\n  In other successful bipartisan measures over the years, such as Head \nStart, child care, and the 21st century learning communities, we have \ncreated a support system for parents of preschool and younger school-\nage children. These programs reduce the risk that children will grow up \nto become juvenile delinquents by giving them a healthy and safe start. \nIt's time to do the same thing for adolescents.\n  Americans overwhelmingly believe that government should invest in \ninitiatives like this. Many studies detail the effectiveness of youth \ndevelopment programs. Beginning with the Carnegie Corporation Report in \n1992, ``A Matter of Time--Risk and Opportunity in the Nonschool \nHours,'' a series of studies have shown repeatedly that youth \ndevelopment programs at the community level produce powerful and \npositive results.\n  In his report this last March, ``Community Counts: How Youth \nOrganizations Matter for Youth Development,'' Milbrey McLaughlin, \nprofessor of education at Stanford University, calls for communities to \nrethink how they design and deliver services for youths, particularly \nduring non-school hours. The report confirms that community involvement \nis essential in creating and supporting effective programs that meet \nthe needs of today's youth.\n  Effective community-based youth development programs build on five \ncore resources that all youths need to be successful. These same core \nresources are the basis for the Younger Americans Act. Youths need \nongoing relationships with caring adults, safe places with structured \nactivities, access to services that promote healthy lifestyles, \nopportunities to acquire marketable skills, and opportunities for \ncommunity service and community participation.\n  The Younger Americans Act will establish a way for communities to \ngive thought and planning on the issues at the local level, and to \ninvolve both youths and parents in the process. The Act will provide \n$5.75 billion over the next five years for communities to conduct youth \ndevelopment programs that recognize the primary role of the family, \npromote the involvement of youth, coordinate services in the community, \nand eliminate barriers which prevent youth from obtaining the guidance \nand support they need to become successful adults. The Act also creates \nan Office on National Youth Policy and a Council on National Youth \nPolicy which includes youth and ensures their participation in finding \nsolutions to their own problems.\n  Too often, the focus on youth has emphasized their problems, not \ntheir successes and their potential. This emphasis has sent a negative \nmessage to youth that needs to be reversed. We need to deal with \nnegative behaviors, but we also need a broader strategy that provides a \npositive approach to youth. The Younger Americans Act will accomplish \nthis goal in three ways, by focusing national attention on the \nstrengths and contributions of youths, by providing funds to develop \npositive and cooperative youth development programs at the state and \ncommunity levels, and by promoting the involvement of parents and \nyouths in developing positive programs that strengthen families.\n  The time of adolescence is a complex transitional period of growth \nand change. We know what works. The challenge we face is to provide the \nresources to implement positive and\n\n[[Page S5985]]\n\npractical programs effectively without creating duplicate programs. It \nis important that we tie together all publicly funded existing youth \ndevelopment programs and build on their success. This bill complements \nother existing programs, like the Work Force Investment Program, in \nhelping young people become productive members of society. Investing in \nyouth in ways like that will pay enormous dividends for communities and \nour country. I urge all Members of Congress to join in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am very pleased to once again join \nSenator Jeffords as a cosponsor of the Younger Americans Act. The \nSenator from Vermont has done yeoman's work on this legislation, which \nseeks to offer the same kind of comprehensive and coordinated support \nto America's young people that the landmark 1965 Older Americans Act \nprovides to our nation's seniors. By creating an Office of National \nYouth Policy in the White House, by authorizing over $5 billion over \nthe next five years to help local community organizations provide \nneeded services and supports to their youth, the Younger Americans Act \nforges a national youth policy which prioritizes the needs of our young \npeople and helps to provide them with the critical resources they need \nto achieve their full potential and become contributing members of \ntheir communities.\n  The recently released 2001 KIDS COUNT Data Book, a State-by-State \nreport on the conditions facing America's children, found that the \nwell-being of our youth improved over the past decade on seven of ten \nkey KIDS COUNT measures. The national rate of teen deaths by accident, \nhomicide and suicide fell by a substantial 24 percent. The number of \nteens ages 16-19 who dropped out of high school declined from 10 \npercent in 1990 to 9 percent in 1998. And there has been a steady \ndecline in the rate of teenage births, which fell by a significant 19 \npercent between 1990 and 1998.\n  On the other hand, the 2001 KIDS COUNT Data Book also reports that \nmore than 16 million children have parents who, despite being employed \nfull time, struggle from paycheck to paycheck. In addition, the report \nfinds that the number of single parent households in this country is on \nthe rise. In 1998, 27 percent of families with children were headed by \na single parent, up from 24 percent in 1990--and every State but three \nexperienced an increase.\n  According to the 2000 Census, there was a 14 percent increase in the \nnumber of children in America in the last decade--the largest increase \nin the number of children living in this country since the decade of \nthe 1950s. This significant increase in the under-18 population will \nundoubtedly mean new challenges and new demands on ``our already \nstruggling public education, child care, and family support systems,'' \nas Douglas Nelson, president of the Annie E. Casey Foundation which \npublishes the KIDS COUNT report, points out. The Younger Americans Act \nwill help this nation meet these new demands by providing a framework \nwhich fosters the positive development of all our nation's youth. This \nis a strategy in marked contrast to previous government policies which \nrespond to youngsters only after they have gotten into trouble. It is a \nsignificant fact that more than 200 young people took part in drafting \nthe original legislation. As some of my colleagues have pointed out, \nthese youngsters were telling us that it is time to redirect our focus \non what is right with our young people, not what is wrong.\n  The Younger Americans Act will support community-based efforts that \nprovide young people access to five core resources: ongoing \nrelationships with caring adults; safe places with structured \nactivities; services that promote healthy lifestyles; opportunities to \nacquire marketable skills; and opportunities for community service and \ncivic participation. Such a positive support system ideally comes from \nstrong families, but communities and government can play a part. The \nsuccessful Head Start and 21st Century Community Leaning Centers \nprograms have provided support systems for parents of America's younger \nchildren. The Younger Americans Act will provide support structure for \nour adolescents during the vulnerable years between ages 10 and 19. It \nstresses the pivotal role of the family and emphasizes the critical \nimportance of parental involvement.\n  James Agee once said: ``As in every child who is born, under no \nmatter what circumstances and of no matter what parents, the \npotentiality of the human race is born again.'' The Younger Americans \nAct recognizes and affirms that an investment in our children is an \ninvestment in America's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5985-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5985-S5987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 47--RECOGNIZING THE INTERNATIONAL OLYMPIC \nCOMMITTEE FOR ITS WORK TO BRING ABOUT UNDERSTANDING OF INDIVIDUALS AND \nDIFFERENT CULTURES, FOR ITS FOCUS ON PROTECTING THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF ITS \nPARTICIPANTS, FOR ITS RULES OF INTOLERANCE AGAINST DISCRIMINATORY ACTS, \n        AND FOR ITS GOAL OF PROMOTING WORLD PEACE THROUGH SPORTS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Stevens, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \nBreaux) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                            S.

and\n       (4) ``The activity of the Olympic movement . . . reaches \n     its peak with the bringing together of athletes of the world \n     at the great sports festival, the Olympic Games'';\n       Whereas the IOC has adopted a Code of Ethics that \n     recognizes the dignity of the individual as one of its \n     primary guarantees;\n       Whereas to safeguard the dignity of participants, the IOC's \n     rules require nondiscrimination on ``the basis of race, sex \n     ethnic origin, religion, philosophical or political opinion, \n     marital status or other grounds'';\n       Whereas the IOC's Code of Ethics specifically prohibits any \n     ``practice constituting any form of physical or mental \n     injury'' and ``all forms of harassment against participants, \n     be it physical, mental, professional or sexual'';\n       Whereas an integral part of the IOC's Olympic Charter, Code \n     of Ethics, and rules requires the following of strict \n     guidelines in selecting a host city for an Olympic Games;\n       Whereas included in the IOC's rules are comprehensive and \n     precise selection criteria and methods by which to assess a \n     candidate's application;\n       Whereas the IOC's Evaluations Commission evaluates and \n     compares, among the candidates, 11 different areas of site \n     analysis, including government support and public opinion, \n     critical infrastructure availability, finance, security, and \n     experience;\n       Whereas the IOC has made environmental conservation the \n     third pillar of Olympism, with the other pillars being sport \n     and culture;\n       Whereas the IOC requires host cities to conduct an \n     environmental impact statement, consult with environmental \n     organizations, and implement an environmental action plan for \n     the Olympic Games;\n       Whereas a primary goal of the IOC is world peace and \n     understanding, and, in pursuit of the goal, the IOC strives \n     to maintain a separation of sports from international \n     politics;\n       Whereas the IOC's Olympic Charter, Code of Ethics, and \n     rules consistently address the IOC's quest to separate \n     politics and sports;\n       Whereas Rule 9 of the IOC's Olympic Charter states that \n     ``the Olympic Games are competitions between athletes in \n     individual or team events and not between countries'';\n       Whereas new members of the IOC take an oath upon membership \n     that avers in part ``to comply with the Code of Ethics, to \n     keep myself free from any political or commercial \n     influence'';\n\n[[Page S5986]]\n\n       Whereas the IOC's Code of Ethics states that ``the Olympic \n     parties shall neither give nor accept instructions to vote or \n     intervene in a given manner with the organs of the IOC'';\n       Whereas the IOC is involved in humanitarian affairs through \n     its involvement with the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees, the United Nations Development Programme, \n     International Labour Organization, and the International \n     Committee of the Red Cross; and\n       Whereas following the issuance of the Report of the Special \n     Bid Oversight Commission, the ``Mitchell Commission'', both \n     the United States Olympic Committee and the IOC ratified a \n     number of reforms regarding the selection of Olympic Games \n     host cities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the IOC for the Committee's--\n       (A) work to bring about understanding of individuals and \n     different cultures;\n       (B) focus on protecting the civil rights of its \n     participants;\n       (C) rules of intolerance against discriminatory acts; and\n       (D) goal of promoting world peace through sports;\n       (2) encourages members of the IOC from the United States to \n     abide by all rules of the IOC when considering and voting for \n     host cities for future Olympic Games;\n       (3) recognizes that any government action designating a \n     preference or displeasure with any Olympic Games candidate \n     host city is inconsistent with the IOC's Olympic Charter, \n     Code of Ethics, and rules; and\n       (4) endorses the concept of the Olympic Games being a \n     competition between athletes in individual or team events and \n     not between countries.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to submit a \nresolution in support of the Olympic Games, and in particular, in \nsupport of Olympic athletes.\n  The United States has a proud Olympic Games history. Thousands of \nAmericans have represented our country at the Summer and Winter Games.\n  Numerous U.S. cities have hosted the Games. And cities all across our \ncountry hope to host the Olympic Games in the future just as Salt Lake \nCity will host the Winter Games next year.\n  Let me share with my colleagues the story of one Olympian from my \nhome state. Her name is Megan Quann.\n  Late last year, following the Sydney Summer Games, more than 1,000 \npeople crowded the streets of Puyallup, Washington to see and to \ncelebrate Megan Quann.\n  At the time, Megan was a 16-year-old junior at Emerald Ridge High \nSchool. She had just returned from Australia where she shocked the \nworld by winning two Olympic Gold Medals in the swimming competition.\n  Megan's hometown was ecstatic. October 29 was officially declared \n``Megan Quann'' day in Puyallup. She was honored through town in a \nparade that was led by local Cub Scouts, Brownies, and swimmers from a \nlocal club.\n  On that day, Megan's community erupted in pride in the \naccomplishments of a young athlete, a neighbor and a classmate.\n  It was a great day for Puyallup and for Washington state. \nUnfortunately, I was not there. But, like most of my constituents, I \nfollowed Megan at the Olympics, and I cheered as she set a new American \nrecord in one of her events.\n  And like all Americans, I was so proud of her as she stood on the \nmedal stand--awestruck in her achievement--as the national anthem of \nour country played in the background.\n  Mr. President, I don't think any of us ever tire of seeing an \nAmerican athlete being recognized as an Olympic champion.\n  We can't help but be moved when we see one of our own standing \nthere--often with tears in their eyes--and the American flag on display \nfor the whole world to see.\n  The Olympic Games can be an enormously patriotic experience for the \nathletes and all of us who watch the competitions. But the Olympics \naren't just about patriotism. They are also about bringing different \npeople together to share in competition.\n  Many Americans know the story of the Lithuanian basketball team which \nwas embraced by the world following the collapse of the Soviet Union.\n  And, of course, the Jamaican bobsled team is famous for its efforts \nto compete in the Winter Games.\n  Time and again, we have seen Olympic athletes support each other in \ncompetition. They give their support freely, without consideration for \nnationality, religion, politics, or sex.\n  That devotion to sport is at the heart of the Olympic Movement \nworldwide and that celebration of sport is one reason why more than a \nthousand of my constituents came out to celebrate Megan Quann's \nachievements at the Sydney Olympic Games.\n  I have come to the floor to introduce a resolution which will \nhopefully ensure that another athlete like Megan can dedicate her life \nto the Olympic dream without the fear of seeing that dream die at the \nhands of political interference from the U.S. or elsewhere.\n  In working on this issue, I have reached out to Olympians. I am proud \nthat in my own State, there are more than 180 Olympians, including 46 \nwho competed at the Sydney Summer Games.\n  Nationwide, there are some 8,000 living Olympians, I appreciate the \nwillingness of Washington's Olympians to review this resolution and to \nshare their input.\n  And I appreciate the many other Olympians who have shared their views \non the issues now before the United States Congress.\n  It is abundantly clear to me that U.S. Olympians do not want the \nCongress to mix politics with sport.\n  Most Olympians do not want the Congress to introduce or consider any \nlegislation regarding the Olympic Games.\n  I agree with them. I too wish the Congress would not inject itself \ninto the Olympic Movement.\n  Unfortunately, U.S. politicians have once again decided to mix \npolitics with the Olympics. We only need to look back a short 20 years \nto see the painful and costly results of politicizing the Olympics.\n  In 1980, a generation of young Olympians did not get to participate \nin the Moscow Games due to the U.S. boycott.\n  More than 5,000 athletes--including more than 1,000 Americans--did \nnot get to participate in the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympic Games.\n  Approximately 25 athletes from Washington state were barred from the \n1980 Moscow Summer Games.\n  We have received strong support from this group of very special \nathletes, and I want to mention a few today.\n  I particularly want to thank Caroline Holmes. Caroline was a 1968 \nOlympic Gymnast. She is now the Chapter President of the Washington \nState Olympic Alumni Association. She is a champion for Olympic \nathletes, and I very much appreciate her assistance.\n  Jan Harville was a 1980 Olympian. She was on the rowing team. Today, \nshe's the women's crew coach at the University of Washington. She's \nstill very active with her fellow 1980 Olympians.\n  Paul Enquist from Seattle was also a rower on the 1980 team. Paul was \nable to compete and win a gold medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Games.\n  Matt Dryke was a skeet shooter on the 1980 team. Matt also went on to \ncompete in later Olympic Games. In 1984, he won a Gold Medal.\n  Wendy Boglioli and Camille Wright were two swimmers on the 1980 team. \nWendy ended her Olympic career when the U.S. boycotted Moscow.\n  Here's what Wendy had to say when asked about once again mixing \npolitics with the Olympic Games:\n\n       It would be wrong for the Congress to interfere in the \n     Olympic site selection process. I was there in 1980.\n       I was one of 50 athletes invited to meet at the White House \n     with President Carter regarding the Moscow Olympics.\n       I am still upset that athletes had no voice in the 1980 \n     decision. Mixing politics with the Olympics will only hurt \n     future athletes.\n\n  The 1980 Olympic Boycott was difficult for this country. Athletes \nsued the United States Olympic Community.\n  The Government threatened the U.S. Olympic Committee, and the \nPresident pressured other world leaders to join the U.S. led boycott.\n  Lost in the political squabble were U.S. athletes and for some, a \nlifetime of commitment and preparation.\n  The Soviets, as we know, boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Games. And \nagain, the athletes were the victims. Consider this fact: In the 1980 \nMoscow Games, the East German team won the women's 4 by 100 relay race \nwith a time of 41.60 seconds.\n  At the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the US team won the same relay race \nwith a time of 41.65 seconds. The U.S. and East German teams were \nwithin five one-hundredths of a second.\n  Knowing all of this, I wish these two great Olympic champion relay \nteams\n\n[[Page S5987]]\n\ncould have competed against one another in Olympic competition. It is a \nsad part of our history that politicians kept this great race from \nhappening in the Olympics.\n  With the benefit of history, we know that the Olympic boycotts were \nfutile and ineffective attempts to settle cold war disputes.\n  I believe we should do absolutely all that we can to ensure this \nnever happens again.\n  No one can foretell the future and what actions might be called for \nto protect our country's national interest, but we should never again \nlose sight of the interests of our athletes.\n  Unfortunately, Members of Congress are politicizing the Olympic \nGames. My resolution has one primary objective--to separate politics \nfrom sport and particularly from the Olympic Games. Simply put, I \nbelieve politics has no place in the dreams of future Olympians.\n  I want to thank Senator Ted Stevens for joining me in this effort. \nSenator Stevens has a long history of involvement with the Olympic \nMovement.\n  I am not aware of another elected official in this country who has \ndone more for U.S. athletes than Senator Stevens. And I thank the \nSenator for once again standing up for the interests of U.S. athletes.\n  The Murray/Stevens resolution on the Olympics has a number of key \nprovisions and clauses. However, I want to focus on three sections \nwhich represent the real intent of our bill.\n  First, our resolution encourages members of the International Olympic \nCommittee to abide by all rules of the IOC when considering and voting \nfor host cities for future Olympic Games.\n  Members of the IOC take an oath which requires individual members to \nkeep free from political influence.\n  Our resolution calls upon the four members of the International \nOlympic Committee from the United States to reject all political \ninfluences on their work as members of the IOC, including their votes \non host cities for future Olympic Games.\n  Second, our resolution recognizes that any government action \ndesignating a preference or displeasure with any Olympic Games host \ncity is inconsistent with the IOC's Charter, Code of Ethics and rules.\n  Essentially, this provision says the IOC should not acknowledge or \nconsider any political interference in the host city selection process \nfor future Olympic Games.\n  And finally, our resolution says the Olympic Games are about the \nathletes, that we do endorse the concept that the Olympic Games are a \ncompetition between athletes in individual and team events and not \nbetween countries.\n  We believe the Olympic Games are best left to the athletes. It is \nthat simple.\n  I encourage my colleagues to consider this issue carefully in the \ndays ahead. And I invite all Senators to join me in seeking to reject \npolitical interference in the Olympic Movement.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/07/senate-section/article/S5987-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 792.

EDUCATIONAL USE COPYRIGHT EXEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the \n     ``Technology, Education, and Copyright Harmonization Act of \n     2001''.\n       (b) Exemption of Certain Performances and Displays for \n     Educational Uses.--Section 110 of title 17, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:\n       ``(2) except with respect to a work produced or marketed \n     primarily for performance or display as part of mediated \n     instructional activities transmitted via digital networks, or \n     a performance or display that is given by means of a copy or \n     phonorecord that is not lawfully made and acquired under this \n     title, and the transmitting government body or accredited \n     nonprofit educational institution knew or had reason to \n     believe was not lawfully made and acquired, the performance \n     of a nondramatic literary or musical work or reasonable and \n     limited portions of any other work, or display of a work in \n     an amount comparable to that which is typically displayed in \n     the course of a live classroom session, by or in the course \n     of a transmission, if--\n       ``(A) the performance or display is made by, at the \n     direction of, or under the actual supervision of an \n     instructor as an integral part of a class session offered as \n     a regular part of the systematic mediated instructional \n     activities of a governmental body or an accredited nonprofit \n     educational institution;\n       ``(B) the performance or display is directly related and of \n     material assistance to the teaching content of the \n     transmission;\n       ``(C) the transmission is made solely for, and, to the \n     extent technologically feasible, the reception of such \n     transmission is limited to--\n       ``(i) students officially enrolled in the course for which \n     the transmission is made; or\n       ``(ii) officers or employees of governmental bodies as a \n     part of their official duties or employment; and\n       ``(D) the transmitting body or institution--\n       ``(i) institutes policies regarding copyright, provides \n     informational materials to faculty, students, and relevant \n     staff members that accurately describe, and promote \n     compliance with, the laws of the United States relating to \n     copyright, and provides notice to students that materials \n     used in connection with the course may be subject to \n     copyright protection; and\n       ``(ii) in the case of digital transmissions--\n\n       ``(I) applies technological measures that, in the ordinary \n     course of their operations, prevent--\n\n       ``(aa) retention of the work in accessible form by \n     recipients of the transmission from the transmitting body or \n     institution for longer than the class session; and\n       ``(bb) unauthorized further dissemination of the work in \n     accessible form by such recipients to others; and\n\n       ``(II) does not engage in conduct that could reasonably be \n     expected to interfere with technological measures used by \n     copyright owners to prevent such retention or unauthorized \n     further dissemination;''; and\n\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``In paragraph (2), the term `mediated instructional \n     activities' with respect to the performance or display of a \n     work by digital transmission under this section refers to \n     activities that use such work as an integral part of the \n     class experience, controlled by or under the actual \n     supervision of the instructor and analogous to the type of \n     performance or display that would take place in a live \n     classroom setting.

Madam President. I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering the TEACH Act, S. 487, today. This legislation will help \nclarify the law and allow educators to use the same rich material in \ndistance learning over the Internet that they are able to use in face-\nto-face classroom instruction. The Senate has been focused on education \nreform for the past two months. The legislation we report today \nreflects our understanding that we must be able to use new technologies \nto advance our education goals in a manner that recognizes and protects \ncopyrighted works.\n  The genesis of this bill was in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act \n(DMCA), where we asked the Copyright Office to study the complex \ncopyright\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\nissues involved in distance education and to make recommendations to us \nfor any legislative changes. The Copyright Office released its report \nin May, 1999, and made valuable suggestions on how modest changes in \nour copyright law could go a long way to foster the appropriate use of \ncopyrighted works in valid distance learning activities. Senator Hatch \nand I then introduced the TEACH Act, S. 487, relying heavily on the \nlegislative recommendations of that report.\n  Marybeth Peters, the Registrar of Copyrights, and her staff deserve \nour heartfelt thanks for that comprehensive study and their work on \nthis legislation.\n  At the March 13, 2001, hearing on this legislation, we heard from \npeople who both supported the legislation and had concerns about it. I \nappreciate that some copyright owners disagreed with the Copyright \nOffice's conclusions and believed instead that current copyright laws \nare adequate to enable and foster legitimate distance learning \nactivities. We have made efforts in refining the original legislation \nto address the valid concerns of both the copyright owners and the \neducational community. This has not been an easy process and I want to \nextend my thanks to all of those who worked hard and with us to craft \nthe legislation reported by the Judiciary Committee and considered by \nthe Senate today.\n  The growth of distance learning is exploding, largely because it is \nresponsive to the needs of older, non-traditional students. The \nCopyright Office, ``CO,'' report noted two years ago that, by 2002, the \nnumber of students taking distance education courses will represent 15 \npercent of all higher education students. Moreover, the typical average \ndistance learning student is 34 years old, employed full-time and has \nprevious college credit. More than half are women. In increasing \nnumbers, students in other countries are benefitting from educational \nopportunities here through U.S. distance education programs. (CO \nReport, at pp. 19-20).\n  In high schools, distance education makes advanced college placement \nand college equivalency courses available--a great opportunity for \nresidents in our more-rural states. In colleges, distance education \nmakes lifelong learning a practical reality.\n  Not only does distance education make it more convenient for many \nstudents to pursue an education, for students who have full- time work \ncommitments, who live in rural areas or in foreign countries, who have \ndifficulty obtaining child or elder care, or who have physical \ndisabilities, distance education may be the only means for them to \npursue an education. These are the people with busy schedules who need \nthe flexibility that on-line programs offer: virtual classrooms \naccessible when the student is ready to log-on.\n  In rural areas, distance education provides an opportunity for \nschools to offer courses that their students might otherwise not be \nable enjoy. It is therefore no surprise that in Vermont, and many other \nrural states, distance learning is a critical component of any quality \neducational and economic development system. The most recent Vermont \nTelecommunications Plan, which was published in 1999, identifies \ndistance learning as being critical to Vermont's development. It also \nrecommends that Vermont consider ``using its purchasing power to \naccelerate the introduction of new [distance learning] services in \nVermont.'' Technology has empowered individuals in the most remote \ncommunities to have access to the knowledge and skills necessary to \nimprove their education and ensure they are competitive for jobs in the \n21st Century.\n  Several years ago, I was proud to work with the state in establishing \nthe Vermont Interactive Television network. This constant two-way \nvideo-conferencing system can reach communities, schools and businesses \nin every corner of the state. Since we first successfully secured funds \nto build the backbone of the system, Vermont has constructed fourteen \nsites. The VIT system is currently running at full capacity and has \ndemonstrated that in Vermont, technology highways are just as important \nas our transportation highways.\n  No one single technology should be the platform for distance \nlearning. In Vermont, creative uses of available resources have put in \nplace a distance learning system that employs T-1 lines in some areas \nand traditional internet modem hook-ups in others. Several years ago, \nthe Grand Isle Supervisory Union received a grant from the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to link all the schools within the district \nwith fiber optic cable. There are not a lot of students in this \nSupervisory Union but there is a lot of land separating one school from \nanother. The bandwidth created by the fiber optic cables has not only \nimproved the educational opportunities in the four Grand Isle towns, \nbut it has also provided a vital economic boost to the area's \nbusinesses.\n  While there are wonderful examples of the use of distance learning \ninside Vermont, the opportunities provided by these technologies are \nnot limited to the borders of one state, or even one country. Champlain \nCollege, a small school in Burlington, Vermont has shown this is true \nwhen it adopted a strategic plan to provide distance learning for \nstudents throughout the world.. Under the leadership of President Roger \nPerry, Champlain College now has more students enrolled than any other \ncollege in Vermont. The campus in Vermont has not been overwhelmed with \nthe increase. Instead, Champlain now teaches a large number of students \noverseas through its on-line curriculum. Similarly, Marlboro College in \nMarlboro, Vermont, offers innovative graduate programs designed for \nworking professionals with classes that meet not only in person but \nalso online.\n  The Internet, with its interactive, multi-media capabilities, has \nbeen a significant development for distance learning. By contrast to \nthe traditional, passive approach of distance learning where a student \nlocated remotely from a classroom was able to watch a lecture being \nbroadcast at a fixed time over the air, distance learners today can \nparticipate in real-time class discussions, or in simultaneous \nmultimedia projects. The Copyright Office report confirmed what I have \nassumed for some time--that ``the computer is the most versatile of \ndistance education instruments,'' not just in terms of flexible \nschedules, but also in terms of the material available.\n\n  More than 20 years ago, the Congress recognized the potential of \nbroadcast and cable technology to supplement classroom teaching, and to \nbring the classroom to those who, because of their disabilities or \nother special circumstances, are unable to attend classes. We included \nin the present Copyright Act certain exemptions for distance learning, \nin addition to the general fair use exemption. The time has come to do \nmore. The recent report of the Web-Based Education Commission, headed \nby former Senator Bob Kerrey, says:\n\n       Current copyright law governing distance education . . . \n     was based on broadcast models of telecourses for distance \n     education. That law was not established with the virtual \n     classroom in mind, nor does it resolve emerging issues of \n     multimedia online, or provide a framework for permitting \n     digital transmissions.\n\n  The Kerrey report concluded that our copyright laws were \n``inappropriately restrictive.'' (p. 97).\n  Under current law, the performance or display of any work in the \ncourse of face-to-face instruction in a classroom is exempt from the \nexclusive rights of a copyright owner. In addition, the copyright law \nallows transmissions of certain performances or displays of copyrighted \nworks but restricts such transmissions subject to the exemption to \nthose sent to a classroom or a similar place which is normally devoted \nto instruction, to persons whose disabilities or other special \ncircumstances prevent classroom attendance, or to government employees. \nWhile this exemption is technology neutral and does not limit exempt \n``transmissions'' to distance learning broadcasts, the exemption does \nnot authorize the reproduction or distribution of copyrighted works a \nlimitation that has enormous implications for transmissions over \ncomputer networks. Digital transmissions over computer networks involve \nmultiple acts of reproduction as a data packet is moved from one \ncomputer to another.\n  The TEACH Act makes three significant expansions in the distance \nlearning exemption in the Copyright Act, while minimizing the \nadditional risks\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\nto copyright owners that are inherent in exploiting works in a digital \nformat. First, the bill eliminates the current eligibility requirements \nfor the distance learning exemption that the instruction occur in a \nphysical classroom or that special circumstances prevent the attendance \nof students in the classroom. At the same time, the bill would maintain \nand clarify the requirement that the exemption is limited to use in \nmediated instructional activities of governmental bodies and accredited \nnon-profit educational institutions.\n  Second, the bill clarifies that the distance learning exemption \ncovers the transient or temporary copies that may occur through the \nautomatic technical process of transmitting material over the Internet.\n  Third, the current distance learning exemption only permits the \ntransmission of the performance of ``non-dramatic literary or musical \nworks,'' but does not allow the transmission of movies or videotapes, \nor the performance of plays. The Kerrey Commission report cited this \nlimitation as an obstacle to distance learning in current copyright law \nand noted the following examples: A music instructor may play songs and \nother pieces of music in a classroom, but must seek permission from \ncopyright holders in order to incorporate these works into an online \nversion of the same class. A children's literature instructor may \nroutinely display illustrations from childrens' books in the classroom, \nbut must get licenses for each one for on online version of the course.\n  To alleviate this disparity, the TEACH Act would amend current law to \nallow educators to show reasonable and limited portions of dramatic \nliterary and musical works, audiovisual works, and sound recordings, in \naddition to the complete versions of nondramatic literary and musical \nworks which are currently exempted.\n  This legislation is a balanced proposal that expands the educational \nuse exemption in the copyright law for distance learning, but also \ncontains a number of safeguards for copyright owners. In particular, \nthe bill excludes from the exemption those works that are produced \nprimarily for instructional use, because for such works, unlike \nentertainment products or materials of a general educational nature, \nthe exemption could significantly cut into primary markets, impairing \nincentives to create. Indeed, the Web-Based Education Commission urged \nthe development of ``high quality online educational content that meets \nthe highest standards of educational excellence.'' Copyright protection \ncan help provide the incentive for the development of such content.\n  In addition, the bill requires that the government or educational \ninstitution using the exemption transmit copyrighted works that are \nlawfully made or acquired and use technological protection safeguards \nto protect against retention of the work and ensure that the \ndissemination of material covered under the exemption is limited only \nto the students who are intended to receive it.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Patent and Trademark Office to report \nto the Congress with a description of the various technological \nprotection systems in use, available, or being developed to protect \ndigitized copyrighted works and prevent infringement, including those \nbeing developed in private, voluntary, industry-led entities through an \nopen broad based consensus process. The original version of this study \nproposed by Senator Hatch in an amendment filed to the Elementary and \nSecondary Education bill, S. 1, proved highly controversial.\n  I appreciate that copyright owners are frustrated at the pace at \nwhich technological measures are being developed and implemented to \nprotect digital copyrighted works, particularly as high-speed Internet \nconnections and broadband service becomes more readily available. At \nthe same time, computer and software manufacturers and providers of \nInternet services are appropriately opposed to the government mandating \nuse of a particular technological protection measure or setting the \nspecification standards for such measures. Indeed, copyright owners are \na diverse group, and some owners may want more flexibility and variety \nin the technical protection measures available for their works than \nwould result if the government intervened too soon and mandated a \nparticular standard or system. I am glad that with the constructive \nassistance of Senator Cantwell and other members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, we were able to include a version of the PTO study in the \nbill that is limited to providing information to the Congress.\n  Distance education is an important issue to both Senator Hatch and to \nme, and to the people of all of our States. This is a good bill and I \nurge the Congress to act promptly to see this legislation enacted.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased that we will pass out of the \nSenate today S. 487, the ``Technology Education and Copyright \nHarmonization Act'' or fittingly abbreviated as the ``TEACH Act,'' \nwhich updates the educational use provisions of the copyright law to \naccount for advancements in digital transmission technologies that \nsupport distance learning.\n  But first I want to thank the Ranking Member for his work and \npartnership on this legislation. We have done it in a bipartisan, \nconsensus-building manner. I would also like to thank the various \nrepresentatives of the copyright owner and education communities who \nhave worked so hard with us to achieve this consensus and move this \nlegislation forward.\n  They have worked in the spirit of cooperation toward the shared goal \nof helping our students learn better through technology and the media. \nI would also like to thank the Register of Copyrights, and her staff at \nthe Copyright Office, for their help and technical assistance. They \nhave done an admirable job in helping us move forward the deployment of \nthe Internet and digital transmissions systems in education.\n  Because of their hard work, I am confident we have an important \neducation reform that can be sent to, and signed by, the President with \nbroad, bipartisan support in the coming month.\n  Distance education, and the use of high technology tools such as the \nInternet in education, hold great promise for students in States like \nUtah, where distances can be great between students and learning \nopportunities. I think it is similarly important for any State that has \nstudents who seek broader learning opportunities than they can reach in \ntheir local area. Any education reforms moved in the Congress this year \nshould include provisions that help deploy high technology tools, \nincluding the Internet, to give our students the very best educational \nexperience we can offer. I believe this legislation is an important \npart of truly effective education reform that can open up new vistas to \nall our students, while potentially costing less in the long run to \nprovide a full education experience.\n  By using these tools, students in remote areas of my home State of \nUtah are becoming able to link up to resources previously available \nonly to those in cities or at prestigious educational institutions. \nLimited access to language instructors in remote areas or particle \naccelerators in most high schools limit access to educational \nopportunity. These limits can be overcome to a revolutionary degree by \nonline offerings, which can combine sound, video, and interactivity in \nexciting new ways. And new experiences that transcend what is possible \nin the classroom, such as hypertexts linked directly to secondary \nsources, are possible only in the online world.\n  With the advent of the Internet and other communication technologies, \nclassrooms need no longer be tied to a specific location or time. As \nexciting as distance education is, online education will only thrive if \nteachers and students have affordable and convenient access to the \nhighest quality educational materials. The goal of the TEACH Act is to \nupdate the educational provisions of the copyright law for the 21st \ncentury, allowing students and teachers to benefit from deployment of \nadvanced digital technologies.\n  Specifically, the TEACH Act amends sections 110(2) and 112 of the \nCopyright Act to facilitate the growth and development of digital \ndistance learning. First, the legislation expands the scope of the \nsection 110(2) exemption to apply to performances and displays of all \ncategories of copyrighted works subject to reasonable limitations on \nthe portion or amount of the work that can be\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\ndigitally transmitted. Thus, for example, the Act allows transmissions \nto locations other than the physical classroom, and includes \naudiovisual works, sound recordings and other works within the \nexemption. At the same time, the bill maintains and clarifies the \nconcept of ``mediated instructional activities,'' which requires that \nthe performance or display be analogous to the type of performance or \ndisplay that would take place in a live classroom setting.\n  Moreover, of utmost significance to the copyright owners, the \nlegislation adds new safeguards to counteract the risks posed by \ndigital transmissions in an educational setting. For example, the bill \nimposes obligations to implement technological protection measures as \nwell as certain limitations relating to accessibility and duration of \ntransient copies. The Act also amends section 112 of the Copyright Act \nto permit storage of copyrighted material on servers in order to permit \nasynchronous use of material in distance education.\n  This legislation was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee, \nand we expect it will pass the full Senate unanimously, too. Today we \nwill make two non-controversial changes to the legislation as passed by \nthe Committee. First, Senator Leahy and I have a technical amendment to \nthe title of the bill, which corrects a non-substantive scrivener's \nerror. Second, we are making a change in the legislative language \nregarding technological protection measures which makes our intention \nclearer by bringing the statutory language into closer conformity with \nour understanding of the provision. These changes are non-controversial \nand have the same support among the affected parties as the rest of the \nbill. For the information of my colleagues and those who may use the \nlegislation, I am including a section by section analysis of the bill \nas amended following my comments, and asked that a copy of that section \nby section analysis and copies of the two amendments be published \nimmediately following my remarks in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1).\n  Mr. HATCH. A few comments about the study we request from the Patent \nand Trademark Office included in this legislation. There was some \ncontroversy generated in some quarters over an earlier draft of the \nTEACH Act that directed the Undersecretary for Intellectual Property to \nprovide the Judiciary Committee with information about technological \nprotection measures for copyrighted works online. I must confess, I \nstill do not entirely understand the precise objections to that \nformulation. One lobbyist, I believe from the Digital Media \nAssociation, was arguing that the study would lead to a rash of class \naction lawsuits. I have been trying to parse the language to see if \nthis informational report might have also provided for attorneys fees. \nBut, fortunately, such imaginative readings of the language are no \nlonger necessary because we were able to come to some agreement late \nlast night on language that will allow the Committee to receive useful \ninformation for our own use and for the information of our constituents \nwithout causing interest rates to increase or the Potomac to run \nbackwards. In all seriousness, I thank those who worked with us late \ninto the night to forge an agreement that allows us to move forward on \nthis last issue as part of this consensus legislation. I believe we \nhave a bill that will be good for students, teachers, copyright owners, \nand information technologists.\n\n  But I would like to explain some of the thinking that went into \nrequesting that report. First of all, the report is not designed to be \na first step toward the government regulating, mandating, or favoring \ntypes of technologies or products produced to protect copyrighted works \nonline. Second, the legislative language makes clear that we do not \nseek a government comparison of various products that are commercially \navailable. We do not seek such comparisons, and we do not want the \ngovernment picking winners and losers among commercial products, nor in \nsetting the standards that would govern the development of such \nproducts.\n  Instead, this request is made because technological protection will \nbe increasingly important in preventing widespread, unlawful copying of \ncopyrighted works generally, and the Committee wishes to know as much \nabout its capabilities as possible, for ourselves and for our \nconstitents. This information would be extremely valuable, for example, \nif the Committee determines in the future that it is appropriate to \nfacilitate the standard-setting process or to encourage the \nimplementation of such standards in devices so that creative works can \nbe offered to the public in a secure environment. Encryption, \nwatermarking, and digital rights management systems have been and \ncontinue to be developed to protect copyrighted works, but these are \njust a portion of the possibilities that exist in making the digital \nenvironment safe for the delivery of valuable copyrighted works. If, \nfor instance, computers and other digital devices recognized and \nresponded to technological protection measures, a significant portion \nof the infringing activity that harms copyright owners could be \nprevented, and the Internet could be a much safer environment for the \nvaluable and quality works that consumers want to enjoy and copyright \nowners want to deliver online. Therefore, the Undersecretary should \ninclude in its study so-called ``bilateral'' systems that have been or \ncould be developed that would allow technology embedded in copyrighted \nworks to communicate with computers and other devices with regard to \nthe level of protection required for that work, as well as unilateral \nprotection systems. The Undersecretary should also provide us \ninformation on robust and reliable protection systems that could be \nrenewed or upgraded after subjected to cyberhacking, as opposed to \nbecoming useless or obsolete. Some have raised concerns that such a \nstudy would only provide a snapshot in time, or would be out of date by \nthe time it is finished due to continual advances in technology. This \nmay be correct. However, despite these possible limitations, the study \nwill be extremely useful in establishing a baseline of knowledge for \nthe Committee and our constituents with regard to what technology is or \ncould be made available and how it is or could be implemented. Perhaps \nthe information contained in this report could be updated by the \nUndersecretary to address evolving technologies in this area.\n  Overall, this legislation will make it easier for the teacher who \nconnects with her students online to enhance the learning process by \nillustrating music appreciation principles with appropriately limited \nsound recordings or illustrate visual design or story-telling \nprinciples with appropriate movie clips. These wholly new interactive \neducational experiences, or more traditional ones now made available \naround the students' schedule, will be made more easily and more \ninexpensively by this legislation. Beyond the legislative safe harbor \nprovided by this legislation, opportunities for students and lifetime \nlearners of all kinds, in all kinds of locations, are limited only by \nthe human imagination and the cooperative creativity of the creators \nand users of copyrighted works. The possibilities for everyone in the \nwired world are thrilling to contemplate.\n  I strongly believe that this legislation is necessary to foster and \npromote distance education while at the same time maintains a careful \nbalance between copyright owners and users. Through the increasing \ninfluence of educational technologies, virtual classrooms are popping \nup all over the country and what we do not want to do is stand in the \nway of the development and advancement of innovative technologies that \noffer new and exciting educational opportunities. I think we all agree \nthat digital distance should be fostered and utilized to the greatest \nextent possible to deliver instruction to students in ways that could \nhave been possible a few years ago. We live at a point in time when we \ntruly have an opportunity to help shape the future by influencing how \ntechnology is used in education so I hope my colleagues will join us in \nsupporting this modest update of the copyright law that offers to make \nmore readily available distance education in a digital environment to \nall of our students.\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\n  Exhibit 1.--Section-by-Section Analysis of S. 487, the Technology, \n               Education, and Copyright Harmonization Act\n\n\n                      Subsection (a): Short Title\n\n       This section provides that this Act may be cited as the \n     ``Technology, Education and Copyright Harmonization Act of \n     2001.''\n\n\n  Subsection (b): Exemption of Certain Performances and Displays for \n                            Educational Uses\n\n                                Summary\n\n       Section 1(b) of the TEACH Act amends section 110(2) of the \n     Copyright Act to encompass performances and displays of \n     copyrighted works in digital distance education under \n     appropriate circumstances. The section expands the scope of \n     works to which the amended section 110(2) exemption applies \n     to include performances of reasonable and limited portions of \n     works other than nondramatic literary and musical works \n     (which are currently covered by the exemption), while also \n     limiting the amount of any work that may be displayed under \n     the exemption to what is typically displayed in the course of \n     a live classroom session. At the same time, section 1(b) \n     removes the concept of the physical classroom, while \n     maintaining and clarifying the requirement of mediated \n     instructional activity and limiting the availability of the \n     exemption to mediated instructional activities of \n     governmental bodies and ``accredited'' non-profit educational \n     institutions. This section of the Act also limits the amended \n     exemption to exclude performances and displays given by means \n     of a copy or phonorecord that is not lawfully made and \n     acquired, which the transmitting body or institution knew or \n     had reason to believe was not lawfully made and acquired. In \n     addition, section 1(b) requires the transmitting institution \n     to apply certain technological protection measures to protect \n     against retention of the work and further downstream \n     dissemination. The section also clarifies that participants \n     in authorized digital distance education transmissions will \n     not be liable for any infringement by reason of transient or \n     temporary reproductions that may occur through the automatic \n     technical process of a digital transmission for the purpose \n     of a performance or display permitted under the section. \n     Obviously, with respect to such reproductions, the \n     distribution right would not be infringed. Throughout the \n     Act, the term ``transmission'' is intended to include \n     transmissions by digital, as well as analog means.\n\n         Works subject to the exemption and applicable portions\n\n       The TEACH Act expands the scope of the section 110(2) \n     exemption to apply to performances and displays of all \n     categories of copyrighted works, subject to specific \n     exclusions for works ``produced or marketed primarily for \n     performance or display as part of mediated instructional \n     activities transmitted via digital networks'' and performance \n     or displays ``given by means of a copy or phonorecord that is \n     not lawfully made and acquired,'' which the transmitting body \n     or institution ``knew or had reason to believe was not \n     lawfully made and acquired.''\n       Unlike the current section 110(2), which applies only to \n     public performances of non-dramatic literary or musical \n     works, the amendment would apply to public performances of \n     any type of work, subject to certain exclusions set forth in \n     section 110(2), as amended. The performance of works other \n     than non-dramatic literary or musical works is limited, \n     however, to ``reasonable and limited portions'' of less \n     than the entire work. What constitutes a ``reasonable and \n     limited'' portion should take into account both the nature \n     of the market for that type of work and the pedagogical \n     purposes of the performance.\n       In addition, because ``display'' of certain types of works, \n     such as literary works using an ``e-book'' reader, could \n     substitute for traditional purchases of the work (e.g., a \n     text book), the display exemption is limited to ``an amount \n     comparable to that which is typically displayed in the course \n     of a live classroom setting.'' This limitation is a further \n     implementation of the ``mediated instructional activity'' \n     concept described below, and recognizes that a ``display'' \n     may have a different meaning and impact in the digital \n     environment than in the analog environment to which section \n     110(2) has previously applied. The ``limited portion'' \n     formulation used in conjunction with the performance right \n     exemption is not used in connection with the display right \n     exemption, because, for certain works, display of the entire \n     work could be appropriate and consistent with displays \n     typically made in a live classroom setting (e.g., short poems \n     or essays, or images of pictorial, graphic, or sculptural \n     works, etc.).\n       The exclusion for works ``produced or marketed primarily \n     for performance or display as part of mediated instructional \n     activities transmitted via digital networks'' is intended to \n     prevent the exemption from undermining the primary market for \n     (and, therefore, impairing the incentive to create, modify or \n     distribute) those materials whose primary market would \n     otherwise fall within the scope of the exemption. The concept \n     of ``performance or display as part of mediated instructional \n     activities'' is discussed in greater detail below, in \n     connection with the scope of the exemption. It is intended to \n     have the same meaning and application here, so that works \n     produced or marketed primarily for activities covered by the \n     exemption would be excluded from the exemption. The exclusion \n     is not intended to apply generally to all educational \n     materials or to all materials having educational value. The \n     exclusion is limited to materials whose primary market is \n     ``mediated instructional activities,'' i.e., materials \n     performed or displayed as an integral part of the class \n     experience, analogous to the type of performance or display \n     that would take place in a live classroom setting. At the \n     same time, the reference to ``digital networks'' is intended \n     to limit the exclusion to materials whose primary market is \n     the digital network environment, not instructional materials \n     developed and marketed for use in the physical classroom.\n       The exclusion of performances or displays ``given by means \n     of a copy or phonorecord that is not lawfully made and \n     acquired'' under Title 17 is based on a similar exclusion in \n     the current language of section 110(1) for the performance or \n     display of an audiovisual work in the classroom. Unlike the \n     provision in section 110(1), the exclusion here applies to \n     the performance or display of any work. But, as in section \n     110(1), the exclusion applies only where the transmitting \n     body or institution ``knew or had reason to believe'' that \n     the copy or phonorecord was not lawfully made and acquired. \n     As noted in the Register's Report, the purpose of the \n     exclusion is to reduce the likelihood that an exemption \n     intended to cover only the equivalent of traditional concepts \n     of performance and display would result in the proliferation \n     or exploitation of unauthorized copies. An educator would \n     typically purchase, license, rent, make a fair use copy, \n     or otherwise lawfully acquire the copy to be used, and \n     works not yet made available in the market (whether by \n     distribution, performance or display) would, as a \n     practical matter, be rendered ineligible for use under the \n     exemption.\n\n                     Eligible transmitting entities\n\n       As under the current section 110(2), the exemption, as \n     amended, is limited to government bodies and non-profit \n     educational institutions. However, due to the fact that, as \n     the Register's Report points out, ``nonprofit educational \n     institutions'' are no longer a closed and familiar group, and \n     the ease with which anyone can transmit educational material \n     over the Internet, the amendment would require non-profit \n     educational institutions to be ``accredited'' in order to \n     provide further assurances that the institution is a bona \n     fide educational institution. It is not otherwise intended to \n     alter the eligibility criteria. Nor is it intended to limit \n     or affect any other provision of the Copyright Act that \n     relates to non-profit educational institutions or to imply \n     that non-accredited educational institutions are necessarily \n     not bona fide.\n       ``Accreditation'' is defined in section 1(b)(2) of the \n     TEACH Act in terms of the qualification of the educational \n     institution. It is not defined in terms of particular courses \n     or programs. Thus, an accredited nonprofit educational \n     institution qualifies for the exemption with respect to its \n     courses whether or not the courses are part of a degree or \n     certificate-granting program.\n\nQualifying performances and displays; mediated instructional activities\n\n       Subparagraph (2)(A) of the amended exemption provides that \n     the exemption applies to a performance or display made ``by, \n     at the direction of, or under the actual supervision of an \n     instructor as an integral part of a class session offered as \n     a regular part of . . . systematic mediated instructional \n     activity.'' The subparagraph includes several requirements, \n     all of which are intended to make clear that the transmission \n     must be part of mediated instructional activity. First, the \n     performance or display must be made by, under the direction \n     of, or under the actual supervision of an instructor. The \n     performance or display may be initiated by the instructor. It \n     may also be initiated by a person enrolled in the class as \n     long as it is done either at the direction, or under the \n     actual supervision, of the instructor. ``Actual'' supervision \n     is intended to require that the instructor is, in fact, \n     supervising the class activities, and that supervision is not \n     in name or theory only. It is not intended to require either \n     constant, real-time supervision by the instructor or pre-\n     approval by the instructor for the performance or display. \n     Asynchronous learning, at the pace of the student, is a \n     significant and beneficial characteristic of digital distance \n     education, and the concept of control and supervision is not \n     intended to limit the qualification of such asynchronous \n     activities for this exemption.\n       The performance or display must also be made as an \n     ``integral part'' of a class session, so it must be part of a \n     class itself, rather than ancillary to it. Further, it must \n     fall within the concept of ``mediated instructional \n     activities'' as described in section 1(b)(2) of the TEACH \n     Act. This latter concept is intended to require the \n     performance or display to be analogous to the type of \n     performance or display that would take place in a live \n     classroom setting. Thus, although it is possible to display \n     an entire textbook or extensive course-pack material through \n     an e-book reader or similar device or computer application, \n     this type of use of such materials as supplemental reading \n     would not be analogous to the type of display that would take \n     place in the classroom, and therefore would not be authorized \n     under the exemption.\n       The amended exemption is not intended to address other uses \n     of copyrighted works in the course of digital distance \n     education, including student use of supplemental or research \n     materials in digital form, such as electronic course packs, \n     e-reserves, and digital library resources. Such activities do \n     not\n\n[[Page S5993]]\n\n     involve uses analogous to the performances and displays \n     currently addressed in section 110(2).\n       The ``mediated instructional activity'' requirement is thus \n     intended to prevent the exemption provided by the TEACH Act \n     from displacing textbooks, course packs or other material in \n     any media, copies or phonorecords of which are typically \n     purchased or acquired by students for their independent use \n     and retention (in most post-secondary and some elementary and \n     secondary contexts). The Committee notes that in many \n     secondary and elementary school contexts, such copies of such \n     materials are not purchased or acquired directly by the \n     students, but rather are provided for the students' \n     independent use and possession (for the duration of the \n     course) by the institution.\n       The limitation of the exemption to systematic ``mediated \n     instructional activities'' in subparagraph (2)(A) of the \n     amended exemption operates together with the exclusion in the \n     opening clause of section 110(2) for works ``produced or \n     marketed primarily for performance or display as part of \n     mediated instructional activities transmitted via digital \n     networks'' to place boundaries on the exemption. The former \n     relates to the nature of the exempt activity; the latter \n     limits the relevant materials by excluding those primarily \n     produced or marketed for the exempt activity.\n       One example of the interaction of the two provisions is the \n     application of the exemption to textbooks. Pursuant to \n     subparagraph (2)(A), which limits the exemption to ``mediated \n     instructional activities,'' the display of material from a \n     textbook that would typically be purchased by students in the \n     local classroom environment, in lieu of purchase by the \n     students, would not fall within the exemption. Conversely, \n     because textbooks typically are not primarily produced or \n     marketed for performance or display in a manner analogous to \n     performances or display in the live classroom setting, they \n     would not per se be excluded from the exemption under the \n     exclusion in the opening clause. Thus, an instructor would \n     not be precluded from using a chart or table or other short \n     excerpt from a textbook different from the one assigned for \n     the course, or from emphasizing such an excerpt from the \n     assigned textbook that had been purchased by the students.\n       The requirement of subparagraph (2)(B), that the \n     performance or display must be directly related and of \n     material assistance to the teaching content of the \n     transmission, is found in current law, and has been \n     retained in its current form. As noted in the Register's \n     Report, this test of relevance and materiality connects \n     the copyrighted work to the curriculum, and it means that \n     the portion performed or displayed may not be performed or \n     displayed for the mere entertainment of the students, or \n     as unrelated background material.\n\n                Limitations on receipt of transmissions\n\n       Unlike current section 110(2), the TEACH Act amendment \n     removes the requirement that transmissions be received in \n     classrooms or similar places devoted to instruction unless \n     the recipient is an officer or employee of a governmental \n     body or is prevented by disability or special circumstances \n     from attending a classroom or similar place of instruction. \n     One of the great potential benefits of digital distance \n     education is its ability to reach beyond the physical \n     classroom, to provide quality educational experiences to all \n     students of all income levels, in cities and rural settings, \n     in schools and on campuses, in the workplace, at home, and at \n     times selected by students to meet their needs.\n       In its place, the Act substitutes the requirement in \n     subparagraph (2)(C) that the transmission be made solely for, \n     and to the extent technologically feasible, the reception is \n     limited to students officially enrolled in the course for \n     which the transmission is made or governmental employees as \n     part of their official duties or employment. This requirement \n     is not intended to impose a general requirement of network \n     security. Rather, it is intended to require only that the \n     students or employees authorized to be recipients of the \n     transmission should be identified, and the transmission \n     should be technologically limited to such identified \n     authorized recipients through systems such as password access \n     or other similar measures.\n\n             Additional safeguards to counteract new risks\n\n       The digital transmission of works to students poses greater \n     risks to copyright owners than transmissions through analog \n     broadcasts. Digital technologies make possible the creation \n     of multiple copies, and their rapid and widespread \n     dissemination around the world. Accordingly, the TEACH Act \n     includes several safeguards not currently present in section \n     110(2).\n       First, a transmitting body or institution seeking to invoke \n     the exemption is required to institute policies regarding \n     copyright and to provide information to faculty, students and \n     relevant staff members that accurately describe and promote \n     compliance with copyright law. Further, the transmitting \n     organization must provide notice to recipients that materials \n     used in connection with the course may be subject to \n     copyright protection. These requirements are intended to \n     promote an environment of compliance with the law, inform \n     recipients of their responsibilities under copyright law, and \n     decrease the likelihood of unintentional and uninformed acts \n     of infringement.\n       Second, in the case of a digital transmission, the \n     transmitting body or institution is required to apply \n     technological measures to prevent (i) retention of the work \n     in accessible form by recipients to which it sends the work \n     for longer than the class session, and (ii) unauthorized \n     further dissemination of the work in accessible form by such \n     recipients. Measures intended to limit access to authorized \n     recipients of transmissions from the transmitting body or \n     institution are not addressed in this subparagraph (2)(D). \n     Rather, they are the subjects of subparagraph (2)(C).\n       The requirement that technological measures be applied to \n     limit retention for no longer than the ``class session'' \n     refers back to the requirement that the performance be made \n     as an ``integral part of a class session.'' The duration of a \n     ``class session'' in asynchronous distance education would \n     generally be that period during which a student is logged on \n     to the server of the institution or governmental body making \n     the display or performance, but is likely to vary with the \n     needs of the student and with the design of the particular \n     course. It does not mean the duration of a particular course \n     (i.e., a semester or term), but rather is intended to \n     describe the equivalent of an actual single face-to-face \n     mediated class session (although it may be asynchronous and \n     one student may remain online or retain access to the \n     performance or display for longer than another student as \n     needed to complete the class session). Although flexibility \n     is necessary to accomplish the pedagogical goals of distance \n     education, the Committee expects that a common sense \n     construction will be applied so that a copy or phonorecord \n     displayed or performed in the course of a distance education \n     program would not remain in the possession of the recipient \n     in a way that could substitute for acquisition or for uses \n     other than use in the particular class session. Conversely, \n     the technological protection measure in subparagraph \n     (2)(D)(ii) refers only to retention of a copy or phonorecord \n     in the computer of the recipient of a transmission. The \n     material to be performed or displayed may, under the \n     amendments made by the Act to section 112 and with certain \n     limitations set forth therein, remain on the server of the \n     institution or government body for the duration of its use in \n     one or more courses, and may be accessed by a student each \n     time the student logs on to participate in the particular \n     class session of the course in which the display or \n     performance is made. The reference to ``accessible form'' \n     recognizes that certain technological protection measures \n     that could be used to comply with subparagraph (2)(D)(ii) do \n     not cause the destruction or prevent the making of a digital \n     file; rather they work by encrypting the work and limiting \n     access to the keys and the period in which such file may be \n     accessed. On the other hand, an encrypted file would still be \n     considered to be in ``accessible form'' if the body or \n     institution provides the recipient with a key for use beyond \n     the class session.\n       Paragraph (2)(D)(ii) provides, as a condition of \n     eligibility for the exemption, that a transmitting body or \n     institution apply technological measures that reasonably \n     prevent both retention of the work in accessible form for \n     longer than the class session and further dissemination of \n     the work. This requirement does not impose a duty to \n     guarantee that retention and further dissemination will never \n     occur. Nor does it imply that there is an obligation to \n     monitor recipient conduct. Moreover, the ``reasonably \n     prevent'' standard should not be construed to imply perfect \n     efficacy in stopping retention or further dissemination. The \n     obligation to ``reasonably prevent'' contemplates an \n     objectively reasonable standard regarding the ability of a \n     technological protection measure to achieve its purpose. \n     Examples of technological protection measures that exist \n     today and would reasonably prevent retention and further \n     dissemination, include measures used in connection \n     with streaming to prevent the copying of streamed \n     material, such as the Real Player ``Secret Handshake/Copy \n     Switch'' technology discussed Real Networks v. Streambox, \n     2000 WL 127311 (Jan. 18, 2000) or digital rights \n     management systems that limit access to or use of \n     encrypted material downloaded onto a computer. It is not \n     the Committee's intent, by noting the existence of the \n     foregoing, to specify the use of any particular technology \n     to comply with subparagraph (2)(D)(ii). Other technologies \n     will certainly evolve. Further, it is possible that, as \n     time passes, a technological protection measure may cease \n     to reasonably prevent retention of the work in accessible \n     form for longer than the class session and further \n     dissemination of the work, either due to the evolution of \n     technology or to the widespread availability of a hack \n     that can be readily used by the public. In those cases, a \n     transmitting organization would be required to apply a \n     different measure.\n       Nothing in section 110(2) should be construed to affect the \n     application or interpretation of section 1201. Conversely, \n     nothing in section 1201 should be construed to affect the \n     application or interpretation of section 110(2).\n\n                     Transient and temporary copies\n\n       Section 1(b)(2) of the TEACH Act implements the Register's \n     recommendation that liability not be imposed upon those who \n     participate in digitally transmitted performances and \n     displays authorized under this subsection by reason of copies \n     or phonorecords made through the automatic technical process \n     of such transmission, or any distribution resulting \n     therefrom. Certain modifications\n\n[[Page S5994]]\n\n     have been made to the Register's recommendations to \n     accommodate instances where the recommendation was either too \n     broad or not sufficiently broad to cover the appropriate \n     activities.\n       The third paragraph added to the amended exemption under \n     section 1(b)(2) of the TEACH Act recognizes that transmitting \n     organizations should not be responsible for copies or \n     phonorecords made by third parties, beyond the control of the \n     transmitting organization. However, consistent with the \n     Register's concern that the exemption should not be \n     transformed into a mechanism for obtaining copies, the \n     paragraph also requires that such transient or temporary \n     copies stored on the system or network controlled or operated \n     by the transmitting body or institution shall not be \n     maintained on such system or network ``in a manner ordinarily \n     accessible to anyone other than anticipated recipients'' or \n     ``in a manner ordinarily accessible to such anticipated \n     recipients for a longer period than is reasonably necessary \n     to facilitate the transmissions'' for which they are made.\n       The liability of intermediary service providers remains \n     governed by section 512, but, subject to section 512(d) and \n     section 512(e), section 512 will not affect the legal \n     obligations of a transmitting body or institution when it \n     selects material to be used in teaching a course, and \n     determines how it will be used and to whom it will be \n     transmitted as a provider of content.\n       The paragraph refers to ``transient'' and ``temporary'' \n     copies consistent with the terminology used in section 512, \n     including transient copies made in the transmission path by \n     conduits and temporary copies, such as caches, made by the \n     originating institution, by service providers or by \n     recipients. Organizations providing digital distance \n     education will, in many cases, provide material from \n     source servers that create additional temporary or \n     transient copies or phonorecords of the material in \n     storage known as ``caches'' in other servers in order to \n     facilitate the transmission. In addition, transient or \n     temporary copies or phonorecords may occur in the \n     transmission stream, or in the computer of the recipient \n     of the transmission. Thus, by way of example, where \n     content is protected by a digital rights management \n     system, the recipient's browser may create a cache copy of \n     an encrypted file on the recipient's hard disk, and \n     another copy may be created in the recipient's random \n     access memory at the time the content is perceived. The \n     third paragraph added to the amended exemption by section \n     1(b)(2) of the TEACH Act is intended to make clear that \n     those authorized to participate in digitally transmitted \n     performances and displays as authorized under section \n     110(2) are not liable for infringement as a result of such \n     copies created as part of the automatic technical process \n     of the transmission if the requirements of that language \n     are met. The paragraph is not intended to create any \n     implication that such participants would be liable for \n     copyright infringement in the absence of the paragraph.\n\n\n                  subsection (c): ephemeral recordings\n\n       One way in which digitally transmitted distance education \n     will expand America's educational capacity and effectiveness \n     is through the use of asynchronous education, where students \n     can take a class when it is convenient for them, not at a \n     specific hour designated by the body or institution. This \n     benefit is likely to be particularly valuable for working \n     adults. Asynchronous education also has the benefit of \n     proceeding at the student's own pace, and freeing the \n     instructor from the obligation to be in the classroom or on \n     call at all hours of the day or night.\n       In order for asynchronous distance education to proceed, \n     organizations providing distance education transmissions must \n     be able to load material that will be displayed or performed \n     on their servers, for transmission at the request of \n     students. The TEACH Act's amendment to section 112 makes that \n     possible.\n       Under new subsection 112(f)(1), transmitting organizations \n     authorized to transmit performances or displays under section \n     110(2) may load on their servers copies or phonorecords of \n     the performance or display authorized to be transmitted under \n     section 110(2) to be used for making such transmissions. The \n     subsection recognizes that it often is necessary to make more \n     than one ephemeral recording in order to efficiently carry \n     out digital transmissions, and authorizes the making of such \n     copies or phonorecords.\n       Subsection 112(f) imposes several limitations on the \n     authorized ephemeral recordings. First, they may be retained \n     and used solely by the government body or educational \n     institution that made them. No further copies or phonorecords \n     may be made from them, except for copies or phonorecords that \n     are authorized by subsection 110(2), such as the copies that \n     fall within the scope of the third paragraph added to the \n     amended exemption under section 1(b)(2) of the TEACH Act. The \n     authorized ephemeral recordings must be used solely for \n     transmissions authorized under section 110(2).\n       The Register's Report notes the sensitivity of copyright \n     owners to the digitization of works that have not been \n     digitized by the copyright owner. As a general matter, \n     subsection 112(f) requires the use of works that are already \n     in digital form. However, the Committee recognizes that some \n     works may not be available for use in distance education, \n     either because no digital version of the work is available to \n     the institution, or because available digital versions are \n     subject to technological protection measures that prevent \n     their use for the performances and displays authorized by \n     section 110(2). In those circumstances where no digital \n     version is available to the institution or the digital \n     version that is available is subject to technological \n     measures that prevent its use for distance education under \n     the exemption, section 112(f)(2) authorizes the conversion \n     from an analog version, but only conversion of the portion or \n     amount of such works that are authorized to be performed or \n     displayed under section 110(2). It should be emphasized that \n     subsection 112(f)(2) does not provide any authorization to \n     convert print or other analog versions of works into digital \n     format except as permitted in section 112(f)(2).\n\n          Relationship to fair use and contractual obligations\n\n       As the Register's Report makes clear ``critical to [its \n     conclusion and recommendations] is the continued availability \n     of the fair use doctrine.'' Nothing in this Act is intended \n     to limit or otherwise to alter the scope of the fair use \n     doctrine. As the Register's Report explains: ``Fair use is a \n     critical part of the distance education landscape. Not only \n     instructional performances and displays, but also other \n     educational uses of works, such as the provision of \n     supplementary materials or student downloading of course \n     materials, will continue to be subject to the fair use \n     doctrine. Fair use could apply as well to instructional \n     transmissions not covered by the changes to section 110(2) \n     recommended above. Thus, for example, the performance of more \n     than a limited portion of a dramatic work in a distance \n     education program might qualify as fair use in appropriate \n     circumstances.''\n       The Register's Report also recommends that the legislative \n     history of legislation implementing its distance education \n     requirements make certain points about fair use. \n     Specifically, this legislation is enacted in recognition of \n     the following: (a) The fair use doctrine is technologically \n     neutral and applies to activities in the digital environment; \n     and (b) the lack of established guidelines for any particular \n     type of use does not mean that fair use is inapplicable.\n       While the Register's Report also examined and discussed a \n     variety of licensing issues with respect to educational uses \n     not covered by exemptions or fair use, these issues were not \n     included in the Report's legislative recommendations that \n     formed the basis for the TEACH Act. It is the view of the \n     Committee that nothing in this Act is intended to affect in \n     any way the relationship between express copyright exemptions \n     and license restrictions.\n\n                    Nonapplicability to secure tests\n\n       The Committee is aware and deeply concerned about the \n     phenomenon of school officials who are entrusted with copies \n     of secure test forms solely for use in actual test \n     administrations and using those forms for a completely \n     unauthorized purpose, namely helping students to study the \n     very questions they will be asked on the real test. The \n     Committee does not in any way intend to change current law \n     with respect to application of the Copyright Act or to \n     undermine or lessen in any way the protection afforded to \n     secure tests under the Copyright Act. Specifically, this \n     section would not authorize a secure test acquired solely for \n     use in an actual test administration to be used for any other \n     purpose.\n\n\n                       Subsection (d): PTO Report\n\n       The report requested in subsection (d) requests information \n     about technological protection systems to protect digitized \n     copyrighted works and prevent infringement. The report is \n     intended for the information of Congress and shall not be \n     construed to have any effect whatsoever on the meaning, \n     applicability, or effect of any provision of the Copyright \n     Act in general or the TEACH Act in particular.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today I rise in strong support of S. \n487, the Technology, Education, and Copyright Harmonization, TEACH, \nAct. This Act expands the distance learning exemption in our copyright \nlaw, acknowledging that changes in technology sometimes require changes \nin the law. In making this change, the TEACH Act places new limits on \nthe rights of copyright owners. These limits, however, are established \nin such a way that they will benefit non-profit educational \ninstitutions and their students, but hopefully without exposing \ncopyrighted works to any further unauthorized use.\n  The drafters of the Constitution acknowledged the importance of \ncreative works--and recognized the property rights of the creators of \nthose works--in the very text of the Constitution itself. The Copyright \nClause of the Constitution, in protecting the rights of American \ncreators everywhere, has directly translated into the most innovative \nenvironment for the creation of creative works we've ever seen. This \ncreativity benefits consumers and our economy as a whole.\n  Never in our history have we seen such a plethora of choices in \nbooks, movies, television, software, and music. One look at the \nstatistics demonstrates the staggering importance\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\ncopyrighted works have to the well-being of not only my home state of \nCalifornia, but also the economy of the entire Nation.\n  It has been reported that the copyright industries are creating jobs \nat three times the rate of the rest of the economy. These industries \nhave a surplus balance of trade with every single country in the world, \nand that last year they accounted for 5 percent of the U.S. Gross \nDomestic Product. Few other industries can boast of such a successful \nrecord, and the protection we grant to copyrighted works is directly \nresponsible for that success.\n  The message is clear. Striking the appropriate balance in copyright \nprotection is vital to maintaining consumer choice, and in maintaining \nthis vibrant part of the American economy. Sufficient protection means \nthe continue investment in the production of creative works, which \nresults in greater choices for consumers.\n  Insufficient protection of copyrighted works, on the other hand, will \nnegatively affect the ability and desire of creators and lawful \ndistributors of such works to make the necessary investment of time, \nmoney and other resources to continue to create and offer quality works \nto the public.\n  That is why we must carefully consider any degradation of that \nprotection, even when proposed limitations would benefit other \nimportant segments of our society, such as the educational community.\n  I believe that this legislation strikes the appropriate balance by \nallowing accredited, nonprofit educational institutions to make certain \nuses of copyrighted works, but requiring them to technologically \nprotect those works to prevent unauthorized uses by others.\n  The application of appropriate technological protection to \ncopyrighted works is increasingly important as we move from the analog \nto the digital world Technological protection will facilitate the \navailability of copyrighted works in high-quality, digital formats and \nin global, networked environments.\n  That is why the provisions of this legislation directing the \nUndersecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property to look at what \nprotective technologies are out there will be of great importance to \nthis Committee in the near future as the online environment and the \nworld of e-commerce develops.\n  Questions such as whether unilateral protection applied to works by \ncopyright owners will provide a sufficiently secure environment or \nwhether bilateral technologies--which invoke a ``handshake'' of sorts \nbetween the work and the machine used to access the work--should be \nexamined more closely have yet to be answered.\n  This study should help us give us an invaluable resource with regard \nto renewable, ungradeable, and robust forms of protection that will \nallow valuable copyrighted works to move freely and securely through \nthe digital environment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 793\n\n  Mr. REID.
