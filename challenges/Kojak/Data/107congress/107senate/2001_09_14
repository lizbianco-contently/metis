Strengthen our conviction \nthat You do not cause tragedies. We dismiss that false question, \n``Where was God in the midst of the tragic terrorist attack?'' You were \nwith us giving us courage and hope. You created humankind: to know, to \nlove, and to serve You. We reverently reflect on what must have been \nYour most crucial decision when You created humankind: You gave us \nfreedom of choice, knowing that there can be no response of love \nwithout choice, but also that humankind would abuse this freedom. There \nis an objective force of evil in the world that often has been \nexpressed through people, and movements, and nations. Heinous acts \nhappen. You are not dissuaded. You suffer with us, and, with ways we \ncould not plan, bring good out of evil. Not even death can separate us \nfrom You. This life is but a small part of the whole of eternity. In \nthe midst of our anguish over those who died in Tuesday's tragedies, \nremind us of the shortness of time and the length of eternity. Make us \ncommunicators of love and strength to those who continue to suffer in \nthe grim aftermath of terrorism. Bless the Senators and the entire \nSenate family with a fresh gift of faith to trust You and a renewed \nassurance that, ``though the wrong seems oft so strong, You are the \nruler yet!''

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, \nthere will be caucuses held by both parties at 9:15 a.m. today. As soon \nas the caucuses have completed their deliberations, we will enter into \nmorning business for a period of time. My hope and my expectation is \nthat we will take up both the supplemental appropriations bill, as well \nas the resolution having to do with the circumstances we are facing in \nproviding the President with additional authority. That resolution, as \nwell as the supplemental appropriations bill, will be the subject of \ndeliberation and debate today, perhaps tomorrow. The House of \nRepresentatives has indicated they will be in session tomorrow to take \nup the resolution.\n  It is my hope that perhaps we might be able to complete our work \ntoday, but until I have had the opportunity to consult more with the \nRepublican leader, I am unable to make any more definitive judgment \nabout the time it will take to complete our work on both of these \nmatters. We were negotiating late into the evening last night. I thank \nall of those who participated.\n  We concluded our work successfully after midnight last night. We will \nnow be in a position to take up the supplemental appropriations bill. I \nwill consult with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the \nranking member, as well as the Republican leader, as we consider just \nwhat the sequence will be throughout the day.\n  There will be rollcalls. We are unclear about the timing of those \nrollcalls or whether or not a Saturday session may be required. I call \nattention to that expectation.\n  I also remind Senators that there is a memorial service at the \nNational Cathedral at noon. While the more optimistic view is that we \ncould perhaps begin boarding buses as early as 10 o'clock to \naccommodate logistics and security, it may be that we will be boarding \na little later than that in order to accommodate whatever other \nconsiderations in the schedule there will be this morning.\n  I remind Senators that there will be a need to board buses sometime, \nI would say, at least prior to 11 o'clock, but we will make more \ndefinitive announcements with regard to boarding the buses as well as \nthe specific schedule in the time ahead.\n\n[[Page S9412]]\n\n                               Baby Grace\n\n  Also, Mr. President, in what has been a very dark hour for this \ncountry and for this institution, it is hard to find anything for which \nwe can celebrate, but we can celebrate this morning. Senator Dodd and \nhis wife Jackie had a baby girl last night. Her name is Grace. She is 7 \npounds. They are doing well.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair. My congratulations \nto Chris and Jackie on the birth of their daughter.\n  Mr. President, there are many times to speak in this Chamber. Today I \nspeak from the Senate floor to make the remarks of one Senator from \nMinnesota part of our historical record. The Senator from South Dakota \nis right, it is a very somber time. The unthinkable happened.\n  We have witnessed the slaughter of parents and their kids. I want to \ntalk about this in the following way: First of all, it sounds so \npolitical to do this, but I want to thank the people of Minnesota for \nmobilizing the way they have mobilized: the blood banks, the offers of \nassistance, the prayers. Nothing could be more important.\n  As a Senator from New Jersey, as someone who worked in the World \nTrade Center, the Chair has probably a more direct understanding of the \nagony and the hell of so many families, but I am very proud that the \npeople of Minnesota, in every way possible, are there for support.\n  This represents the best in our country. I say this because I want to \nsay, drawing on the Minnesota example, that I do not want to let these \nterrorists ever take away from us as Americans the greatness of our \ncountry, including the values by which we live. I am talking about the \ncivil liberties of Americans, and I am talking about the freedom that \nis so important to each and every one of us.\n  I say this as well because unlike these terrorists who slaughtered \nparents and kids, let us be clear, as we pass a resolution and move \nforward, that when we respond, our intention is to target the people \nthat are responsible for this. Unlike these terrorists and what they \ndid to Americans, we care about innocent civilians. We care about \nparents and kids.\n  Our effort must be focused on the people who are responsible, their \nnetwork, their organizations. Our greatness, even in carrying out \nmilitary action, is always to do everything we can to make sure \ninnocent people do not lose their lives.\n  These are our values. This is what we are about. Whether it be how we \nnow conduct ourselves as a nation, or the kind of military action that \nwe are going to be taking, we will never let these terrorists take away \nfrom us what has made our country great.\n  As the son of a Jewish immigrant who fled persecution from Russia, I \nhave always cherished our freedoms, and I always will. I hold that \ndear, and I believe that Americans hold it dear. As the son of a Jewish \nimmigrant who fled persecution from Russia, I have always believed the \ngreatness of our country is the value we place on human life. I am not \nresponding to anybody's particular comments. But of course we will \nalways care and make sure that to the maximum extent possible there \nwill not be loss of lives of innocent people, wherever they live. That \nis what we are about.\n  Our effort is going to be targeted to these terrorists, targeted to \ntheir organization, targeted to their infrastructure. As many people \nhave written in the papers, as Tom Friedman said today in the New York \nTimes, which was right on the mark, and as I think Secretary Powell has \nbeen trying to say, our efforts will not be a single action, and may \nnot be done right away. It is going to be a long, difficult struggle. I \nbelieve people in our country and in Minnesota are united in this, but \nwe need to do this the smart way. We need to do this the right way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as I think certainly everyone on the \nfloor knows, but for those who may be viewing our proceedings and \nshould know, our caucuses have been meeting for the last hour to review \nthe work which has been done by colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nin concert with the administration and with the House of \nRepresentatives. This work has been ongoing now for several days. The \nAppropriations Committee, through the leadership of Senator Byrd and \nSenator Stevens, on the use of force resolution, through the leadership \nof many of our colleagues on both sides, again in concert with the \nWhite House, have given their reports to the caucuses.\n  I am about to propound a unanimous consent request that would allow \nus to vote on both the use of force resolution and the appropriations \nsupplemental. We would hold open the Record for purposes of additional \ncomment. I will read the unanimous consent request. Let me say, before \nI do read the request, how much I appreciate, once again, the \nleadership of our Republican leader. As he has throughout the week, he \nhas been remarkable. We could not be where we are today, this country \nor this institution, without the strong partnership and leadership he \nhas shown. I commend him, and I thank all of our colleagues for their \nremarkable participation during this difficult week.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if Senator Daschle will yield, I thank him \nfor his remarks and I will respond in kind appropriately, but I will \nwait until after the unanimous consent is reached.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9412-5", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9412-S9413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 1426 AND S.J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to consideration of S. 1426, the supplemental \nappropriations bill; that upon its reporting, it be laid aside and the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of S.J. Res. 23, the use of force \nlegislation; that the Senate vote on final passage of the \nappropriations bill, to occur immediately; that the vote on\n\n[[Page S9413]]\n\nfinal passage of the use of force resolution occur immediately upon the \ndisposition of the appropriations bill; that no amendments or motions \nbe in order to either bill; that the preamble to the joint resolution \nbe agreed to; and that when the Senate receives from the House its \nsupplemental appropriations bill, it be read a third time and agreed \nto, provided that it is identical to the bill which the Senate has \npassed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle for agreeing to this request. I, too, want to thank Senator \nDaschle, Senator Reid, the leadership on the Democratic side of the \naisle, and Senators Nickles, Gramm, Domenici, Stevens, and Warner who \nhave worked on these resolutions, and many others.\n  I realize this is a dramatic action in both cases. That is what is \ncalled for.\n\n  I have never seen a better example of Members standing together, \nworking together, swallowing our legalistic desires and our budgetary \nrestraint feelings. These are difficult times. We have got to act \ndecisively. The American people expect it of us and they will accept \nnothing less. We are doing that. We are moving today to provide \nhumanitarian funds to assist in the cleanup, disaster assistance, and \nmilitary action that is necessary.\n  In a perfect world, maybe we would do it differently--with more \nmoney, less money, more language, less language--but the world has \nchanged, and we are acting appropriately.\n  With regard to the use of force language, again, I think it has been \nworked on by Democrats, Republicans, and the administration. If you \nlook at it carefully, I think it does the job without putting us at \nrisk. Senator Daschle said the conference was ready to go to do these \nthings. I think this is the right thing, and I commend both conferences \nfor this decisive action.\n  Thank you for your leadership.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask that Senators, again, vote from \ntheir desks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9413-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9413-S9421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 2001 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR RECOVERY FROM AND \n           RESPONSE TO TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate will pass a $40 billion \nsupplemental appropriation in response to Tuesday's terrorist attack.\n  One of the top priorities must be to increase our airport and airline \nsecurity. I hope that some of the funds provided in this bill will be \nused to place air marshals on commercial planes and to improve security \npersonnel in airports.\n  Would the chairman of the Appropriations Committee inform me of his \nintention with this funding regarding airport and airline security.\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree with the Senator from California on the importance \nof increasing airport and airline security to prevent our Nation from \nexperiencing a tragedy like this. In my opinion, funds in this bill \ncould be for air marshals and airport security personnel.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the agreement reached in this body \nprovides $40 billion to respond to the attacks in New York and \nWashington, and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, as follows:\n  $10 billion available immediately for the President to utilize;\n  $10 billion available 15 days after the President submits a plan;\n  $20 billion available for allocation in subsequent acts.\n  This compromise provides the initial $20 billion sought by the \nPresident with virtually no restriction, and provides a second $20 \nbillion pursuant to the President's commitment to the Governor of New \nYork and the New York delegation that $20 billion would be available \nfor the domestic response and recovery effort.\n  The President can use any of the funds for national security \npurposes--but of the total of $40 billion, not less than $20 billion is \nonly available for the domestic recovery effort.\n  As context, Congress initially provided $15 billion for the gulf war \neffort; nearly $10 billion for the California earthquakes. All of the \nfunds are available until expended, to ensure there is no rush to \nobligate prematurely.\n  The arrangement fulfills the President's commitment to New York, \nVirginia, and Pennsylvania for the families of those on board the \nhijacked aircraft, and ensure adequate funds are available for any \ninitial military or intelligence requirements, without a competition \nfor funds between those two needs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Ernest Hemingway observed that ``life \nbreaks us all, and afterward many are strong at the broken places.''\n  America's heart is broken. What happened on Tuesday was not simply an \nattack against America. It was a crime against democracy, against \ndecency itself.\n  The more we learn, the more we grieve for the innocent victims of \nthese unconscionable attacks: the people of New York, and those of New \nJersey, Connecticut, and all who were in and around World Trade Center \nat the time of these attacks; our men and women serving at the \nPentagon; and, the passengers and crew of American Airlines flights 11 \nand 77, and United Airlines flights 93 and 175.\n  Today, with the passage of this supplemental bill, we take a step \ntoward healing, and we begin the process of growing stronger at the \nbroken places.\n  It has been an extraordinary few days here in Congress. As we come \ntogether to consider how we can act, how we can help, how we can serve, \nwe forget to consider those things that once divided us.\n  Today, we are not Democrats or Republicans. We are Americans.\n  We stand together as one Congress, one people. And we say together, \nwith one voice, we will do whatever needs to be done to care for the \nvictims, to comfort the families, to address this threat to our \nhomeland, and to let our enemies know: We will find them. And we will \nhave justice.\n  This bill we are considering provides 40 billion dollars to provide \naid to the victims of the attacks, and to deal with the consequences of \nthose attacks. The money will be used to: repair the horrific damage \ncaused by these attacks, and help begin the process of recovery; \nimprove attack and disaster preparedness; enhance our counterterrorism \nefforts; make our planes and other systems of transportation safer and \nmore secure; and strengthen our national security.\n  But we need to remember: in the end, this isn't about money, because \nmoney is only a means. This is a statement of our commitment to help \nour fellow Americans in their time of need, to protect our Nation from \nthe most insidious of threats, and to ensure that those who had a hand \nin these evil acts are held accountable.\n  This is a first step. It is the first of many. Because we will do \nwhatever it takes. And, ultimately, we will grow strong in the broken \nplaces.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in the aftermath of Tuesday's tragic \nevents, security has necessarily been tightened at all our borders. \nThis includes the border crossings at the Port of Detroit, including \nthe Ambassador Bridge, the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, and the Blue\n\n[[Page S9414]]\n\nWater Bridge in Port Huron. The U.S. Customs Service is inspecting \nevery vehicle and almost every truck crossing into the United States at \nthese ports of entry, which is what should be the case after such a \nterrible breach of our Nation's security.\n  These ports of entry are important commercial routes for the \ntransport of the just-in-time delivery auto parts to American auto \nmanufacturing plants which are supplied from Canada and elsewhere. \nJust-in-time delivery means an industry must have the ability to move \nits products quickly from point to point. An unfortunate side effect of \nthe tightened security is that significant delays of up to 12 hours in \nsome cases have occurred at the bridges and tunnel. This has meant that \nthe just-in-time delivery systems that the auto manufacturers rely on \nhave broken down. As a result, automobile assembly plants in the United \nStates do not have the necessary parts and many have shut down. Others \nmay have to shut down soon for lack of parts.\n  This backup at our northern border during these extraordinary times \nhighlights and aggravates an existing and chronic problem of under-\nstaffing of Customs inspection and INS personnel at the Port of Detroit \nand along the Northern border in general. Congress was already \nbeginning to address this shortfall before Tuesday's tragedy \nexacerbated the problem.\n  As we pass an emergency supplemental bill today that will provide $40 \nbillion in disaster relief and humanitarian aid to help respond to the \ndestruction caused by Tuesday's tragedy, we should not forget the \nsecurity needs at our borders. Specifically, we need to be sensitive to \nthe economic impact additional security measures have on industries \nthat depend on just-in-time delivery of product from Canada and \nelsewhere. This doesn't mean that we should be any less vigilant in \ninspection at the border. To the contrary, it means we should be sure \nthat we commit adequate resources to preform these inspections without \nhurting our economy in the process.\n  The simple solution would be to direct a portion of the $40 billion \nto increase Customs and INS staffing levels at our northern border and \nat the Port of Detroit in particular where this need has been most \nclearly demonstrated. It makes good domestic security sense and it \nmakes good economic sense.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to express my strong support for \nS. 1426, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill for assistance \nin the recovery from the tragedy that occurred on September 11, 2001, \nand for S. J. Resolution 23, which authorizes the use of force against \nthose responsible for the attacks launched against the United States. \nOn this day of remembrance in our country, we must also face the need \nto respond and rebuild.\n  As we are faced with another critical moment in our Nation's history, \nI am proud to be a member of the United States Senate and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, as we work in a nonpartisan way to provide \nsupport to the victims of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade \nCenter and the Pentagon. The Senate approved this critically important \nfunding legislation of $40 billion by a vote of 96-0 earlier today. The \nUnited States Congress and the President have worked together to \ndemonstrate that the United States will stand together and put our \npartisan differences aside as we address this tragedy facing our great \ncountry.\n  This funding will also help our country as we begin to rebuild and \nwork to find those responsible for these reprehensible and cowardly \nacts of terrorism. Today, I join members of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, Democrats and Republicans, in supporting our President \nand our country by approving legislation to authorize the use of force \nagainst those responsible for the despicable acts of terrorism made \nagainst our Nation on September 11, 2001.\n  Innocent Americans were killed at the hands of our enemies. Our \nNation grieves their loss and remembers an innocence now lost. Now, it \nis time to act swiftly and decisively against those who planned, \nauthorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks in order to \nprevent future aggression against Americans at home and abroad.\n  The war declared by these terrorists is a new kind of conflict. \nUnlike wars of the past, the attack was not made by one military \nagainst another, battling over borders. Instead, the attacks came from \na faceless source and focused on innocent civilians. Their aim was to \nundermine our Nation's freedom, our liberties, and to destroy us from \nwithin through fear, hatred, and rage. We must not and will not allow \nterrorists to ultimately win this war.\n  I think about the families of those who have lost loved ones this \nweek, the children who are now orphans, and those who still await word \non the missing. We hold them in our hearts and keep them in our \nprayers. As the parent of a son in the US Army, I also share the pride \nfelt by those currently serving our Nation and protecting our freedoms \nin the military and in our communities as police and firefighters. The \ncoming weeks and months will by trying, and we must stand with one \nvoice in support of these brave men and women.\n  It is important that we also stand as one America against any example \nof violence against people based on their religion or ethnicity. We \nwill have lost this war against terrorism if our country's diversity \nbecomes threatened.\n  We will remember those we've lost. We will respond against those \nresponsible. And we will rebuild our Nation's confidence and security.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today the Senate has taken a somber step \ntoward a new kind of war. Congress has resolved that military force may \nbe necessary to end the scourge of terrorism. Today we took a solemn \nvow that we will strike back at those who have killed thousands of \nAmerican citizens. Those responsible for the attack on the World Trade \nCenter, the Pentagon, and the crash of an airliner in Pennsylvania will \nnow face the full fury and capability of this great Nation.\n  But the United States will not react blindly. We do not want revenge, \nwe want justice and security. We act today to defend America and punish \nour enemies. Unnecessary violence will do nothing to erase the losses \nsuffered by the American people.\n  Part of what we are fighting to protect, is the Constitution and the \nrole of Congress in a crisis. This resolution faithfully and \nresponsibly executes our duty under the Constitution. We have not ceded \nour power to the President, Congress remains a co-equal branch and a \npartner with the President in this struggle.\n  We stand together in this Chamber and with the President. Shoulder to \nshoulder we are prepared to do whatever is necessary to restore peace \nand security to the land. Our will is resolute, our hearts are \nsteadfast, and our minds are fixed. We will not rest until the task \nbefore us is complete.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise at this time to lend my full support \nto S. 1426 the emergency supplemental appropriations bill.\n  The United States is engaged in war against terrorism. We have been \nengaged in that war for a long time, but seldom has it tread upon our \nNation's soil. On September 11, it did, in a most horrific way.\n  Last night, this body took a great step in its fight against \nterrorism. We passed legislation that will significantly improve the \neffectiveness of our intelligence and legal apparatus.\n  The measure before us will provide much needed funds to the President \nto help heal the wounded, repair the broken and enable our Nation's \nmilitary, justice, and intelligence agencies to carry out the arduous \nduties that lay before them. The threat will not soon go away. The \nmissions of the agencies we provide for with the funds from this bill \nwill continue long past the day when these funds will run out.\n  It is up to us, our colleagues in the House and the President and his \nadministration to develop a long-range plan and provide the resources \nto the men and women who will carry out necessary steps to prevent what \nhappened 3 days ago from ever happening again. It is up to us to \npromote and insure the Nation's resolve in the coming days, months, and \nyears.\n  So, I support emergency supplemental legislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this Tuesday, September 11, 2001, the \nUnited States of America suffered devastating attacks.\n  What happened Tuesday was not only an attack against America. It was \na crime against democracy, and decency. It was a crime against \nhumanity.\n\n[[Page S9415]]\n\n  Our hearts and prayers go out to the many who lost their lives. To \nthe thousands who are injured and suffering. To the families of all the \nvictims. And to the rescue workers and medical personnel who continue \nto work around the clock to try to save lives.\n  At the Pentagon yesterday, I saw the horrendous devastation. I saw \nthe courage and determination of the Montgomery County Urban Search and \nRescue Team and many others working to shore up the structure and \nsearch the rent and burnt symbol of America's military power. I was \ndeeply moved by the two Chaplains who bless the remains as each victim \nis found and removed.\n  The physical impact of these attacks hit New York City, at the \nPentagon, and in Pennsylvania. But the real impact is on all of \nAmerica, on all of the free world.\n  The direct victims were passengers on domestic flights, civilians and \nmembers of our Armed Forces working at the Pentagon, people working at \nor visiting the World Trade Center, and rescue workers. But all \nAmericans share the pain of those who lost loved ones. We feel this as \nan attack on each and every one of us, and on our way of life.\n  I am so proud of the way Americans are responding to this national \ntragedy. We are united. We are helping each other. We are steadfast. We \nare strong.\n  Today, the Senate is taking action. We are doing our part as \nrepresentatives of the American people. I am proud to join in the \nunanimous support for emergency supplemental appropriations and a \nresolution authorizing the use of force.\n  I have pledged to provide President Bush the resources for rescue, \nresponse and recovery, to investigate these attacks, and to improve \nsecurity. Today, we are appropriating $40 billion to do that.\n  We are making resources available immediately to support Federal, \nState and local search, recovery and rebuilding efforts. To \ninvestigate, and prosecute domestic and international terrorism. To \nincrease transportation security. To repair public buildings. And to \nsupport national security readiness. The President has tremendous \nflexibility, consulting appropriately with Congress, to use these \nfunds.\n  We can and will prevail over terrorism. But we must also take strong \naction against those who attacked our Nation. Today, we are also \nadopting a resolution authorizing the President to use ``all necessary \nand appropriate force.''\n  The resolution specifically targets ``those nations, organizations, \nor persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the \nterrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such \norganizations. . . .'' Moreover, the resolution only authorizes action \n``in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism \nagainst the United States. . . .'' The requirements of the War Powers \nResolution remain in force. Congress may decide to give the President \nfurther authorization once we have discovered with greater certainty \nwho is responsible for these barbaric acts.\n  America's law enforcement and intelligence agencies are vigorously \npursuing their investigations to find all those responsible. Whoever \nthey are, they must now know that America is committed to rooting them \nout and exacting a severe price for their barbarity. And America's \nfriends and allies are rightly ready to join us.\n  Much work remains for the Senate, for the Congress, for our \ngovernment, for our Nation, to respond and recover and rebuild. Today \nwe are taking critical steps to sustain the recovery efforts and take \nappropriate action against terrorism.\n  We will not sacrifice our ideals in pursuit of the monsters who \ncarried out these attacks. We will not compromise the principles for \nwhich so many Americans have fought and died.\n  But we will root out those who committed these atrocities. We will \nhave justice. And we will move forward, a stronger nation than before.\n  At our prayer service in the Rotunda on Wednesday evening, I asked \nGod to give us the courage and wisdom to respond rightly to these \nattacks on America. I believe we are doing so today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the third reading and \npassage of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

I move to reconsider the vote and move to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, again, I ask Senators to vote from their \ndesks on this very momentous vote we are about to take.\n  For the information of all Senators, we want to get on the buses just \nas quickly as possible after this vote. For those who are going to be \nattending the memorial service, they will be right down in front of the \nsteps. So we can accommodate all Senators by quickly going, as soon as \nthe vote has been completed, to the buses for transportation to the \nNational Cathedral.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I inquire of the distinguished \nmajority leader if the Senate will be able to stay in session for \npeople who will not be able to stay later to make a statement regarding \nthe bill and joint resolution being passed today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will need some help in presiding. There \nare many people going to the memorial service, so some people will not \nbe in this Chamber. So we will need some cooperation with the \npresiding.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. With an understanding we may be shorthanded with \nPresiding Officers, my intention was for those who were unable to \nattend the memorial service, we would stay in session until noon for \nSenators to speak for up to 5 minutes. We will resume then, following \nthe memorial service, for Senators who may wish to come back and \nexpress themselves on the two matters on which we will have voted this \nmorning--or other issues. And we will be in later in the day for \npurposes of confirming a number of nominees that are prepared for \nconsideration as well.\n  We will come back after the memorial service.\n  Mr. LOTT. Did you propound a UC on the time for the 5 minutes?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I did not.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senators be limited to 5 \nminutes as in morning business, following the vote, up until noon \ntoday.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, and, of course, I will not, \nMr. President, may I say to the distinguished majority leader--if I may \nhave 1 minute----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. There will be no necessity to worry about a Presiding \nOfficer. There will be one.\n  Would the Chair state the question when the leader is finished for \nthe benefit of the Senate?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators be \npermitted to speak for up to 5 minutes as in morning business until the \nhour of 12 o'clock noon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair and thank all Senators.\n  Mr. President, I also announce that this will be the last vote of the \nday and we will not have any votes Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday of \nnext week.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nS.J. Res. 23, the joint resolution for use of military force.\n  As we consider this legislation, our fellow Americans in New York and \nat the Pentagon--indeed throughout this great country, are recovering \nthose who are still lost, assisting their loved ones to cope, and \ndeterminately getting on with the effort to build that which has been \ntorn down. The $40 billion supplemental appropriations bill that we \njust passed unanimously demonstrates our determination to assist in the \nrecovery and rebuilding process.\n  We still have some unfinished business that needs to be attended to \ntoday. In the aftermath of the treacherous terrorist attack on the \nUnited States and its citizens on September 11, I believe that it is \nextraordinarily important that the Congress speak with a united voice \nto authorize the President to use force. In doing so, we will send a \nstrong message of unity behind the President to our fellow citizens, to \nthe international community, and to those connected with these \nterrorist acts and those who might be considering future acts of \nterrorism against us.\n  By this joint resolution, we are authorizing the President to take \nmilitary action as necessary and appropriate against those nations, \norganizations, or persons who planned, authorized, committed, or aided \nthose terrorist attacks or harbored such organizations or persons.\n  In doing so, we will be empowering the President and expressing our \nstrong support for him and for the men and women in our Armed Forces. \nIn my view, it is only by doing so that we can prevent those nations, \norganizations, and persons from conducting terrorist attacks against us \nin the future.\n  I believe it is important to note that this joint resolution would \nauthorize the use of force even before the President or the Congress \nknows with certainty which nations, organizations, or persons were \ninvolved in the September 11 terrorist acts. This is a truly noteworthy \naction and a demonstration of our faith in the ability of our \nGovernment to determine the facts and in the President to act upon \nthem.\n  I believe it is also important to note that this authorization for \nthe use of force is limited to the nations, organizations, or persons \ninvolved in the terrorist attacks of September 11. It is not a broad \nauthorization for the use of military force against any nation, \norganization, or persons who were not involved in the September 11 \nterrorist attacks.\n  This joint resolution is based upon and is an exercise of the \nCongress' constitutional war powers role as codified in the War Powers \nResolution. It also expressly confirms the conditions on the exercise \nof Executive power under that resolution. In that regard, I want to \nnote that the statement in the last ``Whereas'' clause relating to the \nconstitutional authority of the President to take action to deter and \nprevent acts of international terrorism against the United States is to \nbe read in conjunction with the War Powers Resolution. That is why \nwords in earlier drafts of this joint resolution, which might have been \ninterpreted to grant a broader authority to use military force, were \ndeleted and that is why the references to the War Powers Resolution \nwere added. It does not recognize any greater presidential authority \nthan is recognized by the War Powers Resolution nor does it grant any \nnew authority to the President.\n  Finally, I want to encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this \njoint resolution. It is my fervent hope that we will achieve a \nunanimous vote. I believe we owe it to those who have been lost, to \ntheir loved ones and friends, and to the men and women of our Armed \nForces who will be placed in harms way to protect us from future \nterrorist acts.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in 1936, Winston Churchill addressed the \nBritish House of Commons to highlight the extraordinary growth of \nGerman military power and the threat it posed to the security of \nEurope. In his historic address, ``The Locust Years,'' Churchill warned \nof complacency in the face of a Nazi threat that would doom Europe's \npeace and blacken European civilization. In Churchill's words:\n\n       The era of procrastination, of half-measures, of soothing \n     and baffling expedients, of delays, is coming to its close. \n     In its place we\n\n[[Page S9417]]\n\n     are entering a period of consequences. . . . We cannot avoid \n     this period; we are in it now . . . [What has] staggered me . \n     . . has been the dangers that have so swiftly come upon us in \n     a few years, and have been transforming our position and the \n     whole outlook of the world.\n\n  We in America today have entered a period of consequences. We do not \nface the imminent prospect of war against a great power. We face \ninstead a threat more insidious, one that will require the best of \nAmerica to defeat: the reality of catastrophic terrorism in our midst.\n  No longer do we perceive the only great threat to our security in the \nhostile maneuvers of foreign armies; no longer do vast oceans protect \nus from the plots and violence of the Old World; no longer do we sit in \nsplendid isolation, flush with prosperity and naive with peace.\n  A new day has come, a new test of the values upon which our Nation \nwas founded. It calls us to a national mission unlike any we have \nknown. Our Founding Fathers would well understand the nature of this \nchallenge, for they prevailed against even greater odds in defending \nthe American experiment. Let us seek strength from their example, and \ncourage in their wisdom, as we protect the legacy they built.\n  We must destroy this international network of terror in all its \nguises, and deprive its architects, executioners, and sponsors of safe \nharbor anywhere in this world. We will find the enemy, and they will \nsuffer the full, awesome measure of our justice.\n  These were not just crimes of mass murder against the United States; \nthey are acts of war. The American people now know that we are at war. \nThey will make the sacrifices and show the resolve necessary to \nprevail.\n  To see this mission through, Congress should encourage the President \nto use all necessary means to overcome and destroy this enemy, in what \nwill be a long and trying campaign for freedom. Under the Constitution, \nthe President already possesses this authority, but it is enhanced, and \nour cause strengthened, by the support of the Congress.\n  History will judge us for our support of this resolution, just as the \n102nd Congress is judged for its resolution authorizing military action \nagainst Iraq. When faintness of heart carries the day, history's \njudgment is cruel.\n  The stakes today are higher than before the Persian Gulf War: this \nmission is harder, will take longer, and ends not with the capture or \ndeath of Osama bin Laden, but with the destruction of the terrorist \nnetworks that threaten our way of life, and the defeat of nations \nsupporting and collaborating with this evil. These nations, too, are \nour enemies.\n  Those who have seen war do not seek it lightly. But war has been \nthrust upon us, and the stakes couldn't be higher.\n  The era of procrastination and half-measures has ended. The ``post-\nCold War era,'' the prosperity and peace that attended it, is over. We \nnow have a higher purpose. Like other turning points in American \nhistory, when our founding principles were put at grave risk, we today \nrise proudly to the challenge.\n  American resolve is not in doubt. Let us give our Commander in Chief \nall necessary authority to put power behind our purpose, in the name of \nour sacred heritage of freedom, and the glory of all whose sacrifice \nhas preserved it.\n  Two years before Britain's appeasement of the German war machine at \nMunich, Winston Churchill called not for a policy of half-measures to \ntame the foreign threat, but a posture of peace through strength to \nprepare for victory over it. Britain's freedom required no less. In \nChurchill's words:\n\n       The inheritance in our possession represents the prolonged \n     achievement of the centuries . . . There is not one of our \n     simple uncounted rights today for which better men than we \n     are have not died on the scaffolds or the battlefield. We \n     have not only a great treasure; we have a great cause.\n\n  America's freedom, and the values that protect us in the face of \nevil, are our great and glorious cause. We rededicate ourselves to it \ntoday, to our prolonged achievement of the centuries, with humble pride \nand righteous fury, as we seek to make of this world a better, safer \nplace for all.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we cannot undo the grave events that took \nplace on Tuesday or bring back the loved ones that so many families \nhave lost or quickly restore the sense of security that Americans took \nfor granted. But with resolve and determination we can take actions to \nroot out those who perpetrated these dastardly and heretofore \nunimaginable events.\n  There should be no question in the minds of those who are responsible \nfor these attacks, or in the minds of those who have aided and abetted \nthem, that the United States will take all necessary and appropriate \nsteps to respond and to prevent them from undertaking additional \nattacks against our country. In keeping with our very values that were \nunder attack this week, we must respond rationally and judiciously, not \nout of anger and sadness.\n  This resolution leaves no doubt that the Congress is united in full \nsupport of the President. We have given the President the authority \nthat he needs to respond to this unprecedented attack on American \ncitizens on U.S. soil. This resolution allows the President to use all \nnecessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, \nor individuals who are responsible for this attack and against those \nwho helped or harbored them. But it does not give the President a \nblanket approval to take military action against others under the guise \nof fighting international terrorism. It is not an open-ended \nauthorization to use force in circumstances beyond those we face today. \nUnder the Constitution the President has the authority to act if there \nis an imminent attack on the United States. That authority is \nrecognized in this resolution.\n  The tragedy our Nation experienced this week brought home to every \nAmerican the reality of terrorism. Now we must respond. That response \nmust be forceful and unequivocal. I am confident it will be.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the attack on the United States this \nweek leaves all of us jolted and angered. To respond to this terror is \nboth our fate and our challenge. Our response to that attack must \nreflect our national character. As a great Nation, we must respond \npowerfully. But our response must be guided by justice and by our right \nto self defense, not by vengeance. We must act to hold accountable \nthose responsible for these terrorist attacks. But to be true to our \ntraditions and our Founders, we must act within the confines of the \nConstitution and the law. I believe that the resolution before us \nachieves that goal.\n  The War Powers Resolution of 1973 explicitly recognizes the \nPresident's authority to take immediate action as Commander in Chief of \nthe United States Armed Forces to respond to this unprovoked attack on \nthe United States. As such, there is no reason to suggest that the \naction we take here today is required in advance of any immediate \nmilitary response by the President. In the interest of demonstrating \nour national resolve to act firmly and decisively, however, and as a \ndemonstration of our commitment to working in close cooperation with \nour Commander in Chief to respond to this aggression, we act today to \nauthorize the use of force, as required by the War Powers Resolution.\n  I commend the President and his administration for seeking the \nresolution before us today, for working with the Congress, and for \nrecognizing the requirement under the Constitution and the law for \njoint authorization. As well, I commend those who negotiated the \nspecific language of this resolution, and in particular, Senators \nBiden, Levin, and Kerry. They deserve our thanks for insisting that we \nhonor the War Powers Resolution.\n  Like any legislation, this resolution is not perfect. I have some \nconcern that readers may misinterpret the preamble language that the \nPresident has authority under the Constitution to take action to deter \nand prevent acts of international terrorism as a new grant of power; \nrather it is merely a statement that the President has existing \nconstitutional powers. I am gratified that in the body of this \nresolution, it does not contain a broad grant of powers, but is \nappropriately limited to those entities involved in the attacks that \noccurred on September 11. And I am particularly gratified that this \nresolution explicitly abides by and invokes the War Powers Resolution.\n  In taking this action today, we are not responding to a distant \nthreat to\n\n[[Page S9418]]\n\ninternational peace and security; we are responding to a direct attack \non the United States. This is not a humanitarian response to a foreign \ncrisis, but a defensive action to protect the lives of Americans here \nat home.\n  At the same time, we must recognize that this war will be unlike any \nother we have fought in the past. Our enemy is not a state with clearly \ndefined borders. We must respond instead to what is quite likely a \nloose network of terrorists that do not function according to a strict \nhierarchy. We must respond to a highly mobile, diffuse enemy that \noperates largely beyond the reach of our conventional war-fighting \ntechniques.\n  Given the immense difficulties involved in identifying our enemies, \nwe must take great care to guard against making mistakes as we pursue \nthem across an obscured terrain. We must not act on misguided \nprejudices or incomplete information. We must not cause needless harm \nto innocent bystanders. Our response will be judged by friends and \nfoes, by history, and by ourselves. It must stand up to the highest \nlevel of scrutiny: It must be appropriate and constitutional.\n  Within this confusing scenario, it will be easy to point fingers at \nan ever increasing number of enemies, to believe that the ``the enemy'' \nis all around us, that the enemy may even be our neighbor. The target \ncan seem to grow larger and larger every day, before the first strike \neven occurs. And this, of course, is exactly what the terrorists want. \nThey seek to inflate their numbers and their influence by retreating \ninto the shadows. They seek to turn us against each other, and to turn \nus against our friends and allies across the world, but we will not \nallow this to happen.\n  We must also take great care to maintain a careful distinction \nbetween those organizations or states that have knowingly harbored or \nassisted terrorists, and those that have acted carelessly in providing \nunintended aid or shelter. We must punish those who have knowingly \nsupported our enemy, we must strengthen the capacity of all others to \nrespond appropriately. We must invite those who have unintentionally \nharbored terrorists to work with us to locate them, to eliminate them, \nto renounce them, and to begin a new era of vigilance, if they are to \nbe regarded as friends of the United States.\n  Our fight against a faceless, shadow enemy also raises another \ndifficult dilemma, for how will we know when we have defeated this \nenemy? How can we tell whether our enemy has merely regrouped to strike \nagain on another day or at another hour? There can be no peace treaty \nwith such an enemy, but there must be a lasting and discernible peace. \nWe should consider this in determining the frequency and duration of \nconsultations between the Congress and the President over the conduct \nand status of this demanding struggle.\n\n  We enthusiastically support our President as he prepares the response \nto this unparalleled attack. The President has two paths open to him, \nas any President would under the Constitution. On the one hand, he may \nact using his powers as Commander in Chief, while remaining subject to \nthe terms of the War Powers Resolution for any sustained action. Or on \nthe other hand, he may seek a declaration of war under Article I of the \nConstitution.\n  If this is indeed to be a war, then the President should seek a \ndeclaration of war. We cannot allow our cherished Constitution to \nbecome a dead letter. And it should go without saying that to declare a \nwar, he must identify our adversary.\n  If this will be something short of a war in the broadest sense, then \nit is proper that we will pass a resolution that gives such broad \npowers to the President that he could thereby conduct a full-scale war \nacross the globe without the consent of Congress. This would, as well, \nfly in the face of the structure that our Constitution sets up.\n  The drafters of the War Powers Resolution sought to fulfill the \nintent of the Framers of the Constitution and to ensure that the \ncollective judgment of both the Congress and the President would apply \nto the introduction of U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities.\n  In today's world, when candor and cooperation between co-equal \nbranches of government seem paramount, the War Powers Resolution has \nbecome a bit like the family relative that nobody wants to talk about. \nBut we need to talk about it. Our legislative horizons need to move \nbeyond the era when a President could secretly deploy thousands of \ntroops in Cold War struggles outside of the view of a television \ncamera.\n  There is only one circumstance in which a President may act without \nstatutory authorization, and that is to respond to legitimate \nemergencies. None among us doubt that we confront such an emergency \ntoday, and that it may grow into a sustained struggle.\n  The Constitution foresaw and history has since demonstrated that \nthere will continue to be events to which the President must respond in \nthe defense of the country, or in response to urgent and vital \ninterests abroad.\n  Congress owns the war power. But by this resolution, Congress loans \nit to the President in this emergency. In so doing, we demonstrate our \nrespect and confidence in both our Commander in Chief and our \nConstitution.\n  Emergencies can well demand a response of such decisiveness, secrecy, \nor dispatch that can only be provided by the President as Commander in \nChief. But even when emergencies occur, it is our tradition for the \nPresident to act, and then seek what has been called \n``indemnification'' from the Congress.\n  In prosecuting the Korean War, President Truman decided not to do \nthat in 1950. And his decision is widely viewed as the most egregious \nabuse of constitutional war powers in the history of the United States. \nPresident Eisenhower's more constructive working relationship with \nCongress was tempered by the Truman experience.\n  Even President Johnson, the father of the Tonkin Gulf resolution, \nconsidered Truman to have made a serious error in failing to seek \ncongressional authorization.\n  As one U.S. Congressman has said: ``Allow the President to invade a \nneighboring nation, whenever he shall deem it necessary to repel an \ninvasion, and you allow him to do so, whenever he may choose to say he \ndeems it necessary for such purpose--and you allow him to make war at \npleasure.''\n  Those were the words of Congressman Abraham Lincoln. Years later, at \nthe outbreak of the Civil War, President Lincoln himself deployed U.S. \nArmed Forces without the authorization of Congress, but later told the \nCongress that these actions, whether strictly legal or not, were \nventured upon under what appeared to be a popular demand and public \nnecessity, trusting then, as now, that Congress would readily ratify \nthem.\n  Thus Lincoln explicitly sought congressional approval of his \nemergency actions by statute. He never claimed to have full and \nindependent constitutional support for his initiatives.\n  Congressional ratification was an essential legitimating step for his \nactions. Later the Supreme Court upheld his action in the famous 1863 \nprize cases.\n  So, by this resolution, Congress vouchsafes the legitimacy of a \nstruggle that must have the continuing approval of the representatives \nof the people. It is the framework for a continuing consensus and \ncommunicates support to our President in this emergency. We acknowledge \nthat this legitimate emergency permits the President to act \nunilaterally without turning our back on who wields the war power under \nthe Constitution, and we trust that if he does, he will turn to \nCongress to legitimize his actions as appropriate. We have made clear \nthat our support for appropriate action will be forthcoming. And we \ntrust that, by taking up this resolution at this time, there will be no \nneed for after-the-fact measures such as indemnification, no question \nin anyone's mind about our resolve and commitment.\n\n  I take pains to raise these issues because they matter, they go to \nthe core of our Constitution and the brilliant separation of powers \nthat guard our democracy. Unfortunately, there have been too many cases \nin which we have been asked to make loans of the war power in other \nthan emergency situations. As many of our colleagues said during the \n1994 debate regarding Haiti, it is not enough to seek the approval of \nthe U.S. Security Council or of a regional alliance like the OAS or \nNATO only then to ignore the role, the central role, of the United \nStates Congress.\n\n[[Page S9419]]\n\n  I also recognize that power-of-the-purse legislation relating to the \ncommitment of U.S. armed forces is an available remedy, but not an \nideal model. The distinguished President Pro Tempore, Senator Byrd, in \ntestimony before the Foreign Relations Committee in February 1994, \nlikened the power of the purse to a watering hole in the forest to \nwhich all the animals eventually must come to drink. I agree with the \ndistinguished President Pro Tempore's characterization; the power of \nthe purse is an excellent and effective tool in most matters for which \nwe appropriate public funds.\n  But I worry, nonetheless, about how close we would come to a \nconstitutional crisis if we were to rely on such measures as a last \nresort in a war powers struggle with the President. In a way, it \nillustrates our level of urgency about preserving our constitutional \nwar power responsibilities, and they risk infringement upon the \nPresident's equally valid constitutional responsibilities as Commander \nin Chief.\n  The War Powers Resolution is as relevant today as it was enacted in \n1973.\n  It is all too apparent that the post-Cold War environment has ushered \nin an era of threats unforeseen by the founders. These threats \nreinforce the need for the Congress to make its will known when our \ntroops are to be deployed in potentially dangerous situations.\n  While I believe that the heinous acts perpetrated against the United \nStates by still-unidentified terrorists on September 11, 2001, could \njustify U.S. and allied military action, I believe that any such \nactions, if they are to be sustained, must be properly authorized by \nthe Congress.\n  Since coming to the Senate in 1993, I have encouraged discussion and \nvigorous congressional debate regarding the situations in Haiti, \nBosnia, and Kosovo because of my conviction that Congress has both a \nright and a duty to express its will about the wisdom of committing our \ntroops to a potential conflict. Many of these instances were not \nadequately considered and did not follow an appropriate Congressional \nauthorization.\n  That same conviction makes it essential that the Congress should make \nits will known. We must not abdicate our responsibility to the victims \nof September 11, and to the mothers and fathers, the sons and \ndaughters, the wives and husbands of our servicemen and women, who for \nus will be the point of the sword of justice.\n  Moreover, abiding by the constitutional and statutory scheme in this \ncase is not only the right thing to do as a matter of law, but it is \nalso the most effective thing to do. Because it follows the \nconstitutionally and statutorily prescribed procedures, this resolution \nwill strengthen our nation's efforts. Our careful and deliberate acts \nin this Congress are the manifestation of the will of the American \npeople, and we will marshal that mighty force behind our President and \nour military. When we abide by our Constitution and our law, we are as \nstrong as we possibly can be, and we are far stronger than the \nmalevolent force that we soon will engage.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in full support of S.J. Res. 23, \nauthorizing the use of the U.S. Armed Forces against those responsible \nfor the recent attacks launched against the United States.\n  As the President and many of my colleagues have asserted since the \nheinous acts of Tuesday past, we are at war. In fact, we have actually \nbeen at war against terrorists for a long time, but seldom has it \ntouched our shores. The time has come for us, and for our allies, to \nact with all appropriate force to remove the threat of similar acts \noccurring on our soil, or the soil of other free nations.\n  As the President has stated, America is the primary target because we \nare the shining beacon of freedom and democracy. In recent days, our \nallies have recommitted themselves to the support of those ideals, and \nthey have pledged their support for the actions that must be taken in \nresponse to the murderous crimes of September 11.\n  With so much of the world behind us, there will never be a better \ntime for us to make a concerted effort to rid outselves of the threat \nof terrorism. Today we have put partisan politics behind us and created \na joint resolution that authorizes the President to use ``all necessary \nand appropriate force'' against the terrorists who perpetrated these \nacts and the countries of organizations that supported, aided and \nharbored them.\n  We stand united in our resolve to take whatever actions are deemed \nnecessary by the President to defeat the enemy--terrorism.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the joint resolution \nauthorizing the use of U.S. Armed Forces against those responsible for \nthe recent act of war against this Nation, to deter future attacks, and \nto disable the machinery of terror.\n  With the end of the cold war came the hope of even greater prosperity \nand freedom for people the world over. That promise has been threatened \nand attacked in the most vicious and monstrous assault on American soil \never. But make no mistake, it has not been squelched. The forces of \nevil have had their day. Now, we will have ours.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that this is a defining moment not only \nfor the United States, but for the principles and ideals for which it \nstands. It comes down to this: Either you stand with those principles \nand ideals, or you stand against them. Unlike almost any other issue we \ndebate on this floor, this matter is that simple.\n  Either we move to crush those who disregard human life on a massive \nscale, or we surrender humanity to the hands of madmen. Either we send \nthe message that the world will not be a hostage to terror, or we \nsubmit to an infinite cycle of hopeless victimization. That is our \nchoice. It is that simple.\n  But just because the choice is simple does not mean the decision is \neasy. To the contrary, there is nothing more difficult than committing \nour troops to a dangerous mission. While we do not yet know what form \nthat mission will be, we know it will require tremendous sacrifice. \nThis is the one vote that not a single one of us ever wants to make, \nbut now we must make.\n  I well remember being in the White House in January of 1991, at a \nmeeting in the Cabinet room to discuss the use of force in the Persian \nGulf. During the meeting, the President excused himself to take a call \nfrom the Secretary of State on the progress of the talks with the Iraqi \nforeign minister. When he returned, the look on his face told me the \ntalks had failed. Force would have to be used. I will never forget that \nmoment. I will never forget this moment--none of us will.\n  Winston Churchill, in preparing his nation for the full onslaught of \nthe Axis blitzkrieg, told his fellow countrymen, ``Let us therefore \nbrace ourselves to our duty.'' All of us--here in Washington and \nthroughout the country--must brace ourselves for the duty before us. \nThere will be days of triumph, and days of tears. But in the end, we \nknow that our cause is just, and we know we will prevail.\n  Whoever is responsible for this heinous act against humanity must \nknow the full force of our fury. How tragic it is that we must return \nsuffering for suffering, but we know from the history of human \nexperience that it is a price we must be prepared to pay in defense of \nliberty. Sadly, from all we know of these faceless cowards, it is the \nonly dialogue they and others like them understand. For them, the \nlanguage of violence is the only language they speak. For them, the \ntaking of life is the apex of human expression.\n\n  That is not the world I want for us. That is not the world I want for \nour children. Terrorism is quite literally a cancer in the body \npolitick, elusive by its nature, insidious in its stealth, and \nrequiring the most early detection and eradication possible. And that \nis what we intend to do. Either that, or terrorism will destroy the \nrule of law from the inside out, along with the basic tenets by which \nwe are able to live together and thrive and enjoy ``life, liberty and \nthe pursuit of happiness'' in a civilized society.\n  We must remember that this unprovoked attack was on soil that is \nAmerican, against ideals that are global. Indeed, two of the very \ntargets themselves, the twin towers of the World Trade Center, were \ninternational buildings rooted in U.S. ground. The lives that were \nlost--American, Australian, British, and countless others--are in a way \nsymbolic of the freedom that was lost not only in the United States, \nbut in countless nations across every hemisphere of the globe.\n\n[[Page S9420]]\n\n  So while we may lead the charge, we do not stand alone. The North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization to which we have pledged our unyielding \nsupport, as well as many other nations beyond those we might consider \nour traditional and closest allies, will now be there in support of our \nmission, a mission that ultimately is larger than any one Republic, any \none people.\n  In this particular instance, right now, we know not against whom we \naim. For that reason, it is all the more important we give the \nPresident broad latitude to take whatever action is necessary to punish \nthe perpetrators and help ensure that such a catastrophe never \nreoccurs. This Joint Resolution grants the President discretion in \ndestroying the soul of whatever organization has jabbed at the heart of \ndemocracy. It is a resolution born of necessity, and rooted in \nprecedent.\n  In 1962, when Cuba posed the threat of spreading communism and \nendangering the security of the United States, Congress approved a \njoint resolution stating that the United States will use force if \nnecessary to halt the spread of communism in this hemisphere. The \nresolution declared that the United States was determined to prevent, \nby whatever means necessary, including the use of arms, the Marxist \nLeninist regime in Cuba from extending, by force or the threat of \nforce, its aggressive or subversive activities to any part of this \nhemisphere, and to prevent in Cuba the creation or use of an externally \nsupported military capability endangering the security of the United \nStates.\n  On January 12, 1991, in the wake of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, \nboth houses of Congress passed the ``Authorization for Use of Military \nForce Against Iraq Resolution'', which I supported. The resolution \nauthorized the President to use the U.S. Armed Forces pursuant to U.N. \nSecurity Council Resolution 678 to achieve implementation of the \nearlier Security Council resolutions calling for the repulsion of Iraq \nfrom Kuwait.\n  On January 16, former President Bush made the determination required \nby the Resolution that diplomatic means had not and would not compel \nIraq to withdraw from Kuwait. On January 18, he reported to Congress \n``consistent with the War Powers Resolution'' that he had directed U.S. \nforces to commence combat operations.\n  Now, we are faced with the bloodiest attack ever on American soil, \nthe first of this magnitude in this history of the continental United \nStates. This resolution states that the President is ``authorized to \nuse all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, \norganizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, \nor aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, or \nharbored such organization or persons, in order to prevent any future \nacts of international terrorism against the United States by such \nnations, organizations or persons.''\n  This resolution, consistent with the War Powers Resolution, is \nprecisely the right course for the Congress to take at this momentous \njuncture in American history. Our thoughts and prayers are with all the \nmen and women of our Armed Services, who will be at the vanguard of our \nstruggle against whatever evil force has darkened the world.\n  We cannot allow these forces of darkness to take root in the fertile \nsoil of this new century. Rather, the time has come to eradicate terror \nat its roots. We have no choice if we are to remain the authors of our \nown destiny, a destiny that has no room for those who would shackle \nfreedom with the twin specters of fear and violence. It is time to \nunleash the full resources and force and determination of this great \nnation against this unimaginable evil. This atrocity cannot stand, and \nlet history one day record that it did not stand.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the bipartisan \nresolution to authorize the use of force and the emergency supplemental \nappropriation to help our nation recover and respond to this vicious \nterrorist atrocity.\n  The use-of-force resolution authorizes the President to use force \nagainst any nations, organizations, or persons involved in the \nterrorist attacks last Tuesday and to take all appropriate steps to \nprevent future acts of terrorism against the United States. This is an \nappropriate and needed response to the vicious and horrifying recent \nattacks on America.\n  Those who murder American citizens must find no hiding place, and \nthose who harbor terrorists must pay the price. America must be \ndecisive and effective in apprehending terrorists and identifying and \npunishing those who give them support.\n  Our Government is working hard to find the perpetrators of this \ncrime, and this effort deserves the full support of Congress. Our \nresponse to these atrocities will and must be strong and decisive.\n  At the same time, we all agree that our response must not be \nindiscriminate. We should only act when we are certain who the \nperpetrators of these atrocities are.\n  These shameful attacks demonstrated America's vulnerability to \nterrorist attacks, and an effective and appropriate response is \nessential. Despite our efforts to prevent terrorism, a vast \ninternational network of terrorists has been organized to work against \nAmerica's interests at home and abroad. We cannot permit these \nterrorists to succeed.\n  These atrocities have strengthened our resolve to root out the \nterrorist network and protect the safety of American citizens at home \nand abroad. Our resolve is strong to defend and uphold democracy and \nfreedom, the founding principles that have made our Nation great. We \nshould spare no resources to protect these profound values.\n  The need for extra resources cannot be understated. The devastation \ncaused by the attacks in New York and at the Pentagon have already \ndwarfed the largest recent catastrophe, Hurricane Andrew, where losses \nwere estimated at over $18 billion.\n  This emergency supplemental appropriations bill provides $40 billion \nfor the full range of response, recovery, relief, and repair efforts to \nhelp Federal, State, and local governments to support counterterrorism \nactivities to carry out the investigations and eventual prosecution of \nthose who committed these acts and to guarantee increased security for \nour nation's airports.\n\n  These funds will enable America's law enforcement agencies to \ncontinue their urgent efforts to identify all persons who were involved \nin these atrocities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has launched \nthe largest investigation in its history, involving more than 4,000 \nspecial agents and 3,000 support personnel. At the crime scenes in New \nYork, Virginia, and Pennsylvania FBI agents are sifting through the \nwreckage to identify the terrorists and their victims, and to locate \nweapons, flight recorders, and other items that will enable us to \nunderstand how these crimes occurred. Across the nation and around the \nworld, agents are pursuing thousands of leads about the suspected \nperpetrators and supporters of these terrorist acts.\n  FBI Director Robert Mueller has expressed a total, unwavering \ncommitment to the challenge. We in Congress are committed to providing \nfull resources to it and all other federal law enforcement agencies \ninvolved in this investigation. We will do whatever it takes.\n  Our airports must also be made secure. Some of these funds should be \nused for hiring additional sky marshals, so that they can be deployed \non domestic flights. Funding should also be allocated to effective \nbaggage screening technologies, airport personnel training, and \nbackground checks.\n  Additional resources are clearly needed to win this all-important \nbattle against terrorism. All of our counterterrorism assets must be \nstrengthened--in the military, in our intelligence community, and in \nour public health infrastructure including needed steps to counter the \nthreat of biological weapons in the hands of terrorists.\n  This week's devastating attacks in New York and at the Pentagon are a \ncall for action not only to respond forcefully against the perpetrators \nof these outrages, but also to strengthen our defenses against future \nattacks. A central part of this effort must be to improve the Nation's \npreparedness against biological terrorism. The Office of Emergency \nPreparedness estimates that 40 million Americans could die if a \nterrorist released smallpox into the American population; Anthrax could \nkill 10 million.\n\n[[Page S9421]]\n\n  We must strengthen our national capacity to prevent such attacks, and \nalso to detect, monitor, and contain any plague released by a \nbioterrorist attack. The troops in the front line of the battle against \nbioterrorism will be medical and public health workers. We must give \nthem the weapons they need to win that battle.\n  Finally, in the aftermath of this week's attacks, as we reach out and \ncome together as a nation, we must also deal with the profound \npsychological impact of these events on the victims and their families, \non the many emergency personnel who responded so courageously to this \ncrisis, and on the large number of children across the country who have \nalso been affected. It is my hope that a high priority of the resources \nbeing appropriated by this legislation will be used to make post-trauma \nservices and support widely available to all those who need them.\n  Again, I commend President Bush for his strong commitment to win the \nongoing battle against terrorism, and I commend as well, the strong \nbipartisan spirit in which Congress has joined in this all-important \ncommitment. America will be a stronger nation because of this attack.\n\n\n                          Vote On S.J. Res. 23\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the joint resolution.\n  The joint resolution was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 23\n\n       Whereas, on September 11, 2001, acts of treacherous \n     violence were committed against the United States and its \n     citizens; and\n       Whereas, such acts render it both necessary and appropriate \n     that the United States exercise its rights to self-defense \n     and to protect United States citizens both at home and \n     abroad, and\n       Whereas, in light of the threat to the national security \n     and foreign policy of the United States posed by these grave \n     acts of violence, and\n       Whereas, such acts continue to pose an unusual and \n     extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign \n     policy of the United States,\n       Whereas, the President has authority under the Constitution \n     to take action to deter and prevent acts of international \n     terrorism against the United States.\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Authorization \n     for Use of Military Force''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) That the President is authorized to use all necessary \n     and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, \n     or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or \n     aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, \n     2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to \n     prevent any future acts of international terrorism against \n     the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.\n       (b) War Powers Resolution Requirements.--\n       (1) Specific statutory authorization.--Consistent with \n     section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, the Congress \n     declares that this section is intended to constitute specific \n     statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5(b) of \n     the War Powers Resolution.\n       (2) Applicability of other requirements.--Nothing in this \n     resolution supersedes any requirement of the War Powers \n     Resolution.\n\n\n                           three in 29 years\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as of today, during my nearly 29 years in \nthe Senate, I have missed a total of three votes because of ``traffic \njams.'' The first was during my 4th year in the Senate. The other two \noccurred this morning when I was unable to get to the Senate Chamber in \ntime to cast my affirmative votes for H.R. 2888 and S.J. Res. 23, both \nof which were approved without a dissenting vote.\n  Needless to say, I deeply regret I was unable to reach the Senate \nChamber in time to vote for the two critical measures approved by the \nSenate today.\n  The enormity of Tuesday's terrorist attacks is proving more apparent \nevery day. It is obvious that the lives of all Americans have changed \nas a result of these heinous crimes against the United States and, \nindeed, all civilization.\n  Needless to say, I strongly support the Senate's giving President \nBush the authority to root out and destroy the heinous terrorists \nresponsible for such brutality and also, of course, the governments \nharboring them. Needless to say, I support the necessary funding to \nenable the President to begin this solemn responsibility. I commend the \nSenate, of course, for its responsible and appropriate actions to \nprovide sufficient funding to help the recovery effort in New York, \nWashington, D.C. and elsewhere.\n  This is only the beginning of the resources Congress must provide to \neradicate the terrorists that perpetrated such horrific violence \nagainst America and the American people.\n  Mrs. Helms and I join our fellow Americans in mourning the victims \nand praying for their loved ones, and we also share the resolve to \nfight terrorism in any form, by any available means, unless and until \nwe are confident that America will never again have a day like Tuesday, \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9421-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9421-S9422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n\n                           Order of procedure\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there is a time to talk and there is a \ntime to act. The Senate today has unanimously acted with force, with \nresolve, and with unanimity. We spoke for the people of our country \nabout the heinous situation in which we find ourselves, and also about \nthe resolve to keep this from happening again.\n  We have passed a resolution giving the President of the United States \nour support and authorization for the use of military force against any \nperson or any country that is helping the people who did the despicable \nacts of September 11. I heard a young woman on television this morning \nwhose brother was lost in one of the World Trade Center Towers. The \nyoung woman was asked what she thought the response of the United \nStates should be. She said, ``I don't really want to go to war. I just \ndon't want anyone else to have to suffer what I am suffering today.'' I \njust want to say to that young woman, and to all of the other families \nof the victims of September 11, 2001, that it is exactly what we did \ntoday that will prevent other people in the future from suffering what \nshe is suffering.\n  If we do not respond with force, we will put American lives in \njeopardy, and we will not be doing our job of protecting the people of \nour country whom we were elected to protect.\n  No one would ever have the United States move before we had absolute \nevidence about who perpetrated this atrocity, but when we have that \nevidence, we are going to move.\n  The Senate is speaking today in support of the President to take \nmilitary action against those who have attacked our country, our \npeople, our way of life, our very freedom.\n  The most important responsibility I believe I have as a Senator is to \nkeep the freedom that so many have died for in past years for our \ncountry. We are the beacon of freedom in the world. We are a democracy \nthat has proven that, through our voting capabilities, we can become \nthe strongest nation on Earth. It is freedom that is the foundation of \nthe democracy and our way of life.\n  To make sure we keep the freedom we have known--our mothers, fathers, \ngrandmothers, and grandfathers have known--for our children and \ngrandchildren, we must act decisively when an act of war has been \nperpetrated on innocent people of our country.\n  As to the act that occurred on September 11--a day we will never \nforget in our lifetime, nor will our children or grandchildren ever \nforget--the only way we can respond to that kind of attack on our \npeople and our freedom is to say we will fight, not just today or next \nmonth or 2 months from now, but we are in this for the long haul, and \nwe are going to rid the world of the despots who believe they can prey \non innocent citizens against freedom-loving people in the world.\n  I am proud of the Senate. I am proud that we did not dillydally \naround to say, ``I wonder what we ought to do,'' but we are putting our \nfaith in the President of the United States, our military forces, and \nour leaders who have the decisionmaking capabilities and the control of \nthe military to act on our behalf and on behalf of the people of our \ncountry to assure that this will not happen again, and the force that \nwe use will have the appropriate impact to protect ourselves and our \nfreedom-loving allies wherever they may be in the world.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, my mom has an expression: Out of every \ntragedy, something good will come if you look hard enough.\n  I know the Presiding Officer, if he will forgive this point of \npersonal reference, has had his share of personal tragedy. Everyone in \nthis Chamber has. Some of us have gotten those phone calls that the \npeople in New York are getting from cell phones and/or from a police \nofficer and/or from a morgue.\n  We know there is not a darn thing we can do now for those people \nexcept--it is strange the way human nature works, and I know the \nPresiding Officer knows this--except it is amazing how those people in \nthat circumstance draw strength from the knowledge that other people \nunderstand their pain, that other people empathize with them, that \nother people care about what they are going through. It amazes me that \nyou can draw strength from that.\n  I think what we are doing and the Nation is doing is the right thing. \nMost important, what we did today should be noted is not likely to \noccur in any other country in the world, and that is, that we just a \nfew moments ago operated under the rule of law.\n  In all our anger, all our frustration, all our feelings, very \nbluntly, of hatred that exists now for those who perpetrated the act \nagainst us, we did not pell-mell just say: Go do anything, anytime, \nanyplace, Mr. President; you have to just go. We operated as our \nFounders, who were not naive people, intended us to operate. We \noperated under the rule of law.\n  We went to our civil bible, the Constitution, and we said: What does \nit call for here? What it calls for is the U.S. Congress to meet its \nconstitutional responsibility, to say: Mr. President, we authorize you, \nin the name of the American people, to take action, and we define the \naction in generic terms which you can take.\n  We gave the President today, as we should have and as is our \nresponsibility, all the authority he needs to prosecute war against the \nindividuals or countries responsible, without yielding our \nconstitutional right to retain the judgment in the future as to whether \nor not force against others could, should, or would be used.\n  That is remarkable. I suspect not many people know, other than my \ndistinguished colleague, the Senator from Texas, a former professor, \none of the brightest guys with whom I ever worked, unfortunately \nleaving the Senate at the end of his term; what the leading scholar in \nthe Senate, Senator Byrd, knows and what the experienced Senator from \nAlaska knows. My friend from Oklahoma is the only one in this place who \ncan fully understand, I suspect, along with his Oklahoma colleague, \nwhat our friends from New Jersey, New York, Virginia, the District, and \nMaryland are going through. He understands it. He has internalized it. \nHe knows it.\n  I believe it is fairly remarkable that, in spite of the reasons for \nthe attack on us and our way of life, we adhered to the rule of law; \nthat even in this calamity, we acted with dispatch but under the law, \nunder the Constitution.\n  The resolution provides the President clear authority ``to use all \nnecessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, \nor persons that he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided \nthe terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored \nsuch organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of \ninternational terrorism against the United States by such nations, \norganizations or persons.'' In short, the President is authorized to go \nafter those responsible for the barbaric acts of September 11, 2001 to \nensure that those same actors do not engage in additional acts of \ninternational terrorism against the United States.\n  The authority permits the President wide latitude to use force \nagainst the broad range of actors who were responsible for the \nSeptember 11 attacks. If any nation harbored the terrorists while they \nwere in training, that nation may be subject to American military \npower. If a nation or organization financed the operation, they may be \nsubject to American military power. It does not limit the amount of \ntime that the President may prosecute this action against the parties \nguilty for the\n\n[[Page S9423]]\n\nSeptember 11 attacks. We must all understand that the use of force will \nnot be easy or quick. In extending this broad authority to cover those \n``planning, authorizing, committing, or aiding the attacks'' it should \ngo without saying, however, that the resolution is directed only at \nusing force abroad to combat acts of international terrorism.\n  The authority granted is focused on those responsible for the attacks \nof September 11. The President's lawyers originally proposed that the \nresolved clause also include language authorizing military force to \n``deter and pre-empt any future acts of terrorism against the United \nStates.'' Of course, the President has the Constitutional authority to \ndeter terrorism through a broad range of means, including diplomatic \nmeasures, economic sanctions, seizing of financial assets, or \ndeployment of forces. The President must also ensure that Executive \nBranch agencies devote the necessary resources and apply the full \nmeasure of the federal criminal laws to deter, prevent and punish \nterrorism. Further, the President has the authority under the \nConstitution to use force to pre-empt an imminent attack, including a \nterrorist attack, against the United States. Rather than purporting to \nextend these authorities in the resolved clause, the final whereas \nclause reflects these recognized powers of the President.\n  I suggest what others have said, and that is, the President of the \nUnited States has our prayers, he has our good wishes, and he has our \ncommitment under the Constitution now to support him in what action he \ntakes as defined by the authority he has. That is a big deal. It is a \nbig deal. It is worth noting.\n  Lastly, I compliment the President on his patience, on his resolve, \nand his understanding of the need of certitude because the worst thing \nwe can do, as he is uniting the world, is to act precipitously to meet \nour instinct for response immediately. I compliment him. I compliment \nhis Secretary of State for the way he is handling this situation.\n\n  I conclude by saying that I do not see what happened on the 11th as \nthe beginning of the end of our way of life. I see it as the beginning \nof the end of terrorism as it has been able to be spawned over the last \nthree decades. The world has come face to face with the reality that \nnation states, no matter what their ideological disposition, are all in \njeopardy. We are united in understanding that we cannot allow these \nnetworks to be spawned.\n  I thank my colleagues for allowing me to speak at this moment. Again, \nI compliment them all, Democrat and Republican, in the way we have \nstood united.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today, in a bipartisan unanimous vote, we \ngave the President the money and the power to make war on those who \nhave made war on us.\n  We are down, it seems to me, to a stark and bitter choice: We can \nhunt down those who made war on us and make war on them where they \nlive, or we can allow them to make war on us where we live. We can \neither change our lifestyle, limit our freedom, reduce our prosperity, \nor we can change the lifestyle of those who have made war on us. I am \nnot indifferent to that choice. I subscribe to the thesis that when our \nenemies are on the run, they cannot have the resources and the \ncommunications to carry out the kind of terrorist war they carried out \nagainst the Pentagon and against the World Trade Center.\n\n  We have to be aware and we have to accept up front that if we go too \nfar in limiting our freedom or our prosperity in trying to fight this \nwar, then we are ceding the very thing the war is about. So I believe \nvery strongly this money and this vast commitment of authority and \npower is meant to go after our enemies and to pursue them to the end of \nthe earth and to never let up in that process.\n  I do not believe this is going to be an easy war to fight, and I \nbelieve it is going to be a costly war to fight.\n  Our enemies have a hate for capitalism and for democracy that we \ncannot comprehend or understand. I believe until they are hunted down, \ncaptured, or killed we can never reestablish the safety we felt prior \nto last Tuesday.\n  I also want to make it clear that I believe we have to choose sides \nin this conflict. Those countries that harbor or abet or tolerate the \nactions of terrorists on their soil are making war against the United \nStates of America, and I believe that we have to hold them accountable.\n  Finally, I want to thank our leaders. I want to thank Senator Byrd, \nfor working to come up with a responsible appropriation. I think it is \nclear that under these circumstances, the Congress would literally be \nwilling to pass any appropriations bill and spend any amount of money. \nAs this conflict lengthens, as other priorities emerge, as we need more \nresources, as we ultimately will in this conflict, we will wish we had \nbeen responsible. I think we took an important and responsible first \nstep today. I personally believe we should set up a joint bipartisan \ncommittee with the job of overseeing these expenditures, just as the \nTruman Commission oversaw the expenditures of World War II. The job of \nthis committee would not be to determine how the money is spent but to \nsimply see it is being spent as we appropriate it; to see we are not \nbeing gouged in terms of prices when there is no competitive bidding, \nas there generally is not when you are doing things on an emergency \nbasis; to try and see that we are being good stewards of the taxpayers' \nmoney and getting the return on that money in comforting people who \nhave been hurt, helping those who have lost loved ones, rebuilding \nthings that have been destroyed, and prosecuting this war against our \nenemies.\n  It should be a joint bipartisan committee or commission to work with \nthe GAO to see the money is well spent, to see it is spent for the \npurposes we provided it, to see we are being charged reasonable prices, \nand to hold people accountable for things they do under emergency \nsituations in terms of prices that are charged. We did that in World \nWar II. Harry Truman did an excellent job, and the country benefitted \nfrom it.\n  It should obviously not be something on the scale of what we did in \nWorld War II, but something similar to that would be helpful. I intend \nnext week, when we come back, to talk about it. I hope my colleagues \nwill look at that idea, look back at what Harry Truman did in his \ncommittee in terms of following the expenditures on the war and how \nwell the money was being spent and holding people accountable.\n  I am proud of the Senate today, and I think we have a right to be \nproud. I believe the American people are proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, I be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma for his courtesy toward me. He was prepared to speak before I \nspeak. I offered to wait and have him go ahead but he said no, so I \nthank him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak \nfor not to exceed 7 minutes, and I ask the Chair indicate when I have 1 \nminute left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Today, the Senate passed the fiscal year 2001 Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act for Recovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks \non the United States.\n  Mr. President, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill adopted \nearlier today is an extraordinary response to extraordinary events. It \nsends a strong and unmistakable message to the world that the United \nStates is prepared to move swiftly on all fronts to respond to the \nhorrific attacks on our citizens and our territory. The unity and \ndetermination that have propelled this bill through Congress 72 hours \nafter the assault on America speaks volumes about the strength and \nresiliency of our system of government.\n  The supplemental provides $40 billion, to remain available until \nexpended, to respond to the terrorist\n\n[[Page S9424]]\n\nevents of September 11, 2001. This is an extraordinary bill that \nresponds to extraordinary events. The President has not presented the \nCongress with any detailed estimates of agency needs in response to \nthese terrorist acts. This is not a criticism. Federal Government \nagencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the Corps of Engineers, are on the ground, \nfocusing all of their attention on responding to the crisis.\n  Initially, the administration requested authority to spend any amount \nof money, for any purpose. The Constitution gives the power of the \npurse to the Congress. It is the Congress that has the responsibility \nto make sure that the needs of our people are met. This left my good \nfriend Senator Stevens and me with a dilemma. How do we meet the clear \nand immediate need for funding while protecting the prerogatives of \nCongress?\n  On Wednesday, Senator Stevens and I joined with our Senate leaders \nand the House leaders at a meeting with the President to discuss our \nresponse to these evil terrorist acts. At that meeting, I laid out four \ngoals for funding the Federal response. First, we must appropriate a \nspecific amount for particular purposes, not a blank check, not a Gulf \nof Tonkin Resolution, with ill-defined goals. Second, to reinforce bi-\npartisan unity, we must all have trust and candor on the use of these \nfunds. Third, the President must consult with the Congress in the \nallocation of the funds. Finally, there must be regular reporting to \nthe Congress.\n  Mr. President, the supplemental bill that the Senate approved today \nmeets each of those goals. The bill provides $40 billion, all \ndesignated by the Congress as an emergency, and is contingent on the \nPresident designating the full amount as an emergency.\n  Funds are available to: (1) provide Federal, State and local \npreparedness for mitigating and responding to the attacks; (2) provide \nsupport to counter, investigate, or prosecute domestic or international \nterrorism; (3) provide increased transportation security; (4) repair \npublic facilities and transportation systems damaged by the attacks; \nand (5) support national security.\n  Not less than $20 billion of the $40 billion is for disaster \nassistance and disaster recovery activities in New York, Virginia, \nPennsylvania and elsewhere.\n  Funds are available in three segments.\n  The President has $10 billion available to him after consultation \nwith the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Appropriations Committees.\n  The President has a second $10 billion available to him after the \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget has submitted to the \nHouse and Senate Committees on Appropriations a proposed allocation and \nplan for the use of the funds, and he then must wait 15 days. This will \nallow the Committees to review the President's plans and make \nsuggestions--possibly enter into some negotiations with the President \nor his Office of Management and Budget Director.\n  The President has an additional $20 billion available only when the \namounts are allocated to specific programs in a subsequent emergency \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I stress that this bill is just the first order of \nbusiness for Congress. This bill deals with what has already happened \nbut does not fully deal with it. Of course, even as scores of rescue \nworkers continue to sift the rubble of the World Trade Center and \nsearch for victims in the shattered wing of the Pentagon, we in \nCongress must start looking forward. We must take steps now--today, \ntomorrow, next week--to re-double our efforts to intercept would-be \nterrorists before they can launch an attack.\n  As most Americans, I am amazed by the sophistication, organization, \nand complexity of Tuesday's attacks on the United States. This was not \na casual effort or the work of a lone madman. These attacks took \nelaborate planning, significant manpower, and detailed knowledge of \nU.S. aircraft and aviation systems. I have great admiration for our \nnation's intelligence agencies. I believe that they provide tremendous \nservice to our nation with the resources they have, and I know that we \nrarely hear about their success stories. But it is, frankly, beyond \nbelief that such a massive and well-coordinated assault on our nation \ncould be executed without any discernable signals. It is beyond belief \nthat our nation, with its vast and powerful network of worldwide \nintelligence resources, could be caught so utterly unprepared.\n  It has long been acknowledged that to be forewarned is to be \nforearmed. Well, we have been forewarned. Now, we must focus our \nefforts on improving our intelligence-gathering systems so that we have \na chance to thwart a terrorist plot before it can be executed, before \ninnocent lives can be lost. The stunning attack on the heart of \nAmerica's military, financial, and transportation centers has exposed \nour vulnerabilities.\n  As we move quickly to provide assistance to the victims of these \nhorrible acts, to improve security at our airports, to rebuild the \nPentagon, and to repair the devastation of New York's financial \ndistrict, so must we move to rebuild our intelligence capabilities. \nThis emergency supplemental appropriations bill is the first step in a \nlong road that will not end in my lifetime. We must guard against being \nsidetracked by politics or partisanship.\n  There will still be politics. We have other things to do along with \nthese matters. There will still be some politics and some partisanship, \nbut we must not be sidetracked by politics or partisanship. Congress \nand the President have demonstrated this week that in times of crisis \nthere is no center aisle. There is no aisle between us. We can overcome \nour political differences and work together. Make no mistake about it, \nwe are in a time of crisis, and it is a time of suspended crisis. We \nwill weather this crisis, but it will last a long time. We will emerge \nstronger. We must work together to achieve that goal.\n  I close by commending Senator Ted Stevens, former chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee, a very valued Member of this body, for \nhis tireless strength and dedication and patriotism. I commend \nRepresentative Bill Young of Florida for his dedication to purpose, for \nhis cooperation, for his characteristic courtesy to those across the \nCapitol and across the aisle. I commend Representative David Obey for \nhis tenacity and determination, his patriotism, his dedication to the \nseparation of powers in this great country of ours--all of these people \nfor their outstanding contribution to this extraordinary bill. I could \nnot sit down without commending, also, the Speaker of the House, our \ntwo leaders, in particular, Mr. Daschle and Mr. Lott, and our excellent \nstaffs who have worked long hours and rendered invaluable assistance, \nwithout whom we could not succeed in this mighty effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized \nunder the previous order for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will identify myself with the remarks of \nthe previous speaker, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. He \nis a very wise man. He has thought this through. We have heard a lot of \nwisdom in the last few days in this Chamber.\n  Sometimes a child has an innocent wisdom that is more wisdom than \nanything we hear in this Chamber. My wife and I have four children and \nnine grandchildren. I can recall when my No. 2 son, who is now a hand \nsurgeon, was very small, I was teaching him how to ride a bicycle. We \nhave all had this experience, running beside them, and finally they are \nbalanced and they make the first trip around the block. He came up the \nhill panting away. He looked at me and said: Daddy, I wish the whole \nworld was downhill.\n  We know the whole world is not downhill. We think about these things. \nI had a phone call from my daughter, Molly, on Tuesday after this \ntragedy happened. She is a professor at the University of Arkansas, and \na very accomplished one. She has four children--three boys and a little \ngirl. In fact, the little girl she just adopted from Ethiopia. Her \nolder boys are Jason, age 5; the next one is Luke, who is 3 years old. \nShe was taking him to kindergarten.\n  On the way to kindergarten, they were listening to the radio. It is \nEd Koch speaking from New York. He said--I believe she told me--three \ntimes in a row: We need to kill bin\n\n[[Page S9425]]\n\nLaden. We need to kill bin Laden. We need to kill bin Laden.\n  Little 5-year old Jason looked at up and said: Mommy, who is bin \nLaden?\n  She said: bin Laden is a very evil, bad man.\n  He said this. He said: Instead of killing Mr. bin Laden, why don't we \ndo a powerful prayer, and we will build a powerful shield around him so \nthat he cannot hear the voices of the devil. He will only hear the \nvoice of God, and God will be in his heart.\n  I thought, that is the real intellect in America.\n  I believe that God is in the hearts of more Americans today than \nperhaps ever before. People realize that there is something bigger than \nwhat has been happening here on Earth.\n  I think because of four reasons I probably had more opportunities to \nrespond to this disaster than others. Those four reasons are: No. 1, I \nam on the Intelligence Committee; No. 2, I am on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee; No. 3, I am a licensed pilot; and No. 4, I am from \nOklahoma.\n  As far as being a pilot is concerned, I believe that since the \nretirement of John Glenn, Senator Glenn of Ohio, that leaves me as the \nlast active commercial pilot in the Senate.\n  I have been called by a lot of people in the media to talk about \nthose issues. For example, most of my pilot friends would have thought \nthe same as I did on Tuesday afternoon before any of the details came \nin, that virtually anyone who knew the basics of flying could take over \nan airplane that is already in the air and apply those basics to go hit \na target--until I heard some of the details--for example, the 757 that \nI believe we now know, after picking up these fragmented details--we \ncame to the conclusion, which may or may not be right, and we have \nexpressed them here on the floor--the 757 was headed for the White \nHouse and for some reason made a diversion, for reasons which we don't \nknow. Maybe that was the original plan. Maybe it was something that was \nthere that made him believe he could not make that target and he made \nan alternative target, which was the Pentagon. He made a very steep \n207-degree turn with the 757 at a low attitude, knowing there is such a \nthing as a high-speed stall with a high bank.\n  This guy knew what he was doing. He was an accomplished pilot, and he \nwent ahead and hit, I believe, what was the second target in his very \nwell executed terrorist act.\n  Second, as far as flying is concerned, one of my closest friends is--\nthis goes way back from the time we were in the House of \nRepresentatives together--Norman Mineta, a Democrat from California. \nBoth of us were on the Transportation Committee. He was chairman of the \nAviation Subcommittee and then the Transportation Committee. We became \nvery close friends.\n  In fact, when he was appointed by President Bush, I called him up. I \nsaid: Norm, who was the only Republican who openly supported you even \nover your Republican opponents during the years that you served in the \nHouse. He said: This must be Jim Inhofe.\n\n  We have had a chance to visit about this. I consider him a very close \nfriend.\n  There are some obvious things that can and will happen.\n  One, I think we all know that we need to have secured doors for the \ncockpit. That goes without saying. It is very elementary and something \nthat should probably have been done before.\n  Second, sky marshals: It is very important that we adopt a program so \nthat we have sky marshals.\n  Third--and this has come about recently. Someone was very critical of \nme recently--yesterday, I believe--because I have a hold on one of our \nPresident's nominations. He nominated someone to be the Customs \nCommissioner.\n  I have to share a frustration with you. When I was in the House in \n1988, when they had the Pan Am 103 disaster, Jim Oberstar, a Democrat, \ncame with me as a Republican to Europe to test certain types of \ndetection technologies out there that were better than what we had been \nthinking about.\n  We have to do something to have better detection technology used to \nprotect American travelers and the American people.\n  We found several. We came back, and we were unable to get anything \napproved, accepted, or even tried by Customs. They were locked into old \ntechnology. They weren't going to move from that technology.\n  I didn't do anything until 1995 and Oklahoma City, which is the site \nof the worst domestic, devastating attack by a terrorist in the history \nof this country--until this past week. I decided, again, after that, \nlet's see what we can do to try to get some new technology.\n  We discovered a technology called pulsed fast nutron analysis. It is \ncalled PFNA. This is a technology that not only shows through \nsomething, but for a sealed container, it has a three-dimensional view \nof what is inside. They can detect what substances are inside. They can \ndetect the chemical composition from within.\n  This is a possibility. I am not saying there is a great likelihood \nthat if we had this technology on Tuesday the tragedy might not have \nhappened because we would have been able to detect things we could not \notherwise detect.\n  We thought that this was worthwhile; let's go ahead and authorize it \nand ask the Director of Customs to have a side-by-side competition or \ntechnology competition. So we put that in some report language. Nothing \nhappened. They didn't do it.\n  I spoke to the previous--I will not mention by name--Customs \nCommissioner in my office. I said: Will you commit to having this \ncompetition that we have directed?\n  He said: Absolutely. I will.\n  And he didn't do it. I couldn't figure out why.\n  It wasn't until this happened Tuesday that I thought we couldn't wait \nany longer. That is when I put a hold on this man because I wanted a \ncommitment that this person who would be the Commissioner of Customs \nwould obey the law and have the competition. In fact, we actually put \nit in. It is in the appropriations bill over in the House. It has $3 \nmillion for the conduct of this competition down in El Paso, TX, and \ndirects them to do it.\n  The language is very clear. I have talked to Senator Dorgan and \nothers over here. They agree that this should be a part of it. I think \nSenator Stevens would agree with that, as well as the President.\n\n  I will leave that as the commitment that we are going to try that. As \ntechnology advances, we have to advance with it.\n  Getting back to Oklahoma, Senator Biden said something a few minutes \nago. He said that I am probably the only one here--prior to Tuesday--\nwho really understands the pain that goes with a disaster like that. Me \npointed towards me. This is because in 1995 we had that terrible, \ntragic blowing up of the Murrah Office Building. I have to say that \neven though a detection device would not have precluded that from \nhappening, it reminded me of the need for detection devices.\n  I wouldn't expect that the next terrorist attack on America--there \nwill be more--would come in the form of a 767 or 757. I don't think \nthat is going to happen. But we can still have that technology in \nplace.\n  I can remember at that time--I was reminded of this last night. Last \nnight, I went to the Pentagon. There are 194--I believe at the last \ncount--lives lost at the Pentagon, and 168 in Oklahoma in 1995. It is \nvery analogous. I stood there. I had tears in my eyes remembering 1995. \nI happened to be there right after it happened and hearing the \nthundering march of the volunteer firemen going into the Murrah Federal \nOffice Building before it was secure and coming out with bits of body \nparts; there were hands stuck in the wall; there was a lady, a doctor \nwent in and heroically amputated her leg so she could be pulled from \nthe rubbish. She is alive today.\n  I talked to Cindy Rice yesterday who lives in Oklahoma City. Her son, \nDavid, who we assume is dead today, called her. He was on the 104th \nfloor of one of the two towers. I am not sure which one. She wasn't \nsure which one. He called his mother. She said to me: David has always \nbeen a very spiritual boy. Right then I detected from this story that \nhe knew the Lord, and that he knew what was going to happen to him. And \nhe called, really in a sense of joy, saying: ``Mother, don't worry \nabout this. I'm going to be well taken care of.'' Here is a guy \ncalling, knowing he is about to die in the implosion of that building.\n\n  So these stories are out there, and we have heard so many of them. I \nthink\n\n[[Page S9426]]\n\nwe all have such a seriousness in our hearts for what happened, but I \nwould like to say this: People ask the question, Should we declare war? \nThere is all this talk about war. On whom do you declare war?\n  I think we need to stand back and look and see. Yes, we think we know \nthat Osama bin Laden was involved in this. It is not clear cut.\n  I remember so well, as I am sure the President pro tempore remembers, \nback in 1986 when, in a discotheque in Germany, there was a terrorist \nattack that ended up injuring many American soldiers and killing \nanother. At that time President Reagan was the President of the United \nStates, and we determined that Muammar Qadhafi did it. In a matter of \nhours after that took place, he dispatched, in addition to other \nplanes, the first real use of our first stealth plane, the F-111, to \nLibya. And they took them out. They bombed them. We have not heard from \nQadhafi since then. That was 15 years ago. This is not that easy. We do \nnot have the target out there. But we need to act just as decisively \nwhen that time comes. It would be a disservice to the American people \nand to our system and to America to do that before we know.\n  But lastly, and this is the most significant thing I want to visit \nwith--I do not say this critically of the previous administration--I am \nsaying that during the Clinton administration the priorities were \ndifferent than they were during the Reagan administration and the Bush \nadministration before him. He did not have the emphasis on defending \nAmerica and building a strong defense.\n  Now, as evidence of that, I have a couple of charts I have made for \nthis purpose. If you took the fiscal year 1993 budget, and you took all \nof the money that was appropriated in that budget for Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education, then that would be right at this point \nshown on the chart. Eight years after that, if you took the normal CPI, \nor any inflation figure you want to use--this is the index we use--and \nadded for inflation, then what he would have appropriated for Labor, \nHHS, and Education would be this red line shown on the chart. However, \nthis is what he did as shown on the green line. So at the end of 8 \nyears he ended up successfully asking for the appropriation of $150 \nbillion above the inflation rate.\n  If you took Defense and you used that same model, and you started \nwith fiscal year 1993, and took the amount that was appropriated at \nthat time, if you added for inflation, this is where it would be today \nshown on the chart with the red line. However, the green line shows us \nthe actual budget. So in that 8-year period, his request for \nappropriations, I say to Senator Stevens, was $375 billion below the \ninflation rate.\n  Those were his priorities, and he was elected President. I do not \nhave a problem with that. But I can tell you, we were saying all along \nwe were getting into a very serious problem.\n  I began to end every speech in 1995 with this phrase. I said: We, in \nAmerica, are in the most impaired and threatened position today than we \nhave ever been in the history of America.\n  It was not until 1998, when the Director of Central Intelligence \nhappened to be present, that I said this same thing in a meeting that \nwas broadcast live on C-SPAN, when I was chairing the Readiness \nSubcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. I said: Mr. Director, I \nhave been saying we are in the most threatened position today that we \nhave ever been in in the history of America.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  And he said: You are absolutely right.\n  So this is the Director of Central Intelligence. Now it comes in \nthree forms. First of all, our conventional capabilities are one-half \nof what they were in terms of force strength today. And the President \npro tempore knows this in terms of the number of Army divisions, \ntactical air wings, ships dropping from 600 down to 300.\n  No. 2, we have had all these deployments that have taken these rare \nassets and put them in the position where they are no longer usable.\n  No. 3--this is what I am getting to right now--we were on schedule to \nhave deployed a limited national missile defense system by fiscal year \n1998. We would have done that except for the vetoes of President \nClinton.\n  I carry with me his veto message of the 1993 Defense authorization \nbill when, I say to Senator Stevens, he said: I will continue to veto \nany bill that has money in it for a national missile defense system \nbecause the threat isn't there.\n  What people do not understand is, when you take down our military, \nyou are taking down our intelligence at the same time because the \nintelligence budget is tied to the Defense budget. So our quality of \nintelligence has deteriorated to the extent that in 1998, on August 24, \nwhen I had been asking for a response to a question--how many years \nwill it be when North Korea has a multiple-stage rocket capability?--\nthe answer came in a letter from General Shelton. It was dated August \n24, 1998. It said it will be between 5 and 10 years. A week later, on \nAugust 30, 1998, they deployed from North Korea a multiple-stage \nrocket. I say that not to criticize General Shelton, but the quality of \nour intelligence is not good.\n  What is the ultimate weapon of a terrorist? The ultimate weapon of a \nterrorist is a missile with a nuclear warhead. I really appreciated the \neditorial in this morning's Wall Street Journal. I will read one \nparagraph out of it in just a minute. But I want to say this: We have \nan opportunity now to take advantage of the fact that the No. 1 \npriority of America should be to defend ourselves against an incoming \nmissile.\n  Now they might argue, they might say: Only China and Russia and North \nKorea have a missile that will reach the United States of America from \nhalfway around the world. I think that may be true. On the other hand, \nwe do know that Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Pakistan--all these \ncountries--have weapons of mass destruction and have at least \nintermediate-range missiles. So that threat is there today.\n  So I only say that we need to get this done and get it done today.\n  I am going to read just the first paragraph and one of the last \nsentences of an editorial in this morning's Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Can anyone doubt that if the terrorists behind Tuesday's \n     attacks had had access to a ballistic missile, they would \n     have used it? Why settle for toppling the World Trade Center \n     if you can destroy all of New York in an instant, without \n     having to go to the trouble of sneaking a crew over the \n     border and arranging for pilot training in Florida?\n       . . . The President's plan for missile defense ought to go \n     forward with all speed.\n\n  I would say this, and ask it in a different way: Is there any doubt \nin anyone's mind in America that if an individual is willing to fly a \n767 into the towers in New York City, he would not be willing to deploy \na missile at the United States of America?\n  When I remember that screen, Mr. President--and you saw it, too--of \nNew York City, the skyline, and those two buildings imploding, if that \nhad been a nuclear warhead, there would be nothing but a cinder, and it \nwould not be 10,000 or 20,000 deaths; it would be millions.\n  I think this is an opportunity for us to make America strong again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, first, I thank the President pro tempore \nfor his kindness in his comments about me in this Chamber today.\n  As I sat in the chair, I was thinking about the fact that 37 years \nago, approximately, at about 5:30 in the evening, I got on a plane to \nfly to Fairbanks, AK, along with my great friend, Lowell Thomas, Jr.\n  Eight minutes after we took off, the largest earthquake to hit the \nNorth American continent in recorded times occurred. Somewhere around \nmidnight, Lowell Thomas and I had chartered a plane and rounded up some \nphysicians and nurses, and we flew back into Anchorage, landing at \nElmendorf Field near our hometown of Anchorage. And I had to walk from \nthat airfield over to my home in South Addition.\n  Flying in, we saw the Anchorage International Airport, and it looked \nas if it had been bombed. I walked home through fissures that were \nstill moving, some of them 20 and 30 feet deep.\n  That was the largest natural disaster we have had in the United \nStates.\n\n[[Page S9427]]\n\n  We have just witnessed the largest national disaster we have ever \nhad.\n  All of us have had varied feelings this past week, but mine have been \nreally concentrating on what we could do to help--those of us on the \ncommittee that the distinguished President pro tempore chairs, and I \nused to chair--along with our colleagues in the House.\n  I am delighted we have reacted in a way that shows we are prepared to \nfinance the recovery from these disastrous attacks. As I figure it, \nwhat we have appropriated, or at least earmarked for appropriations \ntoday--some $40 billion--is about $160 for every man, woman, and child \nin the country.\n  It is just the beginning. It is just the beginning. I appreciate what \nmy friend from Oklahoma just said because we have really not addressed \nthe need for the changes in our national defense and national security \napparatus. We will do that in time. I believe we may have heard for the \nlast time our people ask us, as we are talking about spending money to \nrestore our national defense capability, ``What is the threat?''\n  In past years, I have constantly been asked what the threat is. I \nhave tried to articulate that we didn't have one single threat coming \nat us from a monolithic empire, the Soviet Union, but that we had \nasymmetrical threats that were hard to conceive. We witnessed one of \nthose as our massive new aircraft were turned into bombs by those who \nare terrorists. And, obviously, as the distinguished President pro \ntempore said, we witnessed probably the most destructive singular \ncommand and control operation by a terrorist organization the world has \never seen.\n  I don't think it is over, Mr. President. That is why today I am proud \nI have been able to work with the President pro tempore and our \ncolleagues in the House, Congressmen Young and Obey, on this \nsupplemental appropriations bill so that it starts the process of \nrecovery and the process of being prepared--or trying to be prepared--\nfor future attacks against this country. But more than that, the \nresolution we have now adopted gives the President all the necessary \nand appropriate authority to use force against the persons or \norganizations that he determines planned, authorized, committed, or \naided in the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11.\n  Some people say that is a broad change in authorization to the \nCommander in Chief of this country. It is not. It is a very limited \nconcept of giving him the authority to pursue those who have brought \nthis terrible destruction to our country and to pursue those who have \nharbored them or assisted them and conspired with them in any way. I am \ndelighted that the resolution says that ``he determines,'' that the \nCommander in Chief is in control, in charge, to find a way to react \nagainst these people who have brought this destruction to our shores.\n  Mr. President, I commend you and those whom I am honored to work with \non Appropriations for having the courage to proceed. I have to say, we \nwere talking about $20 billion. The President met with the \nRepresentatives of New York and New Jersey and Virginia and decided \nthat wasn't enough. He sent word to us that he wanted $40 billion. \nThat, in the past, might have made all of us stumble a little bit. But \nI am delighted to see that all of us unanimously have said, yes, if he \nsays he needs that much money, he should know he has that much money. \nWe are going to review his plans and the requests of individual \nagencies, but we have committed $40 billion.\n  Mr. President, I have to say that nations have defining moments. We \nhad at least two in the 20th century--at the time when we entered World \nWar I and Pearl Harbor. This is really the first true defining moment \nof this country in this millennium, and I am proud of the Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I join my colleague at this momentous \ntime. I again recognize the President pro tempore and my senior Senator \nfor the role they have played in bringing together the Congress and the \nappropriate authorization of funding to meet this crisis in our Nation.\n  Mr. President, on Tuesday, I think we all learned the reality that \nthe decade of peace we have known as the post-Cold-War era probably has \nofficially ended. Things will not be the same. During the Cold War, the \nmap of the world could perhaps be divided into two; you were either a \nfriend or a foe.\n  In the 10 years after the Cold War, the map became much more \ndifficult to read. As we look back to Tuesday, the smoke rising from \nthe devastation, the map is again becoming clear. We are learning, with \nhorrifying swiftness, who our enemies in this new era will be.\n  Now we are faced with a task of, once again, dividing the world into \ntwo and asking the question: Are you friend or foe?\n  As we look at the decision that was made a short time ago by this \nbody to authorize the use of force against those responsible for the \nrecent attacks against the United States, we have to consider the \nconsequences. We can only guess what they might be. Some say the only \nway to get to bin Laden--if indeed he is the responsible individual--is \nwith ground troops. When people are speaking of having the stomach to \ndo what is needed to be done, they are thinking about having the \nstomach to face the reality that innocent people will be killed in that \nprocess, that Americans will die. It could be bigger than just a simple \noperation in Afghanistan to get to bin Laden. To get any troops to \nAfghanistan, you have to go through Pakistan or down from the north. \nWould they let us? We don't know. Would we have to initiate a ground \nwar from Pakistan first? We don't know. Will other Islamic nations just \nstand by? We don't know.\n  I think you can see where I am going. We are flirting with a world \nwar between Islam and the West and the unknown consequences. We can \nonly guess what bin Laden's program is. Is this exactly what he wants? \nIs that why he did this, if indeed he did? Well, we can read his \nspeeches and statements. It seems to be all right there. It seems that \nhe really believes Islam will beat the West. He figures if he can \npolarize the world into Islam and the West, he has a billion soldiers.\n  If the West takes military action against an Islamic nation, would in \nfact bin Laden welcome that? What could be better from bin Laden's \npoint of view? This would be a war that could last for years and \nmillions would die--not just theirs but ours. Who has the stomach for \nthat? We know bin Laden does. But is this really what we want? \nDiscretion is often the better part of valor, even if our stomachs \nhunger for more.\n  American leadership has not been easy. This past century saw this \ngreat country become the world's only superpower through the grit and \nsheer determination of the American people--generations of American \npeople who were called into service to lead the world back from the \nbrink of chaos, to save civilization itself, in wars across many \ncontinents, against many terrible foes. Each time, we triumphed because \nof our spirit and resourcefulness but also because our cause is just \nand true.\n  We have vanquished darkness before. Now we are called upon once again \nto fight the enemies of civilization and the enemies of peace, the \nshadowy armies of evil whose cause is destruction, terror and despair.\n  We will not fail, nor will they succeed.\n  Today's resolution approving the use of force is the call to arms \nagainst our foe in this new, uncertain era. Our enemies have unleashed \nupon themselves the dogs of war.\n  Mr. President, in peace, American leadership has not always been \nappreciated by our fellow nations. We have been dismissed as naive, \nfrivolous, and wasteful. We have been ridiculed for our championship of \nhuman rights, tolerance, and fairness. We are criticized for leading in \npeace, and we will face much greater challenges leading in a war. As we \nhunt down the murderers, the terrorists, as we go to the heart of \ndarkness to rip out the roots of terror, and the systems that breed \nterror, we face an elusive and deadly enemy.\n  Our friends, our allies, and those not as committed to this fight as \nare we will challenge our leadership. We heed them at our peril. \nLeadership can be a lonely business.\n  My own State of Alaska, far from the battlegrounds of this fight, far \nfrom New York City, far from Washington, DC, is going to play an \nimportant role. Elmendorf, Eielson, Ft. Wainwright,\n\n[[Page S9428]]\n\nFt. Richardson and surrounding communities will no doubt play a key \nrole in winning this war. Located just 8 hours from New York, the \nMideast, and the Asian subcontinent, Alaska has been a strategic \nkeystone in our nation's defense for the last 50 years. Alaska will now \nbe an offensive keystone in the battles to come. I can assure you, Mr. \nPresident, Alaskans and our adopted sons and daughters in uniform will \nbe up to the task.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier today the Senate voted unanimously \nto authorize the President to use all necessary and appropriate force \nto respond to the attacks launched by terrorists on Tuesday. Those \nresponsible for these heinous attacks must never be allowed to do so \nagain. For that reason we have also taken note of the President's \nauthority to deter and prevent acts of terrorism against the United \nStates, consistent with provisions of the War Powers Act. There may be \ntimes when the President must act swiftly to preempt an imminent act of \nviolence. In such cases, he may not be able to consult closely with \nCongress beforehand. However, as a general rule, in the exercise of the \nauthority that we have just approved, it is my expectation that the \nPresident and his advisers will consult with the Congress before taking \naction is contemplated by the War Powers Act.\n  Equally important, the U.S. Senate also voted unanimously to \nappropriate, on an emergency basis, some $40 billion in additional \nresources to enable New York City and the Washington, DC, area to cope \neffectively with the aftermath of the devastation wrought by those \nattacks. In addition, we have provided resources to enable the United \nStates to counter domestic and international terrorism, enhance \ntransportation security, and to undertake additional programs to \nenhance our national security.\n  We have taken up and passed these two measures on an expedited basis \nbecause our national interests dictate that we do. The House will do so \nlater today as well. The Congress has an obligation to reassure the \nAmerican people that their government is working to do everything in \nits power to protect them from such heinous acts in the future, as well \nas to provide funding so that the cleanup and rebuilding efforts can \nproceed as quickly as possible.\n  I believe that we are all in agreement that those individuals who \nwere responsible for the premeditated murder of so many of our citizens \nmust be found and stopped from ever conducting such actions again. \nAnyone who has aided, abetted or continues to harbor these terrorists \nis a terrorist as well. So too are those who knowingly facilitate the \nfinancial transactions that keep their organizations in business. While \nwe do not know with 100 percent certainty that Saudi-born militant \nOsama bin Laden is the mastermind of this latest tragedy, we know full \nwell based on past experience that he is fully capable of doing so. The \nPresident has directed that all of our intelligence resources be \nbrought to bear to develop credible evidence as to who was in fact \nresponsible. I am confident that we will have much better information \nin that regard in the very near future. And, when that moment arrives I \nbelieve we will act appropriately, consistent with our principles and \nvalues.\n  Sadly Osama bin Laden is not the only individual who harbors \nirrational hatred against the United States. Many others around the \nglobe do as well. I would call to the attention of my colleagues a very \nimportant article that appeared in today's Washington Post entitled \n``Zinni Urges Economic and Diplomatic Moves.'' In that article, ret. \nGeneral Anthony C. Zinni cautions against an approach that is single \npronged in attempting to eradicate terrorist organizations. An approach \nof simply bombing them back to the stone age may have appeal to some, \nbut will, according to General Zinni, only perpetuate the problem by \ninflaming Anti-American sentiment in the Muslim world. Zinni urges the \nBush administration to accompany any military action taken against \nAfghanistan or other states that harbor terrorists, with economic and \ndiplomatic measures as well. Other governments in the region, Pakistan, \nIran, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, must be prepared to assist the United \nStates in this multifaceted strategy.\n  There is another element to the problem of countering international \nterrorism over the longer term, namely the Middle East conflict. That \nconflict has fueled the hatred, sense of injustice, and hopelessness \nthat has provided and will continue to provide the foot soldiers of the \nOsama bin Laden's of this world. The Bush administration must make \nresolution of the Middle East conflict a higher priority than it has to \ndate. Only with United States leadership will we galvanize our allies \nin Europe, and moderate Arab States to bring sufficient pressure to \nbear on the Palestinians to stop the violence and come back to the \nbargaining table so that a formula can be found that will permit \nIsraelis and Palestinians to live in peace. Only with peace will we be \nable to prevent the emergence of another generation of terrorists \nimbued with a burning hatred of the United States.\n\n\n                      REIMBURSEMENT FOR NEW JERSEY\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to thank the President and the \nleadership of the Congress for their support and immediate response to \nthe tragic events that have transpired over the past few days. While \nthe attack on the World Trade Center physically occurred in New York \nCity, the emotional physical, and financial tolls will be felt \nthroughout the Metropolitan area but especially in northern New Jersey.\n  I have heard estimates that over 50 percent of the people employed at \nthe World Trade Centers were New Jersey residents.\n  The Port Authority which is headquatered at the centers is a joint, \nbi-State New York/New Jersey agency that coordinates infrastructure \nneeds for the airspace, mass transit, and commuter needs of our area. \nWhen the port rebuilds, it will rebuild as a joint entity.\n  Fire, medical and emergency personnel and equipment, as well trades \nworkers and their heavy equipment, hospitals and triage centers as well \nas transportation equipment shuttling the wounded and rescuers all have \nemanated from New Jersey communities.\n  Let me share with my colleagues a few examples.\n  Six hundred wounded were transferred to New Jersey hospitals for \ntreatment. Jersey City Medical treated 150 people; 21 were admitted \novernight; St. Francis Hospital/St. Mary's in Jersey City treated 50 \npeople and UMDNJ in Newark treated and released 17 victims.\n  The New Jersey State Police mobilized 40 boats to ferry victims \nacross the Hudson River and State Troopers have been sent to sort \nthrough rubble. New York Waterway has put all 24 of its ferries into \nservice, transferring free of charge an estimated 200,000 people.\n  The New Jersey National Guard established a field hospital at Liberty \nState Park that evaluated 2,600 people. At the Meadowlands, a makeshift \nhospital with hundreds of ambulances and 50 surgeons was created.\n  The Jersey City Fire Department sent 4 fire trucks and Union County \nhas sent 24 fire trucks and over 100 firefighters. The city of Trenton \nhas sent 10 ambulance/paramedic teams. Middlesex County send 42 \nambulances, 20 fire trucks and 70 police officers. Burlington County in \nsouthern New Jersey sent 20 ambulances.\n  The Elizabeth Urban Rescue Team which specializes in confined spaces \nrescue has been there from day one on 24-hour rotating duty because the \nheroic New York City teams were wiped out in the first minutes. The \ncost of this effort has already reached $150,000. Regular fire \npersonnel from Elizabeth have been dispatched to Staten Island to free \nStaten Island Fire personnel to go to the World Trade Center site to \nhelp.\n\n  The Sheriff's and Prosecutor's Office in Hudson County which is \ndirectly across from New York City has conservatively incurred $50,000 \nin expenses. In Jersey City there are 60 officers working full time and \ncountless numbers of fire fighters and equipment manning a major supply \neffort to New York via the Jersey City waterfront. The North Hudson \nRegional Fire Co. has spent over $150,000 on overtime, personnel, and \nequipment.\n  Mr. BYRD. There are many more examples of the selflessness and \nsacrifice taking place, not just from New Jersey but across the \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S9429]]\n\n  I appreciate that the physical attack did not occur on New Jersey \nsoil and that is why New Jersey is not referenced in this emergency \nappropriation as a location where the terrorist attack occurred as New \nYork, Virginia, and Pennsylvania are listed.\n  However, it is important to acknowledge and fully appreciate the \nhuman and financial expenses being incurred by the neighboring areas \nand that these areas be able to apply directly to the Federal \nGovernment for reimbursement.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the specific State \nlistings in the supplemental specifically refer only to the physical \nlocations where the attacks occurred and do not establish an exclusive \nlist of areas eligible for financial assistance from this Federal aid \npackage.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I want to first associate myself with the remarks of my \ncolleague from New Jersey and I would further appreciate the \nopportunity to clarify one additional point with my colleague from West \nVirginia. I understand that New Jersey was not listed because an attack \ndid not physically occur there; however as my colleague, Senator \nTorricelli has stated, our State and communities have incurred \nsignificant human and financial costs in responding to this disaster.\n  I would appreciate your acknowledgement that the State of New Jersey \nor its local communities who have incurred expenses in the relief \neffort, will be able to apply directly to the Federal Government for \nthe assistance provided under this aid package.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is my understanding that New Jersey is eligible to apply \nfor any authorized disaster relief program in the same manner and under \nthe same conditions as New York, Connecticut, Virginia, and other \naffected States.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I appreciate Senator Byrd's statement and the \nopportunity to clarify this issue.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I similarly appreciate Senator Byrd's statement \nclarifying this concern, as well as all his work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9429-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9429]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MOMENT OF SILENCE\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning the Senate passed a \nhistoric resolution. The resolution passed granting the President broad \nauthority and power to prosecute a war against terrorism and those who \nhouse terrorists.\n  It is important we talk about that from the standpoint that this is a \nwar as no other we have been in where the enemy is one who can attack \nand has attacked on our soil, who will use means and methods of terror, \nwhich is the tool of choice for the terrorists, and try to debilitate \nus by fear.\n  We should not succumb to fear. We should not allow fear to take over \nbut, rather, have faith in our system and faith in God above that we \nwill prosper and persevere.\n  Many terrorists have networks that are headquartered throughout \ncentral Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East. It is wise for us to go \nafter these terrorist organizations. It is absolutely right for us to \ndo so.\n  We need to build alliances with people throughout these regions, and \nthey are available to us if we move wisely and successfully. The State \nDepartment has done a nice job thus far, and I congratulate Secretary \nColin Powell and Rich Armitage, the No. 2 person in the Department, and \nothers, for reaching out to many countries in that part of the world \nand saying: Look, it is time to stand up and be counted. You are either \nwith us or against us, and we want to know what it is, and there will \nbe consequences that will flow from that decision.\n  It appears a number of these countries are standing up and saying: We \nare with you; this global scourge of terrorism hits us on a daily basis \nas it just hit you with such a devastating force on September 11.\n  I think it would be wise for us to look at this very seriously, that \nbefore we move forward, we build these alliances with a number of \nnations that are willing to stand up with us and be heard. That is very \npossible for us to do.\n  We need to look to nations such as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, nations \nthat are not in the common lexicon perhaps of geography of the American \nstudent or maybe even the American political student. These are \ncountries formed out of the fall of the Soviet Union, and they sit in \ndirect proximity to Afghanistan, which has been the headquarters for \nsome period of time of Osama bin Laden.\n  If these nations want to work with the United States, we ought to \nwork with them. It requires us to look at them with a new set of eyes \nand say: OK, we put a lot of demands and pressures on you at different \npoints, and now we have one singular focus, and that is to deal with \nterrorism; we want to work with you on that. I think we will get their \ncooperation.\n  They also will say: We want the United States to work with us, \nbuilding the economies and abilities of our people. So there is going \nto be an exchange and a push back and forth that, in many ways, will \nhelp strengthen our standing and our relationship with many of these \nnations.\n  We have recently been on a diplomatic effort with India. That is \nproper and good and should continue. There are sanctions that need to \nbe lifted in this region. Pakistan is going to be a key country, as we \nhave already seen, and discussions are taking place already. Pakistan \nwill be a key country. We have gone to them and said: OK, stand up and \nbe counted with us or be counted with the other side.\n  We believe Pakistan will strongly come along our way. We have had our \nshare of differences, certainly after the cold war. Pakistan was there \nwith us in bringing the Soviet Union down when the Soviet Union was \nengaged in Afghanistan. I think Pakistan will be with us again. We have \nto look at how we work with them. They are going to say: OK, there are \na series of sanctions you have on us; we want to talk about that as \nwell.\n  We should engage those discussions. Hopefully, that will be a way we \ncan build these nations together. That would be a good and appropriate \nthing to do.\n  I want to point out some history regarding Afghanistan. Some suggest \nwe go in and start bombing. There have been a number of nations, great \nnations over history, that have tried to go into Afghanistan, and there \nhas been great difficulty going into Afghanistan, whether it was the \nBritish or whether it was the Soviet Union, which could merely drive \ninto Afghanistan with huge amounts of weaponry and force and still was \nnot able to put the proud people of Afghanistan under their pressure \nand army.\n  To think we can just drop bombs or drop a few troops into Afghanistan \nand that country will succumb to our pressure does not read correctly \nthe history of that proud nation.\n  The Taliban has been a scourge on that country, as they have been on \nthe world. We have to look very wisely and carefully at how we are \ngoing to deal with Osama bin Laden and other terrorist organizations \nthat are headquartered in Afghanistan.\n  This is going to take some time, and I hope our people are cognizant \nof those lessons of history and are cognizant of what we are dealing \nwith. This may take some time, planning, and thoughtfulness as we build \nthe alliance with countries in that region, as we do the give-and-take \nto get them on\n\n[[Page S9430]]\n\nour side and with them saying: OK, we need you to work with us as we \nbuild up our nations as well and as we plot long-term strategy to be \nable to get at these terrorist groups that are headquartered in a very \ndifficult nation.\n  This is not the sort of thing we are going to do from 30,000 feet in \nthe air, dropping bombs or launching cruise missiles and hoping we get \nit done. This is going to take some period of time to build the \nalliances we will need.\n  It is a different alliance than we have formed in the past. It is an \nalliance to put the tools in place, the human intelligence, the ability \nto get at these dens of iniquity, these evil groups that would \nperpetrate these crimes on this country and across the world.\n  Then we are going to have to go in and dig them out one at a time. \nThis is not the Persian Gulf war or any other war in which we have \nbeen. If done properly and well focused, we can be very successful in \nthis effort. It is going to require time, focus, prudence, and \ndetermination, and the mettle of this country will be tested. But we \nare going to be successful in the long run. We could be here for some \nperiod of time talking about this.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to rise to say that because the resolution we \npassed this morning was quite broad based. It was an expression of the \npeople of the United States, and I think a good expression of the \ndesires of the people of the United States.\n  I do not want people to think this will be done later this year and \nwe are finished with it. This will take a long period of time. These \nterrorist organizations operate in a number of countries, and they have \nsubstantial assets in at least 10 different nations. We could well be \ngoing at that for some period of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9430-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER AND REMEMBRANCE\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the National Day of Prayer and \nRemembrance was held at Washington National Cathedral. What a beautiful \nservice to recognize and remember those who lost their lives and the \nfamilies who mourn them and those who are still missing. We ended it by \nsinging the Battle Hymn of the Republic, with which everybody is \nfamiliar.\n  Most people are familiar with the first verse, maybe the last verse, \nbut not some of the rest of the text. Remember, this is the great hymn \nof the Republic during the time of strife between the States and where \nwe had a war between ourselves, brother against brother, in this land. \nThis was the fight song.\n  As we sang that song, it was as if we were sending our Nation off to \nwar. I want to read the words to the middle verse, the third verse of \nthis hymn that is not familiar to most people, but the words are so \nstrong and striking.\n\n       I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnish'd rows of steel; \n     as ye deal with My contemners, so with you My grace shall \n     deal; let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with His \n     heel; since God is marching on.\n\n  ``I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnish'd rows of steel.'' I \nhope that our enemies, the terrorists in the world, read that writ we \nhave issued today written in burnished rows of steel. We are resolved. \nWe are united. We will win. We will do whatever it takes to win, while \nour God is marching on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Gillis, of California, to be Director of the Office \n     of Victims of Crime.\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JOHN GILLIS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday the Judiciary Committee conducted \nconfirmation hearings that included the President's nomination of John \nGillis to direct the Office for Victims of Crime at the Department of \nJustice. These hearings had been scheduled long before the tragic \nevents of Tuesday, September 11, 2001. This was the first hearing of \nthe committee since the terrorism Tuesday morning that prompted the \npostponement of hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n  Mr. Gillis had come from California before air traffic was suspended \non Tuesday. Also included in the hearing were judicial nominees from \nNew York-Connecticut and Mississippi who were able to drive to \nWashington in order to participate in the hearing. I thank Senator \nMcConnell for serving as the Ranking Republican.\n  Mr. Gillis described his background in law enforcement as a police \nofficer with the Los Angeles Police Department and his work with the \nNew York Port Authority. We also heard first hand of the tragic loss of \nhis daughter and of his work on behalf of homicide victims and other \nvictims of crime.\n  We discussed the outstanding staff of the Office for Victims of \nCrime, the important work in which they are engaged, and the incredible \nchallenges that Mr. Gillis and that office will face.\n  I have worked closely with Mr. Gillis' predecessor in the Office for \nVictims of Crime for several years. With Aileen Adams, I worked on \nvictims legislation to assist in our response to the bombing of the \nAlfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City in April of 1995. Indeed, I \nsponsored the Victims of Terrorism Act amendment when the Senate \nconsidered anti-terrorism legislation in June 1995 and I continued \nworking to ensure that legislation remained part of the Anti-Terrorism \nand Effective Death Penalty Act, which was finally enacted on April 24, \n1996.\n  Thereafter, we worked on special appropriations to assist the victims \nof\n\n[[Page S9431]]\n\nthe Oklahoma bombing and special legislation to ensure their rights in \nconnection with the trial. Last year, working with Katherine Turman, we \nwere able to enact improvements to our 1995 legislation for victims of \nterrorism in order to double the cap on the Victims of Crime Act \nemergency reserve fund to $100 million and provide greater flexibility \nto the Office for Victims of Crime to use the emergency reserve in \ncarrying out programs that assist victims of terrorism and mass \nviolence.\n  In addition, over the years I have worked with Senator Specter and \nothers on a series of legislative actions to provide financial and \neducational benefits to federal and state public safety officers killed \nor injured in the line of duty, including educational benefits for \ntheir dependents.\n  We will be reviewing all of these provisions in the days and weeks \nahead in the wake of the devastation of Tuesday.\n\n  Although nominees to head the Office for Victims of Crime \ntraditionally have not always participated in a confirmation hearing, I \nwanted to include Mr. Gillis at a Senate hearing to highlight the \nimportance of the work of this Office, the critical importance of crime \nvictims' rights, and the assistance and compensation provided by the \nFederal Government.\n  Along with other Senators strongly committed to assisting crime \nvictims and protecting their rights, I reintroduced the Crime Victims \nAssistance Act of 2001 in April of this year. In preparing our bill, we \nconsulted closely with a number of victims organizations and with the \nOffice for Victims of Crime. That legislation, which enhances the \nrights and protections of victims of crime, establishes innovative new \nprograms to help promote compliance with State victim rights laws and \nimproves the manner in which the Crime Victims Fund is managed and \npreserved, is an important matter and a high priority for me. I was \nheartened when Mr. Gillis pledged to work with us on this initiative.\n  Toward the end of yesterday's hearing, I suggested that I would try \nto clear the nomination of John Gillis to be Director of the Office for \nVictims of Crime on an extraordinary and expedited basis. I noted that \nAttorney General Ashcroft had, on the eve of the nomination hearing, \ncalled me at home in support of this nomination. Yesterday I requested \nthat the Majority Leader proceed to the nomination and that the Senate \nconfirm John Gillis. I thank the Majority Leader for taking action and \nI want to thank all Democratic Members of the Senate and my colleague \nfrom Vermont for approving that request. In these difficult days, \nconfirming Mr. Gillis to head the Office for Victims of Crime so that \nhe may lend his hand to the efforts of those working so diligently in \nthat Office and in State and local government and private efforts in \nNew York, Virginia and around the country, is a small but significant \nstep that the Senate can and should take.\n  I am gratified that overnight whatever problem or concern had \nthreatened to delay Senate action on this nomination has been resolved. \nI thank all Senators for their willingness to move forward under these \nextraordinary circumstances to confirm John Gillis to be Director of \nthe Office for Victims of Crime. In particular, I thank the senior \nSenator from Oklahoma (Mr. Nickles) for his effort to clear this \nnomination for expedited Senate action today. His personal intervention \nhelped make this possible. I have had the privilege of working over the \nyears with Senator Nickles on victims legislation. He has shown again \ntoday his commitment to the interests of victims of crime and \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9431-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9431-S9434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Richard B. Myers, 0000.\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF JOHN NEGROPONTE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday the Foreign Relations Committee \nheld a hearing to consider the nomination of John Negroponte to be the \nU.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations. I was unable to \nattend yesterday's hearing because I was with my wife Jackie attending \nthe birth of our daughter Grace.\n  I believe that it was very important yesterday that the Committee \nhearing focused in part on a careful review of new information that has \ncome to light related to Ambassador Negroponte's tenure in Honduras \nduring 1981-85 to see whether Congress had been kept fully informed \nabout all aspects of U.S. policy with respect to Honduras during his \nwatch.\n  I recognize, that this is not a normal week for the Senate or for the \nAmerican people. President Bush has indicated that he wants the United \nStates to be represented by an Ambassador at the United Nations as \nquickly as possible, particularly in light of this week's tragic \nevents. I don't disagree with that view.\n  However, the Foreign Relations Committee did have a responsibility to \nreview the questions raised in connection\n\n[[Page S9432]]\n\nwith this nomination. They discharged that responsibility yesterday. \nThe Committee has proceeded expeditiously, professionally and fairly \nwith Ambassador Negroponte's nomination. It requested and receive \ndocuments from the State Department and CIA. Those documents were \nreviewed, consisting of several thousand pages, the committee proceeded \nwith the hearing yesterday and today the Senate is ready to act. There \nhave been no undue delays.\n  Let's review the time line of this nomination to date. The President \nannounced his intent to nominate Ambassador Negroponte for the U.N. \npost on March 6. The nomination was not submitted to the Senate, \nhowever, until May 14, nearly four months into the Administration, by \ncontrast, Madeleine Albright was nominated for the U.N. post on January \n20, 1993 and confirmed six days later.\n  On May 3, over a week before the nomination was submitted, the \nCommittee Democrats wrote the President to request that the \nAdministration provide documents to the Committee so it could review \nissues related to Negroponte's tenure in Honduras. On May 8, Committee \nstaff submitted a list of requested documents to representatives of the \nWhite House and the State Department. The last document responsive to \nthe original request of May 8 was not provided, however, until late \nJuly. The Committee staff reviewed several thousand pages of documents \nresponsive to the request and determined that a number of documents \nwhich were still classified contained important information on \nquestions raised about Ambassador Negroponte's tenure in Honduras.\n  The chairman of the committee then requested that the State \nDepartment and CIA undertake a review of documents within the \ncommittee's possession that remained classified with a goal of making \npublic as much information as possible in order to shed additional \nlight on what role if any the United States played in the human rights \nabuses that were perpetrated against the Honduran people in the first \nhalf of the 1980s, and specifically what knowledge or involvement the \nUnited States Ambassador, at the time Mr. Negroponte, had in those \nabuses. The committee also offered to begin hearings prior to the \nAugust recess on U.N. issues, with another hearing to follow in \nSeptember on issues related to Negroponte's service in Honduras. The \nadministration chose to wait until September to begin the hearing \nprocess. So we are talking about a period of approximately fourteen \nweeks of working days of the Senate from the time the nomination was \nsubmitted until today. This compares quite favorably when compared to \nthe Holbrooke nomination which took from February 1999 to August 1999 .\n  Some conservative columnists have suggested that I and others are \ntrying to re-fight the Central America conflict of the 1980's. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. Rather, I would argue that there is an \neffort underway in some quarters to rewrite the history of U.S. \ninvolvement in that conflict and sweep under the rug how politically \npainful and damaging that policy was. In the early 1980's, the Congress \nand the American people were told that the United States had no \ninvolvement in using Honduras in as a staging ground for a convert \nContra program to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government. Later, \nwhen the so called second Boland amendment cutting off assistance to \nthe Contra was passed we were told that the United States was not \nviolating that provision of law. That of course proved to be untruth as \nthe Iran Contra Investigation demonstrated. Similarly we were told that \nthe Honduran military was not as a matter of policy violating human \nrights of its citizens or that the Salvadoran High Command had no known \nor culpability for the torture and murder of the American church women \nor the Jesuit priests. Of course we now know that none of that was in \nfact true. It is indisputable that this fabric of untruths and half \ntruths caused deep fissures in the Congressional-Executive branch \nrelationship and in the trust of the American people in their \ngovernment. Those fissures will only be fully healed if there is \nhonesty and full candor between the Executive and the Congress.\n  Our policy was also controversial throughout Central America. Tens of \nthousands of Central Americans lost their lives during the 1980's, many \nat the hands of their own governments. Tens of thousands more had their \nlives permanently marred by losses of loved ones. Fortunately, in 1987 \nCentral American leaders took their fate into their own hands and \ncrafted the Central America Peace Agreement. President George H. Bush, \nupon coming to office in 1989 embraced the peace agreement and reached \nout to the Congress in order to de-politicize Central America. \nElections followed in Nicaragua, as did a negotiated settlement to the \ncivil conflict in El Salvador. Honduras ceased to be a staging area for \nthe U.S. backed contras. El Salvador and Honduras have undertaken to \ncome to grips with the past by attempting to investigate and assign \nresponsibility for the atrocities that occurred in their respective \ncountries as an important step in the process of peace and \nreconciliation.\n\n  Since Ambassador Negroponte was last confirmed by the Senate as \nAmbassador to the Philippines in 1993, a great deal of new information \nhas come to light about the nature and extent of human rights abuses \nduring his tenure in Honduras. This information also raised questions \nabout the appropriateness of the U.S. Embassy's response and about \nwhether Ambassador Negroponte had been forthright with the Committee in \n1989 when I asked him questions about these matters.\n  How has this new information come to light? It is the result of a \nnumber of investigations into this subject from 1992-1998: First in \n1992, Leo Valladares, the Honduran National Commissioner for the \nProtection of Human Rights undertook to catalog the disappearances and \nother human rights abuses that occurred in Honduras in the eighties. \nThat investigation is still ongoing. Prompted by the Valladares \ninvestigation the Baltimore Sun's undertook its own year long \ninvestigation which resulted in 1995 in a four part series detailing \nhuman rights abuses by a special Honduran military intelligence unit, \nthe so called Battalion 316, and U.S. embassy links to that unit, and \nknowledge thereof. In 1996, this led CIA Director John Deutch to \nestablish a Special Working Group within the agency to assess whether \nthe allegations raised by the series were valid. Finally, the CIA \nDirector tasked the CIA's Inspector General to resolve specific \nquestions raised by the Working Group as it related to the death of an \nAmerican citizen, Father James Carney, and about the CIA's relationship \nwith members of the Honduran military who may have committed human \nrights abuses before or doing that relationship.\n  The picture that emerges in analyzing this new information is a \ntroubling one. Some of the key facts that the Committee put on public \nrecord during yesterday's hearing thanks to the cooperation of the \nState Department and CIA are the following: One, during 1980-84, the \nHonduran military committed most of the hundreds of human rights abuses \nreported in Honduras. These abuses were often politically motivated and \nofficially sanctioned; two, Honduran military units were trained by the \nU.S.--members of these units have been linked to death squad activities \nsuch as killings, disappearances, and other human rights abuses; three, \nthe CIA's reporting of human rights abuses was inconsistent. Reporting \ninadequacies precluded CIA headquarters from understanding the scope of \nhuman rights abuses; four, the responsibility for monitoring and taking \naction against domestic subversion in Honduras was first the \nresponsibility of a special unit of the Public Security Forces, FUSEP; \nfive, at the recommendation of a joint U.S./Honduran military seminar, \nthis responsibility was transferred in early 1984 to a new unit (which \ncame to be known as Battalion 316) under the supervision of the \nMilitary Intelligence Division of the Armed Forces General Staff; and \nsix, the FUSEP special unit and Battalion 316 counter terrorist tactics \nincluded torture, rape and assassination against persons thought to be \ninvolved in support of the Salvadoran guerrillas or part of the \nHonduran leftist movement; seven, as many as 250 instances of human \nrights abuses in Honduras are officially documented, including \ndisappearances, torture, extra judicial killings; and eight, at least \none death\n\n[[Page S9433]]\n\nsquad was known to have operated during 1980-84. This death squad was \ncalled ELACH, The Honduran Anti-Communist Liberation Army. There is \ninformation linking this death squad to chief of the National \nIntelligence Directorate of the Honduran Public Security Forces.\n  When Ambassador Negroponte came before the committee in 1989 in the \ncontext of his nomination to the position of US Ambassador to Mexico, I \nasked him a number of questions related to his tenure in Honduras, two \nquestions dealt with human rights. Given what we know about the extent \nand nature of Honduran human rights abuses, to say that Mr. Negroponte \nwas less than forthcoming in his responses to my questions is being \ngenerous. I would ask that the my exchange with Ambassador Negroponte \nduring that hearing in printed in the Record at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Excerpt From Hearing Record\n\n       Senator Dodd. That Battalion 316, I said ``alleged,'' but, \n     in fact, was that a death squad? Was that the name of a death \n     squad operating either within the Honduran military or with \n     their approval?\n       Ambassador Negroponte. I do not recall knowing it as the \n     316th Battalion. In fact, some of what I am saying now may be \n     based on trying to reconstruct events after having discussed \n     this issue with individuals long after the fact, for example, \n     when Mr. LeMoyne wrote his story. But I recall it to have \n     been an intelligence unit.\n       Again, I have never seen any convincing substantiation that \n     they were involved in death squad type activities.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I know there will be those who say, that it isn't terribly \nimportant that the Honduran military committed human rights abuses more \nthan fifteen years ago in some cases. Moreover, in relative terms those \nabuses in Honduras paled in comparison to what to else where in Central \nAmerica. My response to that is that the Senate has a duty and \nresponsibility to be a partner in the fashioning of U.S. foreign \npolicy, and the only way it can be a full partner is if we in this body \nare kept fully informed. When it came to our ability to be full \npartners with respect to U.S. toward Honduras or elsewhere in Central \nAmerica, I would tell you that we were unable to do that because we \nwere flying blind.\n  It gives me great pause as I ponder how to vote on this nomination to \nthink that someone as intelligent and capable as Ambassador Negroponte \nwould treat this committee and this body so cavalierly in his responses \nto my questions. I wonder who he thinks he works for?\n  I was also troubled by Ambassador Negroponte's unwillingness to \nadmit, that as a consequence of other U.S. policy priorities, the U.S. \nembassy, by acts of omissions ending up shading the truth about the \nextent and nature of ongoing human rights abuses in the 1980s. \nMoreover, in light of all the new information that I have just \nmentioned, I do not know how Ambassador Negroponte can continue to \nbelieve that it was simply ``deficiencies in the Honduran legal system \ncoupled with insufficient professionalism of law enforcement \nauthorities that ``led at times to abuses of authority by Honduran \npolice officials.'' And, quoting his written answer to a committee \nquestion on this subject that, ``I did not believe then, nor do I \nbelieve now, that these abuses were part of a deliberate government \npolicy.''\n  The InterAmerican Court of Human Rights had no such reluctance in \nassigning blame to the Honduran government during its adjudication of a \ncase brought against the Government of Honduras by the InterAmerican \nCommission on Human Rights in 1987. In deciding the case of Honduran \ncitizen Velasquez Rodriquez the Court found that ``a practice of \ndisappearances carried out or tolerated by Honduran officials existed \nbetween 1981-84.'' And, as I mentioned earlier, based upon an extensive \nreview of U.S. intelligence information by the CIA Working Group in \n1996, the CIA is prepared to stipulate that ``during the 1980-84 \nperiod, the Honduran military committed most of the hundreds of human \nrights abuses reported in Honduras. These abuses were often politically \nmotivated and officially sanctioned.''\n  Moreover, Mr. Negroponte should have been forewarned to look for \nsigns of government sponsored human rights abuses in light of concerns \nthat his predecessor Ambassador Jack Binns, a career foreign service \nofficer, had raised with the State Department concerning the mind set \nof the architect of Honduras' domestic countersubversion program with \nrespect to a willingness to extrajudicial means in the context of such \nprograms. Ambassador Binns was speaking about General Gustavo Alvarez \nwho became Commander in Chief of the Honduran Armed Forces in 1982, and \nwho had been Commander of Honduran Public Security Forces, FUSEP, from \n1980-82.\n  Based upon the Committee's review of State Department and CIA \ndocuments, it would seem that Ambassador Negroponte knew far more about \ngovernment perpetuated human rights abuses than he chose to share with \nthe committee in 1989 or in Embassy contributions at the time to annual \nState Department Human Rights reports. For example, a Negroponte cable \nsummarizing meetings between Congressman Solarz and Honduran government \nofficials in January 1985 makes note of a Honduran official's concerns \nabout future human rights abuses due to ``fears that there might still \nbe some ``secret operating cells'' left from the Alvarez era,'' here \nreferring to General Alvarez who had headed the Honduran armed forces \nuntil he was removed in 1984 by his fellow officers.\n  I don't quite know the difference between a ``death squad'' and \n``secret operating cells'', but since Ambassador Negroponte is \nofficially on record as saying that no death squads existed in Honduras \nduring his tenure, there must be some difference.\n  There are also discrepancies with respect to when he became aware of \ncertain cases where Honduran authorities were secretly detaining and \ntorturing Hondurans suspected of subversion. And how he chose to report \nthose cases to Washington. The case of dual national Ines Consuelo \nMurillo comes most readily to mind. Her detention and torture was \ndescribed in detail on April 15, 1995 in the Baltimore Sun.\n  These are but a few examples. There were others which taken together, \npaint a very mixed picture of whether the U.S. embassy was doing much \nto discourage Honduran government practices or how comprehensively it \nwas collecting and reporting on such abuses. Having said that, there \nwere no ``smoking guns'' in the documents that have been provided to \nthe Committee.\n  I know that this week is not just any week. I also know that the \nPresident is anxious to have an ambassador at the United Nations is a \nhigh priority, particularly in light of recent events. I will not stand \nin the way of the Senate moving forward with this nomination. I believe \nthat yesterday's decision by the Committee on Foreign Relations to put \non the public record all the additional declassified information that \nit has compiled in reviewing this nomination will contribute to the \nhealing and reconciliation that is still ongoing in Honduras.\n  Finally I would say a word of caution to other career foreign service \nofficers, particularly junior officers, that they not consider this \nnominee's lack of candor before the committee as a model to be \nemulated. A United States Ambassador is a representative of the United \nStates Government and ultimately works for the American people. That \nmeans that our ambassadors have an obligation to be truthful and \nforthcoming in relations with Congress as we are the people's \nrepresentatives. If they are under instruction to withhold information \nas a matter of policy they should say so. Then, we can take it up with \ntheir superiors if we choose to do so. In my estimation, Mr. Negroponte \ndid neither in his dealings with the Congress. I am deeply saddened to \ncome to that judgement. Having said that Ambassador Negroponte has had \na distinguished career and on balance has discharged his \nresponsibilities ably and honorably. For that reason, I intend to give \nhim the benefit of the doubt in light of how extremely polarized \nrelations between the Congress and the Executive were over U.S. policy \nin Central America when he was serving as Ambassador in Honduras. I \nwill therefore support his nomination to the position of the U.S. \nPermanent Representative to the United Nations.\n\n[[Page S9434]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9431-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9431-S9434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

I was unable to \nattend yesterday's hearing because I was with my wife Jackie attending \nthe birth of our daughter Grace.\n  I believe that it was very important yesterday that the Committee \nhearing focused in part on a careful review of new information that has \ncome to light related to Ambassador Negroponte's tenure in Honduras \nduring 1981-85 to see whether Congress had been kept fully informed \nabout all aspects of U.S. policy with respect to Honduras during his \nwatch.\n  I recognize, that this is not a normal week for the Senate or for the \nAmerican people. President Bush has indicated that he wants the United \nStates to be represented by an Ambassador at the United Nations as \nquickly as possible, particularly in light of this week's tragic \nevents. I don't disagree with that view.\n  However, the Foreign Relations Committee did have a responsibility to \nreview the questions raised in connection\n\n[[Page S9432]]\n\nwith this nomination. They discharged that responsibility yesterday. \nThe Committee has proceeded expeditiously, professionally and fairly \nwith Ambassador Negroponte's nomination. It requested and receive \ndocuments from the State Department and CIA. Those documents were \nreviewed, consisting of several thousand pages, the committee proceeded \nwith the hearing yesterday and today the Senate is ready to act. There \nhave been no undue delays.\n  Let's review the time line of this nomination to date. The President \nannounced his intent to nominate Ambassador Negroponte for the U.N. \npost on March 6. The nomination was not submitted to the Senate, \nhowever, until May 14, nearly four months into the Administration, by \ncontrast, Madeleine Albright was nominated for the U.N. post on January \n20, 1993 and confirmed six days later.\n  On May 3, over a week before the nomination was submitted, the \nCommittee Democrats wrote the President to request that the \nAdministration provide documents to the Committee so it could review \nissues related to Negroponte's tenure in Honduras. On May 8, Committee \nstaff submitted a list of requested documents to representatives of the \nWhite House and the State Department. The last document responsive to \nthe original request of May 8 was not provided, however, until late \nJuly. The Committee staff reviewed several thousand pages of documents \nresponsive to the request and determined that a number of documents \nwhich were still classified contained important information on \nquestions raised about Ambassador Negroponte's tenure in Honduras.\n  The chairman of the committee then requested that the State \nDepartment and CIA undertake a review of documents within the \ncommittee's possession that remained classified with a goal of making \npublic as much information as possible in order to shed additional \nlight on what role if any the United States played in the human rights \nabuses that were perpetrated against the Honduran people in the first \nhalf of the 1980s, and specifically what knowledge or involvement the \nUnited States Ambassador, at the time Mr. Negroponte, had in those \nabuses. The committee also offered to begin hearings prior to the \nAugust recess on U.N. issues, with another hearing to follow in \nSeptember on issues related to Negroponte's service in Honduras. The \nadministration chose to wait until September to begin the hearing \nprocess. So we are talking about a period of approximately fourteen \nweeks of working days of the Senate from the time the nomination was \nsubmitted until today. This compares quite favorably when compared to \nthe Holbrooke nomination which took from February 1999 to August 1999 .\n  Some conservative columnists have suggested that I and others are \ntrying to re-fight the Central America conflict of the 1980's. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. Rather, I would argue that there is an \neffort underway in some quarters to rewrite the history of U.S. \ninvolvement in that conflict and sweep under the rug how politically \npainful and damaging that policy was. In the early 1980's, the Congress \nand the American people were told that the United States had no \ninvolvement in using Honduras in as a staging ground for a convert \nContra program to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government. Later, \nwhen the so called second Boland amendment cutting off assistance to \nthe Contra was passed we were told that the United States was not \nviolating that provision of law. That of course proved to be untruth as \nthe Iran Contra Investigation demonstrated. Similarly we were told that \nthe Honduran military was not as a matter of policy violating human \nrights of its citizens or that the Salvadoran High Command had no known \nor culpability for the torture and murder of the American church women \nor the Jesuit priests. Of course we now know that none of that was in \nfact true. It is indisputable that this fabric of untruths and half \ntruths caused deep fissures in the Congressional-Executive branch \nrelationship and in the trust of the American people in their \ngovernment. Those fissures will only be fully healed if there is \nhonesty and full candor between the Executive and the Congress.\n  Our policy was also controversial throughout Central America. Tens of \nthousands of Central Americans lost their lives during the 1980's, many \nat the hands of their own governments. Tens of thousands more had their \nlives permanently marred by losses of loved ones. Fortunately, in 1987 \nCentral American leaders took their fate into their own hands and \ncrafted the Central America Peace Agreement. President George H. Bush, \nupon coming to office in 1989 embraced the peace agreement and reached \nout to the Congress in order to de-politicize Central America. \nElections followed in Nicaragua, as did a negotiated settlement to the \ncivil conflict in El Salvador. Honduras ceased to be a staging area for \nthe U.S. backed contras. El Salvador and Honduras have undertaken to \ncome to grips with the past by attempting to investigate and assign \nresponsibility for the atrocities that occurred in their respective \ncountries as an important step in the process of peace and \nreconciliation.\n\n  Since Ambassador Negroponte was last confirmed by the Senate as \nAmbassador to the Philippines in 1993, a great deal of new information \nhas come to light about the nature and extent of human rights abuses \nduring his tenure in Honduras. This information also raised questions \nabout the appropriateness of the U.S. Embassy's response and about \nwhether Ambassador Negroponte had been forthright with the Committee in \n1989 when I asked him questions about these matters.\n  How has this new information come to light? It is the result of a \nnumber of investigations into this subject from 1992-1998: First in \n1992, Leo Valladares, the Honduran National Commissioner for the \nProtection of Human Rights undertook to catalog the disappearances and \nother human rights abuses that occurred in Honduras in the eighties. \nThat investigation is still ongoing. Prompted by the Valladares \ninvestigation the Baltimore Sun's undertook its own year long \ninvestigation which resulted in 1995 in a four part series detailing \nhuman rights abuses by a special Honduran military intelligence unit, \nthe so called Battalion 316, and U.S. embassy links to that unit, and \nknowledge thereof. In 1996, this led CIA Director John Deutch to \nestablish a Special Working Group within the agency to assess whether \nthe allegations raised by the series were valid. Finally, the CIA \nDirector tasked the CIA's Inspector General to resolve specific \nquestions raised by the Working Group as it related to the death of an \nAmerican citizen, Father James Carney, and about the CIA's relationship \nwith members of the Honduran military who may have committed human \nrights abuses before or doing that relationship.\n  The picture that emerges in analyzing this new information is a \ntroubling one. Some of the key facts that the Committee put on public \nrecord during yesterday's hearing thanks to the cooperation of the \nState Department and CIA are the following: One, during 1980-84, the \nHonduran military committed most of the hundreds of human rights abuses \nreported in Honduras. These abuses were often politically motivated and \nofficially sanctioned; two, Honduran military units were trained by the \nU.S.--members of these units have been linked to death squad activities \nsuch as killings, disappearances, and other human rights abuses; three, \nthe CIA's reporting of human rights abuses was inconsistent. Reporting \ninadequacies precluded CIA headquarters from understanding the scope of \nhuman rights abuses; four, the responsibility for monitoring and taking \naction against domestic subversion in Honduras was first the \nresponsibility of a special unit of the Public Security Forces, FUSEP; \nfive, at the recommendation of a joint U.S./Honduran military seminar, \nthis responsibility was transferred in early 1984 to a new unit (which \ncame to be known as Battalion 316) under the supervision of the \nMilitary Intelligence Division of the Armed Forces General Staff; and \nsix, the FUSEP special unit and Battalion 316 counter terrorist tactics \nincluded torture, rape and assassination against persons thought to be \ninvolved in support of the Salvadoran guerrillas or part of the \nHonduran leftist movement; seven, as many as 250 instances of human \nrights abuses in Honduras are officially documented, including \ndisappearances, torture, extra judicial killings; and eight, at least \none death\n\n[[Page S9433]]\n\nsquad was known to have operated during 1980-84. This death squad was \ncalled ELACH, The Honduran Anti-Communist Liberation Army. There is \ninformation linking this death squad to chief of the National \nIntelligence Directorate of the Honduran Public Security Forces.\n  When Ambassador Negroponte came before the committee in 1989 in the \ncontext of his nomination to the position of US Ambassador to Mexico, I \nasked him a number of questions related to his tenure in Honduras, two \nquestions dealt with human rights. Given what we know about the extent \nand nature of Honduran human rights abuses, to say that Mr. Negroponte \nwas less than forthcoming in his responses to my questions is being \ngenerous. I would ask that the my exchange with Ambassador Negroponte \nduring that hearing in printed in the Record at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Excerpt From Hearing Record\n\n       Senator Dodd. That Battalion 316, I said ``alleged,'' but, \n     in fact, was that a death squad? Was that the name of a death \n     squad operating either within the Honduran military or with \n     their approval?\n       Ambassador Negroponte. I do not recall knowing it as the \n     316th Battalion. In fact, some of what I am saying now may be \n     based on trying to reconstruct events after having discussed \n     this issue with individuals long after the fact, for example, \n     when Mr. LeMoyne wrote his story. But I recall it to have \n     been an intelligence unit.\n       Again, I have never seen any convincing substantiation that \n     they were involved in death squad type activities.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I know there will be those who say, that it isn't terribly \nimportant that the Honduran military committed human rights abuses more \nthan fifteen years ago in some cases. Moreover, in relative terms those \nabuses in Honduras paled in comparison to what to else where in Central \nAmerica. My response to that is that the Senate has a duty and \nresponsibility to be a partner in the fashioning of U.S. foreign \npolicy, and the only way it can be a full partner is if we in this body \nare kept fully informed. When it came to our ability to be full \npartners with respect to U.S. toward Honduras or elsewhere in Central \nAmerica, I would tell you that we were unable to do that because we \nwere flying blind.\n  It gives me great pause as I ponder how to vote on this nomination to \nthink that someone as intelligent and capable as Ambassador Negroponte \nwould treat this committee and this body so cavalierly in his responses \nto my questions. I wonder who he thinks he works for?\n  I was also troubled by Ambassador Negroponte's unwillingness to \nadmit, that as a consequence of other U.S. policy priorities, the U.S. \nembassy, by acts of omissions ending up shading the truth about the \nextent and nature of ongoing human rights abuses in the 1980s. \nMoreover, in light of all the new information that I have just \nmentioned, I do not know how Ambassador Negroponte can continue to \nbelieve that it was simply ``deficiencies in the Honduran legal system \ncoupled with insufficient professionalism of law enforcement \nauthorities that ``led at times to abuses of authority by Honduran \npolice officials.'' And, quoting his written answer to a committee \nquestion on this subject that, ``I did not believe then, nor do I \nbelieve now, that these abuses were part of a deliberate government \npolicy.''\n  The InterAmerican Court of Human Rights had no such reluctance in \nassigning blame to the Honduran government during its adjudication of a \ncase brought against the Government of Honduras by the InterAmerican \nCommission on Human Rights in 1987. In deciding the case of Honduran \ncitizen Velasquez Rodriquez the Court found that ``a practice of \ndisappearances carried out or tolerated by Honduran officials existed \nbetween 1981-84.'' And, as I mentioned earlier, based upon an extensive \nreview of U.S. intelligence information by the CIA Working Group in \n1996, the CIA is prepared to stipulate that ``during the 1980-84 \nperiod, the Honduran military committed most of the hundreds of human \nrights abuses reported in Honduras. These abuses were often politically \nmotivated and officially sanctioned.''\n  Moreover, Mr. Negroponte should have been forewarned to look for \nsigns of government sponsored human rights abuses in light of concerns \nthat his predecessor Ambassador Jack Binns, a career foreign service \nofficer, had raised with the State Department concerning the mind set \nof the architect of Honduras' domestic countersubversion program with \nrespect to a willingness to extrajudicial means in the context of such \nprograms. Ambassador Binns was speaking about General Gustavo Alvarez \nwho became Commander in Chief of the Honduran Armed Forces in 1982, and \nwho had been Commander of Honduran Public Security Forces, FUSEP, from \n1980-82.\n  Based upon the Committee's review of State Department and CIA \ndocuments, it would seem that Ambassador Negroponte knew far more about \ngovernment perpetuated human rights abuses than he chose to share with \nthe committee in 1989 or in Embassy contributions at the time to annual \nState Department Human Rights reports. For example, a Negroponte cable \nsummarizing meetings between Congressman Solarz and Honduran government \nofficials in January 1985 makes note of a Honduran official's concerns \nabout future human rights abuses due to ``fears that there might still \nbe some ``secret operating cells'' left from the Alvarez era,'' here \nreferring to General Alvarez who had headed the Honduran armed forces \nuntil he was removed in 1984 by his fellow officers.\n  I don't quite know the difference between a ``death squad'' and \n``secret operating cells'', but since Ambassador Negroponte is \nofficially on record as saying that no death squads existed in Honduras \nduring his tenure, there must be some difference.\n  There are also discrepancies with respect to when he became aware of \ncertain cases where Honduran authorities were secretly detaining and \ntorturing Hondurans suspected of subversion. And how he chose to report \nthose cases to Washington. The case of dual national Ines Consuelo \nMurillo comes most readily to mind. Her detention and torture was \ndescribed in detail on April 15, 1995 in the Baltimore Sun.\n  These are but a few examples. There were others which taken together, \npaint a very mixed picture of whether the U.S. embassy was doing much \nto discourage Honduran government practices or how comprehensively it \nwas collecting and reporting on such abuses. Having said that, there \nwere no ``smoking guns'' in the documents that have been provided to \nthe Committee.\n  I know that this week is not just any week. I also know that the \nPresident is anxious to have an ambassador at the United Nations is a \nhigh priority, particularly in light of recent events. I will not stand \nin the way of the Senate moving forward with this nomination. I believe \nthat yesterday's decision by the Committee on Foreign Relations to put \non the public record all the additional declassified information that \nit has compiled in reviewing this nomination will contribute to the \nhealing and reconciliation that is still ongoing in Honduras.\n  Finally I would say a word of caution to other career foreign service \nofficers, particularly junior officers, that they not consider this \nnominee's lack of candor before the committee as a model to be \nemulated. A United States Ambassador is a representative of the United \nStates Government and ultimately works for the American people. That \nmeans that our ambassadors have an obligation to be truthful and \nforthcoming in relations with Congress as we are the people's \nrepresentatives. If they are under instruction to withhold information \nas a matter of policy they should say so. Then, we can take it up with \ntheir superiors if we choose to do so. In my estimation, Mr. Negroponte \ndid neither in his dealings with the Congress. I am deeply saddened to \ncome to that judgement. Having said that Ambassador Negroponte has had \na distinguished career and on balance has discharged his \nresponsibilities ably and honorably. For that reason, I intend to give \nhim the benefit of the doubt in light of how extremely polarized \nrelations between the Congress and the Executive were over U.S. policy \nin Central America when he was serving as Ambassador in Honduras. I \nwill therefore support his nomination to the position of the U.S. \nPermanent Representative to the United Nations.\n\n[[Page S9434]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9434-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of a long-time \nformer employee of mine, Terry Michael Lynch. Terry was killed Tuesday \nmorning at the Pentagon in the tragic and senseless events of a day \nthat will never be forgotten in America. Terry worked for me for over \n15 years, both in the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, and \nI would like to take this opportunity to reflect on the life of a \ndedicated family man and a true patriot.\n  Terry was born in 1952 in Youngstown, Ohio, Terry grew up as the son \nof a steel-factory administrator. he graduated from high school in \nYoungstown, and received both his bachelor's and master's degrees in \nhistory from Youngstown State. It was there that Terry met his wife of \n24 years, Jackie.\n  Terry worked on Capitol Hill as an aide to former Alabama Republican \nCongressman Albert Lee Smith. Some of you might remember the \nCongressman. He began working for me in 1983, when I was a Member of \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. When I entered the race for the \nUnited States Senate in 1986, Terry was one of the first volunteers to \ntake personal time away from his family here in Virginia and travel \nthroughout Alabama doing any task that was needed. Terry came over to \nthe U.S. Senate with me as my Legislative Assistant assigned to the \nArmed Services Committee and continued in that position from 1987 \nthrough 1994. In 1995, Terry became a professional staff member of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee and for two years brought his expertise \nto the Intelligence Committee. He subsequently worked as a member of \nthe professional staff of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee \nchaired by Senator Specter. Terry was most recently employed by the \nconsulting firm of Booz Allen and Hamilton.\n  To say and give you all of this background does not touch the essence \nof Terry Lynch. He was one of the most loyal, caring, unpretentious, \nand compassionate human beings I have ever had the privilege of \nknowing. Terry was a foundation of strength and stability for everyone \nthat knew and loved him. He was the kindest soul and the most dedicated \nand loving father to his two daughters, Tiffany and Ashley. Terry's \npassion for helping others, especially the men and women in uniform \nwith which he so closely worked, was always evident over the course of \nhis career. This week, former staff members have called from all over \nthe world to express their deep grief. And, although they had not seen \nTerry in many years, he made such a strong impact on all of us that to \nthis day, he still lives on in each of our hearts in some way. Terry \nLynch's spirit and his memory will forever be with us--the people who \nworked with him and knew him in the House of Representatives, who \nworked with him and knew him in the Senate, and who worked with him and \nknew him in the Pentagon where he died.\n\n  We are all, I believe, better people for having known Terry Michael \nLynch.\n  Terry was an intelligent man with a heart of gold. He was also a \ngreat American. His life should not have ended in this unfortunate and \npremature manner, because he had so much ahead of him. But I promise \nyou I will do everything in my power to ensure that Terry's life, and \nthe lives of all Americans affected by this terrible tragedy, did not \nend in vain.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9434-6", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9434-S9437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred December 19, \n1997 in Stockton, CA. A high school student was allegedly beaten by a \ngroup of youths who believed he was gay. Two youths, ages 16 and 17, \nwere charged with civil rights violations.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill \nfor their hard work in putting forth this\n\n[[Page S9435]]\n\nlegislation which provides federal funding for numerous vital programs.\n  This bill provides funding for fighting crime, enhancing drug \nenforcement, and responding to threats of terrorism. It further \naddresses the shortcomings of the immigration process, funds the \noperation of the judicial process, facilitates commerce throughout the \nUnited States, and supports the needs of the State Department and \nvarious other agencies.\n  Regrettably, this bill spends at a level 4.4 percent higher than the \nlevel enacted in fiscal year 2001 which is greater than the 4 percent \nincrease in discretionary spending than the President wanted to adhere \nto.\n  In real dollars, this is $720 million in additional spending above \nthe amount requested by the President, and a $1.7 billion increase in \nspending from last year. So far this year, with just five \nappropriations bills already passed, spending levels have already \nexceeded the President's budget request by more than $6.6 billion.\n  A good amount of this increase is in the form of parochial spending \nfor unrequested projects. In this bill, I have identified approximately \n600 earmarks totaling $2 billion, which is greater than the 470 \nearmarks, totaling $1.5 billion, in the bill passed last year.\n  There are hundreds of millions of dollars in pork-barrel spending and \nlegislative riders that are riddled throughout this bill. The multitude \nof unrequested earmarks buried in this measure will undoubtedly further \nburden the American taxpayers. While the amounts associated with each \nindividual earmark may not seem extravagant, taken together, they \nrepresent a serious diversion of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars at the \nexpense of numerous programs that have undergone the appropriate merit-\nbased selection process.\n  For example, under funding for the Department of Justice, some \nexamples of earmarks include: $3 million to the University of \nConnecticut to fund the Prison Health Research Project; $3 million for \na grant to the Clearwater, Idaho EDA for the Lewis and Clark \nBicentennial Bi-State Public Safety Project; $1 million for a grant to \nthe Alaska Native Justice Center Restorative Justice programs; $1.6 \nmillion for the Montana Highway Patrol for computer upgrades; \nand $725,000 for the City of Jackson, Mississippi, for their public \nsafety automated technologies system.\n\n  Under funding for the Department of Commerce, some of the earmarks \ninclude: $500,000 for the Central California Ozone Study; $500,000 for \nthe International Pacific Research Center at the University of Hawaii; \n$1.25 million for the Alaska Near Shore Fisheries; $350,000 for the \nSouth Carolina Taxonomic Center; $1.75 million for the Alaska Fisheries \nDevelopment Foundation; $500,000 for weather radio transmitters in \nWyoming; $4 million for the Institute for Politics at Harvard \nUniversity; and $6 million for the Thayer School of Engineering at \nDartmouth University for the nanocrystalline materials and biomass \nresearch initiative.\n  There are many more projects on the list that I have compiled, which \nwill be available on my Senate Web site.\n  Mr. President, I must once again draw attention to the more \nquestionable ways in which Americans' tax dollars serve the otherwise \nnoble cause of U.S. diplomacy around the world as part of the State \nDepartment appropriations portion of this bill. As usual, several \norganizations and universities have received earmarked funds for \ninternational exchanges. Five particularly parochial earmarks deserve \nmention: the Joiner Fellowships in War, the Padnos International \nCenter, the UNI-Cedar Falls Russo-American Exchange, the UNLV Global \nBusiness Exchange, and the UNR International Business Exchange each \nreceive a $100,000 earmark, to the surprise of, among others, officials \nof the State Department, who not only did not request funding for these \nprograms, but in several cases were unaware they even existed.\n  Among other beneficiaries this year of unrequested spending that \nseems to serve primarily the interests of its patrons, Pacific salmon \nstand out: this bill appropriates $45,419,000, or nearly twice the $25 \nmillion requested by the Department of State, to implement the 1999 \nPacific Salmon Treaty. Included in this figure is $20 million above the \nAdministration's request to capitalize the Northern and Southern \nBoundary Funds and $419,000 above the Administration's request \ndedicated to the State of Washington for its salmon preservation \nefforts. The Committee report also takes it upon itself to absolve the \nState of Alaska of further harvest reductions under the 1999 Pacific \nSalmon Treaty.\n  Traveling dance and music troupes and Internet entrepreneurs are also \nbeing shown the money as a result of the Committee report's generous \nprovision of $750,000 to their cause, on the grounds that, in the \nCommittee's words, ``Performances by touring U.S. dance and music \ntroupes have afforded our diplomats unusual access to oft-times elusive \nsenior policy-makers in Africa. At the same time, the lure of \ntechnological innovation, especially the explosion of the Internet, \nafford American educators and entrepreneurs a rare opportunity to \ndevelop lasting links with African elites.'' Our relations with African \nnations are important, and many countries torn by crippling poverty, \nfamine, disease, civil unrest, and open warfare could use our help. I \nlike a good dance performance as much as anyone, but I'm not positive \nthis funding is the best way to help our friends or advance American \ninterests in Africa.\n  For many years now I have opposed the Advanced Technology Program at \nthe Department of Commerce on grounds that it is ``corporate pork.'' \nFor many years, any of the Nation's leading companies have reaped the \nbenefits of this grant program for research ideas that they could and \nshould have pursued under their corporate budgets. Proponents of the \nprogram have cited that the program funds high-risk projects.\n  Several years ago, on the Senate Commerce Committee, we reviewed many \nof the funded projects under the program and found that many of the \nprojects were not high-risk at all, but rather evolutionary or \nincremental development of existing technologies.\n  The President has stated that the future of the program would be \nsubject to a Commerce Department's review. The fiscal year 2002 budget \nrequest has essentially eliminated funding for ATP. The Appropriations \nCommittee has provided funding of $204 million for fiscal year 2002, \n$191 million above the President's request. Furthermore, to ensure that \nthis funding is awarded in a timely manner, the Appropriations \nCommittee, in report language, has prohibited obligations of any funds \nunder the Department's Departmental Management account, which funds \nsalaries and other expenses, until a plan on how timely awards are to \nbe made. That is equivalent to saying make ATP awards or we will shut \ndown the Department.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to curb our habit of directing hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars to locality-specific special interests and our \ninclusion of legislative riders which thwart the very process that is \nneeded to ensure our laws address the concerns and interests of all \nAmericans, not just a few who seek special protection or advantage.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 1538 to h.r. 2500\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hamphsire. Mr. President, I rise to raise an issue \nregarding the meaning and effect of amendment No. 1538 to H.R. 2500. I \nam proud to have joined in sponsoring this amendment with Senators \nHarkin, Warner, Inhofe, Cochran, Allard, Campbell, and Johnson.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is the understanding of the Senator from New Hampshire \nthat the proper meaning of that amendment would bar the State and \nJustice Departments from filing any statement of interest or in any \nmanner intervening to oppose any civil action brought by a former \nprisoner of war against a corporation of the type referenced in the \namendment?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Yes. This is the intent of the amendment \nwhich passed this body by voice vote after a motion to table failed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is my understanding as well.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a provision that \nhas been included in the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary \nAppropriations Subcommittee manager's amendment to H.R. 2500 that is \nabsolutely crucial to recovering threatened and\n\n[[Page S9436]]\n\nendangered species, while also protecting people and the economies of \nareas where these species are present.\n  I would like to thank the esteemed Chairman and Ranking Member of the \nSubcommittee and the Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee for \nrecognizing the critical nature of this issue and including it in the \nmanager's amendment.\n  The Endangered Species Act, ESA, requires Federal agencies to avoid \nactions that are likely to ``jeopardize'' the continued existence of \nthreatened or endangered species or destroy or adversely modify \ndesignated critical habitat. Agencies must ``consult'' with the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service, who \nissue a biological opinion at the conclusion of consultation to assist \nthe Federal agency to meet its substantive no-jeopardy obligation. The \nobligation to avoid jeopardy rests upon on the Federal ``action \nagency,'' not on the Services. These actions may include the \nconstruction of a highway or bridge, a stream restoration project to \nbenefit listed fish species, a forest health activity such as thinning \nor prescribed fire to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire, or the \noperation of hydroelectric projects.\n  In the West, we have seen countless projects held up for inordinate \namounts of time. They have caused economic hardship and job loss, while \nalso draining the resources of the Federal Government. What is so \nsignificant about these resources being consumed by the consultation \nprocess is that in nearly all of these cases, projects did not \njeopardize threatened or endangered species. In nearly every case, \nneither the species nor their habitats were at risk. In every case, \nthis was a matter of doing paperwork that is required by the regulatory \nprocess. And, in no case, did this process do anything to increase a \nspecies chances of survival or improve habitat for that species on-the-\nground.\n  In 1986, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine \nFisheries Service issued joint regulations that divided consultations \ninto ``informal'' and ``formal.'' Informal consultations occur for any \naction that ``may affect'' a listed species. If the consulting Service \nfinds that adverse affect on the species is likely, then formal \nconsultation begins and the service will issue a formal biological \nopinion.\n  Since 1986, the consultation process has mushroomed into a lengthy \nand expensive process. Eight hundred and twenty two new species have \nbeen listed since then, including 21 new salmon listings in the past \nfive years. Between 1987 and 1995 Federal agencies were required to \ncomplete more than 186,000 consultations with the Services on proposed \nprograms and projects. The increasing number of critical habitat \ndesignations will only add to this burden. Despite efforts to manage \nthe workload under existing rules, the Services have been unable to \nquell growing criticism that they cannot do the job adequately.\n\n  Yet only three tenths of one percent of these projects, let me say \nthat again, only three tenths of one percent or fewer than 600, were \nfound to be likely to jeopardize a protected species or adversely \nmodify critical habitat. A full 99.7 percent of all consultations \ninvolved projects that already complied fully with the ESA. Only one \nout of every 300 consultations involved a project with a potential to \nviolate the ESA.\n  Each year Federal agencies are compelled to expend millions of \nFederal dollars for elaborate consultations on projects that pose no \nsignificant threat to species. Each of these consultations requires \nextensive studies and reports by the Federal action agency and one or \nboth of the Services, and extends for months or years before ending \nwith the inevitable no-jeopardy finding that was obvious from the \nstart. The Services have increased their staffs every year for the past \ndecade in order to complete more and more of these unneeded \nconsultations that have no value for protected species.\n  These project delays further drain the Federal Treasury by increasing \nthe ultimate costs of the stalled projects. The delays also cause \nmillions of dollars more in lost economic opportunity for private \ncitizens dependent on a stalled project. These consultations sap \nresources from those relatively few situations where a species actually \nneeds protection from a proposed Federal agency project or program.\n  This out-of-control consultation process is contrary to Congress' \nintent in enacting the Endangered Species Act. The Supreme Court has \nobserved that consultation is among the ESA's procedural safeguards \nintended ``to avoid needless economic dislocation produced by agency \nofficials zealously but unintelligently pursuing their environmental \nobjectives.'' (Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 176-77 (1997).)\n  The joint consultation rules must be modified to mitigate the \nproblem, reduce the workload and continue the same level of protection \nfor the listed species. The regulations have caused large numbers of \nunneeded and burdensome consultations. None of these is required by the \nESA and none of them is necessary in today's heightened sensitivity of \nendangered species responsibility to protect listed species.\n  It is impossible to make the argument that streamlining the \nconsultation regulations will negatively affect species. In fact, a \nmore efficient and effective process will help imperiled species by \nreducing unnecessary paperwork, and thus, reducing the resources needed \nto do the paperwork, and by redirecting this precious resources to \nmaking real, on-the-ground improvements for imperiled species.\n  My provision, which has been included in the bill, would direct the \nServices to review this situation and revise their joint regulations \naccordingly. The review would consider the significant increase in \nnumber, cost, and duration of consultations since promulgation of the \nregulations in 1986 and would result in modifications to the \nregulations that will streamline the consultation process to ensure \nthat: one, all forms of consultation are completed within the deadlines \nprovided in section 7 of the ESA; two, the requirements for initiating \nconsultation and for any information generated and documentation \nprepared by both the action agency and the consulting agency during \nconsultation are fully consistent with section 7; and three, the \nconsultation process is conducted in an efficient and useful manner to \nmeet the purpose of section 7.\n\n  Section 7(b) of the ESA imposes a 90-day deadline, subject to certain \nextensions to which each agency must agree. If there is a permit \napplicant involved, consultation may not exceed 150 days without the \napplicant's consent. The 1986 regulations make no effort to follow \nthese deadlines during the informal consultation stage, thus allowing \nthis process to drag on and on.\n  A primary cause of the explosion in unneeded consultations is the \nextremely low threshold in the regulations for an action agency to \ninitiate a consultation. The regulations require an action agency to \ninitiate consultation for any proposed action that ``may affect'' \neither a listed species or critical habitat. In announcing the \nregulations, the Fish and Wildlife Service explained that they may \naffect threshold means that ``any possible effect, whether beneficial, \nbenign, adverse, or of an undetermined character, triggers the formal \nconsultation requirement.''\n  The regulations do not permit an action agency to decide that it does \nnot need to consult on a ``may affect'' action, no matter how harmless \nthe activity may be. A ``may affect'' action can be exempted from \nformal consultation only if a Service concurs in writing that the \naction is ``not likely to adversely affect'' a listed species or \ncritical habitat. That finding itself requires a multi-step inter-\nagency administrative process called informal consultation, which often \ntakes longer than the formal consultation it is intended to avoid.\n  The ESA does not contain the ``may affect'' consultation threshold. \nAs a matter of fact, the Endangered Species Act does not contain any \nconsultation threshold at all. The ``may affect'' threshold in the \nregulations is so far removed from the substantive no-jeopardy \nrequirement in the ESA that large volumes of unnecessary consultations \nwere virtually guaranteed to occur--and have.\n  Other sections of the regulations also compel large numbers of \nunnecessary consultations: consultation is required on any action \nauthorized, funded, or carried out ``in part'' by a federal agency, \neven if the Federal involvement is minor or secondary to private or \nstate\n\n[[Page S9437]]\n\naction; consultation is required for agency actions that are intended \nto benefit species; consultation is required for agency regulations \nwith no direct on-the-ground impact; and consultation is required for \nagency actions that ``indirectly'' cause modification to the land, \nwater, or air.\n  The regulations also impose burdensome documentation requirements, \nfar beyond the ESA, that guarantee that even the most minor \nconsultation will be long and slow. The action agency is required to \ninitiate every formal consultation with a detailed written report on \nthe manner in which the action may affect any listed species or \ncritical habitat and an analysis of any cumulative effects, and must \nalso provide the best scientific and commercial information available \nor which can be obtained during the consultation for an adequate review \nof the effects that an action may have upon listed species or critical \nhabitat. Moreover, while the ESA only requires ``biological \nassessments'' to be prepared for ``major construction activities,'' the \njoint regulations make this detailed analysis a virtual requirement for \nevery agency action.\n  The joint regulations then mandate that a biological opinion include \na detailed discussion of the effects of the action on listed species or \ncritical habitat that addresses all of the indirect, interrelated, \ninterconnected and cumulative effects as defined in the regulations. In \ncontrast, the ESA only requires that a biological opinion set forth a \nsummary of the information on which the opinion is based, detailing how \nthe agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.\n  The Services have the authority under existing law to amend their \nregulations to improve the operation of the process. The agencies can \ninitiate a rulemaking process to amend their regulations, with notice \nand opportunity for the public to comment, following the same \nprocedures as were employed for the original 1986 regulations. No \namendment of the ESA is required. The amendment I am offering merely \ndirects the Services to use a portion of their fiscal year 2002 funds \nto review the consultation regulations and propose changes that will \nbring this process into line with the realities of the 21st Century and \nwill enable all federal agencies to fulfill their obligations under the \nESA.\n  The Endangered Species Act is besieged with problems that must be \nsolved in order to adequately protected listed species and recover \nthem. At the same time, many Western communities feel that they have \nbeen assaulted by the ESA in the last two decades. Win-win solutions \noften evade us as policymakers when it comes to issues that are as \ncontentious as the Endangered Species, but this is truly a win-win for \nspecies AND people. Again, my sincere thanks to the chairman and \nRanking Member of the Commerce Appropriations Subcommittee for their \nassistance in finding solutions to this troubling issue.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, last year this Committee and Congress \npassed legislation to privatize INMARSAT [International Maritime \nSatellite Organization]. As part of the privatization, INMARSAT is \nrequired to hold an initial public offering [IPO]. INMARSAT's IPO \ndeadline is set for December 31 of this year. Since the IPO market \ncontinues to be in bad shape, INMARSAT and its investment advisors \nwould like time to see if the market improves.\n  INMARSAT was established in 1979 to improve maritime communications \nespecially for distress and safety signals. Over the past two decades, \nINMARSAT has branched out to serve both maritime markets and \nincreasingly any markets requiring mobility--shipping, oil and gas \nexploration and the FAA.\n  Since the IPO market has nosed-dived, INMARSAT has been waiting for \nconditions to improve. All of the extensions available to INMARSAT have \nnow been used and the FCC has no more discretion to extend the \ndeadline.\n  The dilemma is that if INMARSAT does not hold the IPO it will be in \nviolation of U.S. law, and if it does hold the IPO, they could be found \nin breach of its fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders, possibly \nsubjecting itself to shareholder lawsuits.\n  My amendment would simply give the FCC the ability to extend the \ndeadline an additional 18 months to see if the IPO market improves. A \nlarge number of U.S. companies have pulled their IPOs off the market \ngiven market conditions. We are trying to privatize INMARSAT and we \nshould allow them to act like a company.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9437-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9437-S9438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  IN SUPPORT OF THE BROADCASTING BOARD OF GOVERNORS' NEW MIDDLE EAST \n                             RADIO NETWORK\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for a \nproposal by the Broadcasting Board of Governors to enhance and expand \nservice to the Middle East. According to the Chairman of the \nBroadcasting Board of Governors, the mission of U.S. international \nbroadcasting is to promote the open communication of information and \nideas in support of democracy, and the freedom to seek, receive, and \nimpart information, worldwide. In pursuit of this goal, the \nBroadcasting Board of Governors has proposed a new station, the Middle \nEast Radio Network.\n  Would Senator Boxer care to enlighten us on the current U.S. \nGovernment sponsored Arabic language broadcasting in the Middle East?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I would and I thank the Senator for this opportunity \nto describe the important results of the board's most recent Language \nService Review. This review found that our current broadcasting efforts \nin the Middle East only reach approximately 2 percent of the \npopulation. The boards's 2001 Language Service Review highlighted the \nimportance of revitalizing America's Arabic programs in order to offset \nlocal Arabic radio broadcasts that often serve to incite violence in \nthe region. An alternative must be offered to the hate radio that so \noften incites the population to violence.\n  In February, Broadcasting Board of Governors' representatives \ntraveled throughout the Middle East to gather facts, to talk to \ngovernment and media officials, and to begin to build a concept for \nsuccess. The research emphasized the need for a greater U.S. media \npresence and increased local content to U.S. broadcasts. The \nresearchers found that in spite of widespread opposition to the U.S. \npolicies, there is a strong attraction to the American values of \nfreedom and individualism. In addition, the Arab public would like \ninformation about U.S. businesses, technology and advances in medicine. \nI believe my colleague from Nebraska would like to discuss the \nBroadcasting Board of Governors' plans to address the shortcomings in \nour broadcasting services to the Middle East.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Senator for the opportunity to speak about the \nnew broadcast service proposed by the Broadcasting Board of Governors \nfor fiscal year 2002. The goal is to provide broadcasts that will \nappeal to a broad Arabic-speaking audience by providing news and \ninformation about events in the region. The working name for this \nstation is the Middle East Radio Network. It would be a 24 hour per \nday, 7 days per week Arabic-language station to be delivered via a \ncombination of local MW and FM, and shortwave to areas where local \ndelivery is not possible. Programming will include news, music, talk, \nand interactive programs with listener participation. The Broadcasting \nBoard of Governors plans to feature reliable news and discussion of \nissues relevant to the audience in a format to appeal to young adults \nand to news-seekers of all ages. The programs will embody two important \nthemes: individual choice and respect for others. In a region where \nmore than half of the population is under 25, a successful station must \nappeal to young people who are the best hope to end the cycle of \nviolence that has ravaged the region.\n  I know my colleague from Washington would like to discuss the \ndelivery of this new service in the Middle East, and I invite her to \ncomment.\n  Mrs. Murray. The expansion and enhancement of our radio programming \nin the Middle East are critical to the success of our policies in the \nregion. The proposed service would reach audiences in the West Bank and \nGaza, the Gulf, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and Sudan in the most popular \nmedia of AM, FM and satellite program delivery. This is an area where \nwe cannot afford to deliver our message through a third party\n\n[[Page S9438]]\n\nbroadcaster, and we must deliver accurate information about events \noccurring in the region. We must be an accessible voice in the region \nwith a program and format that will attract a broader audience. This \nexpanded service will also provide the region with increased exposure \nto news and information and Western journalistic standards of a free \npress. This provision of information will help counter the existing \nregional broadcasts which are often censored or under state control.\n  I am confident this increased information will help us further our \npolicy goals of establishing peace and stability in the region. In \nlight of the terrible events of this week, I appreciate the opportunity \nto register my support for this program and our international \nbroadcasting efforts. I would also add that I concur with the comments \nof my colleagues.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I also concur with the remarks of my colleagues.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I also concur with my colleagues and would like to ask \nSenator Inouye to provide his final comments.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I concur in the comments of my colleagues about the \nimportance of the enhanced programming in the Middle East proposed by \nthe Broadcasting Board of Governors. It is my hope that the proposed \nservice will help disseminate news and information throughout the \nregion. I am pleased that the Broadcasting Board of Governors has \ncommitted to providing this much-needed service and look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to support the Middle East Radio Network.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9438-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             STEPFAMILY DAY\n\n Ms. STABENOW.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Eluid Pete \nSuazo, a distinguished Utah State Senator whose untimely death in \nAugust has had a tremendous impact--not only on his family and close \nfriends, but also on the entire state of Utah.\n  At the time of his death, Senator Suazo represented Salt Lake City's \nmulti-cultural west side, and he also served as the Assistant minority \nwhip. Pete was heralded for his unfailing determination and advocacy \nfor his constituents. Indeed, his integrity and absolute dedication won \nSenator Suazo respect from his colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  As the only Hispanic member of the Utah Legislature, Pete felt a \nstrong sense of responsibility to honor and help Utah's growing \nHispanic and minority populations. He was a top leader of the Hispanic \ncommunity, who was also able to cross Utah's ethnic and political lines \nto effect policies benefitting the entire community. I remember how \nPete's wife, Alicia, fondly recalled the day her husband decided to run \nfor office. He passionately stated, ``The Chicano boy is going to be a \nsenator, not in New Mexico, but in Utah where the work is going to be \ndoubly hard and the victory glorious.'' This optimism showed in Pete's \nface, for he was always smiling.\n  Pete fought for the underdog and the less privileged. For those who \nsought his advice and assistance, he always had a helping hand and a \nlistening ear. He worked tirelessly to improve the lives of the youth \nin his neighborhood. He organized graffiti removal teams, baseball and \nsoccer leagues, summer work programs, and provided so many other \nopportunities to strengthen the characters of countless young men and \nwomen.\n  Over the past few years, Pete helped reinvigorate amateur boxing in \nUtah and participated as a referee to ensure safety in the sport. The \nSenator undertook these and many other volunteer efforts to help the \nless fortunate, always giving hope to those who needed it so much.\n  Senator Suazo's work ethic was extraordinary and was developed at a \nvery young age. He took great pride in whatever he was doing--from \nselling popcorn at a charity carnival in his youth to serving as a \nleading state senator. Throughout his life, he used his tremendous \nenergy and his capacity for hard work to champion the causes in which \nhe so fervently believed.\n  While serving in the Utah legislature, Senator Suazo was not afraid \nof the tough battles. In recent years, his work to adopt a more pro-\nactive and stronger hate crimes law defined Pete Suazo's leadership and \ndetermination. He never gave up, and through his efforts this issue \nrose to the forefront of the legislature's attention.\n  Mr. President, Utah has lost a true hero. Senator Pete Suazo was a \nman with great integrity, strong personal conviction, and a humble \nheart. His life was an example of dedicated public service and utmost \nlove for his community and fellow man. I hope my colleagues will join \nme in sending our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the Suazo family--\nhis wife, Alicia, and their children Travis, Abel, Emilio and Julio, \nhis parents Pat and Lily, his siblings Kathy, Becky, Georgia, Anna, \nEllie and Andy--and also to the many, many friends and neighbors of \nPete who will deeply miss him. My hope is that future generations of \nUtahns will have the desire to follow in this good man's footsteps, and \ncontinue his legacy of work for the people of Utah. In so many \ninstances Pete did not only dream the impossible dream, he strove for \nand attained it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9438-3", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9438-4", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9438-5", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9438-S9439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE DECLARATION OF NATIONAL EMERGENCY BY REASON OF CERTAIN \n          TERRORIST ATTACKS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 40\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 201 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. \n1621), I hereby report that I have exercised my authority to declare a \nnational emergency by reason of the terrorist attacks at the World \nTrade Center, New York, New York, and the Pentagon, and the continuing \nand immediate threat of further attacks on the United States.

A bill to authorize the issuance of Unity Bonds in response \nto the acts of terrorism perpetrated against the United States on \nSeptember 11, 2001, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to unite our \ncitizens in this time of great crisis. As Americans, we feel many \nemotions, from anger to sadness, because of the tragedy of the \nterrorist attacks this past week.\n  The American people have responded with incredible acts of heroism, \nkindness and generosity. The outpouring of volunteers, blood donors and \ncontributions of food and money demonstrates that America will unite to \nprovide relief to the victims of these cowardly terrorist acts. This \nresponse is the true American spirit our country has always known.\n  So many of my constituents in South Dakota have called my office this \nweek to ask what they can possibly do to help their fellow Americans \nwho are suffering today. Many have given blood, others have donated to \naid organizations, and most have offered prayers for the victims and \ntheir families. One woman asked whether she could buy the equivalent of \nthe old war bonds that allowed our citizens to contribute to the war \neffort back in World War II.\n  Based on my constituent's idea, today I am introducing legislation \nthat directs the United States Treasury to issue Unity Bonds. Americans \nwho purchase these savings bonds will be contributing to disaster \nrelief to the victims of Tuesday's attack and to our Nation's war \nagainst terrorism.\n  We will recover from this week's attacks. We will rebuild our \nNation's infrastructure, and we will rebuild our Nation's spirit. But \nit will take a sustained, long-term effort to stamp out terrorism \nagainst the United States and all other liberty-loving nations.\n  Unity Bonds will allow Americans who want to show their support for \nthis great country to participate in a meaningful way. I urge you to \njoin me in helping to unite our citizens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1143. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to issue \nWar Bonds in support of recovery and response efforts relating to the \nSeptember 11, 2001 hijackings and attacks on the Pentagon and the World \nTrade Center, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, no American was spared from the \nhorrific and violent assaults on New York and the Pentagon which \nshocked us all the morning of September 11, 2001. Yet, even as heroic \nrescue workers sift through the rubble that remains, our nation is \ncoming together in its resolve to respond to these despicable acts. \nThis indefatigable spirit is a shining symbol of America's resilience \nand purpose.\n  The United States will undoubtedly meet the challenges which we now \nface. As President Bush has stated, ``Now that war has been declared on \nus, we will lead the world to victory.''\n  Winning the war against terrorism will require the full support of \nthe American public who stand so anxious and so willing to contribute. \nTherefore, today I am introducing legislation to direct the Department \nof the Treasury to establish a special category of U.S. savings bonds \ndesignated War Bonds.\n  These War Bonds will give voice to countless Americans who are \nlooking for opportunities to make a difference in this time of need. By \ninvesting in a U.S. War Bond, patriotic citizens will have an \nopportunity to make a direct contribution to the war against the \nscourge of terrorism and provide much-needed resources for the effort \nto rescue the injured, rebuild the broken, and retaliate against the \nenemy.\n  America's battle against the evil of terrorism will amount to much \nmore than the immediate steps which are being undertaken in the \naftermath of Tuesday's carnage. Unlike previous conflicts when \nAmericans had the luxury of recognizing a precise moment of victory, \nthis battle's success will be assured only if our shores never again \nfall victim to terrorist acts. Thus, by definition, this war will be \nongoing. As such, it will be essential for our Government to generate \nconsistent public support for its actions.\n  The national campaign to sell U.S. War Bonds will serve not only to \ngenerate revenue, but will provide an opportunity to educate all \nAmericans on the complicated nature of the terrorist threat and the \nresulting comprehensive nature of our response. This national effort \nwill build on one of American's proudest traditions. Dating from the \nRevolutionary War through World War II, our country has relied upon \nU.S. War Bonds to respond to the threats posed by our most dangerous \nenemies. The World War II effort generated more than $200 billion in \nrevenue from patriotic Americans eager to respond to the call of duty. \nI have no doubt that today's Americans will respond in kind, thus \nproviding unprecedented support for the long road ahead.\n  I call on all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, and Mr. Lott):\n  S.J.

Mr. President, we are now learning that the terrorists \nwho attacked our Nation this week may have been planning their hideous \ncrimes for years.\n  In their evil and painstaking calculations, the terrorists clearly \ntried to anticipate every possible obstacle they might encounter.\n  But there is one obstacle they overlooked; that is, the courage of \nthe American people, and our fierce determination to defend the people \nand values we cherish.\n  It was that courage and determination that appears to have given the \npassengers aboard the plane that crashed near Pittsburgh the strength \nto resist their murderers and prevent an even greater tragedy.\n  It is that same courage and determination that is at the heart of \nthis resolution we pass today.\n  Tuesday, from the window of my office in the Capitol, I watched thick \nblack smoke rise from the Pentagon and fill the sky over Arlington \nCemetery.\n  The graves in that hallowed ground remind us that Americans have \nfaced great evil before and defeated it.\n  By passing this resolution, we are saying we are prepared to confront \nevil again and to defeat it again.\n  We are saying that the Congress of the United States--Democrats and \nRepublicans stand with the President as our Commander in Chief.\n  We are authorizing the President to use force against the terrorists \nwho attacked America on September 11, and any nation, organization, or \nperson that aids or harbors them.\n  As a result of our actions today, we know that our men and women in \nuniform may be forced to confront a new kind of enemy--an enemy whose \nactions are constrained neither by conscience, nor the rules of war.\n  We also know that whatever they are called to do, they will do it \nwell and with honor. And we know this: They will prevail.\n  This is the gravest responsibility we can undertake as elected \nleaders.\n  That is why our Constitution calls on the President and the Congress \nto act together on decisions to employ our armed forces to defend our \nNation.\n  By passing this resolution, we reaffirm our belief in our \nConstitution as the foundation and strength of our democracy.\n  By providing specific statutory authorization and by requiring \ncontinuing consultation between the President and the Congress, we also \nunderscore the importance of the War Powers Resolution. Only by \nstanding together, can we stand strong and defeat this threat.\n  As I have said before, what happened on Tuesday was not simply an \nattack against America. It was a crime against democracy, and decency. \nIt was a crime against civilization itself.\n  Americans have been deeply touched this week by the support we have \nreceived from friends throughout the world. From the gates of \nBuckingham Palace, to the halls of the United Nations and NATO, to the \nstreets of Moscow and beyond, the grief displayed by our friends has \nhelped to make our own grief more bearable.\n  We thank the family of nations for standing with us in these early \ndays of this battle against terrorism. Even more, we thank them for \ntheir commitment to stand with us in the days ahead.\n  I am confident we will continue to stand together, and defeat this \nmost insidious of threats, wherever and whenever it arises.\n  We will be fierce in the defense of our ideals. We will make whatever \nmaterial or physical sacrifice that is required of us to punish those \nwho attacked our nation, and to prevent future attacks.\n  But we will not sacrifice the ideals that built this nation and have \nsustained us for more than two centuries.\n  Just as we are united against the terrorists and their co-\nconspirators who carried out the attacks on our nation, we must also be \nunited against acts of hate against innocent Arab-Americans and \nMuslims.\n  The madmen who carried out these crimes despise our values of liberty \nand justice for all.\n  By maintaining our commitment to those ideals now, we send a powerful \nmessage to those who committed this evil that they have not won, and \nthey will not win this war. They have broken our hearts, but not our \nwill.\n\n[[Page S9460]]\n\n  The terrorists hoped to bring us to our knees. Let us defy them by \nstanding together on our feet as one nation, indivisible.\n  Yes, we saw evil this week. But we have also seen great strength. We \nhave seen it in the heroic men and women working day and night in the \nwreckage of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\n  We have seen it in the countless Americans in cities across the \ncountry who waited hours to donate blood.\n  And we have seen it in the men and women who may have prevented even \ngreater destruction through their bravery aboard that doomed flight.\n  That is the strength of America--the one obstacle the terrorists did \nnot anticipate, and the one that will be their undoing.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9460-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9460-S9461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AMERICA UNITED\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, at midday today I attended the prayer \nservice at the National Cathedral which President Bush called. It was \nattended by President Bush and four former Presidents, and many \nAmericans, of course. And I think millions of Americans watched on \ntelevision. It was a remarkable, moving, and emotional prayer service.\n  As I sat in the prayer service, I thought about something that \nhappened yesterday as I toured the damage to the Pentagon with my \ncolleagues, Senator Daschle, Senator Reid, and others. Yesterday, we \nwere touring the Pentagon where, of course, many Americans died as a \nresult of an airplane, loaded with jet fuel and commercial passengers, \nwhich was flown by a terrorist into the Pentagon and caused a fire and \ncollapse and so much damage.\n  Yesterday, as we were being briefed at the Pentagon about the damage \nthat was caused and the loss of life, my colleague, Senator Reid, will \nremember that there was a crane near the building. The crane had a long \nsteel cable attached to it. On the end of the steel cable was one of \nthese little baskets. There was a man standing in the basket in \nuniform. The crane hauled this basket up to the fourth floor of this \ngaping wound in the middle of the Pentagon building. This man, who is a \nsoldier, reached around from this basket deep into the hole of the \nPentagon building, and from outside of this hole he pulled out a red \nand gold flag. He put it into this basket, again, dangling from a \ncrane. They brought him back to the ground. It turned out he had pulled \nout of this gaping hole in this burned-out structure at the Pentagon a \nU.S. Marine flag that had for some reason not burned. It appeared to be \nthe only thing that could not have possibly burned in that entire area.\n\n  This young Marine, who grabbed this U.S. Marine Corps flag--this \nbeautiful gold and red flag--marched over to where we were, and he \nstopped and said he was taking this flag to the U.S. Marine Corps \nCommandant.\n  He said he saw the flag as he looked through the wreckage up on the \nfourth floor in an office, and miraculously this flag had not burned. \nHe wanted to get to it, so he got somebody to take him up in a crane in \na basket, and he retrieved this flag.\n  As he held this flag proudly, on his way to the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps, he said to us: They couldn't destroy this flag, and they \ncan't destroy this country. And I thought, wow, what a thing to say. \nThis morning I woke up and looked at the Washington Post, and there is \na full color picture of this young Marine holding that U.S. Marine flag \nas he came away from that building. It was just before he came over to \ngreet us on his way to the Marine Corps Commandant.\n  It was but one act--a symbolic act, in many ways--of a young soldier \nwho used that flag that he saw, that had survived the fire and survived \nthe carnage--the one flag that was left standing--to make a point that \nthose who committed these heinous acts, those madmen who perpetrated \nthese acts of evil that murdered so many innocent men, women, and \nchildren in this country, could not destroy that flag and cannot \ndestroy this country.\n  As I said the other day, all of us are heartbroken in America today. \nWe express that in many ways. Prayer services across the country, \nrecommended by our President, have reflected a common understanding--\nthe ability to grieve together and the ability to come together. It was \nimportant to do that. It is important to do that.\n  But there is something else that is important for us to understand. \nThe terrorists did something they could never have possibly imagined: \nThey created in this country a togetherness that has not been here for \nsome long while. People want to show the flag these days.\n  My 12-year-old daughter yesterday said: Dad, let's put out the flag. \nPeople all over this country are putting an American flag out in full \nview. And people around this country are doing things that we know \nrepresent the inherent goodness of people.\n  Within hours of the terrible tragedy at the World Trade Center--\nwithin hours of those evil acts--we had scores of people lining up to \ngive blood in this country. I saw the interview of one person who was \nin a 5-hour line, and she was asked: Why are you in line 5 hours \nwaiting to give blood? And she said: Because it's the only thing I can \ndo, and I want to do something today.\n  The terrorists could not have possibly imagined what their acts would \ndo to bring Americans together. This country has a common purpose. Yes, \nit has a great deal of grief and, yes, our heart is broken, but our \nspirit is not broken.\n  The common purpose in this country is to grieve together, to pray \ntogether, and then understand that we want to--and we must--find those \nwho planned and committed these acts, and those who harbored them, and \npunish them and at the same time take the kind of precautions we know \nwe must take to prevent this from happening again.\n  It is a free country. We are proud of that freedom and liberty. And \nit is also understood by everyone that we have the risk of acts of \nterrorism committed in free countries precisely because of that \nfreedom. Perhaps we can never make certain that we will not ever see a \nterrorist act again. Perhaps we can never do that. We can certainly \nexert all the energy and all the genius available to all of us in this \ncountry to take the steps we think can try to prevent these acts again.\n\n  But notwithstanding the challenges and the tragedies, and \nnotwithstanding the common grief that was born of these evil acts, this \ncountry will remain a free country. We will remain a country of which \nall of us are enormously proud.\n  There is a spirit about America: A spirit to prevail, a spirit to \nbuild, a spirit to come together. It is reflected by a lot of things, a \ncouple of which I just mentioned. And that spirit is, in my judgment, \nnot dimming; that spirit is growing. In the coming weeks and days, I \nthink manifested today on the floor of the Senate, that spirit will \nnurture all of America.\n  Today, on the floor of the Senate, we passed a piece of legislation, \nwithout a dissenting vote, that said we want to help people in need. We \nprovided the resources to say to the people who were victims of this: \nYou are not alone. Your families are not alone. Your loved ones are not \nalone. Your cities are not alone. And then we passed, without a \ndissenting vote, an authorization to the President, who asked for an \nauthorization from Congress, to be able to take appropriate action \nagainst those who committed these evil acts.\n  Without a dissenting vote, the Congress said to the President: Yes, \nwe are with you. That is quite a remarkable thing to have done. And it \nreflects a spirit not just here in the Senate; it reflects a spirit, in \nmy judgment, borne in the breast of every American today, proud to be \nan American, and determined to make sure we are able to retain and \nnurture this way of life, to defeat terrorism wherever it exists, and \nto nurture freedom and liberty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hesitate to interject any more words prior \nto our going out today because I think\n\n[[Page S9461]]\n\nthe tone has been set by my friend from North Dakota, but I just say \nthat there are so many examples of people coming together. The example \nof the blood drives is certainly one of the most appropriate.\n  People are now all over America in reservation lines. They are there \nto sign up to give blood 2 weeks from now, 3 weeks from now because the \nlines are so long.\n  I think my friend from North Dakota would agree that the prayer \nservice held today at the National Cathedral was touched. I think \neveryone there participated with the prayers. Billy Graham gave some \nremarks. He has been an adviser to many Presidents over the years, and \neven though his body is frail, his mind certainly is not.\n  I hope all Americans will realize that the President of the United \nStates needs everyone's prayers now. There are 535 Members of Congress. \nI was able to sit with Senator Dorgan today at the prayer service at \nthe National Cathedral. We were together. And that is what we \nlegislatures are; we are together; we are always with each other. But \nthe President of the United States is alone. He does not have people to \nlean on. He has to make decisions by himself.\n  So I hope that everyone will be involved in praying for this \nPresident, recognizing the tremendous burdens he has and the decisions \nhe has to make, decisions that are so vitally important to the virtual \nfreedom of this country, matters dealing with life and death.\n  So I do hope people will join together and have continual prayers for \nthis country and the President of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/09/14/senate-section/article/S9461-1", "month": "09", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THANKING THE PRESIDING OFFICER\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon at this late hour on \nFriday at the close of a terrible week--a week which has seared itself \ninto our very being for the rest of our lives--to object to the \napproval of John Negroponte to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the United \nNations.\n  I understand an agreement was reached that this nomination be passed \non a voice vote today. It has been made, and certainly I will honor and \nrespect the agreement. However, I believe this nomination deserves a \nfull debate on the Senate floor and a full look into the record of this \nindividual who is about to represent all of us in the United Nations.\n  I understand and I agree that America needs a U.N. ambassador. We do \nneed someone there, especially given the terrorist attacks on our \nNation this week, in terms of an international dialog and international \nresponse to this terrorist attack. But I believe it is also important \nthat all Senators be given an opportunity to vote on this controversial \nnomination and to debate it.\n  Why is Mr. Negroponte's nomination so controversial? Why did the \nBaltimore Sun, in April of this year, devote a five-part series just on \nthis one nominee? Well, I think there are two considerations that stand \nout in my mind, and I will explain why I oppose his nomination.\n  First of all, Mr. Negroponte showed a callous disregard for human \nrights abuses throughout his tenure as U.S. Ambassador to Honduras \nbetween 1981 and 1985, during which time I traveled to Honduras and, in \nfact, went out to one of the contra camps with the Ambassador at that \ntime. Quite frankly, in my conversations at that time in Honduras, and \nwith the later revelations of what was going on with Battalion 316, \nwhich was supervised and basically trained by our CIA and our military \npersonnel--when a lot of these issues came to light, it became clear to \nme that during my trip there I was misled and, quite frankly, not given \nthe correct information that I sought.\n  Secondly, I believe Mr. Negroponte knowingly misinformed the U.S. \nState Department about gross human rights violations in Honduras and \nthroughout Central America during the height of the so-called contra \nwar in Central America in the 1980s.\n  That action, in turn, resulted in the Congress being misled as to the \nscope and nature of gross human rights violations that were being \ncommitted by the contras and by the Honduran military and, in \nparticular, Battalion 316 in the Honduran military.\n  In a letter to The Economist in 1982, then-Ambassador Negroponte \nwrote:\n\n       It is simply untrue that death squads have made appearances \n     in Honduras.\n\n  Yet from 1981 to 1984 over 150 people disappeared, including one \nAmerican priest, Father James Carney, whose body has never been \nrecovered.\n\n  All indications are it was Battalion 316 that took custody of and had \ncontrol over Father Carney. There had been reports that they \ninterrogated him, that he was severely tortured and killed--he was an \nAmerican citizen, an American priest--during the time of Mr. \nNegroponte's ambassadorship.\n  I am not saying in any way he was responsible. I do not want anyone \nto get that wrong. All I am saying is as Ambassador at that time, there \nis a lot of evidence to show he just turned a\n\n[[Page S9462]]\n\nblind eye and a deaf ear to the human rights abuses at that time in \nHonduras.\n  The 1997 CIA Inspector General's report and other official records, \nas well as extensive research published in numerous books and articles, \nhave implicated Mr. Negroponte personally in condoning and covering up \negregious human rights violations during his service in Honduras in the \n1980s. Read the five-part series that was in the Baltimore Sun in 1995 \nand later amplified this year. That lays out the case quite clearly.\n  Is he really the best nominee President Bush could find to represent \nour Nation at the United Nations? I think not. I guess what bothers me \nmore than anything else is, as we move ahead seeking to get other \nnations to support us in our efforts to uphold human rights around the \nworld, he does not bring clean hands to this critically important and \nsenior diplomatic post.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following articles be \nprinted in the Record at the end of my remarks: An April 16, 2001, Los \nAngeles Times editorial headlined ``Hard Questions for U.N. Nominee''; \na Sunday, April 8, 2001, editorial written by Frank Del Olmo, associate \neditor of the Los Angeles Times; a Thursday, April 19, 2001, editorial \nwritten by Father Joseph Mulligan, a Jesuit priest from Detroit who has \nbeen working in Central America since 1986; an April 2, 2001, editorial \nfrom In These Times of the Institute for Public Affairs, and a list of \n150 people who disappeared in Honduras from October 29, 1981, to May \n30, 1985.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand agreements were made. I wish \nwe had a fuller debate on this nominee. I want the record to show if, \nin fact, there was a record vote on this nominee, this Senator from \nIowa would have voted no.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Apr. 16, 2001]\n\n                    Hard Questions for U.N. Nominee\n\n       Under normal circumstances, President Bush's nomination of \n     a veteran U.S. diplomat like John D. Negroponte to be \n     ambassador to the United Nations would be a routine matter. \n     Negroponte is well regarded in the State Department and close \n     to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. Senate approval would \n     be all but certain.\n       But while Negroponte's 37-year career in the foreign \n     service has admittedly been an impressive upward arc of \n     increasingly important ambassadorships, it was not routine. \n     It would be a mistake for the Senate, and particularly for \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations, to treat Negroponte with \n     kid gloves.\n       To be sure, Negroponte's diplomatic career has been marked \n     by noteworthy accomplishments. He handled sensitive embassy \n     posts quite effectively, most notably Mexico City in the \n     years leading up to the North American Free Trade Agreement \n     and Manila following the collapse of Philippine dictator \n     Ferdinand Marcos' regime. But Negroponte's career also \n     includes some troubling activities that took place in \n     Honduras during his tenure as ambassador there, between 1981 \n     and 1985.\n       Those were the years when President Ronald Reagan ordered \n     the CIA to launch covert activities against the Sandinista \n     government in neighboring Nicaragua. The key element of \n     Reagan's anti-Nicaragua strategy was a guerrilla war waged by \n     a puppet army based in Honduras and known as the Contras. It \n     was composed largely of former soldiers of Nicaraguan \n     dictator Anastasio Somoza, whom the Sandinistas had ousted. \n     With such unseemly allies, the Contra war was immediately \n     controversial, and Congress imposed limits on how the CIA \n     could wage it.\n       Among other things, Congress insisted that before a small \n     nation like Honduras received massive increases in military \n     aid (from $4 million a year to $77 million during \n     Negroponte's tenure alone) that the U.S. Embassy there had to \n     verify that the notoriously corrupt Honduran army would use \n     the money properly. The Honduran security forces were not, \n     for instance, to use the money to pursue political dissidents \n     or otherwise violate the human rights of their fellow \n     citizens. Congress even required annual human rights reports \n     on Honduras to ensure that its mandate was being carried out.\n       The human rights reports that Negroponte signed off on \n     during his tenure in Honduras need to be carefully reviewed \n     by the Senate. For while he routinely reported few violations \n     by the Honduran government, it has since become public \n     record, through declassified government documents and \n     reputable reports in the U.S. and Honduran press, that the \n     Honduran military was indeed engaged in some very brutal \n     activities in support of the Contras and U.S. policy.\n       Honduran officials have documented the disappearance of as \n     many as 184 Honduran citizens, not just political dissidents \n     but innocent civilians who may have been mistaken for \n     dissidents, during that period. Most of these kidnappings and \n     murders were carried out by a secret, CIA-trained Honduran \n     army unit known as Battalion 316. The Senate should probe \n     deeply regarding how much of this activity Negroponte was \n     aware of and whether he hid what he knew from Congress.\n       The Contra war was an ugly and inconclusive affair--but \n     brush-fire wars usually are. And no one is suggesting that \n     Negroponte bears all, or even most, of the blame for whatever \n     excesses may have taken place in Honduras. But he had a legal \n     obligation to truthfully inform Congress of what was \n     happening in Honduras in support of U.S. policy. If \n     Negroponte did not live up to that obligation, it calls into \n     question his suitability for an important post at the United \n     Nations.\n       The Senate must not approve Negroponte's nomination without \n     asking him some very tough questions and putting his tenure \n     in Honduras under renewed and thorough scrutiny.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Apr. 8, 2001]\n\n                Is Negroponte Clean Enough for the U.N?\n\n                          (By Frank Del Olmo)\n\n       We're eyeball to eyeball with the Chinese, talking tough to \n     the Russians and not talking to North Korea at all. It's back \n     to the Cold War.\n       Call me parochial, but what has me shivering after a brief \n     but chilly visit to Washington is how the Bush administration \n     is reviving the old U.S.-Soviet standoff in a part of the \n     world where I spent my crazy youth as a correspondent: \n     Central America. And if you loved how the Bushies tossed \n     those alleged Russian spies out of the country, wait until \n     you see what's for dessert. Warmed over Contras!\n       Or, to be more precise, a warmed-over Contra paymaster, \n     John D. Negroponte, who has been nominated to be ambassador \n     to the United Nations.\n       You remember the Contras--the CIA-funded guerrillas who \n     waged a futile war to overthrow the revolutionary Sandinista \n     government in Nicaragua, until the Nicaraguan people simply \n     voted the Sandinistas out of power. Even those poor Central \n     Americans, it turned out, know how democracy works. But more \n     on the Contras later.\n       It is no longer news that most of the men (doesn't National \n     Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice know any women she can \n     suggest for some of these jobs?) President Bush wants to put \n     in key positions on his foreign policy team are Cold Warriors \n     from the days of presidents Reagan and Bush the First. But \n     some of the guys being hauled out of cold storage have \n     worrisome histories that Congress needs to revisit before \n     punching their tickets. We can start with Negroponte.\n       During his 37-year career with the State Department, \n     Negroponte has held several sensitive embassy jobs in Asia \n     (Vietnam, during the war, and the Philippines in the 1990s) \n     and Latin America (Mexico, in the years leading up to the \n     North American Free Trade Agreement, and Honduras, during the \n     start of the Contra war against neighboring Nicaragua). It is \n     Negroponte's tenure in Honduras, from 1981 to 1985, that the \n     Senate needs to consider.\n       I traveled all over Central America in those days, knew \n     Negroponte and members of his staff and have no illusions \n     about anyone who was involved in those brush-fire wars. Some \n     ugly things were done on both sides in the same of national \n     security--from assassinations to wholesale massacres. It was \n     quite literally a bloody mess, and Negroponte was in it up to \n     his elbows.\n       Just how deep we don't know because Negroponte's \n     involvement in convert U.S. activities in Honduras has never \n     been fully investigated by Congress, even when the Mexican \n     government protested Negroponte's 1989 appointment to run \n     the U.S. Embassy there. Former Mexican President Carlos \n     Salinas de Gortari wanted NAFTA so badly that he probably \n     would have accepted any U.S. ambassador. Knowing that, \n     Congress stamped Negroponte's passport after some token \n     questions about Honduras.\n       Since then, however, much more has become public, largely \n     because of an excellent, but insufficiently recognized, \n     series of articles published by the Baltimore Sun in 1995. \n     Through interviews with former Honduran soldiers and some of \n     the people they kidnapped and tortured, the articles laid out \n     in gruesome detail the activities of a CIA-funded death squad \n     run by the Honduran military during the Contra war.\n       Those articles also made a credible case that Negroponte \n     knew about the Honduran death squad, officially known as \n     Battalion 316, and other covert operations taking place under \n     his nose, and he ignored them. Worse, he may have lied to \n     Congress about what he knew.\n       The Sun documents the fact that embassy staffers knew about \n     human rights violations and duly reported them to their \n     superiors in the embassy (including Negroponte) and \n     Washington. Yet their annual human-rights reports to Congress \n     did not reflect what they knew was going on all around them. \n     In just one of the less egregious cases (no one was killed), \n     the 1982 year-end report to Congress asserted there had been \n     ``no incident of official interference with the media'' that \n     year. Yet in June 1982, Negroponte had personally intervened \n     with the Hondurans to free a prominent journalist, Oscar \n     Reyes, who had been arrested and tortured by Battalion 316 \n     for a week. The ambassador did so at the behest of his \n     embassy's press spokesman, who\n\n[[Page S9463]]\n\n     warned Negroponte: ``We cannot let this guy get hurt. . . . \n     It would be a disaster for our policy.''\n       The Sun series should be reread by every member of the \n     Senate before Negroponte comes before them for confirmation \n     later this spring. Better yet, the Foreign Affairs Committee \n     should move beyond what one gutsy newspaper did and \n     thoroughly review any and all still-classified documents that \n     might shed light on just what Negroponte knew about Battalion \n     316 and the wider Contra war, and when he knew it.\n       Negroponte is, after all, the guy Bush wants in New York to \n     lecture the Chinese and Cubans about human rights. We ought \n     to be sure they won't have reason to laugh in his face when \n     he does.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Apr. 19, 2001]\n\n           What Did Negroponte Hide and When Did He Hide It?\n\n                        (By Joseph E. Mulligan)\n\n       Managua, Nicaragua.--As the Senate considers the nomination \n     of John D. Negroponte to be the U.S. ambassador to the United \n     Nations, it is important to look at charges that, as \n     ambassador to Honduras, Negroponte suppressed information \n     about the Honduran military's human rights violations. This \n     is a serious matter. What is the evidence?\n       According to a 1997 CIA inspector general's report, U.S. \n     officials in Honduras were aware of serious violations of \n     human rights by the Honduran military during the 1980s but \n     did not adequately report this to Congress. A heavily \n     redacted version of the report notes particularly that the \n     U.S. Embassy suppressed sensitive data during Negroponte's \n     time there.\n       I am especially concerned about the disappearance of two \n     U.S. citizens--Father James ``Guadalupe'' Carney and David \n     Arturo Baez Cruz--during Negroponte's tenure. Carney had come \n     to Honduras in 1983 as a chaplain to a revolutionary group, \n     which include Baez Cruz, a Nicaraguan American who had served \n     in the U.S. special forces. The group was captured by the \n     Honduran army, and Carney ``disappeared'' along with nearly \n     all of the 96 members of the group.\n       U.S. officials eventually gave Carney's chalice and stole, \n     turned up by the Honduran army, to his relatives. But the \n     army never explained the circumstances of the priest's death, \n     suggesting only that he probably starved in the mountains. \n     Five years later, in 1988, the New York Times reported that a \n     former officer of the Honduran army sad he personally had \n     interrogated Carney. Carney's body has not been found, and \n     the people responsible for his death have not been \n     identified. Whether any U.S. agents or officials were \n     involved in his disappearance remains an open question.\n       In a section with repeated references to the capture and \n     execution of Jose Maria Reyes Mata, the political leader of \n     the group, the CIA inspector general's report cited a source \n     whose name has been blacked out who ``believes that the \n     embassy country team in Honduras wanted reports on subjects \n     such as this to be benign to avoid Congress looking over its \n     shoulders.''\n       Reporting murders, executions and corruption, says the \n     source, would ``reflect negatively on Honduras and not be \n     beneficial in carrying out U.S. policy.'' The embassy seemed \n     particularly sensitive to reports about the operation in \n     which the two U.S. citizens disappeared, the report said, \n     quoting another source as recalling ``a discussion . . . \n     circa 1983 wherein the latter indicated that unspecified \n     individuals at the embassy did not want information \n     concerning human rights abuses . . . to be disseminated \n     because it was viewed as an internal Honduran matter,'' This \n     is corroborated by an Aug. 19, 1985, handwritten memo \n     declassified by the State Department ``Fr. Carney case . . . \n     is dead. Front office does not want the case active. . . . We \n     aren't telling that to the family.''\n       The CIA report cites another person whose name has been \n     deleted as explaining ``the basis for no further reporting on \n     the prisoner executions--the event had been reported \n     previously and there was concern on the part of Negroponte \n     that over-emphasis would create an unwarranted human rights \n     problem for Honduras.'' Among his conclusions, the CIA \n     inspector general states: ``The ambassador was particularly \n     sensitive regarding the issue and was concerned that earlier \n     CIA reporting on the same topic might create a human rights \n     problem for Honduras. Based on the ambassador's reported \n     concerns, [blacked out] actively discouraged [blacked out] \n     from following up the information reported by the [blacked \n     out] source.''\n       It was up to members of Congress to determine whether \n     Honduras had a human rights problem. But Negroponte denied \n     the facts needed for their judgment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  [From the Institute for Public Affairs in These Times, Apr. 2, 2001]\n\n In From the Cold War; Bush's Pick for U.N. Ambassador Has Some Spooky \n                          Stuff on His Resume\n\n                          (By Terry J. Allen)\n\n       Like spooks from an abandoned B-Movie graveyard, officials \n     of the Reagan-Bush era are merging from the dirt and showing \n     up inside the George W. Bush administration. The latest \n     resurrection is John Negroponte, whom Bush recently nominated \n     as ambassador to the United Nations.\n       As U.S. ambassador to Honduras from 1981 to 1985, \n     Negroponte abetted and covered up human rights crimes. He was \n     a zealous anti-Communist crusader in America's covert wars \n     against the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua and \n     the FMLN rebels in El Salvador. The high-level planning, \n     money and arms for those wars flowed from Washington, but \n     much of the on-the-ground logistics for the deployment of \n     intelligence, arms and soldiers was run out of Honduras. U.S. \n     military aid to Honduras jumped from $3.9 million in 1989 to \n     $77.4 million by 1984. So crammed was the tiny country with \n     U.S. bases and weapons that it was dubbed the USS Honduras, \n     as if it were simply an off-shore staging ground.\n       The captain of this ship, Negroponte was in charge of the \n     U.S. Embassy when, according to a 1995 four-part series in \n     the Baltimore Sun, hundreds of Hondurans were kidnapped, \n     tortured and killed by Battalion 316, a secret army \n     intelligence unit trained and supported by the Central \n     Intelligence Agency. As Gary Cohn and Ginger Thompson wrote \n     in the series, Battalion 316 used ``shock and suffocation \n     devices in interrogations. Prisoners often were kept naked \n     and, when no longer useful, killed and buried in unmarked \n     graves.'' Members of Battalion 316 were trained in \n     surveillance and interrogation at a secret location in the \n     United States and by the CIA at bases in Honduras. Gen. \n     Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, the chief of the Honduran armed \n     forces who personally directed Battalion 316, also trained in \n     the United States at the School of the Americas.\n       Negroponte tried to distance himself from the pattern of \n     abuses, even after a flood of declassified documents exposed \n     the extent of U.S. involvement with Battalion 316. In a \n     segment of the 1998 CNN mini-series Cold War, Negroponte said \n     that ``some of the retrospective effort to try and suggest \n     that we were supportive of, or condoned the actions of, human \n     rights violators is really revisionistic.''\n       By the time Negroponte was appointed ambassador by \n     President Reagan in 1981, human rights activists in Honduras \n     were vocally denouncing abuses. Former Honduran congressman \n     Efrain Diaz Arrivillage pleaded with Negroponte and other \n     U.S. officials to stop the abuses committed by the U.S.-\n     controlled military. ``Their attitude was one of tolerance \n     and silence,'' Diaz told the Sun. ``They needed Honduras to \n     loan its territory more than they were concerned about \n     innocent people being killed.''\n       Negroponte ignored such protests, and annually filed State \n     Department reports from Honduras that gave the impression \n     that the Honduran military respected human rights. But in an \n     interview with In These Times, Negroponte's predecessor as \n     ambassador, Carter appointee Jack Binns, tells a different \n     story: ``Negroponte would have had to be deliberately blind \n     not to know about human rights violations. . . . One of the \n     things a departing ambassador does is prepare a briefing \n     book, and one of those issues we included [in our briefing \n     book] was how to deal with the escalation of human rights \n     issues.''\n       Binns considered the U.S. support for Alvarez and Battalion \n     316 ``counterproductive'' to the declared objective of \n     ``establishing a rule of law.'' This lack of enthusiasm, \n     Binns says, led to ``my being cut out of the loop'' by the \n     Reagan administration, which he served for several months \n     before Negroponte took over. In the summer of 1981, Binns \n     recalls, ``I was called unexpectedly to Washington by Tom \n     Enders, the assistant secretary of state. He asked me to \n     stop reporting human rights violations through official \n     State Department channels and to use back channels because \n     they were afraid of leaks.''\n       As Binns explains, back-channel messages ``don't officially \n     exist. The message is translated over CIA channels, decrypted \n     and hand-carried from Langley, one copy only. No record.''\n       Binns did not agree to use back channels and when he \n     returned to Honduras, he received no further reports of human \n     rights violations from the CIA. ``I was deliberately lied \n     to,'' says Binns, who later found out that Reagan \n     administration had been working behind his back.\n       Honduras was only one of many hot spots where Negroponte \n     served. He spent four years as a political officer in the \n     U.S. Embassy in Saigon during the height of the Vietnam War. \n     As an aide to then National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger \n     at the Paris Peace Talks, he fell out of favor with his boss, \n     wrote Mark Matthews in a 1997 article in the Sun, ``by \n     arguing that the chief U.S. negotiator was making too many \n     concessions to the North Vietnamese.'' Negroponte also served \n     in the Philippines, Panama and Mexico, where he was a strong \n     booster for NAFTA.\n       Rumored to have been Colin Powell's pick for the job of \n     U.N. ambassador, Negroponte has a reputation as a loyal \n     bureaucrat and efficient fixer. He also has a Cold War \n     mentality characteristic of many of the old Reagan-Bush \n     people surrounding the new president.\n       The lessons Negroponte has learned from the past may shed \n     light on what kind of U.N. ambassador he will be if his \n     nomination is approved by the Senate. When he appeared in \n     1981 before a Senate committee for confirmation as envoy to \n     Honduras, he said, ``I believe we must do our best not to \n     allow the tragic outcome of Indochina to be repeated in \n     Central America.''\n       The tragedy to which he referred, of course, was the defeat \n     of the United States, not the devastation and death caused by \n     U.S. intervention.\n\n[[Page S9464]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\nDisappearances in Honduras During Amb.
