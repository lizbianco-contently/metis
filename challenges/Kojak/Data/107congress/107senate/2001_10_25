We hear the frozen echoes of their lofty debates. \nWe see them arising to confront the issues of their day. We note them \nchasing not the ``bubble popularity'' but seeking the shield of God's \nfavor.\n  During their tenure, many a Senator answered the rollcall of glory. \nWhat an example they set! They were faithful in fearful times, \ncommanding in common times, staunch in shaken times, persevering in \nperilous times, true in trying times.\n  We remember their statesmanship and stewardship with ongoing \nindebtedness. How we need a measure of their stoutness of spirit. How \nwe need the inspiration of their steadying hand on the tiller as we \nawaken to war's alarms and deadly pestilence.\n  Soon we ourselves will become the ones who have gone before. May the \ngenerations to come stand upon our shoulders. May our careers be of \nsuch significance that those who succeed us throughout this century see \neven further into the future.\n  By our governance, may that future exalt God's blessings for all \nAmericans; by our goodness, may that future extol God's design for this \nland of freedom; by our greatness, may that future enlarge God's plan \nfor the safety and security of His world.

Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears no objection. That will be the order of the Senate.\n  The Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, is recognized.\n  (Mrs. CLINTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President. I agree with the distinguished \nDemocratic leader in his request because we do want to have discussion \nof this piece of legislation, but there is no question we will vote on \nthis piece of legislation today and we will pass this legislation \ntoday.\n  I think it is only fitting the Senator from New York is now in the \nchair as we begin discussion of this legislation because her State was \none of those that was badly impacted, terribly impacted, tragically \nimpacted on September 11, as were the people of New Jersey and \nConnecticut, who worked in the World Trade Towers, and, of course, \nthose at the Pentagon in Virginia, including those in Maryland and the \nDistrict of Columbia, and actually the whole Nation.\n  Today we consider H.R. 3162, the second House-passed version of the \n``Uniting and Strengthening of America Act'' or ``USA Act of 2001.'' \nSenate passage of this measure without amendment will amount to final \npassage of this important legislation, and the bill will be sent to the \nPresident for his signature. We complete our work six weeks after the \nSeptember 11 attacks and months ahead of final action following the \ndestruction of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995. The \nAmerican people and the Members of this body deserve fast work and \nfinal action.\n  On October 4, I was pleased to introduce with the Majority Leader, \nSenator Daschle, and the Chairmen of the Banking and Intelligence \nCommittees, as well as the Republican Leader, Senator Lott, and Senator \nHatch and Senator Shelby, the Uniting and Strengthening America, or USA \nAct. This was not the bill that I, or any of the sponsors, would have \nwritten if compromise was unnecessary. Nor was it the bill the \nAdministration had initially proposed and the Attorney General \ndelivered to us on September 19, at a meeting in the Capitol.\n  We were able to refine and supplement the Administration's original \nproposal in a number of ways in the original USA Act, and have \ncontinued that process in the development of H.R. 3162. The \nAdministration accepted a number of the practical steps I had \noriginally proposed on September 19 to improve our security on the \nNorthern Border, assist our Federal, State and local law enforcement \nofficers, and provide compensation to the victims of terrorist acts and \nto the public safety officers who gave their lives to protect ours. \nThis final version of the USA Act further improves the compromise by \nincluding additional important checks on the proposed expansion of \ngovernment powers that were not contained in the Attorney General's \ninitial proposal.\n  Let me outline just ten ways in which we in the bicameral, bipartisan \nnegotiations were able to supplement and improve this legislation from \nthe original proposal we received from the Administration.\n  We improved security on the Northern Border;\n  We added money laundering;\n  We added programs to enhance information sharing and coordination \nwith State and local law enforcement, grants to State and local \ngovernments to respond to bioterrorism, and to increase payments to \nfamilies of fallen firefighters, police officers and other public \nsafety workers;\n  We added humanitarian relief to immigrant victims of the September 11 \nterrorist attacks;\n  We added help to the FBI to hire translators;\n  We added more comprehensive victims assistance;\n  We added measures to fight cybercrime;\n  We added measures to fight terrorism against mass transportation \nsystems;\n  We added important measures to use technology to make our borders \nmore secure;\n  Finally, and most importantly, we were able to include additional \nimportant checks on the proposed expansion of government powers \ncontained in the Attorney General's initial proposal.\n  In negotiations with the Administration, I did my best to strike a \nreasonable balance between the need to address the threat of terrorism, \nwhich we all keenly feel at the present time, and the need to protect \nour constitutional freedoms. Despite my misgivings, I acquiesced in \nsome of the Administration's proposals to move the legislative process \nforward. That progress has been rewarded by a bill we have been able to \nimprove further during discussions over the last two weeks.\n  The Senate passed the original version of the USA Act, S. 1510, by a \nvote of 96-1 on October 11. The House passed a similar bill, based \nlargely on the USA Act, the following day. The Majority Leader and I \nboth strongly believed that a conference would have been the better and \nfaster way to reconcile the differences between the bills, and to \nconsider the proposals that had been included in the managers' \namendment to S. 1510, which Republicans did not approve in time for \nconsideration and passage with the Senate bill. The House did not \nrequest a conference when it passed the bill, however, and despite the \nunderstanding among House and Senate leadership, the House leadership \nabruptly incorporated the product of our discussions in a new bill \nrather than proceed to a quick conference.\n  Yesterday, the House passed H.R. 3162, which was based upon informal \nagreements reached by Senate and House negotiators, but which did not \ninclude additional important provisions to make the Justice Department \nmore efficient and effective in its anti-terrorism efforts and to \nreduce domestic demand for illegal drugs, some of which are produced \nand supplied from Taliban-controlled regions of Afghanistan. I am \ndisappointed that the commitment we received to hold a conference--at \nwhich these proposals could have been considered more fully--was not \nhonored. Nonetheless, H.R. 3162, which the House passed yesterday, \ncontains additional improvements to the USA Act that had been \nnegotiated on a bicameral, bipartisan basis, and deserves the support \nof the Senate.\n  I do believe that some of the provisions contained both in this bill \nand the original USA Act will face difficult tests in the courts, and \nthat we in Congress may have to revisit these issues at some time in \nthe future when the present crisis has passed, the sunset has expired \nor the courts find an infirmity in these provisions. I also intend\n\n[[Page S10991]]\n\nas Chairman of the Judiciary Committee to exercise careful oversight of \nhow the Department of Justice, the FBI and other executive branch \nagencies are using the newly-expanded powers that this bill will give \nthem. I know that other members of the Judiciary Committee--including \nSenator Specter, Senator Grassley, and Senator Durbin--appreciate the \nimportance of such oversight.\n  The negotiations on anti-terrorism legislation have not been easy. \nWithin days of the September 11 attacks, I began work on legislation to \naddress security needs on the Northern Border, the needs of victims and \nState and local law enforcement, and criminal law improvements. A week \nafter the attack, on September 19, the Attorney General and I exchanged \nthe outlines of the legislative proposals and pledged to work together \ntoward our shared goal of putting tools in the hands of law enforcement \nthat would help prevent another terrorist attack.\n  Let me be clear: No one can guarantee that Americans will be free \nfrom the threat of future terrorist attacks, and to suggest that this \nlegislation--or any legislation--would or could provide such a \nguarantee would be a false promise. I will not engage in such false \npromises, and those who make such assertions do a disservice to the \nAmerican people.\n\n  I have also heard claims that if certain powers had been previously \nauthorized by the Congress, we could somehow have prevented the \nSeptember 11 attacks. Given this rhetoric it may be instructive to \nreview efforts that were made a few years ago in the Senate to provide \nlaw enforcement with greater tools to conduct surveillance of \nterrorists and terrorist organizations. In May 1995, Senator Lieberman \noffered an amendment to the bill that became the Antiterrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 that would have expanded the \ngovernment's authority to conduct emergency wiretaps to cases of \ndomestic or international terrorism and added a definition of domestic \nterrorism to include violent or illegal acts apparently intended to \n``intimidate, or coerce the civilian population.'' The consensus, \nbipartisan bill that we consider today contains a very similar \ndefinition of domestic terrorism.\n  In 1995, however, a motion to table Senator Lieberman's amendment was \nagreed to in a largely party-line vote, with Republicans voting against \nthe measure. In fact, then Senator Ashcroft voted to table that \namendment, and one Republican colleague spoke against it and opined, \n``I do not think we should expand the wiretap laws any further.'' He \nfurther said that ``We must ensure that in our response to recent \nterrorist acts, we do not destroy the freedoms that we cherish.'' I \nhave worked very hard to maintain that balance in negotiations \nconcerning the current legislation.\n  Following the exchange on September 19 of our legislative proposals, \nwe have worked over the last month around the clock with the \nAdministration to put together the best legislative package we could. I \nshare the Administration's goal of providing promptly the legal tools \nnecessary to deal with the current terrorist threat. While some have \ncomplained publicly that the negotiations have gone on for too long, \nthe issues involved are of great importance, and we will have to live \nwith the laws we enact for a long time to come. Demands for action are \nirresponsible when the roadmap is pointed in the wrong direction. As \nBen Franklin once noted, ``if we surrender our liberty in the name of \nsecurity, we shall have neither.''\n  Moreover, our ability to make rapid progress was impeded because the \nnegotiations with the Administration did not progress in a straight \nline. On several key issues that are of particular concern to me, we \nhad reached an agreement with the Administration on Sunday, September \n30. Unfortunately, over the next two days, the Administration announced \nthat it was reneging on the deal. I appreciate the complex task of \nconsidering the concerns and missions of multiple Federal agencies, and \nthat sometimes agreements must be modified as their implications are \nscrutinized by affected agencies. When agreements made by the \nAdministration must be withdrawn and negotiations on resolved issues \nreopened, those in the Administration who blame the Congress for delay \nwith what the New York Times described as ``scurrilous remarks,'' do \nnot help the process move forward.\n  We expedited the legislative process in the Judiciary Committee to \nconsider the Administration's proposals. In daily news conferences \nprior to the original passage of the USA Act, the Attorney General \nreferred to the need for such prompt consideration. He made time to \nappear before the Judiciary Committee at a hearing September 25 to \nrespond to questions that Members from both parties had about the \nAdministration's initial legislative proposals. I thank the Attorney \nGeneral for extending the hour and a half he was able to make in his \nschedule for the hearing for another 15 minutes so that Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Specter were able to ask questions before his \ndeparture. I regret that the Attorney General did not have the time to \nrespond to questions from all the Members of the Committee either on \nSeptember 25 or at any time since. He promised to answer the written \nquestions Members submitted about the legislation promptly, but we did \nnot receive any answers before passage of S. 1510, H.R. 2975, or H.R. \n3162. I will make those answers a part of the hearing record whenever \nthey are received even after final passage of the legislation.\n  The Chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, Senator Feingold, also \nheld an important hearing on October 3 on the civil liberties \nramifications of the expanded surveillance powers requested by the \nAdministration. I thank him for his assistance in illuminating these \ncritical issues for the Senate.\n  To accede to the Administration's request for prompt consideration of \nthe USA Act, the Leaders decided to hold the bill at the desk rather \nthan refer it to the Committee for markup, as is regular practice. \nSenator Hatch specifically urged that this occur. Indeed, when the \nSenate considered the anti-terrorism act in 1995 after the Oklahoma \nCity bombing, we bypassed the Committee in order to deal with the \nlegislation more promptly on the floor.\n  After Senate consideration and passage on the one-month anniversary \nof the terrorist attack, the House Republican leadership decided to \nproceed with a version of the Senate-passed bill rather than the bill \nreported by the House Judiciary Committee. H.R. 2975 passed the House \nwith opposition on October 12. Unfortunately, the House did not take \nthe traditional step of requesting a conference to reconcile the bills. \nIn an apparent effort by the Administration and House Republican \nleadership to try to pressure the Senate to accept that version of the \nbill, without strong money laundering or biological weapons provisions \nand with a 5-year sunset, the House failed to take the procedural steps \nnecessary to convene a conference. Had a conference been requested and \nbegun, a final bill would have been passed last week. Instead, without \na structure or process, discussions were less concentrated and it was \nonly after a leadership meeting late last week that the major outline \nof the measure was agreed upon.\n  During the negotiations over the past two weeks, the Administration \nsought to eliminate the sunset altogether, but that effort failed. The \nHouse insisted that the amendments to the so-called ``McDade law'' be \ndropped, and the Administration acquiesced. Eventually, the House \naccepted the Senate's position on the need to include both money \nlaundering and biological weapons provisions. Even then, the House \nRepublican leadership reneged on the agreement to proceed by way of a \ntraditional House-Senate conference. Instead, they opted to proceed by \na new bill passed by the House in short order and sent to the Senate as \nan amendable measure. That brings us to today.\n  Given the expedited process that has been used to move this \nlegislation through the House and now to the Senate, I will take more \ntime than usual to detail its provisions.\n  This bill has raised serious and legitimate concerns about the \nexpansion of authorities for government surveillance and intelligence \ngathering within this country. Indeed, this bill will change \nsurveillance and intelligence procedures for all types of criminal and \nforeign intelligence investigations, not just for terrorism cases. \nSignificantly, the sunset provision included in the final bill calls \nfor vigilant legislative oversight, so that the Congress will know how \nthese legal authorities are\n\n[[Page S10992]]\n\nused and whether they are abused over the next four years.\n\n  We should be clear at the outset that while the sunset applies to the \nexpanded surveillance authorities under FISA, it does not apply to \nother controversial provisions in the bill. As originally passed by the \nHouse, the sunset did not apply to the provisions on sharing grand jury \ninformation with intelligence agencies, in section 203(a), and the so-\ncalled ``sneak and peak'' authority for surreptitious search and \nseizure, in section 213. The final bill, H.R. 3162, removes two more \nprovisions from the sunset--the expanded scope of subpoenas for records \nof electronic communications, in section 210, and the new authority for \npen registers and trap and trace devices in criminal investigations, in \nsection 216.\n  Congressional oversight is especially necessary to monitor the \nimplementation of these new authorities. I agree with Leader Armey that \nthe sunset will help ensure that law enforcement is responsive to \ncongressional oversight and inquiries on use of these new authorities \nand that a full record is developed on their efficacy and necessity. \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee has the challenging duty to establish \nand maintain an oversight regime that allows the Congress to know how \nthese powers are exercised.\n  This bill will authorize the expanded sharing with intelligence \nagencies of information collected as part of a criminal investigation, \nand the expanded use of foreign intelligence surveillance tools and \ninformation in criminal investigations. Where foreign-sponsored \nterrorism is the target of an investigation, criminal and foreign \nintelligence jurisdictions clearly overlap and agencies must coordinate \ntheir efforts accordingly. This bill enters new and uncharted territory \nby breaking down traditional barriers between law enforcement and \nforeign intelligence. This is not done just to combat international \nterrorism, but for any criminal investigation that overlaps a broad \ndefinition of ``foreign intelligence.''\n  Yet, before final passage of this bill, the Senate should recall our \nnation's unfortunate experience with domestic surveillance and \nintelligence abuses that came to light in the mid-1970s. Until \nWatergate and the Vietnam war, Congress allowed the Executive branch \nvirtually a free hand in using the FBI, the CIA, and other intelligence \nagencies to conduct domestic surveillance in the name of national \nsecurity. It was the Cold War, Members of Congress were reluctant to \ntake on FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, and oversight was non-existent. \nOne of the few safeguards enacted into law drew a sharp line between \nforeign intelligence and law enforcement. The National Security Act of \n1947, which established the Central Intelligence Agency, said--and \nstill says today--that the CIA ``shall have no police, subpoena, or law \nenforcement powers or internal security functions.''\n  The provisions on the disclosure of ``foreign intelligence'' from \nFederal criminal investigations make fundamental changes in the rules \nfor the handling of highly sensitive personal, political and business \ninformation acquired for law enforcement purposes. Such information may \nnow be disclosed to intelligence, defense, and national security \nagencies. The law is changed not only to permit the wider sharing of \ninformation from grand juries, domestic law enforcement wiretaps, and \ncriminal investigations generally (in section 203), but also to require \nFederal law enforcement agencies to share this information with \nintelligence agencies through the Director of Central Intelligence, \nunless the Attorney General makes exceptions (in section 905).\n  There would be far less controversy if these provisions were limited \nto information about domestic or international terrorism or espionage. \nInstead, they potentially authorize the disclosure throughout \nintelligence, military, and national security organizations of a far \nbroader range information about United States persons, including \ncitizens, permanent resident aliens, domestic political groups, and \ncompanies incorporated in the United States. The information may be \nshared if it fits the broad definitions of ``foreign intelligence'' and \n``foreign intelligence information.''\n  The term ``foreign intelligence'' is defined to mean ``information \nrelating to the capabilities, intentions, or activities of foreign \ngovernments or elements thereof, foreign organizations, or foreign \npersons, or international terrorist activities.'' The term ``foreign \nintelligence information'' is defined to include information about a \nUnited States person that concerns a foreign power or foreign territory \nand ``that relates to the national defense or the security of the \nUnited States'' or ``the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United \nStates.'' Therefore, potentially, whenever a criminal investigation \nacquires information about an American citizen's relationship with a \nforeign country or its government, that information is eligible to be \ndisseminated widely as ``foreign intelligence information''--even if \nthe information is about entirely lawful activities, business \ntransactions, political relationships, or personal opinions.\n  Criminal investigations acquire voluminous information about persons \nwho are not involved in illegal activity. Many individuals are \ninvestigated and later cleared. Many cases are investigated and never \nprosecuted. Many witnesses are interviewed whose testimony never \nsurfaces at trial. Immunity is granted to compel testimony before grand \njuries about people who are never indicted. Wiretaps and microphone \n``bugs'' and computer communications intercepts pick up extensive \ninformation about activities and opinions and personal lives that have \nno relevance to the criminal activity that they are authorized to \ndetect or monitor. Where regulatory or tax laws carry criminal \npenalties, investigators probe the confidential financial details of \nbusiness transactions and records. Federal criminal investigators have \nenormous discretion, with little statutory or constitutional guidance \nfor how they interview people, conduct physical surveillance, recruit \ninformants in organizations, and request access to records they \nconsider ``relevant'' to an investigation. All that information would \nbe eligible to be disseminated widely within the government, beyond the \npurposes of the criminal investigation, if it meets the definition of \n``foreign intelligence'' or ``foreign intelligence information.''\n  The risks of misusing this information were documented 25 years ago, \nwhen the Congress made public the record of Cold War abuses of \ninvestigative powers by Federal agencies acting in the name of national \nsecurity. The Senate created a Select Committee To Study Governmental \nAffairs With Respect to Intelligence Communities, chaired by Senator \nFrank Church, to conduct a year-long investigation with extensive \npublic hearings and detailed reports on the investigations of lawful \npolitical dissent and protest. The Church Committee found that the \nFBI's internal security and domestic intelligence programs compiled \nmassive files on activities protected by the First Amendment and the \npolitical opinions of Americans.\n  During the height of antiwar protest and urban unrest in the late \n1960's, Army intelligence joined the FBI in monitoring domestic \npolitical activity. National intelligence agencies such as CIA and NSA \nreceived extensive reporting from the FBI and the military, as well as \nfrom their own intelligence gathering on critics of government policy. \nOther law enforcement agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service \nwere used to selectively investigate organizations based on their \npolitical views. Under President's of both parties, these agencies \ndisseminated information to the White House about the lawful political \nactivities and opinions of critics of Administration policy--all under \nthe rubric of protecting the national security. The scope of \nintelligence gathering swept up environmental groups, women's \nliberation activists, and virtually any organization that mounted \npeaceful protest demonstrations.\n  During this unfortunate period in our history, the government did \nmore than just gather information about protest and dissent. The FBI \ndeveloped a systematic program to disrupt domestic groups and discredit \ntheir leaders, known as ``COINTELPRO.'' The FBI's efforts included the \nselective sharing of information from its investigations to deny people \nemployment and smear their reputations. Beginning with Communist and \nsocialist groups, the FBI's COINTELPRO operations spread in the 1960s \nto the Klan, the ``new left,'' and black militants. Elements of the \ncivil\n\n[[Page S10993]]\n\nrights and antiwar movements were targeted for disruption because of \nsuspicion that they were ``influenced'' by communists; others because \nof their strident rhetoric. When some targets were suspected of \nengaging in violence, the FBI's tactics went so far as to place lives \nin jeopardy by passing false allegations that individuals were \ngovernment informants.\n  The most notorious case was J. Edgar Hoover's vendetta against Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. The Church Committee documented the FBI's \neffort to discredit Dr. King by disclosing confidential information \nthat was obtained from wiretaps and microphones targeted against him. \nThe wiretaps were justified to the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations \non the grounds that some of Dr. King's advisors were Communists, but \nthis excuse allowed the FBI to mount continuous political surveillance \nto undermine Dr. King's effectiveness. The FBI disseminated allegedly \nderogatory information not only within the government, but to media and \nother private organizations including efforts to deny Dr. King the \nNobel Peace Prize. Most vicious of all was the FBI's preparation of a \ncomposite tape recording that was sent to him anonymously with an \napparent invitation to commit suicide. During the 1964 Democratic \nNational Convention in Atlantic City where the greatest controversy \ninvolved seating the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegates, \nthe FBI provided the Johnson White House a continuous flow of political \nintelligence from the wiretaps on Dr. King's telephones in Atlantic \nCity.\n  These methods of domestic political surveillance and covert \nmanipulation and disruption have no place in a free society. They are \nlawful for the CIA to use against terrorists abroad, under Presidential \nauthorization and oversight by the Intelligence Committees. In the \nUnited States, however, such surveillance activities by our government \noffends our fundamental First Amendment rights of speech and \nassociation, and undermines our democratic values. Since the Church \nCommittee investigation, one of the main reasons for maintaining \nbarriers between domestic criminal investigations and foreign \nintelligence operations has been a concern that the no-hold-barred \nmethods used abroad must not be brought back into this country.\n  The Church Committee recommended a series of safeguards to restrict \nthe collection of information about Americans by the CIA, the National \nSecurity Agency, and other U.S. intelligence agencies. The Attorney \nGeneral issued guidelines for FBI investigations and Presidents issued \nExecutive Orders requiring procedures approved by the Attorney General \nfor the collection and retention of information about Americans by U.S. \nintelligence agencies. These guidelines and procedures have served for \nthe past 25 years as a stable framework that, with rare exceptions, has \nnot allowed previous abuses to recur.\n  The most significant legislative result of the Church Committee \ninvestigation was the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 \nwhich required court orders for national security electronic \nsurveillance in the United States. No longer did the Executive branch \nhave exclusive control over the vast powers of U.S. intelligence to \nconduct wiretapping, bugging, and other communications monitoring in \nthis country. Surveillance was limited to foreign powers and agents of \nforeign powers, and the statutory probable cause standard for targeting \nan American as an ``agent of a foreign power'' required a showing of \nclandestine intelligence activities, sabotage, or international \nterrorist activities on behalf of a foreign power. Americans could not \nbe targeted solely on the basis of activities protected by the First \nAmendment. Surveillance of Americans under FISA was limited to \ncounterintelligence purposes to defend the nation against foreign \nspying and terrorism. Americans could not be considered ``agents of a \nforeign power'' on the basis of their lawful business or political \nrelationships with foreign governments or organizations.\n  The Congress has been cautious in the decades following the \nrevelations of the Church Committee about allowing use of criminal \njustice information for other purposes and, specifically, on sharing \nsuch information with intelligence agencies. In 1979 Attorney General \nBenjamin Civiletti testified before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on \nConstitutional Rights that the guidelines for ``any dissemination \noutside the Bureau . . . will have to be very, very specific. We will \nhave to be very certain the dissemination is lawful, meets the same \nstandards of certainty, of intent, which is the basic reason for the \ncollection of the information and the investigation. . . .'' On the \nissue of FBI sharing with the CIA, Attorney General Civiletti said \n``you have to be extremely careful in working out, pursuant to the law, \nthe information which is being exchanged, what its purpose is, how it \nwas obtained and collected, so that you are not inadvertently, out of a \nsense of cooperation or efficiency, perverting or corrupting the fact \nthat the CIA's main duty is foreign intelligence, and they have no \ncharter, no responsibility, and not duty performance, no mission to \ninvestigate criminal acts in the United States.''\n  The bill we are passing today makes potentially sweeping changes in \nthe relationships between the law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies. In the current crisis, there is justification for expanding \nauthority specifically for counterintelligence to detect and prevent \ninternational terrorism. I support the FBI request for broader \nauthority under FISA for pen registers and access to records without \nhaving to meet the statutory ``agent of a foreign power'' standard, \nbecause the Fourth Amendment does not normally apply to such techniques \nand the FBI has comparable authority in its criminal investigations. \nHowever, I have insisted that this authority to investigate U.S. \npersons be limited to counterintelligence investigations conducted to \nprotect against international terrorism and spying activities and that \nsuch investigations may not be based solely on activities protected by \nthe First Amendment. None of the changes in FISA would authorize \ninvestigations of Americans for the broader, more ambiguous purpose of \ncollecting ``foreign intelligence'' generally. In that respect, the \nbill adheres to the basic principles recommended by the Church \nCommittee.\n\n  The gravest departure from that framework, and the one with most \npotential for abuses, is the new and unprecedented statutory authority \nfor sharing of ``foreign intelligence'' from criminal investigations \nwith ``any other Federal law enforcement, intelligence, protective, \nimmigration, national defense, or national security official.'' The \nChurch Committee warned of the political abuse of the dissemination of \nintelligence from domestic investigations. Intelligence was \ndisseminated to the White House to track the contacts of members of \nCongress with particular foreign embassies. Information was volunteered \nto the White House about Administration critics and other political \nfigures. The Church Committee found ``excessive dissemination of large \namounts of relatively useless or totally irrelevant information'' to \nthe White House that was not evaluated and ``thus exaggerated the \ndangers.''\n  The Church Committee recommended permitting FBI dissemination of \npersonally identifiable information about Americans to intelligence, \nmilitary and other national security agencies in two areas--\n``preventive criminal investigations of terrorist activities'' and \n``preventive intelligence investigations of hostile foreign \nintelligence activities.'' This has been substantially the practice \nunder the Attorney General's guidelines and Executive order procedures \nsince then.\n  The new authority to disseminate ``foreign intelligence'' from \ncriminal investigations, including grand juries and law enforcement \nwiretaps, is an invitation to abuse without special safeguards. \nFortunately, the final bill includes a provision, which was not in the \nAdministration's original proposal, to maintain some degree of judicial \noversight of the dissemination of grand jury information. Within a \n``reasonable time'' after the disclosure of grand jury information, a \ngovernment attorney ``shall file under seal a notice with the court \nstating the fact that such information was disclosed and the \ndepartments, agencies, or entities to which the disclosure was made.'' \nNo such judicial role is provided for the disclosure of information \nfrom wiretaps and\n\n[[Page S10994]]\n\nother criminal investigative techniques including the infiltration of \norganizations with informants. However, that authority to disclose \nwithout judicial review is subject to the sunset in four years.\n  Other safeguards can, if used properly, minimize the unnecessary \ndisclosure of ``foreign intelligence'' that identifies an American. \nWhen the information comes from grand juries or wiretaps, the Attorney \nGeneral is required under the bill to establish procedures for the \ndisclosure of information that identifies a United States person. The \nSenate Judiciary Committee will want to take a very close look at these \nprocedures. Although not required under the bill, such procedures would \nalso be desirable for disclosure of information from criminal \ninvestigations generally, as permitted under section 203(d). In section \n905, where the bill requires disclosure to intelligence agencies from \ncriminal investigations, the Attorney General is authorized to make \nexceptions and must issue implementing procedures. Again, these \nprocedures will be closely examined by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  These procedures will be critical in determining the scope and impact \nof these provisions. Will they focus the sharing of information on \ninternational terrorism, which is the immediate and compelling need \nbefore us, or will they sweep more broadly? Will they permit automatic \ndissemination to intelligence agencies of any information about foreign \ngovernments, foreign organizations, or foreign persons that is obtained \nin FBI investigations of international organized crime and white collar \ncrime? What are the specific circumstances under which confidential \ninformation collected by particular agencies, such as the Internal \nRevenue Service or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, will be \ndisseminated to the U.S. Military or other agencies? What will be the \nguidelines for including information that identifies United States \npersons? How will need-to-know decisions be made on the handling of \nthis information, and how will access be controlled? What will be done \nto ensure compliance with the 1947 ban on CIA having ``police, \nsubpoena, or law enforcement powers or internal security functions?''\n  These and many other questions must be the subject of the Judiciary \nCommittee's oversight of the implementation of the surveillance and \nintelligence provisions of this bill. Our government is entering \nuncharted territory. Much of the government's experience from the Cold \nWar era before the mid-1970s warns us of the risks of abuse. Reasonable \nmeasures that we are taking to protect against international terrorism \nmay have far-reaching ramifications beyond the immediate crisis. There \nhas never been a greater need for Congressional vigilance to ensure \nagainst unnecessary and improper use of the wide discretion being \ngranted by a new law. I intend to ask the Attorney General and the \nDirector of Central Intelligence to advise the Judiciary Committee of \ntheir implementation plans and practices every step of the way.\n  The final bill includes a long overdue remedy for unauthorized \ndisclosure of information obtained from electronic surveillance under \nFISA and under criminal procedures. If the government monitors the \nconversations of a person under the electronic surveillance procedures \nof title 18 or FISA and that information is disclosed without proper \nauthority, the aggrieved person may recover money damages from the \nFederal Government. Such improper disclosure is what happened in the \npast when the FBI passed information from the electronic surveillance \nof Dr. Martin Luther King to selected private individuals and \norganizations in an effort to discredit Dr. King. The government itself \nwould be liable, in addition to individual employees, if something like \nthis ever happens again.\n  This provision is especially valuable in this bill, because of the \nexpanded sharing of information from electronic surveillance in \ncriminal cases to agencies with intelligence, military, and other \nnational security responsibilities. When this kind of sensitive \ninformation is disseminated more widely, the risk increases that it \nwill be leaked.\n  As a deterrent against malicious leaks, this provision wisely \nincludes procedures for administrative discipline as well as the civil \nremedy against the Government. When a court or the appropriate agency \ndetermines that there is serious question about whether or not an \nemployee willfully disclosed information without proper authority, \ndisciplinary proceedings must be initiated. If the agency head decides \nthat discipline is not warranted, he or she must notify the Inspector \nGeneral with jurisdiction over the agency and provide the reasons for \nthe decision not to impose discipline.\n  Representative Barny Frank deserves credit for developing this \nproposal, and the Department of Justice has worked with Representative \nFrank to ensure that the procedures for civil discovery take into \naccount the needs for protecting related criminal investigations or \nprosecutions and classified operations under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act.\n\n  When Congress authorized electronic surveillance in 1968 under title \n18 and in 1978 under FISA, the legislation imposed civil and criminal \nsanctions for violations by individuals. This bill takes the law two \nsteps forward by adding government liability and administrative \ndiscipline against government employees. Along with the sunset \nprovision, judicial oversight of the sharing of grand jury information, \nand other improvements, the Frank amendment reflects the valuable \ncontribution of the House of Representatives towards making this a \nbalanced bill.\n  The heart of every American aches for those who died or have been \ninjured because of the tragic terrorist attacks in New York, Virginia, \nand Pennsylvania on September 11. Even now, we cannot assess the full \nmeasure of this attack in terms of human lives, but we know that the \nnumber of casualties is extraordinarily high.\n  Congress acted swiftly to help the victims of September 11. Within 10 \ndays, we passed legislation to establish a Victims Compensations \nProgram, which will provide fair compensation to those most affected by \nthis national tragedy. I am proud of our work on that legislation, \nwhich will expedite payments to thousands of Americans whose lives were \nso suddenly shattered.\n  But now more than ever, we should remember the tens of thousands of \nAmericans whose needs are not being met--the victims of crimes that \nhave not made the national headlines. Just one day before the events \nthat have so transformed our nation, I came before this body to express \nmy concern that we were not doing more for crime victims. I noted that \nthe pace of victims legislation had slowed, and that many opportunities \nfor progress had been squandered. I suggested that this year, we had a \ngolden opportunity to make significant progress in this area by passing \nS. 783, the Leahy-Kennedy Crime Victims Assistance Act of 2001.\n  I am pleased, therefore, that the antiterrorism package now before \nthe Senate contains substantial portions of S. 783 aimed at refining \nthe Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA), and improving the manner in \nwhich the Crime Victims Fund is managed and preserved. Most \nsignificantly, section 621 of the USA Act will eliminate the cap on \nVOCA spending, which has prevented more than $700 million in Fund \ndeposits from reaching victims and supporting essential services.\n  Congress has capped spending from the Fund for the last two fiscal \nyears, and President Bush has proposed a third cap for fiscal year \n2002. These limits on VOCA spending have created a growing sense of \nconfusion and unease by many of those concerned about the future of the \nFund.\n  We should not be imposing artificial caps on VOCA spending while \nsubstantial unmet needs continue to exist. Section 621 of the USA Act \nreplaces the cap with a self-regulating system that will ensure \nstability and protection of Fund assets, while allowing more money to \nbe distributed to the States for victim compensation and assistance.\n  Other provisions included from S. 783 will also make an immediate \ndifference in the lives of victims, including victims of terrorism. \nShortly after the Oklahoma City bombing, I proposed and the Congress \nadopted the Victims of Terrorism Act of 1995. This legislation \nauthorized the Office for Victims of Crime (OVC) to set aside an \nemergency reserve of up to $50 million as part of the Crime Victims \nFund. The emergency reserve was intended to serve as a ``rainy day'' \nfund to supplement compensation and assistance\n\n[[Page S10995]]\n\ngrants to States to provide emergency relief in the wake of an act of \nterrorism or mass violence that might otherwise overwhelm the resources \nof a State's crime victim compensation program and crime victim \nassistance services. Last month's disaster created vast needs that have \nall but depleted the reserve. Section 621 of the USA Act authorizes OVC \nto replenish the reserve with up to $50 million, and streamlines the \nmechanism for replenishment in future years.\n  Another critical provision of the USA Act will enable OVC to provide \nmore immediate and effective assistance to victims of terrorism and \nmass violence occurring within the United States. I proposed this \nmeasure last year as an amendment to the Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act, but was compelled to drop it to achieve bipartisan \nconsensus. I am pleased that we are finally getting it done this year.\n  These and other VOCA reforms in the USA Act are long overdue. Yet, I \nregret that we are not doing more. In my view, we should pass the Crime \nVictims Assistance Act in its entirety. In addition to the provisions \nthat are included in today's bill, this legislation provides for \ncomprehensive reform of Federal law to establish enhanced rights and \nprotections for victims of Federal crime. It also proposes several \nprograms to help States provide better assistance for victims of State \ncrimes.\n  I also regret that we have not done more for other victims of recent \nterrorist attacks. While all Americans are numbed by the heinous acts \nof September 11, we should not forget the victims of the 1998 embassy \nbombings in East Africa. Eleven Americans and many Kenyan and Tanzanian \nnationals employed by the United States lost their lives in that tragic \nincident. It is my understanding that compensation to the families of \nthese victims has in many instances fallen short. It is my hope that \nOVC will use a portion of the newly replenished reserve fund to remedy \nany inequity in the way that these individuals have been treated.\n  We cannot speak of the victims of the September 11 without also \nnoting that Arab-Americans and Muslims in this country have become the \ntargets of hate crimes, harassment, and intimidation. I applaud the \nPresident for speaking out against and condemning such acts, and for \nvisiting a mosque to demonstrate by action that all religions are \nembraced in this country. I also commend the FBI Director for his \nperiodic reports on the number of hate crime incidents against Arab-\nAmerican and Muslims that the FBI is aggressively investigating and \nmaking clear that this conduct is taken seriously and will be punished.\n  The USA Act contains, in section 102, a sense of the Congress that \ncrimes and discrimination against Arab and Muslim Americans are \ncondemned, and in section 1002, a provision suggested by Senator Durbin \nthat condemns violence and discrimination against Sikh Americans. Many \nof us would like to do more, and finally enact effective hate crimes \nlegislation, but the Administration has asked that the debate on that \nlegislation be postponed. One of my greatest regrets regarding the \nnegotiations in this bill was that objections prevented the Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act, S. 625, from being included in the USA \nAct.\n  The Administration's initial proposal was entirely focused on Federal \nlaw enforcement. Yet, we must remember that State and local law \nenforcement officers have critical roles to play in preventing and \ninvestigating terrorist acts. I am pleased that the bill we consider \ntoday recognizes this fact.\n\n  As a former State prosecutor, I know that State and local law \nenforcement officers are often the first responders to a crime. On \nSeptember 11, the nation saw that the first on the scene were the \nheroic firefighters, police officers and emergency personnel in New \nYork City. These New York public safety officers, many of whom gave the \nultimate sacrifice, remind us of how important it is to support our \nState and local law enforcement partners. The USA Act provides three \ncritical measures of Federal support for our State and local law \nenforcement officers in the war against terrorism.\n  We streamline and expedite the Public Safety Officers' Benefits \napplication process for family members of fire fighters, police \nofficers and rescue workers who perish or suffer a disabling injury in \nconnection with prevention, investigation, rescue or recovery efforts \nrelated to a future terrorist attack.\n  The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program provides benefits for \neach of the families of law enforcement officers, firefighters, and \nemergency response crew members who are killed or disabled in the line \nof duty. Current regulations, however, require the families of public \nsafety officers who have fallen in the line of duty to go through a \ncumbersome and time-consuming application process. In the face of our \nnational fight against terrorism, it is important that we provide a \nquick process to support the families of brave Americans who selflessly \ngive their lives so that others might live before, during, and after a \nterrorist attack.\n  This provision builds on the new law championed by Senator Clinton, \nSenator Schumer and Congressman Nadler to speed the benefit payment \nprocess for families of public safety officers killed in the line of \nduty in New York City, Virginia, and Western Pennsylvania, on September \n11.\n  We have raised the total amount of Public Safety Officers' Benefit \nProgram payments from approximately $150,000 to $250,000. This \nprovision retroactively goes into effect to provide much-needed relief \nfor the families of the brave men and women who sacrificed their own \nlives for their fellow Americans during the year. Although this \nincrease in benefits can never replace a family's tragic loss, it is \nthe right thing to do for the families of our fallen heroes. I want to \nthank Senator Biden and Senator Hatch for their bipartisan leadership \non this provision.\n  We expand the Department of Justice Regional Information Sharing \nSystems Program to promote information sharing among Federal, State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute terrorist \nconspiracies and activities and authorize a doubling of funding for \nthis year and next year. The RISS Secure Intranet is a nationwide law \nenforcement network that already allows secure communications among the \nmore than 5,700 Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies. \nEffective communication is key to effective law enforcement efforts and \nwill be essential in our national fight against terrorism.\n  The RISS program enables its member agencies to send secure, \nencrypted communications--whether within just one agency or from one \nagency to another. Federal agencies, such as the FBI, do not have this \ncapability, but recognize the need for it. Indeed, on September 11, \nimmediately after the terrorist attacks, FBI Headquarters called RISS \nofficials to request ``Smartgate'' cards and readers to secure their \ncommunications systems. The FBI agency in Philadelphia called soon \nafter to request more Smartgate cards and readers as well.\n  The Regional Information Sharing Systems Program is a proven success \nthat we need to expand to improve secure information sharing among \nFederal, State and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate their \ncounter-terrorism efforts.\n  During negotiations following initial passage of the Senate and House \nbills, we added two new provisions to support State and local \ngovernments in the final legislation. At Senator Biden's request, the \nFirst Responders Assistance Act, was added as section 1005 of H.R. \n3062. This provision authorizes a $25 million Department of Justice \nprogram to authorize grants to State and local authorities to respond \nto and prevent acts of terrorism.\n  I authored section 1014 of H.R. 3062 to authorize a Department of \nJustice grant program for State and local domestic preparedness \nsupport. These grants will help each State prepare for and respond to \nterrorist acts including but not limited to events of terrorism \ninvolving weapons of mass destruction and biological, nuclear, \nradiological, incendiary, chemical, and explosive devices. This \nprovision improves an appropriated program to provide: 1, additional \nflexibility to purchase needed equipment; 2, training and technical \nassistance to State and local first responders; and 3, a more equitable \nallocation of funds to all States.\n  Our State and local law enforcement partners welcome the challenge to \njoin in our national mission to combat terrorism. We cannot ask State \nand local\n\n[[Page S10996]]\n\nlaw enforcement officers to assume these new national responsibilities \nwithout also providing new Federal support. This bill provides five key \nprovisions for necessary Federal support for our State and local law \nenforcement officers to serve as full partners in our fight against \nterrorism.\n  I am deeply troubled by continuing reports that critical information \nis not being shared with State and local law enforcement. In \nparticular, the recent testimony of Baltimore Police Chief Ed Norris \nbefore the House Government Reform Committee highlighted the current \nproblem. I have also spoken to Mayor Giuliani and to Senator Schumer \nand Senator Clinton about the need for better coordination and \ninformation sharing between the FBI and State and local law enforcement \nauthorities who are being called upon to assist in the current \nterrorism investigations. This is no time for turf battles. The FBI \nmust recognize the contributions of other law enforcement authorities \nand facilitate their continued cooperation in this national effort.\n  The unfolding facts about how the terrorists who committed the \nSeptember 11 attack were able to enter this country without difficulty \nare chilling. Since the attacks many have pointed to our northern \nborder as vulnerable to the entry of future terrorists. This is not \nsurprising when a simple review of the numbers shows that the northern \nborder has been routinely short-changed in personnel. While the number \nof border patrol agents along the southern border has increased over \nthe last few years to over 8,000, the number at the northern border has \nremained the same as a decade ago at 300. This remains true despite the \nfact that Admad Ressam, the Algerian who planned to blow up the Los \nAngeles International Airport in 1999, and who has been linked to those \ninvolved in the September 11 attacks, chose to enter the United States \nat our northern border. That border will remain an inviting target \nuntil we dramatically improve our security.\n\n  The USA Act includes my proposals to provide the substantial and long \noverdue assistance for our law enforcement and border control efforts \nalong the Northern Border. My home State of Vermont has seen huge \nincreases in Customs and INS activity since the signing of the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement. The number of people coming through our \nborders has risen steeply over the years, but our staff and our \nresources have not.\n  I proposed--and this legislation authorizes in section 402--tripling \nthe number of Border Patrol, INS inspectors, and Customs Service \nemployees in each of the States along the 4,000-mile Northern Border. I \nwas gratified when 22 Senators--Democrats and Republicans--wrote to the \nPresident supporting such an increase, and now hope that the \nAdministration will fully fund this critical law enforcement \nimprovement.\n  Senators Cantwell and Schumer in the Committee and Senators Murray \nand Dorgan have been especially strong advocates of these provisions \nand I thank them for their leadership. In addition, the USA Act, in \nsection 401, authorizes the Attorney General to waive the FTE cap on \nINS personnel in order to address the national security needs of the \nUnited States on the northern border. Now more than ever, we must \npatrol our border vigilantly and prevent those who wish America harm \nfrom gaining entry. At the same time, we must work with the Canadians \nto allow speedy crossing to legitimate visitors and foster the \ncontinued growth of trade which is beneficial to both countries.\n  In addition to providing for more personnel, this bill also includes, \nin section 402(4), my proposal to provide $100 million in funding for \nboth the INS and the Customs Service to improve the technology used to \nmonitor the Northern Border and to purchase additional equipment. The \nbill also includes, in section 403(c), an important provision from \nSenator Cantwell directing the Attorney General, in consultation with \nother agencies, to develop a technical standard for identifying \nelectronically the identity of persons applying for visas or seeking to \nenter the United States. In short, this bill provides a comprehensive \nhigh-tech boost for the security of our nation.\n  This bill also includes important proposals to enhance data sharing. \nThe bill, in section 403, directs the Attorney General and the FBI \nDirector to give the State Department and INS access to the criminal \nhistory information in the FBI's National Crime Information Center \n(NCIC) database, as the Administration and I both proposed. The \nAttorney General is directed to report back to the Congress in two \nyears on progress in implementing this requirement. We have also \nadopted the Administration's language, in section 413, to make it \neasier for the State Department to share information with foreign \ngovernments for aid in terrorist investigations.\n  The USA Act contains a number of provisions intended to improve and \nupdate the Federal criminal code to address better the nature of \nterrorist activity and assist the FBI in translating foreign language \ninformation collected. I will mention just a few of these provisions.\n  The truth certainly seems self-evident that all the best surveillance \ntechniques in the world will not help this country defend itself from \nterrorist attack if the information cannot be understood in a timely \nfashion. Indeed, within days of September 11, the FBI Director issued \nan employment ad on national TV calling upon Arabic speakers to apply \nfor a job as an FBI translator. This is a dire situation that needs \nattention. I am therefore gratified that the final bill contains my \nproposal, in section 205, to waive any Federal personnel requirements \nand limitations imposed by any other law in order to expedite the \nhiring of translators at the FBI.\n  This bill also directs the FBI Director to establish such security \nrequirements as are necessary for the personnel employed as \ntranslators. We know the effort to recruit translators has a high \npriority, and the Congress should provide all possible support. \nTherefore, the bill calls on the Attorney General to report to the \nJudiciary Committees on the number of translators employed by the \nJustice Department; any legal or practical impediments to using \ntranslators employed by other Federal, State, or local agencies, on a \nfull, part-time, or shared basis; and the needs of the FBI for specific \ntranslation services in certain languages, and recommendations for \nmeeting those needs.\n  The Administration's initial proposal assembled a laundry list of \nmore than 40 Federal crimes ranging from computer hacking to malicious \nmischief to the use of weapons of mass destruction, and designated them \nas ``Federal terrorism offenses,'' regardless of the circumstances \nunder which they were committed. For example, a teenager who spammed \nthe NASA website and, as a result, recklessly caused damage, would be \ndeemed to have committed this new ``terrorism'' offense. Under the \nAdministration's proposal, the consequences of this designation were \nsevere. Crimes on the list would carry no statute of limitations. The \nmaximum penalties would shoot up to life imprisonment, and those \nreleased earlier would be subject to a lifetime of supervised release. \nMoreover, anyone who harbored a person whom he had ``reasonable grounds \nto suspect'' had committed, or was about to commit, a ``Federal \nterrorism offense''--whether it was the Taliban or the mother of my \nhypothetical teenage computer hacker--would be subject to stiff \ncriminal penalties. I worked closely with the Administration to ensure \nthat the definition of ``terrorism'' in the USA Act fit the crime.\n  First, we have trimmed the list of crimes that may be considered as \nterrorism predicates in section 808 of the bill. This shorter, more \nfocused list, to be codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332(g)(5)(B), more \nclosely reflects the sorts of offenses committed by terrorists.\n  Second, we have provided, in section 809, that the current 8-year \nlimitations period for this new set of offenses will remain in place, \nexcept where the commission of the offense resulted in, or created a \nrisk of, death or serious bodily injury.\n  Third, rather than make an across-the-board, one-size-fits-all \nincrease of the penalties for every offense on the list, without regard \nto the severity of the offense, we have made, in section 810, more \nmeasured increases in maximum penalties where appropriate, including \nlife imprisonment or lifetime supervised release in cases in which the \noffense resulted in death. We have also\n\n[[Page S10997]]\n\nadded, in section 811, conspiracy provisions to a few criminal statutes \nwhere appropriate, with penalties equal to the penalties for the object \noffense, up to life imprisonment.\n\n  Finally, we have more carefully defined the new crime of harboring \nterrorists in section 803, so that it applies only to those harboring \npeople who have committed, or are about to commit, the most serious of \nFederal terrorism-related crimes, such as the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Moreover, it is not enough that the defendant had \n``reasonable grounds to suspect'' that the person he was harboring had \ncommitted, or was about to commit, such a crime; the government must \nprove that the defendant knew or had ``reasonable grounds to believe'' \nthat this was so.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the amendments to the so-called McDade \nlaw, which were included in the original USA Act, S. 1510, which passed \nthe Senate, are not included in the bill before the Senate today. Well \nbefore September 11, the Justice Department has said that the McDade \nlaw--which subjects Federal prosecutors to multiple and potentially \nconflicting State bar rules--has delayed important criminal \ninvestigations, prevented the use of effective and traditionally-\naccepted investigative techniques, and served as the basis of \nlitigation to interfere with legitimate Federal prosecutions. Despite \nthis record of opposition, and the increasing demands upon Federal \nprosecutors in the wake of the terrorist attacks, the Administration \nsimply acceded to House demands to remove this provision of the USA \nAct. This abandonment has removed a critical law enforcement provision \nfrom the bill. No one in the Senate knows more about the importance of \nthis provision than Senator Wyden, who worked strenuously to include \nthe McDade law in this bill. But his efforts and mine proved unavailing \nwithout Administration backing through the entire process.\n  The McDade law has a dubious history, to say the least. At the end of \nthe 105th Congress, it was slipped into an omnibus appropriations bill \nover the objection of every member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nSince it was adopted, it has caused numerous problems for Federal \nprosecutors, and we must find a way to amend it before more cases are \ncompromised. At a time when we need Federal law enforcement authorities \nto move quickly to catch those responsible for the September 11 \nattacks, and to prevent further attacks on our country, we can no \nlonger tolerate the drag on Federal investigations and prosecutions \ncaused by this ill-considered legislation.\n  Another provision of the USA Act that was not included in the \nAdministration's initial proposal is section 801, which targets acts of \nterrorism and other violence against mass transportation systems. \nEarlier this month, a Greyhound bus crashed in Tennessee after a \nderanged passenger slit the driver's throat and then grabbed the \nsteering wheel, forcing the bus into oncoming traffic. Six people were \nkilled in the crash. Because there are currently no Federal laws \naddressing terrorism of mass transportation systems, however, there may \nbe no Federal jurisdiction over such a case, even if it were committed \nby suspected terrorists. Clearly, there is an urgent need for strong \ncriminal legislation to deter attacks against mass transportation \nsystems. Section 801 will fill this gap.\n  The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1030, is the \nprimary Federal criminal statute prohibiting computer frauds and \nhacking. I worked with Senator Hatch in the last Congress to make \nimprovements to this law in the Internet Security Act, which passed the \nSenate as part of another bill. Our work is included in section 814 of \nthe USA Act. This section would amend the statute to clarify the \nappropriate scope of Federal jurisdiction. (1) The bill adds a \ndefinition of ``loss'' to cover any reasonable cost to the victim in \nresponding to a computer hacker. Calculation of loss is important both \nin determining whether the $5,000 jurisdictional hurdle in the statute \nis met, and, at sentencing, in calculating the appropriate guideline \nrange and restitution amount.\n  (2) The bill amends the definition of ``protected computer,'' to \ninclude qualified computers even when they are physically located \noutside of the United States. This clarification will preserve the \nability of the United States to assist in international hacking cases \nand finally, this section eliminates the current directive to the \nSentencing Commission requiring that all violations, including \nmisdemeanor violations, of certain provisions of the Computer Fraud and \nAbuse Act be punished with a term of imprisonment of at least six \nmonths.\n  Borrowing from a bill introduced in the last Congress by Senator \nBiden, the USA Act contains a provision in section 817 to strengthen \nour Federal laws relating to the threat of biological weapons. At a \ntime when the national headlines are filled with news about anthrax and \nother biological threats, it is fitting that the House added this \nprovision back to the bill after dropping it from H.R. 2975. \nUnfortunately, the bill does not contain certain regulatory provisions \nthat the Administration initially proposed and later withdrew, \napparently due to its inability to resolve inter-agency conflicts. \nGiven the grave importance of this issue, I urge the Administration to \nresolve these disputes and work with the Congress to provide these \nadditional protections.\n  Current law prohibits the possession, development, or acquisition of \nbiological agents or toxins ``for use as a weapon.'' Section 817 amends \nthe definition of ``for use as a weapon'' to include all situations in \nwhich it can be proven that the defendant had any purpose other than a \npeaceful purpose. This will enhance the government's ability to \nprosecute suspected terrorists in possession of biological agents or \ntoxins, and conform the scope of the criminal offense in 18 U.S.C. \nSec.  175 more closely to the related forfeiture provision in 18 U.S.C. \nSec.  176. This section also contains a new statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  \n175b, which generally makes it an offense for certain restricted \npersons, including non-resident aliens from countries that support \ninternational terrorism, to possess a listed biological agent or toxin.\n  Of greater consequence, section 817 defines another additional \noffense, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, of possessing a \nbiological agent, toxin, or delivery system ``of a type or in a \nquantity that, under the circumstances,'' is not reasonably justified \nby a peaceful purpose. As originally proposed by the Administration, \nthis provision specifically stated that knowledge of whether the type \nor quantity of the agent or toxin was reasonably justified was not an \nelement of the offense. Thus, although the burden of proof is always on \nthe government, every person who possesses a biological agent, toxin, \nor delivery system was at some level of risk. At my urging, the \nAdministration agreed to drop this portion of the provision.\n  Nevertheless, I remain troubled by the subjectivity of the \nsubstantive standard for violation of this new criminal prohibition, \nand question whether it provides sufficient notice under the \nConstitution. I also share the concerns of the American Society for \nMicrobiology and the Association of American Universities that this \nprovision will have a chilling effect upon legitimate scientific \ninquiry that offsets any benefit in protecting against terrorism. While \nwe have tried to prevent against this by creating an explicit exclusion \nfor ``bona fide research,'' this provision may yet prove unworkable, \nunconstitutional, or both. I urge the Justice Department and the \nresearch community to work together on substitute language that would \nprovide prosecutors with a more workable tool.\n\n  Two sections of the USA Act were added at the request of the United \nStates Secret Service, with the support of the Administration. I was \npleased to accommodate the Secret Service by including these provisions \nin the bill to expand Electronic Crimes Task Forces and to clarify the \nauthority of the Secret Service to investigate computer crimes.\n  The Secret Service is committed to the development of new tools to \ncombat the growing areas of financial crime, computer fraud, and \ncyberterrorism. Recognizing a need for law enforcement, private \nindustry and academia to pool their resources, skills, and vision to \ncombat criminal elements in cyberspace, the Secret Service created the \nNew York Electronic Crimes Task Force (NYECTF). This highly successful \nmodel includes\n\n[[Page S10998]]\n\nover 250 individual members, including 50 different Federal, State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies, 100 private companies, and 9 \nuniversities. Since its inception in 1995, the NYECTF has successfully \ninvestigated a range of financial and electronic crimes, including \ncredit card fraud, identity theft, bank fraud, computer systems \nintrusions, and e-mail threats against protectees of the Secret \nService. Section 105 of the USA Act authorizes the Secret Service to \ndevelop similar task forces in cities and regions across the country \nwhere critical infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks from \nterrorists or other cyber-criminals.\n  Section 506 of the USA Act gives the Secret Service concurrent \njurisdiction to investigate offenses under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1030 \nrelating to fraud and related activity in connection with computers. \nPrior to the 1996 amendments to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the \nSecret Service was authorized to investigate any and all violations of \nsection 1030, pursuant to an agreement between the Secretary of \nTreasury and the Attorney General. The 1996 amendments, however, \nconcentrated Secret Service jurisdiction on certain specified \nsubsections of section 1030. The current amendment would return full \njurisdiction to the Secret Service and would allow the Justice and \nTreasury Departments to decide on the appropriate work-sharing balance \nbetween the two. This will enable the Secret Service to investigate a \nwide range of potential White House network intrusions, as well as \nintrusions into remote sites (outside of the White House) that could \nimpact the safety and security of its protectees, and to continue its \nmissions to protect the nation's critical infrastructure and financial \npayment systems.\n  The USA Act also authorizes, for the first time, a counter-terrorism \nfund in the Treasury of the United States to reimburse Justice \nDepartment for any costs incurred in connection with the fight against \nterrorism. I first authored this counter-terrorism fund in S. 1319, the \n21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act, \nwhich Senator Hatch and I introduced in August.\n  Specifically, this counter-terrorism fund may be used: (1) to \nreestablish an office or facility that has been damaged as the result \nof any domestic or international terrorism incident; (2) to provide \nsupport to counter, investigate, or prosecute domestic or international \nterrorism, including paying rewards in connection with these \nactivities; (3) to conduct terrorism threat assessments of Federal \nagencies; and (4) for costs incurred in connection with detaining \nindividuals in foreign countries who are accused of acts of terrorism \nin violation of United States law.\n  This bill provides enhanced surveillance procedures for the \ninvestigation of terrorism and other crimes. The challenge before us \nhas been to strike a reasonable balance to protect both the security \nand the liberties of our people. In some respects, the changes made are \nappropriate and important ones to update surveillance and investigative \nprocedures in light of new technology and experience with current law. \nYet, as I noted at the beginning of my statement, in other respects, I \nhave deep concerns that we may be increasing surveillance powers and \nthe sharing of criminal justice information without adequate checks on \nhow information may be handled and without adequate accountability in \nthe form of judicial review.\n  The bill contains a number of sensible proposals that should not be \ncontroversial.\n  For example, sections 201 and 202 of the USA Act would add to the \nlist of crimes that may be used as predicates for wiretaps certain \noffenses which are specifically tailored to the terrorist threat. In \naddition to crimes that relate directly to terrorism, the list would \ninclude crimes of computer fraud and abuse which are committed by \nterrorists to support and advance their illegal objectives.\n  The bill, in section 206, would authorize the use of roving wiretaps \nin the course of a foreign intelligence investigation and brings FISA \ninto line with criminal procedures that allow surveillance to follow a \nperson, rather than requiring a separate court order identifying each \ntelephone company or other communication common carrier whose \nassistance is needed. This is a matter on which the Attorney General \nand I reached early agreement. This is the kind of change that has a \ncompelling justification, because it recognizes the ease with which \ntargets of investigations can evade surveillance by changing phones. In \nfact, the original roving wiretap authority for use in criminal \ninvestigations was enacted as part of the Electronic Communications \nPrivacy Act, ECPA, in 1986. I was proud to be the primary Senate \nsponsor of that earlier law.\n  Paralleling the statutory rules applicable to criminal \ninvestigations, the formulation I originally proposed made clear that \nthis roving wiretap authority must be requested in the application \nbefore the FISA court was authorized to order such roving surveillance \nauthority. Indeed, the Administration agrees that the FISA court may \nnot grant such authority sua sponte. Nevertheless, we have accepted the \nAdministration's formulation of the new roving wiretap authority, which \nrequires the FISA court to make a finding that the actions of the \nperson whose communications are to be intercepted could have the effect \nof thwarting the identification of a specified facility or place. While \nno amendment is made to the statutory directions for what must be \nincluded in the application for a FISA electronic surveillance order, \nthese applications should include the necessary information to support \nthe FISA court's finding that roving wiretap authority is warranted.\n  Section 220 of this bill authorizes nationwide service of search \nwarrants in terrorism investigations. This will allow the judge who is \nmost familiar with the developments in a fast-breaking and complex \nterrorism investigation to make determinations of probable cause, no \nmatter where the property to be searched is located. This will not only \nsave time by avoiding having to bring up-to-speed another judge in \nanother jurisdiction where the property is located, but also serves \nprivacy and Fourth Amendment interests in ensuring that the most \nknowledgeable judge makes the determination of probable cause. The \nbill, in section 209, also authorizes voice mail messages to be seized \non the authority of a probable cause search warrant rather than through \nthe more burdensome and time-consuming process of a wiretap.\n  The bill updates the laws pertaining to electronic records in three \nprimary ways. First, in section 210, the bill authorizes the nationwide \nservice of subpoenas for subscriber information and expands the list of \nitems subject to subpoena to include the means and source of payment \nfor the service.\n  In section 211, the bill equalizes the standard for law enforcement \naccess to cable subscriber records on the same basis as other \nelectronic records. The Cable Communications Policy Act, passed in 1984 \nto regulate various aspects of the cable television industry, did not \ntake into account the changes in technology that have occurred over the \nlast fifteen years. Cable television companies now often provide \nInternet access and telephone service in addition to television \nprogramming. This amendment clarifies that a cable company must comply \nwith the laws governing the interception and disclosure of wire and \nelectronic communications just like any other telephone company or \nInternet service provider. The amendments would retain current \nstandards that govern the release of customer records for television \nprogramming.\n  Finally, the bill, in section 212, permits, but does not require, an \nelectronic communications service to disclose the contents of and \nsubscriber information about communications in emergencies involving \nthe immediate danger of death or serious physical injury. Under current \nlaw, if an ISP's customer receives an e-mail death threat from another \ncustomer of the same ISP, and the victim provides a copy of the \ncommunication to the ISP, the ISP is limited in what actions it may \ntake. On one hand, the ISP may disclose the contents of the forwarded \ncommunication to law enforcement (or to any other third party as it \nsees fit). See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2702(b)(3). On the other hand, current \nlaw does not expressly authorize the ISP to voluntarily provide law \nenforcement with the identity, home address, and other subscriber \ninformation of the user making the threat. See 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 2703(c)(1)(B),(C) (permitting disclosure\n\n[[Page S10999]]\n\nto government entities only in response to legal process). In those \ncases where the risk of death or injury is imminent, the law should not \nrequire providers to sit idly by. This voluntary disclosure, however, \nin no way creates an affirmative obligation to review customer \ncommunications in search of such imminent dangers.\n  Also, under existing law, a provider (even one providing services to \nthe public) may disclose the contents of a customer's communications--\nto law enforcement or anyone else--in order to protect its rights or \nproperty. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2702(b)(5). However, the current statute \ndoes not expressly permit a provider voluntarily to disclose non-\ncontent records (such as a subscriber's login records) to law \nenforcement for purposes of self-protection. See 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 2703(c)(1)(B). Yet the right to disclose the content of \ncommunications necessarily implies the less intrusive ability to \ndisclose non-content records. Cf. United States v. Auler, 539 F.2d 642, \n646 n.9 (7th Cir. 1976) (phone company's authority to monitor and \ndisclose conversations to protect against fraud necessarily implies \nright to commit lesser invasion of using, and disclosing fruits of, pen \nregister device) (citing United States v. Freeman, 524 F.2d 337, 341 \n(7th Cir. 1975)). Moreover, as a practical matter providers must have \nthe right to disclose the facts surrounding attacks on their systems. \nWhen a telephone carrier is defrauded by a subscriber, or when an ISP's \nauthorized user launches a network intrusion against his own ISP, the \nprovider must have the legal ability to report the complete details of \nthe crime to law enforcement. The bill clarifies that service providers \nhave the statutory authority to make such disclosures.\n  There is consensus that the existing legal procedures for pen \nregister and trap-and-trace authority are antiquated and need to be \nupdated. I have been proposing ways to update the pen register and trap \nand trace statutes for several years, but not necessarily in the same \nways as the Administration initially proposed. In fact, in 1998, I \nintroduced with then-Senator Ashcroft, the E-PRIVACY Act, S. 2067, \nwhich proposed changes in the pen register laws. In 1999, I introduced \nthe E-RIGHTS Act, S. 934, also with proposals to update the pen \nregister laws.\n  Again, in the last Congress, I introduced the Internet Security Act, \nS. 2430, on April 13, 2000, that proposed: 1, changing the pen register \nand trap and trace device law to give nationwide effect to pen register \nand trap and trace orders obtained by Government attorneys and obviate \nthe need to obtain identical orders in multiple Federal jurisdictions; \n2, clarifying that such devices can be used for computer transmissions \nto obtain electronic addresses, not just on telephone lines; and 3, as \na guard against abuse, providing for meaningful judicial review of \ngovernment attorney applications for pen registers and trap and trace \ndevices.\n  As the outline of my earlier legislation suggests, I have long \nsupported modernizing the pen register and trap and trace device laws \nby modifying the statutory language to cover the use of these orders on \ncomputer transmissions; to remove the jurisdictional limits on service \nof these orders; and to update the judicial review procedure, which, \nunlike any other area in criminal procedure, bars the exercise of \njudicial discretion in reviewing the justification for the order. The \nUSA Act, in section 216, updates the pen register and trap and trace \nlaws only in two out of three respects I believe are important, and \nwithout allowing meaningful judicial review. Yet, we were able to \nimprove the Administration's initial proposal, which suffered from the \nsame problems as the provision that was hastily taken up and passed by \nthe Senate, by voice vote, on September, 13, 2001, as an amendment to \nthe Commerce Justice State Appropriations Act.\n  The existing legal procedures for pen register and trap-and-trace \nauthority require service of individual orders for installation of pen \nregister or trap and trace device on the service providers that carried \nthe targeted communications. Deregulation of the telecommunications \nindustry has had the consequence that one communication may be carried \nby multiple providers. For example, a telephone call may be carried by \na competitive local exchange carrier, which passes it at a switch to a \nlocal Bell Operating Company, which passes it to a long distance \ncarrier, which hands it to an incumbent local exchange carrier \nelsewhere in the U.S., which in turn may finally hand it to a cellular \ncarrier. If these carriers do not pass source information with each \ncall, identifying that source may require compelling information from \na host of providers located throughout the country.\n\n  Under present law, a court may only authorize the installation of a \npen register or trap device ``within the jurisdiction of the court.'' \nAs a result, when one provider indicates that the source of a \ncommunication is a carrier in another district, a second order may be \nnecessary. The Department of Justice has advised, for example, that in \n1996, a hacker (who later turned out to be launching his attacks from a \nforeign country) extensively penetrated computers belonging to the \nDepartment of Defense. This hacker was dialing into a computer at \nHarvard University and used this computer as an intermediate staging \npoint in an effort to conceal his location and identity. Investigators \nobtained a trap and trace order instructing the phone company, Nynex, \nto trace these calls, but Nynex could only report that the \ncommunications were coming to it from a long-distance carrier, MCI. \nInvestigators then applied for a court order to obtain the connection \ninformation from MCI, but since the hacker was no longer actually using \nthe connection, MCI could not identify its source. Only if the \ninvestigators could have served MCI with a trap and trace order while \nthe hacker was actively on-line could they have successfully traced \nback and located him.\n  In another example provided by the Department of Justice, \ninvestigators encountered similar difficulties in attempting to track \nKevin Mitnick, a criminal who continued to hack into computers attached \nto the Internet despite the fact that he was on supervised release for \na prior computer crime conviction. The FBI attempted to trace these \nelectronic communications while they were in progress. In order to \nevade arrest, however, Mitnick moved around the country and used cloned \ncellular phones and other evasive techniques. His hacking attacks would \noften pass through one of two cellular carriers, a local phone company, \nand then two Internet service providers. In this situation, where \ninvestigators and service providers had to act quickly to trace Mitnick \nin the act of hacking, only many repeated attempts--accompanied by an \norder to each service provider--finally produced success. Fortunately, \nMitnick was such a persistent hacker that he gave law enforcement many \nchances to complete the trace.\n  This duplicative process of obtaining a separate order for each link \nin the communications chain can be quite time-consuming, and it serves \nno useful purpose since the original court has already authorized the \ntrace. Moreover, a second or third order addressed to a particular \ncarrier that carried part of a prior communication may prove useless \nduring the next attack: in computer intrusion cases, for example, the \ntarget may use an entirely different path (i.e., utilize a different \nset of intermediate providers) for his or her subsequent activity.\n  The bill would modify the pen register and trap and trace statutes to \nallow for nationwide service of a single order for installation of \nthese devices, without the necessity of returning to court for each new \ncarrier. I support this change.\n  The language of the existing statute is hopelessly out of date and \nspeaks of a pen register or trap and trace ``device'' being \n``attached'' to a telephone ``line.'' However, the rapid \ncomputerization of the telephone system has changed the tracing \nprocess. No longer are such functions normally accomplished by physical \nhardware components attached to telephone lines. Instead, these \nfunctions are typically performed by computerized collection and \nretention of call routing information passing through a communications \nsystem.\n  The statute's definition of a ``pen register'' as a ``device'' that \nis ``attached'' to a particular ``telephone line'' is particularly \nobsolete when applied to the wireless portion of a cellular phone call, \nwhich has no line to which anything can be attached. While courts have \nauthorized pen register orders for wireless phones based on the\n\n[[Page S11000]]\n\nnotion of obtaining access to a ``virtual line,'' updating the law to \nkeep pace with current technology is a better course.\n  Moreover, the statute is ill-equipped to facilitate the tracing of \ncommunications that take place over the Internet. For example, the pen \nregister definition refers to telephone ``numbers'' rather than the \nbroader concept of a user's communications account. Although pen \nregister and trap orders have been obtained for activity on computer \nnetworks, Internet service providers have challenged the application of \nthe statute to electronic communications, frustrating legitimate \ninvestigations. I have long supported updating the statute by removing \nwords such as ``numbers . . . dialed'' that do not apply to the way \nthat pen/trap devices are used and to clarify the statute's proper \napplication to tracing communications in an electronic environment, but \nin a manner that is technology neutral and does not capture the content \nof communications. That being said, I have been concerned about the FBI \nand Justice Department's insistence over the past few years that the \npen/trap devices statutes be updated with broad, undefined terms that \ncontinue to flame concerns that these laws will be used to intercept \nprivate communications content.\n  The Administration's initial pen/trap device proposal added the terms \n``routing'' and ``addressing'' to the definitions describing the \ninformation that was authorized for interception on the low relevance \nstandard under these laws. The Administration and the Department of \nJustice flatly rejected my suggestion that these terms be defined to \nrespond to concerns that the new terms might encompass matter \nconsidered content, which may be captured only upon a showing of \nprobable cause, not the mere relevancy of the pen/trap statute. \nInstead, the Administration agreed that the definition should expressly \nexclude the use of pen/trap devices to intercept ``content,'' which is \nbroadly defined in 18 U.S.C. 2510(8).\n  While this is an improvement, the FBI and Justice Department are \nshort-sighted in their refusal to define these terms. We should be \nclear about the consequence of not providing definitions for these new \nterms in the pen/trap device statutes. These terms will be defined, if \nnot by the Congress, then by the courts in the context of criminal \ncases where pen/trap devices have been used and challenged by \ndefendants. If a court determines that a pen register has captured \n``content,'' which the FBI admits such devices do, in violation of the \nFourth Amendment, suppression may be ordered, not only of the pen \nregister evidence by any other evidence derived from it. We are leaving \nthe courts with little or no guidance of what is covered by \n``addressing'' or ``routing.''\n  The USA Act also requires the government to use reasonably available \ntechnology that limits the interceptions under the pen/trap device laws \n``so as not to include the contents of any wire or electronic \ncommunications.'' This limitation on the technology used by the \ngovernment to execute pen/trap orders is important since, as the FBI \nadvised me in June 2000, pen register devices ``do capture all \nelectronic impulses transmitted by the facility on which they are \nattached, including such impulses transmitted after a phone call is \nconnected to the called party.'' The impulses made after the call is \nconnected could reflect the electronic banking transactions a \ncaller makes, or the electronic ordering from a catalogue that a \ncustomer makes over the telephone, or the electronic ordering of a \nprescription drug.\n\n  This transactional data intercepted after the call is connected is \n``content.'' As the Justice Department explained in a May 1998 letter \nto then-House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, ``the retrieval \nof the electronic impulses that a caller necessarily generated in \nattempting to direct the phone call'' does not constitute a ``search'' \nrequiring probable cause since ``no part of the substantive information \ntransmitted after the caller had reached the called party'' is \nobtained. But the Justice Department made clear that ``all of the \ninformation transmitted after a phone call is connected to the called \nparty . . . is substantive in nature. These electronic impulses are the \n`contents' of the call: They are not used to direct or process the \ncall, but instead convey certain messages to the recipient.''\n  When I added the direction on use of reasonably available technology \n(codified as 18 U.S.C. 3121(c)) to the pen register statute as part of \nthe Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) in 1994, \nI recognized that these devices collected content and that such \ncollection was unconstitutional on the mere relevance standard. \nNevertheless, the FBI advised me in June 2000, that pen register \ndevices for telephone services ``continue to operate as they have for \ndecades'' and that ``there has been no change . . . that would better \nrestrict the recording or decoding of electronic or other impulses to \nthe dialing and signaling information utilized in call processing.'' \nPerhaps, if there were meaningful judicial review and accountability, \nthe FBI would take the statutory direction more seriously and actually \nimplement it.\n  Due in significant part to the fact that pen/trap devices in use \ntoday collect ``content,'' I have sought in legislation introduced over \nthe past few years to update and modify the judicial review procedure \nfor pen register and trap and trace devices. Existing law requires an \nattorney for the government to certify that the information likely to \nbe obtained by the installation of a pen register or trap and trace \ndevice will be relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. The court \nis required to issue an order upon seeing the prosecutor's \ncertification. The court is not authorized to look behind the \ncertification to evaluate the judgement of the prosecutor.\n  I have urged that government attorneys be required to include facts \nabout their investigations in their applications for pen/trap orders \nand allow courts to grant such orders only where the facts support the \nrelevancy of the information likely to be obtained by the orders. This \nis not a change in the applicable standard, which would remain the very \nlow relevancy standard. Instead, this change would simply allow the \ncourt to evaluate the facts presented by a prosecutor, and, if it finds \nthat the facts support the government's assertion that the information \nto be collected will be relevant, issue the order. Although this change \nwill place an additional burden on law enforcement, it will allow the \ncourts a greater ability to assure that government attorneys are using \nsuch orders properly.\n  Some have called this change a ``roll-back'' in the statute, as if \nthe concept of allowing meaningful judicial review was an extreme \nposition. To the contrary, this is a change that the Clinton \nAdministration supported in legislation transmitted to the Congress \nlast year. This is a change that the House Judiciary Committee also \nsupported last year. In the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, H.R. \n5018, that Committee proposed that before a pen/trap device ``could be \nordered installed, the government must first demonstrate to an \nindependent judge that `specific and articulable facts reasonably \nindicate that a crime has been, is being, or will be committed, and \ninformation likely to be obtained by such installation and use . . . is \nrelevant to an investigation of that crime.'' (Report 106-932, 106th \nCong. 2d Sess., Oct. 4, 2000, p. 13). Unfortunately, the Bush \nAdministration has taken a contrary position and has rejected this \nchange in the judicial review process.\n  Currently, an owner or operator of a computer that is accessed by a \nhacker as a means for the hacker to reach a third computer, cannot \nsimply consent to law enforcement monitoring of the computer. Instead, \nbecause the owner or operator is not technically a party to the \ncommunication, law enforcement needs wiretap authorization under Title \nIII to conduct such monitoring. I have long been interested in closing \nthis loophole. Indeed, when I asked about this problem, the FBI \nexplained to me in June 2000 that:\n\n       This anomaly in the law creates an untenable situation \n     whereby providers are sometimes forced to sit idly by as they \n     witness hackers enter and, in some situations, destroy or \n     damage their systems and networks while law enforcement \n     begins the detailed process of seeking court authorization to \n     assist them. In the real world, the situation is akin to a \n     homeowner being forced to helplessly watch a burglar or \n     vandal while police seek a search warrant to enter the \n     dwelling.\n\n  I therefore introduced as part of the Internet Security Act, S. 2430, \nin 2000,\n\n[[Page S11001]]\n\nan exception to the wiretap statute that would explicitly permit such \nmonitoring without a wiretap if prior consent is obtained from the \nperson whose computer is being hacked through and used to send \n``harmful interference to a lawfully operating computer system.''\n  The Administration initially proposed a different formulation of the \nexception that would have allowed an owner/operator of any computer \nconnected to the Internet to consent to FBI wiretapping of any user who \nviolated a workplace computer use policy or online service term of \nservice and was thereby an ``unauthorized'' user. The Administration's \nproposal was not limited to computer hacking offenses under 18 U.S.C. \n1030 or to conduct that caused harm to a computer or computer system. \nThe Administration rejected these refinements to their proposed wiretap \nexception, but did agree, in section 217 of the USA Act, to limit the \nauthority for wiretapping with the consent of the owner/operator to \ncommunications of unauthorized users without an existing subscriber or \nother contractual relationship with the owner/operator.\n  This bill will make significant changes in the sharing of \nconfidential criminal justice information with various Federal \nagencies. For those of us who have been concerned about the leaks from \nthe FBI that can irreparably damage reputations of innocent people and \nfrustrate investigations by alerting suspects to flee or destroy \nmaterial evidence, the Administration's insistence on the broadest \nauthority to disseminate such information, without any judicial check, \nis disturbing. Nonetheless, I believe we have improved the \nAdministration's initial proposal in responsible ways. Only time will \ntell whether the improvements we were able to reach agreement on are \nsufficient.\n  At the outset, we should be clear that current law allows the sharing \nof confidential criminal justice information, but with close court \nsupervision. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) provides that \nmatters occurring before a grand jury may be disclosed only to an \nattorney for the government, such other government personnel as are \nnecessary to assist the attorney and another grand jury. Further \ndisclosure is also allowed as specifically authorized by a court.\n  Similarly, section 2517 of title 18, United States Code provides that \nwiretap evidence may be disclosed in testimony during official \nproceedings and to investigative or law enforcement officers to the \nextent appropriate to the proper performance of their official duties. \nIn addition, the wiretap law allows disclosure of wiretap evidence \n``relating to offenses other than specified in the order'' when \nauthorized or approved by a judge. Indeed, just last year, the Justice \nDepartment assured us that ``law enforcement agencies have authority \nunder current law to share title III information regarding terrorism \nwith intelligence agencies when the information is of overriding \nimportance to the national security.'' (Letter from Robert Raben, \nAssistant Attorney General, September 28, 2000).\n  For this reason, and others, the Justice Department at the time \nopposed an amendment proposed by Senators Kyl and Feinstein to S. 2507, \nthe Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 2001, that would have allowed \nthe sharing of foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information \ncollected from wiretaps with the intelligence community. I deferred to \nthe Justice Department on this issue and sought changes in the proposed \namendment to address the Department's concern that this provision was \nnot only unnecessary but also ``could have significant implications for \nprosecutions and the discovery process in litigation,'' ``raises \nsignificant issues regarding the sharing with intelligence agencies of \ninformation collected about United States persons,'' and jeopardized \n``the need to protect equities relating to ongoing criminal \ninvestigations.'' In the end, the amendment was revised to address the \nJustice Department's concerns and passed the Senate as a free-standing \nbill, S. 3205, the Counterterrorism Act of 2000. The House took no \naction on this legislation.\n  The Administration initially proposed adding a sweeping provision to \nthe wiretap statute that broadened the definition of an ``investigative \nor law enforcement officer'' who may receive disclosures of information \nobtained through wiretaps to include Federal law enforcement, \nintelligence, national security, national defense, protective and \nimmigration personnel and the President and Vice President. This \nproposal troubled me because information intercepted by a wiretap has \nenormous potential to infringe upon the privacy rights of innocent \npeople, including people who are not even suspected of a crime and \nmerely happen to speak on the telephone with the targets of an \ninvestigation. For this reason, the authority to disclose information \nobtained through a wiretap has always been carefully circumscribed in \nlaw.\n  While I recognize that appropriate officials in the executive branch \nof government should have access to wiretap information that is \nimportant to combating terrorism or protecting the national security, I \nproposed allowing such disclosures where specifically authorized by a \ncourt order. Further, with respect to information relating to \nterrorism, I proposed allowing the disclosure without a court order as \nlong as the judge who authorized the wiretap was notified as soon as \npracticable after the fact. This would have provided a check against \nabuses of the disclosure authority by providing for review by a neutral \njudicial official. At the same time, there was a little likelihood that \na judge would deny any requests for disclosure in cases where it was \nwarranted.\n  On Sunday, September 30, the Administration agreed to my proposal, \nbut within two days, it backed away from its agreement. I remain \nconcerned that the resulting provision will allow the unprecedented, \nwidespread disclosure of this highly sensitive information without any \nnotification to or review by the court that authorizes and supervises \nthe wiretap. This is clearly an area where our Committee will have to \nexercise close oversight to make sure that the newly-minted disclosure \nauthority is not being abused.\n  The Administration offered three reasons for reneging on the original \ndeal. First, they claimed that the involvement of the court would \ninhibit Federal investigators and attorneys from disclosing information \nneeded by intelligence and national security officials. Second, they \nsaid the courts might not have adequate security and therefore should \nnot be told that information was disclosed for intelligence or national \nsecurity purposes. And third, they said the President's constitutional \npowers under Article II give him authority to get whatever foreign \nintelligence he needs to exercise his national security \nresponsibilities.\n  I believe these concerns are unfounded. Federal investigators and \nattorneys will recognize the need to disclose information relevant to \nterrorism investigations. Courts can be trusted to keep secrets and \nrecognize the needs of the President.\n  Current law requires that such information be used only for law \nenforcement purposes. This provides an assurance that highly intrusive \ninvasions of privacy are confined to the purpose for which they have \nbeen approved by a court, based on probable cause, as required by the \nFourth Amendment. Current law calls for minimization procedures to \nensure that the surveillance does not gather information about private \nand personal conduct and conversations that are not relevant to the \ncriminal investigation.\n  When the Administration reneged on the agreement regarding court \nsupervision, we turned to other safeguards and were more successful in \nchanging other questionable features of the Administration's bill. The \nAdministration accepted my proposal to strike the term ``national \nsecurity'' from the description of wiretap information that may be \nshared throughout the executive branch and replace it with ``foreign \nintelligence'' information. This change is important in clarifying what \ninformation may be disclosed because the term ``foreign intelligence'' \nis specifically defined by statute whereas ``national security'' is \nnot.\n  Moreover, the rubric of ``national security'' has been used to \njustify some particularly unsavory activities by the government in the \npast. We must have at least some assurance that we are not embarked on \na course that will lead to a repetition of these abuses because the \nstatute will now more clearly define what type of information is \nsubject to disclosure. In addition, Federal officials who receive the \ninformation\n\n[[Page S11002]]\n\nmay use it only as necessary to the conduct of their official duties. \nTherefore, any disclosure or use outside the conduct of their official \nduties remains subject to all limitations applicable to their retention \nand dissemination of information of the type of information received. \nThis includes the Privacy Act, the criminal penalties for \nunauthorized disclosure of electronic surveillance information under \nchapter 119 of title 18, and the contempt penalties for unauthorized \ndisclosure of grand jury information. In addition, the Attorney General \nmust establish procedures for the handling of information that \nidentifies a United States person, such as the restrictions on \nretention and dissemination of foreign intelligence and \ncounterintelligence information pertaining to United States persons \ncurrently in effect under Executive Order 12333.\n\n  While these safeguards do not fully substitute for court supervision, \nthey can provide some assurance against misuse of the private, \npersonal, and business information about Americans that is acquired in \nthe course of criminal investigations and that may flow more widely in \nthe intelligence, defense, and national security worlds.\n  The wiretap statute was not the only provision in which the \nAdministration sought broader authority to disclose highly sensitive \ninvestigative information. It also proposed broadening Rule 6(e) of the \nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure to allow the disclosure of \ninformation relating to terrorism and national security obtained from \ngrand jury proceedings to a broad range of officials in the executive \nbranch of government. As with wiretaps, few would disagree that \ninformation learned in a criminal investigation that is necessary to \ncombating terrorism or protecting the national security ought to be \nshared with the appropriate intelligence and national security \nofficials. The question is how best to regulate and limit such \ndisclosures so as not to compromise the important policies of secrecy \nand confidentiality that have long applied to grand jury proceedings.\n  I proposed that we require judicial review of requests to disclose \nterrorism and foreign intelligence information to officials in the \nexecutive branch beyond those already authorized to receive such \ndisclosures. Once again, the Administration agreed to my proposal on \nSunday, September 30, but reneged within two days. As a result, the \nbill does not provide for any judicial supervision of the new \nauthorization for dissemination of grand jury information throughout \nthe executive branch. The bill does contain the safeguards that I have \ndiscussed with respect to law enforcement wiretap information. However, \nas with the new wiretap disclosure authority, I am troubled by this \nissue and plan to exercise the close oversight of the Judiciary \nCommittee to make sure it is not being abused.\n  The Administration also sought a provision that would allow the \nsharing of foreign intelligence information throughout the executive \nbranch of the government notwithstanding any current legal prohibition \nthat may prevent or limit its disclosure. I have resisted this proposal \nmore strongly than anything else that still remains in the bill. What \nconcerns me is that it is not clear what existing prohibitions this \nprovision would affect beyond the grand jury secrecy rule and the \nwiretap statute, which are already covered by other provisions in the \nbill. Even the Administration, which wrote this provision, has not been \nable to provide a fully satisfactory explanation of its scope.\n  If there are specific laws that the Administration believes impede \nthe necessary sharing of information on terrorism and foreign \nintelligence within the executive branch, we should address those \nproblems through legislation that is narrowly targeted to those \nstatutes. Tacking on a blunderbuss provision whose scope we do not \nfully understand can only lead to consequences that we cannot foresee. \nFurther, I am concerned that such legislation, broadly authorizing the \nsecret sharing of intelligence information throughout the executive \nbranch, will fuel the unwarranted fears and dark conspiracy theories of \nAmericans who do not trust their government. This was another provision \non which the Administration reneged on its agreement with me; it agreed \nto drop it on September 30, but resurrected it within two days, \ninsisting that it remain in the bill. I have made efforts to mitigate \nits potential for abuse somewhat by adding the same safeguards that \napply to disclosure of law enforcement wiretap and grand jury \ninformation.\n  Another issue that has caused serious concern relates to the \nAdministration's proposal for so-called ``sneak and peek'' search \nwarrants. The House Judiciary Committee dropped this proposal entirely \nfrom its version of the legislation. Normally, when law enforcement \nofficers execute a search warrant, they must leave a copy of the \nwarrant and a receipt for all property seized at the premises searched. \nThus, even if the search occurs when the owner of the premises is not \npresent, the owner will receive notice that the premises have been \nlawfully searched pursuant to a warrant rather than, for example, \nburglarized.\n  Two circuit courts of appeal, the Second and the Ninth Circuits, have \nrecognized a limited exception to this requirement. When specifically \nauthorized by the issuing judge or magistrate, the officers may delay \nproviding notice of the search to avoid compromising an ongoing \ninvestigation or for some other good reason. However, this authority \nhas been carefully circumscribed.\n  First, the Second and Ninth Circuit cases have dealt only with \nsituations where the officers search a premises without seizing any \ntangible property. As the Second Circuit explained, such searches are \n``less intrusive than a conventional search with physical seizure \nbecause the latter deprives the owner not only of privacy but also of \nthe use of his property.'' United States v. Villegas, 899 F.2d 1324, \n1337 (2d Cir. 1990).\n  Second, the cases have required that the officers seeking the warrant \nmust show good reason for the delay. Finally, while the courts have \nallowed notice of the search may be delayed, it must be provided within \na reasonable period thereafter, which should generally be no more than \nseven days. The reasons for these careful limitations were spelled out \nsuccinctly by Judge Sneed of the Ninth Circuit: ``The mere thought of \nstrangers walking through and visually examining the center of our \nprivacy interest, our home, arouses our passion for freedom as does \nnothing else. That passion, the true source of the Fourth Amendment, \ndemands that surreptitious entries be closely circumscribed.'' United \nStates v. Freitas, 800 F.2d 1451, 1456 (9th Cir. 1986).\n  The Administration's original proposal would have ignored some of the \nkey limitations created by the case law for sneak and peek search \nwarrants. First, it would have broadly authorized officers not only to \nconduct surreptitious searches, but also to secretly seize any type of \nproperty without any additional showing of necessity. This type of \nwarrant, which has never been addressed by a published decision of a \nFederal appellate court, has been referred to in a law review article \nwritten by an FBI agent as a ``sneak and steal'' warrant. See K. Corr, \n``Sneaky But Lawful: The Use of Sneak and Peek Search Warrants,'' 43 U. \nKan. L. Rev. 1103, 1113 (1995). Second, the proposal would simply have \nadopted the procedural requirements of 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2705 for \nproviding delayed notice of a wiretap. Among other things, this would \nhave extended the permissible period of delay to a maximum of 90 days, \ninstead of the presumptive seven-day period provided by the caselaw on \nsneak and peek warrants.\n\n  I was able to make significant improvements in the Administration's \noriginal proposal that will help to ensure that the government's \nauthority to obtain sneak and peek warrants is not abused. First, the \nprovision that is now in section 213 of the bill prohibits the \ngovernment from seizing any tangible property or any wire or electronic \ncommunication or stored electronic information unless it makes a \nshowing of reasonable necessity for the seizure. Thus, in contrast to \nthe Administration's original proposal, the presumption is that the \nwarrant will authorize only a search unless the government can make a \nspecific showing of additional need for a seizure. Second, the \nprovision now requires that notice be given within a reasonable time of \nthe execution of the warrant rather than giving a blanket authorization \nfor up to a 90-day delay. What constitutes a reasonable time, of \ncourse, will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case. But \nI would expect courts\n\n[[Page S11003]]\n\nto be guided by the teachings of the Second and the Ninth Circuits \nthat, in the ordinary case, a reasonable time is no more than seven \ndays.\n  Several changes in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, \nare designed to clarify technical aspects of the statutory framework \nand take account of experience in practical implementation. These \nchanges are subject to the four-year sunset.\n  The USA Act, in section 207, changes the duration of electronic \nsurveillance under FISA in cases of an agent of a foreign power, other \nthan a United States persons, who acts in the United States as an \nofficer or employee of a foreign power or as a member of an \ninternational terrorist group. Current law limits court orders in these \ncases to 90 days, the same duration as for United States persons. \nExperience indicates, however, that after the initial period has \nconfirmed probable cause that the foreign national meets the statutory \nstandard, court orders are renewed repeatedly and the 90-day renewal \nbecomes an unnecessary procedural for investigators taxed with far more \npressing duties.\n  The Administration proposed that the period of electronic \nsurveillance be changed from 90 days to one year in these cases. This \nproposal did not ensure adequate review after the initial stage to \nensure that the probable cause determination remained justified over \ntime. Therefore, the bill changes the initial period of the \nsurveillance from 90 to 120 days and changes the period for extensions \nfrom 90 days to one year. The initial 120-day period provides for a \nreview of the results of the surveillance or search directed at an \nindividual before one-year extensions are requested. These changes do \nnot affect surveillance of a United States person.\n  The bill also changes the period for execution of an order for \nphysical search under FISA from 45 to 90 days. This change applies to \nUnited States persons as well as foreign nationals. Experience since \nphysical search authority was added to FISA in 1994 indicates that 45 \ndays is frequently not long enough to plan and carry out a covert \nphysical search. There is no change in the restrictions which provide \nthat United States persons may not be the targets of search or \nsurveillance under FISA unless a judge finds probable cause to believe \nthat they are agents of foreign powers who engage in specified \ninternational terrorist, sabotage, or clandestine intelligence \nactivities that may involve a violation of the criminal statutes of the \nUnited States.\n  The bill, in section 208, seeks to ensure that the special court \nestablished under FISA has sufficient judges to handle the workload. \nWhile changing the duration of orders and extensions will reduce the \nnumber of cases in some categories, the bill retains the court's role \nin pen register and trap and trace cases and expands the court's \nresponsibility for issuing orders for records and other tangible items \nneeded for counterintelligence and counter terrorism investigations. \nUpon reviewing the court's requirements, the Administration requested \nan increase in the number of Federal district judges designated for the \ncourt from seven to 11 of whom no less than three shall reside within \n20 miles of the District of Columbia. The latter provision ensures that \nmore than one judge is available to handle cases on short notice and \nreduces the need to invoke the alternative of Attorney General approval \nunder the emergency authorities in FISA.\n  Other changes in FISA and related national security laws are more \ncontroversial. In several areas, the bill reflects a serious effort to \naccommodate the requests for expanded surveillance authority with the \nneed for safeguards against misuse, especially the gathering of \nintelligence about the lawful political or commercial activities of \nAmericans. One of the most difficult issues was whether to eliminate \nthe existing statutory ``agent of a foreign power'' standards for \nsurveillance and investigative techniques that raise important privacy \nconcerns, but not at the level that the Supreme Court has held to \nrequire a court order and a probable cause finding under the Fourth \nAmendment. These include pen register and trap and trace devices, \naccess to business records and other tangible items held by third \nparties, and access to records that have statutory privacy protection. \nThe latter include telephone, bank, and credit records.\n  The ``agent of a foreign power'' standard in existing law was \ndesigned to ensure that the FBI and other intelligence agencies do not \nuse these surveillance and investigative methods to investigate the \nlawful activities of Americans in the name of an undefined authority to \ncollect foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information. The \nlaw has required a showing of reasonable suspicion, less than probable \ncause, to believe that a United States person is an ``agent of a \nforeign power'' engaged in international terrorism or clandestine \nintelligence activities.\n  However, the ``agent of a foreign power'' standard is more stringent \nthan the standard under comparable criminal law enforcement procedures \nwhich require only a showing of relevance to a criminal investigation. \nThe FBI's experience under existing laws since they were enacted at \nvarious time over the past 15 years has been that, in practice, the \nrequirement to show reasonable suspicion that a person is an ``agent of \na foreign power'' has been almost as burdensome as the requirement to \nshow probable cause required by the Fourth Amendment for more intrusive \ntechniques. The FBI has made a clear case that a relevance standard is \nappropriate for counterintelligence and counterterrorism \ninvestigations, as well as for criminal investigations.\n  The challenge, then, was to define those investigations. The \nalternative proposed by the Administration was to cover any \ninvestigation to obtain foreign intelligence information. This was \nextremely broad, because the definition includes any information with \nrespect to a foreign power that relates to, and if concerning a United \nStates person is necessary to, the national defense or the security of \nthe United States or the conduct of the foreign affairs of the \nUnited States. This goes far beyond FBI counterintelligence and \ncounterterrorism requirements. Instead, the bill requires that use of \nthe surveillance technique or access to the records concerning a United \nStates person be relevant to an investigation to protect against \ninternational terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.\n\n  In addition, an investigation of a United States person may not be \nbased solely on activities protected by the First Amendment. This \nframework applies to pen registers and trap and trace under section \n215, access to records and other items under section 215, and the \nnational security authorities for access to telephone, bank, and credit \nrecords. Lawful political dissent and protest by American citizens \nagainst the government may not be the basis for FBI counterintelligence \nand counterterrorism investigations under these provisions.\n  A separate issue for pen registers and trap and trace under FISA is \nwhether the court should have the discretion to make the decision on \nrelevance. The Administration has insisted on a certification process. \nI discussed this issue as it comes up in the criminal procedures for \npen registers and trap and trace under title 18, and my concerns apply \nto the FISA procedures as well.\n  Among the more controversial changes in FISA requested by the \nAdministration was the proposal to allow surveillance and search when \n``a purpose'' is to obtain foreign intelligence information. Current \nlaw requires that the secret procedures and different probable cause \nstandards under FISA be used only if a high-level executive official \ncertifies that ``the purpose'' is to obtain foreign intelligence \nformation. The Administration's aim was to allow FISA surveillance and \nsearch for law enforcement purposes, so long as there was at least some \nelement of a foreign intelligence purpose. This proposal raised \nconstitutional concerns, which were addressed in a legal opinion \nprovided by the Justice Department.\n  The Justice Department opinion did not defend the constitutionality \nof the original proposal. Instead, it addressed a suggestion made by \nSenator Feinstein to the Attorney General at the Judiciary Committee \nhearing to change ``the purpose'' to ``a significant purpose.'' No \nmatter what statutory change is made even the Department concedes that \nthe court may impose a constitutional requirement of ``primary \npurpose'' based on the appellate court decisions upholding FISA against \nconstitutional challenges over the past 20 years.\n\n[[Page S11004]]\n\n  Section 218 of the bill adopts ``significant purpose,'' and it will \nbe up to the courts to determine how far law enforcement agencies may \nuse FISA for criminal investigation and prosecution beyond the scope of \nthe statutory definition of ``foreign intelligence information.''\n  In addition, I proposed and the Administration agreed to an \nadditional provision in Section 505 that clarifies the boundaries for \nconsultation and coordination between officials who conduct FISA search \nand surveillance and Federal law enforcement officials including \nprosecutors. Such consultation and coordination is authorized for the \nenforcement of laws that protect against international terrorism, \nclandestine intelligence activities of foreign agents, and other grave \nforeign threats to the nation. Protection against these foreign-based \nthreats by any lawful means is within the scope of the definition of \n``foreign intelligence information,'' and the use of FISA to gather \nevidence for the enforcement of these laws was contemplated in the \nenactment of FISA. The Justice Department's opinion cites relevant \nlegislative history from the Senate Intelligence Committee's report in \n1978, and there is comparable language in the House report.\n  The Administration initially proposed that the Attorney General be \nauthorized to detain any alien indefinitely upon his certification that \nthe alien met the criteria of the terrorism grounds of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act, or was engaged in any other activity endangering \nthe national security of the United States. Under close questioning by \nboth Senator Kennedy and Senator Specter at the Committee hearing on \nSeptember 25, the Attorney General said that his proposal was intended \nonly to allow the government to hold an alien suspected of terrorist \nactivity while deportation proceedings were ongoing. In response to a \nquestion by Senator Specter, the Attorney General said: ``Our intention \nis to be able to detain individuals who are the subject of deportation \nproceedings on other grounds, to detain them as if they were the \nsubject of deportation proceedings on terrorism.'' The Justice \nDepartment, however, continued to insist on broader authority, \nincluding the power to detain even if the alien was found not to be \ndeportable.\n  I remain concerned about the provision, in section 412, but I believe \nthat we have twice improved it from the original proposal offered by \nthe Administration, first in S. 1510 and second in the bill we pass \ntoday. S. 1510 provided that the Justice Department had to charge an \nalien with an immigration or criminal violation within seven days of \ntaking custody, and that the merits of the Attorney General's \ncertification were subject to judicial review. The bill we vote on \ntoday is further improved. First, if an alien is found not to be \nremovable, he must be released from custody. Second, the Attorney \nGeneral can only delegate the power to certify an alien to the Deputy \nAttorney General, ensuring greater accountability and preventing the \ncertification decision from being made by low-level officials. Third, \nthe Attorney General must review his certification of an alien every \nsix months. Fourth, an alien who is found to be removable but has not \nbeen removed, and whose removal is unlikely in the reasonably \nforeseeable future, may be detained only if the Attorney General \ndemonstrates that release of the alien will adversely affect national \nsecurity or the safety of the community or any person. This improvement \nis essential to preserve the constitutionality of the bill. Fifth, \nhabeas corpus review of detention is made available in the District \nwhere the detention is occurring, instead of only in the District Court \nin the District of Columbia. Despite these improvements, this remains a \nmajor and controversial new power for the Attorney General, and I would \nurge him and his successors to employ great discretion in using it.\n  In addition, the Administration initially proposed a sweeping \ndefinition of terrorist activity and new powers for the Secretary of \nState to designate an organization as a terrorist organization for \npurposes of immigration law. We were able to work with the \nAdministration to refine this definition to limit its application to \nindividuals who had innocent contacts with non-designated \norganizations. We also limited the retroactive effect of these new \ndefinitions. If an alien solicited funds or membership, or provided \nmaterial support for an organization that was not designated at that \ntime by the Secretary of State, the alien will have the opportunity to \nshow that he did not know and should have known that his acts would \nfurther the organization's terrorist activity. This is substantially \nbetter than the administration's proposal, which by its terms, would \nhave empowered the INS to deport someone who raised money for the \nAfrican National Congress in the 1980s.\n  Throughout our negotiations on these issues, Senator Kennedy provided \nsteadfast leadership. Although neither of us are entirely pleased with \nthe final product, it is far better than it would have been without his \nactive involvement.\n  I was disappointed that the Administration's initial proposal \nauthorizing the President to impose unilateral food and medical \nsanctions would have undermined a law we passed last year with \noverwhelming bipartisan support.\n  Under that law, the President already has full authority to impose \nunilateral food and medicine sanctions during this crisis because of \ntwo exceptions built into the law that apply to our current situation. \nNevertheless, the Administration sought to undo this law and obtain \nvirtually unlimited authority in the future to impose food and medicine \nembargoes, without making any effort for a multi-lateral approach in \ncooperation with other nations. Absent such a multi-lateral approach, \nother nations would be free to step in immediately and take over \nbusiness from American firms and farmers that they are unilaterally \nbarred from pursuing.\n  Over 30 farm and export groups, including the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the Grocery Manufacturers of America, the National Farmers \nUnion, and the U.S. Dairy Export Council, wrote to me and explained \nthat the Administration proposal would ``not achieve its intended \npolicy goal.''\n  I worked with Senator Enzi, and other Senators, on substitute \nlanguage to give the Administration the tools it needs in this crisis. \nThis substitute has been carefully crafted to avoid needlessly hurting \nAmerican farmers in the future, yet it will assure that the U.S. can \nengage in effective multilateral sanctions.\n  This bipartisan agreement limits the authority in the bill to \nexisting laws and executive orders, which give the President full \nauthority regarding this conflict, and grants authority for the \nPresident to restrict exports of agricultural products, medicine or \nmedical devices. I continue to agree with then-Senator Ashcroft, who \nargued in 1999 that unilateral U.S. food and medicine sanctions simply \ndo not work when he introduced the ``Food and Medicine for the World \nAct.'' As recently as October 2000, then-Senator Ashcroft pointed out \nhow broad, unilateral embargoes of food or medicine are often \ncounterproductive. Many Republican and Democratic Senators made it \nclear just last year that the U.S. should work with other countries on \nfood and medical sanctions so that the sanctions will be effective in \nhurting our enemies, instead of just hurting the U.S. I am glad that \nwith Senator Enzi's help, we were able to make changes in the trade \nsanctions provision to both protect our farmers and help the President \nduring this crisis.\n  Title III of this bill contains money laundering provisions agreed \nupon by the relevant House and Senate committees. I commend the \nChairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Sarbanes, for working \nwith the House to produce a balanced and effective package of measures \nto combat international money laundering and the financing of \nterrorism.\n  The Senate included money laundering provisions in the original USA \nAct, but those provisions were removed from the bill the House passed \nthe following day. Instead, the House passed a separate money \nlaundering bill, H.R. 3004, on October 17. House and Senate negotiators \nthen met to resolve the differences between the bills and produce the \nlanguage contained in the bill the Senate considers today.\n  I am very pleased that the House has agreed to include money \nlaundering provisions in anti-terrorism legislation. Preventing money \nlaundering is a\n\n[[Page S11005]]\n\ncrucial part of our efforts to defeat terrorism, and it was important \nfor Congress to develop a bipartisan approach to strengthening our \nlaws. This bill contains such an approach.\n  I am also pleased that a number of provisions that would have \nundermined the Civil Asset Forfeiture Act of 2000, which I sponsored in \nthe Senate, have been removed. In addition, this bill does not include \nlanguage that would have unduly expanded administrative subpoena powers \nin all money laundering cases. A more targeted approach was necessary, \nand has been produced.\n  This measure could not be considered today and would not be in the \nimproved condition it is without the steadfast commitment of our \nMajority Leader. Senator Daschle deserves all the credit for all that \nis good in this bill. Without his commitment and focus, we simply would \nnot be in the position to pass this bill today.\n  On my behalf and more importantly on behalf of the American people, I \nwant to publicly acknowledge his vital role in this legislation.\n  I have done my best under the circumstances and want to thank \nespecially Senator Kennedy for his leadership on the Immigration parts \nof the bill. My efforts have not been completely successful and there \nare a number of provisions on which the Administration has insisted \nwith which I disagree. Frankly, the agreement of September 30, 2001 on \nthe sharing of criminal justice information would have led to a better \nbalanced bill. I could not stop the Administration from reneging on the \nagreement any more than I could have sped the process to reconstitute \nthis bill in the aftermath of those breaches. In these times we need to \nwork together to face the challenges of international terrorism. I have \nsought to do so in good faith.\n  We have worked around the clock for the past month to put forward the \nbest legislative package we could. While I share the administration's \ngoal of promptly providing the tools necessary to deal with the current \nterrorist threat, I feel strongly that our responsibilities include \nequipping such tools with safety features to ensure that these tools do \nnot cause harm and are not misused.\n  I want to conclude my remarks with thanks for the efforts of many \nstaff members who have worked tirelessly under unusual and enormously \ninconvenient circumstances to help us craft the legislation before us \ntoday. In particular, I want to thank Mark Childress and Andrea LaRue \non the staff of Majority Leader Daschle, and David Hoppe on the staff \nof Republican Leader Lott. I would also like to thank Makan Delrahim, \nJeff Taylor, Stuart Nash, and Leah Belaire with Senator Hatch, the \nRanking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Melody Barnes and Esther \nOlavarria with Senator Kennedy, Neil McBride and Eric Rosen with \nSenator Biden, Bob Schiff with Senator Feingold, and Stacy Baird and \nBeth Stein with Senator Cantwell. Finally, I would like to thank my own \nJudiciary Committee staff, especially Bruce Cohen, Beryl Howell, Julie \nKatzman, Ed Pagano, John Elliff, David James, Ed Barron, Tim Lynch, \nSusan Davies, Manu Bhardwaj, Liz McMahon, and Tara Magner.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools \nRequired To Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA Patriot) Act of 2001, \n                 H.R. 3162--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Sec. 1. Short title and table of contents. Both S. 1510 \n     passed by the Senate on October 11, 2001 (the ``Senate \n     bill''), and H.R. 2975 passed by the House of Representatives \n     on October 12, 2001, included this section containing the \n     short title ``Uniting and Strengthening America (USA) Act of \n     2001'' and the table of contents for the Act. H.R. 3162, the \n     bill subsequently passed by the House on October 24, 2001 \n     (the ``House bill''), changed the title to the ``Uniting and \n     Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required \n     to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of \n     2001.''\n       Sec. 2. Construction; severability. Both the House and \n     Senate bills included this rule of construction to provide \n     that any portion of this Act found to be invalid or \n     unenforceable by its terms, or as applied to any person or \n     circumstance, shall be construed to give it the maximum \n     effect permitted by law and that any portion found invalid or \n     unenforceable in its entirety shall be severable from the \n     rest of the Act.\n\n\n         title i--enhancing domestic security against terrorism\n\n       Sec. 101. Counterterrorism fund. Both the House and Senate \n     bills included this provision to establish a counterterrorism \n     fund in the Treasury of the United States, without affecting \n     prior appropriations, to reimburse Department of Justice \n     components for costs incurred in connection with terrorism \n     and terrorism prevention, rebuild any Justice Department \n     component damaged or destroyed as a result of a terrorism \n     incident, pay terrorism-related rewards, conduct terrorism \n     threat assessments, and reimburse Federal agencies for costs \n     incurred in connection with detaining suspected terrorists in \n     foreign countries. Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 102. Sense of Congress condemning discrimination \n     against Arab and Muslim Americans. Both the House and Senate \n     bills included this provision to condemn acts of violence and \n     discrimination against Arab Americans, American Muslims, and \n     Americans from South Asia, and to declare that every effort \n     must be taken to protect their safety. Not in original \n     Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 103. Increased funding for the technical support \n     center at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Both the House \n     and Senate bills included this provision to \n     authorize $200,000,000 per year for fiscal years 2002, \n     2003 and 2004 for the Technical Support Center established \n     in section 811 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \n     Penalty Act of 1996 to help meet the demands of activities \n     to combat terrorism and enhance the technical support and \n     tactical operations of the FBI. Not in original \n     Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 104. Requests for Military Assistance to Enforce \n     Prohibition in Certain Emergencies. Both the House and Senate \n     bills included this provision to authorize the Attorney \n     General to request military assistance in support of \n     Department of Justice activities relating to the enforcement \n     of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332a during an emergency situation \n     involving a weapon of mass destruction. Current law \n     references a statute that was repealed in 1998, relating to \n     chemical weapons. Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 105. Expansion of National Electronic Crime Task Force \n     Initiative. Both the House and Senate bills included this \n     provision to allow the Secret Service to develop a national \n     network of electronic crime task forces, based on the highly \n     successful New York Electronic Crimes Task Force model, for \n     the purpose of preventing, detecting, and investigating \n     various forms of electronic crimes, including potential \n     terrorist attacks against critical infrastructure and \n     financial payment systems. Not in original Administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 106. Presidential authority. Both the House and Senate \n     bills included this provision to give to the President, in \n     limited circumstances involving armed hostilities or attacks \n     against the United States, the power to confiscate and vest \n     in the United States the property of enemies of the United \n     States during times of national emergency, which was \n     permitted by the Trading with the Enemy Act, 50 app. U.S.C. \n     Sec. 5(b), until 1977, when the International Economic \n     Emergency Act was passed. The new provision permits the \n     President, when the United States is engaged in military \n     hostilities or has been subject to attack, to confiscate \n     property of any foreign country, person or organization \n     involved in hostilities or attacks on the United States. This \n     section also permits courts, when reviewing determinations \n     made by the executive branch, to consider classified evidence \n     ex parte and in camera. Same as original Administration \n     proposal.\n\n\n               TITLE II--ENHANCED SURVEILLANCE PROCEDURES\n\n       [Note: Elimination of original Administration proposal to \n     allow government use of wiretap information on U.S. citizens \n     obtained illegally overseas in violation of the Fourth \n     Amendment and of foreign government laws.]\n       Sec. 201. Authority to intercept wire, oral, and electronic \n     communications relating to terrorism. Both the House and \n     Senate bills included this provision to add criminal \n     violations relating to terrorism to the list of predicate \n     statutes in the criminal procedures for interception of \n     communications under chapter 119 of title 18, United States \n     Code. Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 202. Authority to intercept wire, oral, and electronic \n     communications relating to computer fraud and abuse offenses. \n     Both the House and Senate bills included this provision to \n     add criminal violations relating to computer fraud and abuse \n     to the list of predicate statutes in the criminal procedures \n     for interception of communications under chapter 119 of title \n     18, United States Code. Not in original Administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 203. Authority to share criminal investigative \n     information. Both the House and Senate bills included \n     provisions amending the criminal procedures for interception \n     of communications under chapter 119 of title 18, United \n     States Code, and the grand jury procedures under Rule 6(e) of \n     the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures to authorize \n     disclosure of foreign intelligence information obtained by \n     such interception or by a grand jury to any Federal law \n     enforcement, intelligence, national security, national \n     defense, protective or immigration personnel to assist the \n     official receiving that information in\n\n[[Page S11006]]\n\n     the performance of his official duties. Section 203(a) \n     requires that within a reasonable time after disclosure of \n     any grand jury information, an attorney for the government \n     notify the court of such disclosure and the departments, \n     agencies or entities to which disclosure was made. Section \n     203(b) pertains to foreign intelligence information obtained \n     by intercepting communications pursuant to a court-ordered \n     wiretap. Section 203(c) also authorizes such disclosure of \n     information obtained as part of a criminal investigation \n     notwithstanding any other law.\n       The information must meet statutory definitions of foreign \n     intelligence or counterintelligence or foreign intelligence \n     information. Recipients may use that information only as \n     necessary for their official duties, and use of the \n     information outside those limits remains subject to \n     applicable penalties, such as penalties for unauthorized \n     disclosure under chapter 119, contempt penalties under Rule \n     6(e) and the Privacy Act. The Attorney General must establish \n     procedures for disclosure of information that identifies a \n     United States person, such as the current procedures \n     established under Executive Order 12333 for the intelligence \n     community. Modified Administration proposal to limit scope of \n     personnel eligible to receive information. In case of grand \n     jury information, limited proposal to require notification to \n     court after disclosure.\n       Sec. 204. Clarification of intelligence exceptions from \n     limitations on interception and disclosure of wire, oral, and \n     electronic communications. Both the House and Senate bills \n     included this provision to amend the criminal procedures for \n     interception of wire, oral, and electronic communications in \n     title 18, United States Code, to make clear that these \n     procedures do not apply to the collection of foreign \n     intelligence information under the statutory foreign \n     intelligence authorities. Not in original Administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 205. Employment of translators by the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation. Both the House and Senate bills included \n     this provision to authorize the FBI Director to expedite the \n     employment of personnel as translators to support \n     counterterrorism investigations and operations without regard \n     to applicable Federal personnel requirements and limitations. \n     Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 206. Roving surveillance authority under the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. Both the House and \n     Senate bills included this provision to modify the Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (``FISA'') to allow \n     surveillance to follow a person who uses multiple \n     communications devices or locations, a modification which \n     conforms FISA to the parallel criminal procedure for \n     electronic surveillance in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2518(11)(b). The \n     court order need not specify the person whose assistance to \n     the surveillance is required (such as a particular \n     communications common carrier), where the court finds that \n     the actions of the target may have the effect of thwarting \n     the identification of a specified person. Same as original \n     Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 207. Duration of FISA surveillance of non-United \n     States persons who are agents of foreign power. Both the \n     House and Senate bills included this provision to change the \n     initial period of a FISA order for a surveillance or physical \n     search targeted against an agent of a foreign power from 90 \n     to 120 days, and changes the period for extensions from 90 \n     days to one year. One-year extensions for physical searches \n     are subject to the requirement in current law that the judge \n     find ``probable cause to believe that no property of any \n     United States person will be acquired during the period.'' \n     Section 207 also changes the ordinary period for physical \n     searches under FISA from 45 to 90 days. Narrower than \n     Administration proposal which sought to eliminate the initial \n     90-day limitation and authorize surveillance for up to one \n     year from the outset.\n       Sec. 208. Designation of judges. Both the House and Senate \n     bills included this provision to increase the number of \n     Federal district judges designated to serve on the FISA court \n     from seven to 11, and requires that no less that 3 of the \n     judges reside within 20 miles of the District of Columbia. \n     Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 209. Seizure of voice-mail messages pursuant to \n     warrants. Both the House and Senate bills included this \n     provision to authorize government access to voice mails with \n     a court order supported by probable cause in the same way e-\n     mails currently may be accessed, and authorizes nationwide \n     service with a single search warrant for voice mails. Current \n     law, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(1), defines ``wire communication'' \n     to include ``any electronic storage of such communication,'' \n     with the result that the government must apply for a Title \n     III wiretap order before it may obtain unopened voice mail \n     messages held by a service provider. This section amends the \n     definition of ``wire communication'' so that it no longer \n     includes stored communications. It also amends 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2703 to specify that the government may use a search \n     warrant (instead of a wiretap order) to compel the production \n     of unopened voicemail, thus harmonizing the rules applicable \n     to stored voice and non-voice (e.g., e-mail) communications. \n     Same as Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 210. Scope of subpoenas for records of electronic \n     communications. Both the House and Senate bills included this \n     provision to broaden the types of records that law \n     enforcement may obtain, pursuant to a subpoena, from \n     electronic communications service providers by requiring \n     providers to disclose the means and source of payment, \n     including any bank account or credit card numbers. Current \n     law allows the government to use a subpoena to compel \n     communications providers to disclose a small class of records \n     that pertain to electronic communications, limited to such \n     records as the customer's name, address, and length of \n     service. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703(c)(1)(C). Investigators may not \n     use a subpoena to obtain such records as credit card number \n     or other form of payment and must use a court order. In many \n     cases, users register with Internet service providers using \n     false names, making the form of payment critical to \n     determining the user's true identity. Same as original \n     Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 211. Clarification of scope. Both the House and Senate \n     bills included provisions to amend the Cable Communications \n     Policy Act to clarify that when a cable company acts as a \n     telephone company or an Internet service provider, it must \n     comply with the same laws governing the interception and \n     disclosure of wire and electronic communications that apply \n     to any other telephone company or Internet service provider. \n     This section also expressly provides, however, that \n     authorized disclosures under this provision do not include \n     records that reveal customer cable viewing activity. Modified \n     original Administration proposal to specify that targets do \n     not receive advance notice of wiretap order and amends \n     title 47 to accomplish same purpose as administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 212. Emergency disclosure of electronic communications \n     to protect life and limb. Both the House and Senate bills \n     included this provision to amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2702 to \n     authorize providers of electronic communications services to \n     disclose the communications (or records of such \n     communications) of their subscribers if the provider \n     reasonably believes that an emergency involving immediate \n     danger of death or serious physical injury to any person \n     requires the disclosure of the information without delay. \n     This section also corrects an anomaly in the current law by \n     clearly permitting a provider to disclose non-content records \n     (such as a subscriber's log-in records) as well as the \n     contents of the customer's communications to protect their \n     computer systems. Same as original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 213. Authority for delaying notice of the execution of \n     a warrant. Both the House and Senate bills included this \n     provision to amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3103a to authorize a court \n     to issue a search warrant in which the government is \n     permitted to delay providing notice of the warrant's \n     execution. Consistent with the requirements of case law from \n     the Second and Ninth Circuits, this section also provides \n     several limitations on this authority. See United States v. \n     Villegas, 899 F.2d 1324 (2d Cir. 1990); United States v. \n     Freitas, 800 F.2d 1451 (9th Cir. 1986). First, delayed notice \n     is authorized only in cases where the government has \n     demonstrated reasonable cause to believe that providing \n     immediate notice would have an adverse result as defined in \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 2705. Second, the provision prohibits the \n     government from seizing any tangible property or any wire or \n     electronic communication or stored wire or electronic \n     communication unless it makes a showing of reasonable \n     necessity for the seizure. Third, the warrant must require \n     the giving of notice within a reasonable time of the \n     execution of the search. Narrower than original \n     Administration proposal, which would have permitted delay as \n     law enforcement saw fit.\n       Sec. 214. Pen register and trap and trace authority under \n     FISA. Both the House and Senate bills included this provision \n     to modify FISA provisions for pen register and trap and trace \n     to eliminate the requirement to show to the court that the \n     target is in contact with an ``agent of a foreign power.'' It \n     replaces this requirement with a determination that the pen \n     register or trap and trace is relevant to an investigation to \n     protect against international terrorism or clandestine \n     intelligence activities or to obtain foreign intelligence \n     information not concerning U.S. persons. Any investigation of \n     a United States person may not be based solely on activities \n     protected by the First Amendment. Narrower than original \n     Administration proposal, which would simply have removed \n     the ``agent of a foreign power'' requirement.\n       Sec. 215. Access to records and other items under the FISA. \n     Both the House and Senate bills included this provision to \n     remove the ``agent of a foreign power'' standard for court-\n     ordered access to certain business records under FISA and \n     expands the scope of court orders to include access to other \n     records and tangible items. The authority may be used for an \n     investigation to protect against international terrorism or \n     clandestine intelligence activities or to obtain foreign \n     intelligence information not concerning U.S. persons. An \n     investigation of a United States person may not be based \n     solely on activities protected by the First Amendment. \n     Narrower than original Administration proposal, which would \n     have removed requirements of court order and the ``agent of a \n     foreign power'' showing.\n       Sec. 216. Modification of authorities relating to use of \n     pen registers and trap and trace devices. Both the House and \n     Senate bills included this provision to authorize courts to \n     grant pen register and trap and trace orders that are valid \n     anywhere in the nation. It also ensures that the pen register \n     and trap and trace provisions apply to facilities other than \n     telephone lines (e.g., the Internet). It specifically \n     provides, however, that the grant of authority to capture \n     ``routing'' and\n\n[[Page S11007]]\n\n     ``addressing'' information for Internet users does not \n     authorize the interception of the content of any such \n     communications. It further requires the government to use the \n     latest available technology to insure that a pen register or \n     trap and trace device does not intercept the content of any \n     communications. Finally, it provides for a report to the \n     court on each use of ``Carnivore''-like devices on packet-\n     switched data networks. Makes a number of improvements over \n     Administration proposal, including exclusion of content, \n     exclusion of ISP liability, and Carnivore report.\n       Sec. 217. Interception of computer trespasser \n     communications. Both the House and Senate bills included this \n     provision to allow computer service providers who are victims \n     of attacks by computer trespassers to authorize persons \n     acting under color of law to monitor trespassers on their \n     computer systems in a narrow class of cases. A computer \n     trespasser is defined as a person who accesses a protected \n     computer without authorization and thus has no reasonable \n     expectation of privacy in any communications transmitted to, \n     through, or from the protected computer. However, it does not \n     include a person known by the owner or operator of the \n     protected computer to have an existing contractual \n     relationship with the owner or operator for access to all or \n     part of the protected computer. Narrower than original \n     Administration proposal, which did not exclude service \n     provider subscribers from definition of trespasser and did \n     not limit interception authority to only those \n     communications through the computer in question.\n       Sec. 218. Foreign intelligence information. Both the House \n     and Senate bills included this provision to amend FISA to \n     require a certification that ``a significant purpose'' rather \n     than ``the purpose'' of a surveillance or search under FISA \n     is to obtain foreign intelligence information. Narrower than \n     Administration proposal, which would have allowed FISA \n     surveillance if intelligence gathering was merely ``a'' \n     purpose.\n       Sec. 219. Single-jurisdiction search warrants for \n     terrorism. Both the House and Senate bills included this \n     provision to amend Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(a) \n     to provide that warrants relating to the investigation of \n     terrorist activities may be obtained in any district in which \n     the activities related to the terrorism may have occurred, \n     regardless of where the warrants will be executed. Same as \n     Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 220. Nationwide service of search warrants for \n     electronic surveillance. Both the House and Senate bills \n     included this provision to amend 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2703(a) to \n     authorize courts with jurisdiction over the offense to issue \n     search warrants for electronic communications in electronic \n     storage anywhere in the United States, without requiring the \n     intervention of their counterparts in the districts where \n     Internet service providers are located. Narrower than \n     Administration proposal in that it limits forum shopping \n     problem by limiting to courts with jurisdiction over the \n     offense.\n       Sec. 221. Trade sanctions. Both the House and Senate bills \n     included this provision to authorize the President \n     unilaterally to restrict exports of agricultural products, \n     medicine or medical devices to the Taliban or the territory \n     of Afghanistan controlled by the Taliban. Narrower than \n     original Administration proposal which would have undermined \n     the congressional approval requirement, conferring upon the \n     President control of agricultural and medical exports ``to \n     all designated terrorists and narcotics entities wherever \n     they are located.''\n       Sec. 222. Assistance to law enforcement agencies. Both the \n     House and Senate bills included this provision that this Act \n     does not impose any additional technical requirements on a \n     provider of a wire or electronic communication service and \n     that a provider of a wire or electronic communication \n     service, landlord, custodian or other person who furnishes \n     facilities or technical assistance pursuant to section 216 \n     shall be reasonably compensated for expenditures incurred in \n     providing such facilities or assistance. Not in original \n     Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 223. Civil liability for certain unauthorized \n     disclosures. H.R. 2975 included this provision to create \n     civil liability for violations, including unauthorized \n     disclosures, by law enforcement authorities of the electronic \n     surveillance procedures set forth in title 18, United States \n     Code (e.g., unauthorized disclosure of pen trap, wiretap, \n     stored communications), or FISA information. Also requires \n     administrative discipline of officials who engage in such \n     unauthorized disclosures. Not in original Administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 224. Sunset. H.R. 2975 included a provision to sunset \n     certain amendments made by this title in 3 to 5 years. H.R. \n     3162 provides a 4-year sunset for sections 206, 201, 202, \n     203(b), 204, 206, 207, 209, 210, 212, 214, 215, 217, 218, \n     220, 223--at the end December 31, 2005, with the authorities \n     ``grandfathered'' as to particular investigations based on \n     offenses occurring prior to sunset. No sunset provided in \n     original Administration proposal or S. 1510, and four-year \n     sunset shorter than the five-year sunset in H.R. 2975.\n\n\nTitle III--INTERNATIONAL MONEY LAUNDERING ABATEMENT AND ANTI-TERRORIST \n                         FINANCING ACT OF 2001\n\n       [Note: Elimination of original Administration proposals to \n     allow broad disclosure of individual tax return information; \n     pre-trial restraint of legitimately obtained property in all \n     criminal forfeiture cases; carve-out of tobacco companies \n     from RICO liability for foreign excise taxes; and creation of \n     new criminal offense to misrepresent identification when \n     opening bank account. The Administration bill contained none \n     of the money laundering provisions contained in either the \n     Senate bill or H.R. 3004.]\n       Sec. 301. Short title. This section contains the short \n     title of Title III, ``International Money Laundering \n     Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001,'' which \n     merges the short title of Title III of the Senate bill with \n     the short title of H.R. 3004, which passed the House of \n     Representatives on October 17, 2001 (``H.R. 3004''). This \n     section also contains the table of contents for Title III.\n       Sec. 302. Findings and purposes. The Senate bill included \n     this provision, which states the legislative findings and \n     purposes in support of Title III.\n       Sec. 303. 4-Year congressional review; expedited \n     consideration. Section 303, included in the Senate bill, \n     provides that the provisions added and amendments made by \n     Title III will terminate after September 30, 2004, if the \n     Congress enacts a joint resolution to that effect, and that \n     any such joint resolution will be given expedited \n     consideration by the Congress.\n\nSubtitle A--International Counter-Money Laundering and Related Measures\n\n       Sec. 311. Special measures for jurisdictions, financial \n     institutions, or international transactions or accounts of \n     primary money laundering concern. Section 311, included in \n     both the Senate bill and H.R. 3004, adds a new section 5318A \n     to the Bank Secrecy Act, to give the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, in consultation with other senior government \n     officials, authority (in the Secretary's discretion), to \n     impose one or more of five new ``special measures'' against \n     foreign jurisdictions, foreign financial institutions, \n     transactions involving such jurisdictions or institutions, or \n     one more types of accounts, that the Secretary, after \n     consultation with Secretary of State and the Attorney \n     General, determines to pose a ``primary money laundering \n     concern'' to the United States. The special measures include: \n     (1) requiring additional recordkeeping or reporting for \n     particular transactions; (2) requiring the identification of \n     the foreign beneficial owners of certain accounts at a U.S. \n     financial institution; (3) requiring the identification of \n     customers of a foreign bank who use an interbank payable-\n     through account opened by that foreign bank at a U.S. bank; \n     (4) requiring the identification of customers of a foreign \n     bank who use an interbank correspondent account opened by \n     that foreign bank at a U.S. bank; and (5) after consultation \n     with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the \n     Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, restricting or \n     prohibiting the opening or maintaining of certain interbank \n     correspondent or payable-through accounts. Measures (1) \n     through (4) may not be imposed for more than 120 days except \n     by regulation, and measure (5) may only be imposed by \n     regulation.\n       Sec. 312. Special due diligence for correspondent accounts \n     and private banking accounts. Section 312, included in both \n     the Senate bill and H.R. 3004, adds a new subsection (i) to \n     31 U.S.C. Sec. 5318, to require a U.S. financial institution \n     that maintains a correspondent account or private banking \n     account for a non-United States person to establish \n     appropriate and, if necessary, enhanced due diligence \n     procedures to detect and report instances of money \n     laundering. The new provision also creates minimum anti-money \n     laundering due diligence standards for U.S. financial \n     institutions that enter into correspondent banking \n     relationships with banks that operate under offshore banking \n     licenses or under banking licenses issued by countries that \n     (1) have been designated as noncooperative with international \n     counter money laundering principles by an international body \n     with the concurrence of the U.S. representative to that body, \n     or (2) have been the subject of special measures authorized \n     by section 311. Finally, the new provision creates minimum \n     anti-money laundering due diligence standards for \n     maintenance of private banking accounts by U.S. financial \n     institutions. New section 31 U.S.C Sec. 5318(i) will take \n     effect 270 days after the date of enactment; the Secretary \n     of the Treasury is required to issue regulations (in \n     consultation with the appropriate Federal functional \n     regulators) within 180 days of enactment further \n     delineating the requirements of the new subsection, but \n     the statute is to take effect whether or not such \n     regulations are issued, and failure to issue final \n     regulations shall in no way affect the enforceability of \n     Sec. 5318(i) as added by section 312.\n       Sec. 313. Prohibition on United States correspondent \n     accounts with foreign shell banks. Section 313, included in \n     both the Senate bill and H.R. 3004, adds a new subsection (j) \n     to 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5318, to bar depository institutions and \n     brokers and dealers in securities operating in the United \n     States from establishing, maintaining, administering, or \n     managing correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks, \n     other than shell bank vehicles affiliated with recognized and \n     regulated depository institutions. The new 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 5318(j) takes effect 60 days after enactment. The House \n     receded to the Senate with respect to differences in the \n     language of the versions of the provision in the Senate bill \n     and H.R. 3004.\n       Sec. 314. Cooperative efforts to deter money laundering. \n     Section 314, contained in the Senate bill, requires the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations, within 120 \n     days of the date of enactment, to encourage\n\n[[Page S11008]]\n\n     cooperation among financial institutions, financial \n     regulators and law enforcement officials, and to permit the \n     sharing of information by law enforcement and regulatory \n     authorities with such institutions regarding persons \n     reasonably suspected, based on credible evidence, of engaging \n     in terrorist acts or money laundering activities. This \n     section also allows (with notice to the Secretary of the \n     Treasury) the sharing of information among banks involving \n     possible terrorist or money laundering activity, and requires \n     the Secretary of the Treasury to publish, at least \n     semiannually, a report containing a detailed analysis of \n     patterns of suspicious activity and other appropriate \n     investigative insights derived from suspicious activity \n     reports and law enforcement investigations. The final text of \n     this section includes section 203 (Reports to the Financial \n     Services Industry on Suspicious Financial Activities) and \n     portions of section 205 (Public-Private Task Force on \n     Terrorist Financing Issues) of H.R. 3004.\n       Sec. 315. Inclusion of foreign corruption offenses as money \n     laundering crimes. Section 315, included in both the Senate \n     bill and H.R. 3004 in somewhat different language, amends 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1956 to include foreign corruption offenses, \n     certain U.S. export control violations, certain customs and \n     firearm offenses, certain computer fraud offenses, and \n     felony violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act \n     of 1938, to the list of crimes that constitute ``specified \n     unlawful activities'' for purposes of the criminal money \n     laundering provisions.\n       Sec. 316. Anti-terrorist forfeiture protection. Section \n     316, included in the Senate bill, establishes procedures to \n     protect the rights of persons whose property may be subject \n     to confiscation in the exercise of the government's anti-\n     terrorism authority.\n       Sec. 317. Long-arm jurisdiction over foreign money \n     launderers. Section 317, which was included in both the \n     Senate bill and H.R. 3004, amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956 to give \n     United States courts ``long-arm'' jurisdiction over foreign \n     persons committing money laundering offenses in the United \n     States, over foreign banks opening U.S. bank accounts, and \n     over foreign persons who convert assets ordered forfeited by \n     a U.S. court. It also permits a Federal court dealing with \n     such foreign persons to issue a pre-trial restraining order \n     or take other action necessary to preserve property in the \n     United States to satisfy an ultimate judgment. The Senate, \n     but not the House, bill included language permitting the \n     appointment by a Federal court of a receiver to collect and \n     take custody of assets of a defendant to satisfy criminal or \n     civil money laundering or forfeiture judgments; with respect \n     to the latter provision, the House receded to the Senate.\n       Sec. 318. Laundering money through a foreign bank. Section \n     318, included in both the Senate bill and H.R. 3004, expands \n     the definition of financial institution for purposes of 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1956 and 1957 to include banks operating \n     outside of the United States.\n       Sec. 319. Forfeiture of funds in United States interbank \n     accounts. Section 319 combines sections 111, 112, and 113 of \n     H.R. 3004 with section 319 of the Senate bill. This section \n     amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 981 to treat amounts deposited by \n     foreign banks in interbank accounts with U.S. banks as having \n     been deposited in the United States for purposes of the \n     forfeiture rules, but grants the Attorney General authority, \n     in the interest of justice and consistent with the United \n     States' national interest, to suspend a forfeiture \n     proceeding, based on that presumption. This section also adds \n     a new subsection (k) to 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5318 to require U.S. \n     financial institutions to reply to a request for information \n     from a U.S. regulator relating to anti-money laundering \n     compliance within 120 hours of receipt of such a request, and \n     to require foreign banks that maintain correspondent accounts \n     in the United States to appoint agents for service of process \n     within the United States. The new 31 U.S.C. 5318(k) \n     authorizes the Attorney General and the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to issue a summons or subpoena to any such foreign \n     bank seeking records, wherever located, relating to such a \n     correspondent account, and it requires U.S. banks to sever \n     correspondent arrangements with foreign banks that do not \n     either comply with or contest any such summons or \n     subpoena. Finally, section 319 amends section 413 of the \n     Controlled Substances Act to authorize United States \n     courts to order a convicted criminal to return property \n     located abroad and to order a civil forfeiture defendant \n     to return property located abroad pending trial on the \n     merits. With respect to the provisions requiring a \n     response to certain requests for information by U.S. \n     regulators within 120 hours of receipt and the requirement \n     that correspondent relationships with foreign banks that \n     do not either respond or challenge subpoenas issued under \n     new 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5318(k) must be terminated, the House \n     receded to the Senate. With respect to the power to order \n     convicted criminals to return property located abroad, the \n     Senate receded to the House.\n       Sec. 320. Proceeds of foreign crimes. Section 320, included \n     in both the Senate bill and H.R. 3004, amends 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 981 to permit the United States to institute forfeiture \n     proceedings against the proceeds of foreign criminal offenses \n     found in the United States.\n       Sec. 321. Financial institutions specified in subchapter II \n     of chapter 53 of Title 31, United States Code. Section 321, \n     included in H.R. 3004, amends 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5312(2) to add \n     credit unions, futures commission merchants, commodity \n     trading advisors, or commodity pool operators to the \n     definition of financial institution for purposes of the Bank \n     Secrecy Act, and to provide that the term ``Federal \n     functional regulator'' includes the Commodity Futures Trading \n     Commission for purposes of the Bank Secrecy Act.\n       Sec. 322. Corporation represented by a fugitive. Section \n     322, included in both the Senate bill and H.R. 3004, extends \n     the prohibition against the maintenance of a forfeiture \n     proceeding on behalf of a fugitive to include a proceeding by \n     a corporation whose majority shareholder is a fugitive and a \n     proceeding in which the corporation's claim is instituted by \n     a fugitive.\n       Sec. 323. Enforcement of foreign judgments. Section 323, \n     included in both the Senate bill and H.R. 3004, permits the \n     government to seek a restraining order to preserve the \n     availability of property subject to a foreign forfeiture or \n     confiscation judgment.\n       Sec. 324. Report and recommendation. Section 324, included \n     in the Senate bill, directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the Attorney General, the Federal banking \n     agencies, the SEC, and other appropriate agencies to evaluate \n     operation of the provisions of subtitle A of Title III of the \n     Act and recommend to Congress any relevant legislative \n     action, within 30 months of the date of enactment.\n       Sec. 325. Concentration accounts at financial institutions. \n     Section 325, included in both the Senate bill and H.R. 3004, \n     authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations \n     concerning the maintenance of concentration accounts by U.S. \n     depository institutions, to prevent an institution's \n     customers from anonymously directing funds into or through \n     such accounts.\n       Sec. 326. Verification of identification. Section 326(a), \n     included in H.R. 3004, adds a new subsection (l) to 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 5318 to require the Secretary of the Treasury to \n     prescribe by regulation, jointly with each Federal functional \n     regulator, minimum standards for financial institutions and \n     their customers regarding the identity of the customer that \n     shall apply in connection with the opening of an account at a \n     financial institution; the minimum standards shall require \n     financial institutions to implement, and customers (after \n     being given adequate notice) to comply with, reasonable \n     procedures concerning verification of customer identity, \n     maintenance of records of identity verification, and \n     consultation at account opening of lists of known or \n     suspected terrorists provided to the financial institution by \n     a government agency. The required regulations are to be \n     issued within one year of the date of enactment.\n       Section 326(b), included in both the Senate bill and H.R. \n     3004, requires the Secretary of the Treasury, again in \n     consultation with the Federal functional regulators (as well \n     as other appropriate agencies), to submit a report to \n     Congress within six months of the date of enactment \n     containing recommendations about the most effective way to \n     require foreign nationals to provide financial institutions \n     in the United States with accurate identity information, \n     comparable to that required to be provided by U.S. nationals, \n     and to obtain an identification number that would function \n     similarly to a U.S. national's tax identification number.\n       Sec. 327. Consideration of anti-money laundering record. \n     Section 327, included in H.R. 3004, amends section 3(c) of \n     the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, and section 18(c) of \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require the Federal \n     Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, \n     respectively, to consider the effectiveness of a bank holding \n     company or bank (within the jurisdiction of the appropriate \n     agency) in combating money laundering activities, including \n     in overseas branches, in ruling on any merger or similar \n     application by the bank or bank holding company. The Senate \n     receded to the House, with the agreement that the amendments \n     will apply only to applications submitted after December 31, \n     2001.\n       Sec. 328. International cooperation on identification of \n     originators of wire transfers. Section 328, included in H.R. \n     3004, requires the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \n     with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to take \n     all reasonable steps to encourage foreign governments to \n     require the inclusion of the name of the originator in wire \n     transfer instructions sent to the United States, and to \n     report annually to the House Committee on Financial Services \n     and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs concerning progress toward that goal.\n       Sec. 329. Criminal penalties.

International cooperation in investigations of \n     money laundering, financial crimes, and the finances of \n     terrorist groups. Section 330, included in H.R. 3004, states \n     the sense of the Congress that the President should direct \n     the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, or the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, as appropriate and in consultation \n     with the Federal Reserve Board, to seek negotiations with \n     foreign financial supervisory agencies and other foreign \n     officials, to ensure that foreign financial institutions \n     maintain adequate records relating to any foreign terrorist \n     organization or its membership, or any person engaged in \n     money laundering or other financial crimes, and make such \n     records available to U.S. law enforcement and financial \n     supervisory personnel when appropriate.\n\n[[Page S11009]]\n\n    Subtitle B--Bank Secrecy Act Amendments and Related Improvements\n\n       Sec. 351. Amendments relating to reporting of suspicious \n     activities. Section 351, included in both the Senate bill and \n     H.R. 3004, restates 31 U.S.C.

The amendments to subsection (g)(3) \n     also create a safe harbor from civil liability for banks that \n     provide information in employment references sought by other \n     banks pursuant to the amendment to the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Act made by section 355. The House receded to the \n     Senate with respect to minor differences in wording between \n     the House and Senate versions of the provision.\n       Sec. 352. Anti-money laundering programs. Section 352, \n     included in both the Senate bill and H.R. 3004, amends 31 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 5318(h) to require financial institutions to \n     establish anti-money laundering programs and grants the \n     Secretary of the Treasury authority to set minimum standards \n     for such programs. The Senate recedes to the House with \n     respect to a provision in H.R. 3004 that the anti-money \n     laundering program requirement take effect at the end of \n     the 180-day period beginning on the date of enactment of \n     the Act and a related provision that the Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall prescribe regulations before the end of \n     that 180-day period that consider the extent to which the \n     requirements imposed under amended Sec. 5318(h) are \n     commensurate with the size, location, and activities of \n     the financial institutions to which the regulations apply.\n       Sec. 353. Penalties for violations of geographic targeting \n     orders and certain recordkeeping requirements, and \n     lengthening effective period of geographic targeting orders. \n     Section 353, included generally in both the Senate bill and \n     H.R. 3004, amends 31 U.S.C.

Sec. 3526, \n     and to certain recordkeeping requirements relating to funds \n     transfers. The House receded to a provision in the Senate \n     bill that also amends 31 U.S.C.

Special report on administration of bank secrecy \n     provisions. Section 357, included in the Senate bill, directs \n     the Secretary of the Treasury to submit a report to Congress, \n     six months after the date of enactment, on the role of the \n     IRS in the administration of the Bank Secrecy Act, with \n     emphasis on whether IRS Bank Secrecy Act information \n     processing responsibility (for reports filed by all financial \n     institutions) or Bank Secrecy Act audit and examination \n     responsibility (for certain non-bank financial institutions) \n     should be retained or transferred.\n       Sec. 358. Bank Secrecy provisions and activities of the \n     United States intelligence agencies. Section 358, included in \n     the same general terms in both the Senate bill and H.R. 3004, \n     contains amendments to various provisions of the Bank Secrecy \n     Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and the Fair Credit \n     Reporting Act, to permit information to be used in the \n     conduct of United States intelligence or counterintelligence \n     activities to protect against international terrorism. This \n     section combines the Senate and House provisions, with each \n     body receding to the other in the case of particular language \n     included in one version of the provision but not the other.\n       Sec. 359. Reporting of suspicious activities by underground \n     banking systems. Section 359, included in both the Senate \n     bill and H.R. 3004, clarifies that the Bank Secrecy Act \n     treats certain underground banking systems as financial \n     institutions, and that the funds transfer recordkeeping rules \n     applicable to licensed money transmitters also apply to \n     such underground systems. This section also directs the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress, within \n     one year of the date of enactment, on the need for \n     additional legislation or regulatory controls relating to \n     underground banking systems. The House receded to the \n     Senate with respect to certain technical changes in the \n     definition of the underground banking systems at issue.\n       Sec. 360. Use of authority of the United States Executive \n     Directors. Section 360, included in Senate bill, authorizes \n     the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the United States \n     Executive Director of each of the international financial \n     institutions (for example, the IMF and the World Bank) to use \n     such Director's ``voice and vote'' to support loans and other \n     use of resources to benefit nations that the President \n     determines to be contributing to United States efforts to \n     combat international terrorism, and to require the auditing \n     of each international financial institution to ensure that \n     funds are not paid to persons engaged in or supporting \n     terrorism.\n       Sec. 361. Financial crimes enforcement network. Section \n     361, included in H.R. 3004, adds a new Sec. 310 to subchapter \n     I of chapter 3 of title 31, United States Code, to make the \n     Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (``FinCEN'') a bureau \n     within the Department of the Treasury, to specify the duties \n     of FinCEN's Director, and to require the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to establish operating procedures for the \n     government-wide data access service and communications center \n     that FinCEN maintains. Section 361 also authorizes \n     appropriations for FinCEN for fiscal years 2002 through 2005. \n     Finally, this section requires the Secretary to study methods \n     for improving compliance with the reporting requirements for \n     ownership of foreign bank and brokerage accounts by U.S. \n     nationals imposed by regulations issued under 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 5314. The required report is to be submitted within six \n     months of the date of enactment and annually thereafter.\n       Sec. 362. Establishment of highly secure network. Section \n     362, included in H.R. 3004, directs the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to establish, within nine months of enactment, a \n     secure network with FinCEN that will allow financial \n     institutions to file suspicious activity reports and provide \n     such institutions with information regarding suspicious \n     activities warranting special scrutiny.\n       Sec. 363. Increase in civil and criminal penalties for \n     money laundering. Section 363, included in the Senate bill, \n     increases from $100,000 to $1,000,000 the maximum civil and \n     criminal penalties for a violation of provisions added to the \n     Bank Secrecy Act by sections 311 and 312 of this Act.\n       Sec. 364. Uniform protection authority for Federal Reserve \n     facilities. Section 364, included in H.R. 3004, authorizes \n     certain Federal Reserve personnel to act as law enforcement \n     officers and carry firearms to protect and safeguard Federal \n     Reserve employees and premises.\n       Sec. 365. Reports relating to coins and currency received \n     in nonfinancial trade or business. Section 365, included in \n     H.R. 3004, adds 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5331 (and makes related and \n     conforming changes) to the Bank Secrecy Act to require any \n     person who receives more than $10,000 in coins or currency, \n     in one transaction or two or more related transactions in the \n     course of that person's trade or business, to file a report \n     with respect to such transaction with FinCEN. Regulations \n     implementing the new reporting requirement are to be \n     promulgated within six months of enactment.\n       Sec. 366. Efficient use of currency transaction report \n     system. Section 366, included in H.R. 3004, requires the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to report to the Congress before \n     the end of the one year period beginning on the date of \n     enactment containing the results of a study of the possible \n     expansion of the statutory system for exempting transactions \n     from the currency transaction reporting requirements and ways \n     to improve the use by financial institutions of the statutory \n     exemption system as a way of reducing the volume of unneeded \n     currency transaction reports.\n\n                      Subtitle C--Currency Crimes\n\n       Sec. 371. Bulk cash smuggling into or out of the United \n     States. Section 371, included in both the Senate bill and \n     H.R. 3004, but with different language relating to \n     forfeiture, creates a new Bank Secrecy Act offense, 31 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 5332, involving the bulk smuggling of more than $10,000 \n     in currency in any conveyance, article of luggage or \n     merchandise or\n\n[[Page S11010]]\n\n     container, either into or out of the United States, and \n     related forfeiture provisions. The Senate receded to the \n     House language.\n       Sec. 372. Forfeiture in currency reporting cases. Section \n     372, included in the Senate bill and H.R. 3004 with different \n     language concerning mitigation, amends 31 U.S.C. Sec. 5317 to \n     permit confiscation of funds in connection with currency \n     reporting violations consistent with existing civil and \n     criminal forfeiture procedures. The Senate receded to the \n     House language.\n       Sec. 373. Illegal money transmitting businesses. Section \n     373, included in H.R. 3004, amends 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1960 to \n     clarify the terms of the offense stated in that \n     provision, relating to knowing operation of an unlicensed \n     (under state law) or unregistered (under Federal law) \n     money transmission business. This section also amends 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 981(a) to authorize the seizure of funds \n     involved in a violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1960.\n       Sec. 374. Counterfeiting domestic currency and obligations. \n     Section 374, included in H.R. 3004, makes a number of changes \n     to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 470-473 relating to \n     the maximum sentences for various counterfeiting offenses, \n     and adds to the definition of counterfeiting in 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 474 the making, acquiring, etc. of an analog, digital, \n     or electronic image of any obligation or other security of \n     the United States.\n       Sec. 375. Counterfeiting Foreign Currency and Obligations. \n     Section 375, included in H.R. 3004, makes a number of changes \n     to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 478-480 relating to \n     the maximum sentences for various counterfeiting offenses \n     involving foreign obligations or securities and adds to the \n     definition of counterfeiting in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 481 the \n     making, acquiring, etc. of an analog, digital, or electronic \n     image of any obligation or other security of a foreign \n     government.\n       Sec. 376. Laundering the proceeds of terrorism. This \n     provision expands the scope of predicate offenses for \n     laundering the proceeds of terrorism to include ``providing \n     material support or resources to terrorist organizations,'' \n     as that crime is defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339B of the \n     criminal code. Same as original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 377. Extraterritorial jurisdiction. This provision \n     applies the financial crimes prohibitions to conduct \n     committed abroad in situations where the tools or proceeds of \n     the offense pass through or are in the United States. Same as \n     original Administration proposal.\n\n\n                    TITLE IV--PROTECTING THE BORDER\n\n               Subtitle A--Protecting the Northern Border\n\n       Sec. 401. Ensuring adequate personnel on the Northern \n     border. Both the House and Senate bills included this \n     provision to authorize the Attorney General to waive any cap \n     on the number of full time employees assigned to the INS on \n     the northern border. Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 402. Northern border personnel. Both the House and \n     Senate bills included this provision to authorize additional \n     appropriations to allow for a tripling in personnel for \n     the Border Patrol, INS Inspectors, and the US Customs \n     Service in each State along the northern border, and an \n     additional $50 million each to the INS and the US Customs \n     Service to improve technology and acquire additional \n     equipment for use at the northern border. Not in original \n     Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 403. Access by the Department of State and the INS to \n     certain identifying information in the criminal history \n     records of visa applicants and applicants for admission to \n     the United States. Both the House and Senate bills included \n     this provision to give the State Department and INS access to \n     the criminal history record information contained in the \n     National Crime Information Center's Interstate Identification \n     Index, Wanted Persons File, and any other information \n     mutually agreed upon between the Attorney General and the \n     agency receiving access. Same as original Administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 404. Limited authority to pay overtime. Both the House \n     and Senate bills included this provision to allow the \n     Attorney General to authorize overtime pay for INS employees \n     in an amount in excess of $30,000 during calendar year 2001, \n     to ensure that experienced personnel are available to handle \n     the increased workload generated by the events of September \n     11, 2001. Same as original Administration proposal but based \n     on a Leahy-Conyers proposal.\n       Sec. 405. Report on the integrated automated fingerprint \n     identification system for points of entry and overseas \n     consular posts. Both the House and Senate bills included this \n     provision to require the Attorney General to report to \n     Congress on the feasibility of enhancing the FBI's Integrated \n     Automated Fingerprint Identification System or other \n     identification systems to identify foreign passport and visa \n     holders who may be wanted in connection with a criminal \n     investigation in the United States or abroad before issuing a \n     visa to that person or their entry or exit from the United \n     States. Not in original Administration proposal.\n\n              Subtitle B--Enhanced Immigration Provisions\n\n       Sec. 411. Definitions relating to terrorism. Both the House \n     and Senate bills included this provision to amend the \n     definition of ``engage in terrorist activity'' to clarify \n     that an alien who solicits funds or membership or provides \n     material support to a certified terrorist organization is \n     inadmissible and removable. Aliens who solicit funds or \n     membership or provide material support to organizations not \n     designated as terrorist organizations have the opportunity to \n     show that they did not know and should not have known that \n     their actions would further terrorist activity. This section \n     also creates a definition of ``terrorist organization,'' \n     which is not defined under current law, for purposes of \n     making an alien inadmissible or removable. It defines a \n     terrorist organization as one that is (1) designated by \n     the Secretary of State as a terrorist organization under \n     the process supplied by current law; (2) designated by the \n     Secretary of State as a terrorist organization for \n     immigration purposes; or (3) a group of two or more \n     individuals that commits terrorist activities or plans or \n     prepares to commit (including locating targets for) \n     terrorist activities. The changes made by this section \n     will apply to actions taken by an alien before enactment \n     with respect to any group that was at that time certified \n     by the Secretary of State. Narrower than original \n     Administration proposal by allowing an alien to show \n     support for non-designated organization was offered \n     without knowledge of organization's terrorist activity.\n       Sec. 412. Mandatory detention of suspected terrorists; \n     habeas corpus; judicial review. Both the House- and Senate-\n     passed bills included provisions to grant the Attorney \n     General the authority to certify that an alien meets the \n     criteria of the terrorism grounds of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act, or is engaged in any other activity that \n     endangers the national security of the United States, upon a \n     ``reasonable grounds to believe'' standard, and take such \n     aliens into custody. This authority is delegable only to the \n     Deputy Attorney General. The Attorney General must either \n     begin removal proceedings against such aliens or bring \n     criminal charges within seven days, or release them from \n     custody. An alien who is charged but ultimately found not to \n     be removable is to be released from custody. An alien who is \n     found to be removable but has not been removed, and whose \n     removal is unlikely in the reasonably foreseeable future, may \n     be detained if the Attorney General demonstrates that release \n     of the alien will adversely affect national security or the \n     safety of the community or any person. Judicial review of any \n     action taken under this section, including review of the \n     merits of the certification, is available through habeas \n     corpus proceedings, with appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the D.C. Circuit. The Attorney General shall review his \n     certification of an alien every six months. Narrower than \n     original Administration proposal in numerous ways, including \n     placing a 7-day limit on detention without charge, ordering \n     release of aliens found not to be removable, and more \n     meaningful judicial review of Attorney General's \n     determination of national security risk posed by alien.\n       Sec. 413. Multilateral cooperation against terrorists. Both \n     the House and Senate bills included this provision to provide \n     new exceptions to the laws regarding disclosure of \n     information from State Department records pertaining to the \n     issuance of or refusal to issue visas to enter the U.S., and \n     allows the sharing of this information with a \n     foreign government on a case-by-case basis for the purpose \n     of preventing, investigating, or punishing acts of \n     terrorism. Based on original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 414. Visa integrity and security. This section \n     expresses the sense of the Congress that the Attorney \n     General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, should \n     fully implement the entry/exit system as expeditiously as \n     practicable. Particular focus should be given to the \n     utilization of biometric technology and the development of \n     tamper-resistant documents. Not in original Administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 415. Participation of Office of Homeland Security on \n     Entry-Exit Task Force. This section includes the new Office \n     of Homeland Security as a participant in the Entry and Exit \n     Task Force established by the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service Data Management Improvement Act of 2000. Not in \n     original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 416. Foreign student monitoring program. This section \n     seeks to implement the foreign student monitoring program \n     created in 1996 by temporarily supplanting the collection of \n     user fees mandated by the statute with an appropriation of \n     $36,800,000 for the express purpose of fully and effectively \n     implementing the program through January 2003. Thereafter, \n     the program would be funded by user fees. Currently, all \n     institutions of higher education that enroll foreign students \n     or exchange visitors are required to participate in the \n     monitoring program. This section expands the list of \n     institutions to include air flight schools, language training \n     schools, and vocational schools. Not in original \n     Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 417. Machine readable passports. This section requires \n     the Secretary of State to conduct an annual audit to assess \n     precautionary measures taken to prevent the counterfeiting \n     and theft of passports among countries that participate in \n     the visa waiver program, and ascertain that designated \n     countries have established a program to develop tamper-\n     resistant passports. Results of the audit will be reported to \n     Congress. This provision would advance the deadline for \n     participating nations to develop machine readable passports \n     to October 1, 2003, but permit the Secretary of State to \n     waive the requirements imposed by the deadline if he finds \n     that the program country is making sufficient progress to \n     provide their nationals with machine-readable passports. Not \n     in original Administration proposal.\n\n[[Page S11011]]\n\n       Sec. 418. Prevention of consulate shopping. This section \n     directs the State Department to examine what concerns, if \n     any, are created by the practice of certain aliens to \n     ``shop'' for a visa between issuing posts. Not in original \n     Administration proposal.\n\n    Subtitle C--Preservation of Immigration Benefits for Victims of \n                               Terrorism\n\n       [Note: This subtitle was not in original Administration \n     proposal. It is certain that some aliens fell victim to the \n     terrorist attacks on the U.S. on September 11. For many \n     families, these tragedies will be compounded by the trauma of \n     husbands, wives, and children losing their immigration status \n     due to the death or serious injury of a family member. These \n     family members are facing deportation because they are out of \n     status: they no longer qualify for their current immigration \n     status or are no longer eligible to complete the application \n     process because their loved one was killed or injured in the \n     September 11 terrorist attack. Others are threatened with the \n     loss of their immigration status, through no fault of their \n     own, due to the disruption of communication and \n     transportation that has resulted directly from the terrorist \n     attacks. Because of these disruptions, people have been and \n     will be unable to meet important deadlines, which will mean \n     the loss of eligibility for certain benefits and the \n     inability to maintain lawful status, unless the law is \n     changed.\n       At the request of Congressman Conyers and Senator Leahy, \n     this new subtitle (sections 421-428) was included in the \n     final bill to modify the immigration laws to provide the \n     humanitarian relief to these victims and their family members \n     in preserving their immigration status.]\n       Sec. 421. Special immigrant status. This section provides \n     permanent resident status to an alien who was the beneficiary \n     of a petition filed (on or before September 11) to grant the \n     alien permanent residence as a family-sponsored immigrant or \n     employer-sponsored immigrant, or of an application for labor \n     certification (filed on or before September 11), if the \n     petition or application was rendered null because of the \n     disability of the beneficiary or loss of employment of the \n     beneficiary due to physical damage to, or destruction of, the \n     business of the petitioner or applicant as a direct result of \n     the terrorist attacks on September 11, or because of the \n     death of the petitioner or applicant as a direct result of \n     the terrorist attacks. Permanent residence would be granted \n     to an alien who was the spouse or child of an alien who was \n     the beneficiary of a petition filed on or before September 11 \n     to grant the beneficiary permanent residence as a family-\n     sponsored immigrant (as long as the spouse or child follows \n     to join not later than September 11, 2003). Permanent \n     residence would be granted to the beneficiary of a petition \n     for a nonimmigrant visa as the spouse or the fiance (and \n     their children) of a U.S. citizen where the petitioning \n     citizen died as a direct result of the terrorist attack. This \n     section also provides permanent resident status to the \n     grandparents of a child both of whose parents died as a \n     result of the terrorist attacks, if either of such \n     deceased parents was a U.S. citizen or a permanent \n     resident. Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 422. Extension of filing or reentry deadlines. This \n     section provides that an alien who was legally in a \n     nonimmigrant status and was disabled as a direct result of \n     the terrorist attacks on September 11 (and his or her spouse \n     and children) may remain lawfully in the United States (and \n     receive work authorization) until the later of the date that \n     his or her status normally terminates or September 11, 2002. \n     Such status is also provided to the nonimmigrant spouse and \n     children of an alien who died as a direct result of the \n     terrorist attacks. The Act provides that an alien who was \n     lawfully present as a nonimmigrant at the time of the \n     terrorist attacks will be granted 60 additional days to file \n     an application for extension or change of status if the alien \n     was prevented from so filing as a direct result of the \n     terrorist attacks. Also, an alien who was lawfully present as \n     a nonimmigrant at the time of the attacks but was then unable \n     to timely depart the United States as a direct result of the \n     attacks will be considered to have departed legally and will \n     not be considered to have been unlawfully present for the \n     purposes of section 212(a)(9) of the INA if departure occurs \n     before November 11. Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 423. Humanitarian relief for certain surviving spouses \n     and children. Current law provides that an alien who was the \n     spouse of a U.S. citizen for at least 2 years before the \n     citizen died shall remain eligible for immigrant status as an \n     immediate relative. This also applies to the children of the \n     alien. This section provides that if the citizen died as a \n     direct result of the terrorist attacks, the 2-year \n     requirement is waived. This section provides that if an alien \n     spouse, child, or unmarried adult son or daughter had been \n     the beneficiary of an immigrant visa petition filed by a \n     permanent resident who died as a direct result of the \n     terrorist attacks, the alien will still be eligible for \n     permanent residence. In addition, if an alien spouse, child, \n     or unmarried adult son or daughter of a permanent resident \n     who died as a direct result of the terrorist attacks was \n     present in the United States on September 11 but had not yet \n     been petitioned for permanent residence, the alien can self-\n     petition for permanent residence. The section also provides \n     that an alien spouse or child of an alien who (1) died as a \n     direct result of the terrorist attacks and (2) was a \n     permanent resident (petitioned-for by an employer) or an \n     applicant for adjustment of status for an employment-based \n     immigrant visa, may have his or her application for \n     adjustment adjudicated despite the death (if the application \n     was filed prior to the death). Not in original Administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 424. ``Age-out'' protection for children. Under \n     current law, certain visas are only available to an alien \n     until the alien's 21st birthday. This section provides that \n     an alien whose 21st birthday occurs this September and who is \n     a beneficiary for a petition or application filed on or \n     before September 11 shall be considered to remain a child for \n     90 days after the alien's 21st birthday. For an alien whose \n     21st birthday occurs after this September, (and who had a \n     petition for application filed on his or her behalf on or \n     before September 11) the alien shall be considered to remain \n     a child for 45 days after the alien's 21st birthday. Not in \n     original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 425. Temporary administrative relief. This section \n     provides that temporary administrative relief may be provided \n     to an alien who was lawfully present on September 10, was on \n     that date the spouse, parent or child of someone who died or \n     was disabled as a direct result of the terrorist attacks, and \n     is not otherwise entitled to relief under any other provision \n     of this legislation. Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 426. Evidence of death, disability, or loss of \n     employment. This section instructs the Attorney General to \n     establish appropriate standards for evidence demonstrating \n     that a death, disability, or loss of employment due to \n     physical damage to, or destruction of, a business, occurred \n     as a direct result of the terrorist attacks on September 11. \n     The Attorney General is not required to promulgate \n     regulations prior to implementing this subtitle. Not in \n     original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 427. No Benefits to Terrorists or Family Members of \n     Terrorists. This section states that no benefit under this \n     subtitle shall be provided to anyone culpable for the \n     terrorist attacks on September 11 or to any family member of \n     such an individual. Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 428. Definitions. This section defines the term \n     `specified terrorist activity' as any terrorist activity \n     conducted against the Government or the people of the United \n     States on September 11, 2001. Not in original Administration \n     proposal.\n\n\n         TITLE V--REMOVING OBSTACLES TO INVESTIGATING TERRORISM\n\n       Sec. 501. Attorney General's authority to pay rewards to \n     combat terrorism. Both the House and Senate bills included \n     this provision to authorize the Attorney General to offer \n     rewards--payments to individuals who offer information \n     pursuant to a public advertisement--to gather information to \n     combat terrorism and defend the nation against terrorist acts \n     without any dollar limitation (Current law limits rewards to \n     $2 million). Rewards of $250,000 or more require the personal \n     approval of the Attorney General or President and notice \n     to Congress. Narrower than original Administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 502. Secretary of State's authority to pay rewards. \n     Both the House and Senate bills included this provision to \n     authorize the Secretary of State to offer rewards--payments \n     to individuals who offer information pursuant to a public \n     advertisement--to gather information to combat terrorism and \n     defend the nation against terrorist acts without any dollar \n     limitation (Current law limits rewards to $5 million). \n     Rewards of $100,000 or more require the personal approval of \n     the Secretary of State and notice to Congress. Narrower than \n     original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 503. DNA identification of terrorists and other \n     violent offenders. Both the House and Senate bills included \n     this provision to authorize the collection of DNA samples \n     from any person convicted of certain terrorism-related \n     offenses and other crimes of violence, for inclusion in the \n     national DNA database. Modified from original Administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 504. Coordination with law enforcement. Both the House \n     and Senate bills included this provision to amend FISA to \n     authorize consultation between FISA officers and law \n     enforcement officers to coordinate efforts to investigate or \n     protect against international terrorism, clandestine \n     intelligence activities, or other grave hostile acts of a \n     foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Not in original \n     Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 505. Miscellaneous national security authorities. Both \n     the House and Senate bills included this provision to modify \n     current statutory provisions on access to telephone, bank, \n     and credit records in counterintelligence investigations to \n     remove the ``agent of a foreign power'' standard. The \n     authority may be used only for investigations to protect \n     against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence \n     activities, and an investigation of a United States person \n     may not be based solely on activities protected by the First \n     Amendment. Narrower than original Administration proposal \n     which simply removed ``agent of foreign power'' requirement.\n       Sec. 506. Extension of Secret Service jurisdiction. Both \n     the House and Senate bills included this provision to give \n     the Secret Service concurrent jurisdiction to investigate \n     offenses relating to fraud and related activity in connection \n     with computers, and permanently extends its current authority \n     to investigate financial institution fraud. Not in original \n     Administration proposal.\n\n[[Page S11012]]\n\n       Sec. 507. Disclosure of educational records. Both the House \n     and Senate bills included this provision to require \n     application to a court to obtain educational records in the \n     possession of an educational agency or institution if it is \n     determined by the Attorney General or Secretary of Education \n     (or their designee) that doing so could reasonably be \n     expected to assist in investigating or preventing a federal \n     terrorism offense or domestic or international terrorism. \n     Limited immunity is given to persons producing such \n     information acting in good faith, and the Attorney General is \n     directed to issue guidelines to protect confidentiality. \n     Narrower than original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 508. Disclosure of information from NCES surveys. Both \n     the House and Senate bills included this provision to require \n     application to a court to obtain reports, records and \n     information in the possession of the National Center for \n     Educational Statistics that are relevant to an authorized \n     investigation or prosecution of terrorism. Limited immunity \n     is given to persons producing such information acting in good \n     faith, and the Attorney General is directed to issue \n     guidelines to protect confidentiality.

Expedited payment for public safety officers \n     involved in the prevention, investigation, rescue, or \n     recovery efforts related to a terrorist attack. Both the \n     House and Senate bills included this provision to streamline \n     the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program application \n     process for family members of law enforcement officers, \n     firefighters, and emergency personnel who perished or \n     suffered serious injury in connection with prevention, \n     investigation, rescue or recovery efforts related to a \n     terrorist attack. The Public Safety Officers Benefits Program \n     provides benefits for each of the families of law enforcement \n     officers, fire fighters, emergency response squad members, \n     ambulance crew members who are killed or permanently and \n     totally disabled in the line of duty ($151,635 in FY 2001). \n     Current regulations, however, require the families of public \n     safety officers who have fallen in the line of duty to go \n     through a cumbersome and time-consuming application process. \n     Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 612. Technical correction with respect to expedited \n     payments for heroic public safety officers. Both the House \n     and Senate bills included this provision to make technical \n     corrections to Public Law 107-37 to provide sufficient \n     information to make expedited Public Safety Officers Benefits \n     Program payments to the fallen firefighters, emergency \n     personnel and law enforcement officers who perished or \n     were disabled during the rescue and recovery efforts \n     related to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. \n     Modified from original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 613. Public safety officers benefits program payment \n     increase. Both the House and Senate-passed bills included \n     this provision to raise the total amount of Public Safety \n     Officers Benefits Program payment to $250,000 and is \n     effective for any death or disability occurring on or after \n     January 1, 2001. Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 614. Office of Justice programs. Both the House and \n     Senate bills included this provision to amend the Office of \n     Justice Program's authorities to enhance the authority of the \n     Assistant Attorney General to coordinate and manage emergency \n     response activities of its various components including the \n     Public Safety Officers Benefits Program. Modified from \n     original Administration proposal.\n\n       Subtitle B--Amendments to the Victims of Crime Act of 1984\n\n       [Note: The original Administration proposal did not include \n     most of the provisions of this subtitle to streamline the \n     administration of the Crime Victims Fund.]\n       Sec. 621. Crime victims fund. Both the House and Senate \n     bills included this provision to authorize the Office for \n     Victims of Crime (OVC) to replenish the antiterrorism \n     emergency reserve with up to $50 million and establishes a \n     mechanism to allow for replenishment in future years. Funds \n     added to the Crime Victims Fund to respond to the September \n     11 attacks shall not be subject to the cap or the new formula \n     provisions. A technical clarification includes the September \n     11th Victim Compensation Fund established in Public Law 107-\n     42 as one of the Federal benefits that should be a primary \n     payer to the States. This section also replaces the annual \n     cap on the Fund with a self-regulating system that ensures \n     stability in the amounts distributed while preserving the \n     amounts remaining for use in future years; it authorizes \n     private gift-giving to the Fund; and it increases the portion \n     of the Fund available for discretionary grants and assistance \n     to victims of Federal crime. Significant expansion of \n     original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 622. Crime victim compensation. Both the House and \n     Senate bills included this provision to increase the minimum \n     threshold for the annual grant to State compensation \n     programs. It clarifies that a payment of compensation to a \n     victim shall not used in means tests for Federal benefit \n     programs. A technical clarification removes the dual \n     requirement that State crime victim compensation programs \n     cover victims of terrorism occurring outside the United \n     States. Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 623. Crime victim assistance. Both the House and \n     Senate bills included this provision to authorize States to \n     give VOCA funds to U.S. Attorney's Offices in jurisdictions \n     where the U.S. Attorney is the local prosecutor. It prohibits \n     victim assistance programs from discriminating against \n     certain victims; authorizes grants to eligible victim \n     assistance programs for program evaluation and compliance \n     efforts; and allows use of funds for fellowships, clinical \n     internships and training programs. Not in original \n     Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 624. Victims of terrorism. Both the House and Senate \n     bills included this provision to conform VOCA's domestic \n     terrorism section to the international terrorism section, \n     giving OVC the flexibility to deliver timely and critically-\n     needed assistance to victims of terrorism and mass violence \n     occurring within the United States. It also makes a technical \n     correction to recent legislation that inadvertently reversed \n     the existing exclusion under VOCA of individuals eligible for \n     other Federal compensation under the Omnibus Diplomatic \n     Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. Expansion of original \n     Administration proposal.\n\n\n TITLE VII--INCREASED INFORMATION SHARING FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE \n                               PROTECTION\n\n       [Note: The original Administration proposal did not include \n     this subtitle to expand regional information sharing to \n     facilitate Federal-state-local law enforcement responses to \n     terrorism.]\n       Sec. 701. Expansion of regional information sharing system \n     to facilitate Federal-State-local law enforcement response \n     related to terrorist attacks. Both the House and Senate bills \n     included this provision to expand the Department of Justice \n     Regional Information Sharing Systems (RISS) Program to \n     facilitate information sharing among Federal, State and local \n     law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute \n     terrorist conspiracies and activities and doubles its \n     authorized funding for FY2002 and FY2003. Currently, 5,700 \n     Federal, State and local law enforcement agencies participate \n     in the RISS Program. Not in original Administration proposal.\n\n\n     TITLE VIII--STRENGTHENING THE CRIMINAL LAWS AGAINST TERRORISM\n\n       Sec. 801. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence \n     against mass transportation systems. Both the House and \n     Senate bills included this provision to create a new statute \n     (to be codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1993) to make punishable \n     acts of terrorism and other violence against mass \n     transportation vehicles, systems, facilities, employees and \n     passengers; the reporting of false information about such \n     activities; and attempts and conspiracies to commit such \n     offenses. Violations are punishable by a fine and term \n     imprisonment of 20 years; however, the mass transportation \n     vehicle was carrying a passenger at the time of the attack, \n     or if death resulted from the offense, the maximum term of \n     imprisonment is increased to life. Not in original \n     Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 802. Definition of domestic terrorism. Both the House \n     and Senate bills included this provision to define the term \n     ``domestic terrorism'' as a counterpart to the current \n     definition of ``international terrorism'' in 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2331. The new definition for ``domestic terrorism'' is \n     for the limited purpose of providing investigative \n     authorities (i.e., court orders, warrants, etc.) for acts of \n     terrorism within the territorial jurisdiction of the United \n     States. Such offenses are those that are ``(1) dangerous to \n     human life and violate the criminal laws of the United States \n     or any state; and (2) appear to be intended (or have the \n     effect)--to intimidate a civilian population; influence \n     government policy intimidation or coercion; or affect \n     government conduct by mass destruction, assassination, or \n     kidnapping (or a threat of).'' Same as Administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 803. Prohibition against harboring terrorists. Both \n     the House and Senate bills included this provision to \n     establish a new criminal prohibition against harboring \n     terrorists, similar to the current prohibition in 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 792 against harboring spies, and makes it an offense \n     when someone harbors or conceals another they know or should \n     have known had engaged in or was about to engage in federal \n     terrorism offenses. Narrower than Administration's proposal \n     except that the final bill removes the Administration's \n     original proposal to make it an offense to harbor someone \n     merely suspected of engaging in terrorism.\n       Sec. 804. Jurisdiction over crimes committed at U.S. \n     facilities abroad. Both the House and Senate bills included \n     this provision to extend the special maritime and territorial \n     jurisdiction of the United States to cover, with respect to \n     offenses committed by or against a U.S. national, U.S. \n     diplomatic, consular and military missions, and residences \n     used by U.S. personnel assigned to such missions. Based on \n     original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 805. Material support for terrorism. Both the House \n     and Senate bills included this provision to amend 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2339A, which prohibits providing material support to \n     terrorists, in four respects. First, it adds three terrorism-\n     related offenses to the list of Sec. 2339A predicates. \n     Second, it provides that Sec. 2339A violations may be \n     prosecuted in any Federal judicial district in which the \n     predicate offense was committed. Third, it clarifies that \n     monetary instruments, like currency and other financial \n     securities, may constitute ``material support or resources''\n\n[[Page S11013]]\n\n     for purpose of Sec. 2339A. Fourth, it explicitly prohibits \n     providing terrorists with ``expert advice or assistance,'' \n     such as flight training, knowing or intending that it will be \n     used to prepare for or carry out an act of terrorism. Same as \n     original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 806. Assets of terrorists organizations. Both the \n     House and Senate bills included this provision to provide \n     that the assets of individuals and organizations engaged in \n     planning or perpetrating acts of terrorism against the United \n     States, as well as the proceeds and instrumentalities of such \n     acts, are subject to civil forfeiture. Same as original \n     Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 807. Technical clarification relating to provision of \n     material support to terrorism. Both the House and Senate \n     bills included this provision to clarify that the provisions \n     of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of \n     2000 (title IX of Public Law 106-387) do not limit or \n     otherwise affect the criminal prohibitions against providing \n     material support to terrorists or designated terrorist \n     organizations, 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2339A & 2339B. Same as \n     original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 808. Definition of Federal crime of terrorism. Both \n     the House and Senate bills included this provision to update \n     the list of predicate offenses under the current definition \n     of ``Federal crime of terrorism,'' 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2332b(g)(5). Narrower than original Administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 809. No statute of limitation for certain terrorism \n     offenses. Both the House and Senate bills included this \n     provision to eliminate the statute of limitations for certain \n     terrorism-related offenses, if the commission of such offense \n     resulted in, or created a foreseeable risk of, death or \n     serious bodily injury to another person. Narrower than \n     original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 810. Alternative maximum penalties for terrorism \n     offenses. Both the House and Senate bills included this \n     provision to raise the maximum prison terms to 15 or 20 years \n     or, if death results, life, in the following criminal \n     statutes: 18 U.S.C. Sec. 81 (arson within the special \n     maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United \n     States); 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1366 (destruction of an energy \n     facility); 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2155(a) (destruction of \n     national-defense materials); 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2339A & \n     2339B (provision of material support to terrorists and \n     terrorist organizations); 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2284 (sabotage of \n     nuclear facilities or fuel); 19 U.S.C. Sec. 46505(c) \n     (killings on aircraft); 49 U.S.C. Sec. 60123(b) \n     (destruction of interstate gas or hazardous liquid \n     pipeline facility). Narrower than original Administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 811. Penalties for terrorist conspiracies. Both the \n     House and Senate-passed bills included this provision to \n     ensure adequate penalties for certain terrorism-related \n     conspiracies by adding conspiracy provisions to the following \n     criminal statutes: 18 U.S.C. Sec. 81 (arson within the \n     special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United \n     States); 18 U.S.C. Sec. 930(c) (killings in Federal \n     facilities); 18 U.S.C.

Sec. 1992 (wrecking trains); 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339A \n     (material support to terrorists); 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340A \n     (torture); 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2284 (sabotage of nuclear \n     facilities or fuel); 49 U.S.C. Sec. 46504 (interference with \n     flight crews); 49 U.S.C. Sec. 46505 (carrying weapons or \n     explosives on aircraft); 49 U.S.C. Sec. 60123 (destruction of \n     interstate gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facility). \n     Narrower than original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 812.

Inclusion of acts of terrorism as racketeering \n     activity. Both the House and Senate bills included this \n     provision to amend the RICO statute to include certain \n     terrorism-related offenses within the definition of \n     ``racketeering activity,'' thus allowing multiple acts of \n     terrorism to be charged as a pattern of racketeering for RICO \n     purposes. This section expands the ability of prosecutors to \n     prosecute members of established, ongoing terrorist \n     organizations that present the threat of continuity that the \n     RICO statute was designed to permit prosecutors to combat. \n     Narrower than original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 814. Deterrence and prevention of cyberterrorism. Both \n     the House and Senate bills included this provision to clarify \n     the criminal statute prohibiting computer hacking, 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1030, to cover computers located outside the United \n     States when used in a manner that affects the interstate \n     commerce or communications of this country, update the \n     definition of ``loss'' to ensure full costs to victims of \n     hacking offenses are counted, clarify the scope of civil \n     liability and eliminate the current mandatory minimum \n     sentence applicable in some cases.

The \n     Senate-passed bill included this provision to amend the \n     definition of ``for use as a weapon'' in the current \n     biological weapons statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 175, to include \n     all situations in which it can be proven that the defendant \n     had any purpose other than a prophylactic, protective, or \n     peaceful purpose. This section also creates a new criminal \n     statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 175b, which generally makes it an \n     offense for certain restricted persons, including non-\n     resident foreign nationals of countries that support \n     international terrorism, to possess a listed biological agent \n     or toxin. Finally, this section provides that the Department \n     of Health and Human Services enhance its role in bioterrorism \n     prevention by establishing and enforcing standards and \n     procedures governing the possession, use, and transfer of \n     certain biological agents that have a high national security \n     risk, including safeguards to prevent access to such agents \n     for use in domestic or international terrorism. Modified from \n     original Administration proposal, which did not require the \n     government to establish the mens rea of the defendant to \n     prove the crime of possession of the biological weapon.\n\n\n                    TITLE IX--IMPROVED INTELLIGENCE\n\n       Sec. 901. Responsibilities of Director of Central \n     Intelligence regarding foreign intelligence collected under \n     the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. Both the \n     House and Senate bills included this provision to clarify the \n     role of the Director of Central Intelligence (``DCI'') with \n     respect to the overall management of collection \n     goals, analysis and dissemination of foreign intelligence \n     gathered pursuant to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act, in order to ensure that FISA is properly and \n     efficiently used for foreign intelligence purposes. It \n     requires the DCI to assist the Attorney General in \n     ensuring that FISA efforts are consistent with \n     constitutional and statutory civil liberties. The DCI will \n     have no operational authority with respect to \n     implementation of FISA, which will continue to reside with \n     the FBI. Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 902. Inclusion of international terrorism activities \n     within scope of foreign intelligence under National Security \n     Act of 1947. Both the House and Senate bills included this \n     provision to revise the National Security Act definitions \n     section to include ``international terrorism'' as a subset of \n     ``foreign intelligence.'' This change will clarify the DCI's \n     responsibility for collecting foreign intelligence related to \n     international terrorism. Not in original Administration \n     proposal.\n       Sec. 903. Sense of Congress on the establishment and \n     maintenance of intelligence relationships to acquire \n     information on terrorists and terrorist organizations.

Both the House and Senate bills \n     included this provision to create a responsibility for law \n     enforcement agencies to notify the Intelligence Community \n     when a criminal investigation reveals information of \n     intelligence value. Regularizes existing ad hoc notification, \n     and makes clear that constitutional and statutory \n     prohibitions of certain types of information sharing apply. \n     Not in original Administration proposal.\n       Sec. 906. Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center. Both the \n     House and Senate bills included this provision to regularize \n     the existing Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking Center by \n     creating an element within the Department of Treasury \n     designed to review all-source intelligence in support of both \n     intelligence and law enforcement efforts to counter \n     terrorist financial support networks.

Not in original Administration proposal.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. After that terrible day of September 11, we began looking \nat our laws, and what we might do. Unfortunately, at first, rhetoric \novercame reality. We had a proposal sent up, and we were asked to pass \nit within a day or so. Fortunately for the country, and actually \nironically beneficial to both the President and the Attorney General \nwho asked for such legislation, we took time to look at it, we took \ntime to read it, and we took time to remove those parts that were \nunconstitutional and those parts that would have actually hurt \nliberties of all Americans.\n\n  I say that because I think of what Benjamin Franklin was quoted as \nsaying at a time when he literally had his neck on the line, where he \nwould have been hanged if our revolution had failed. He said: A people \nwho would give up their liberty for security deserve neither.\n  What we have tried to do in this legislation is to balance the \nliberties we enjoy as Americans and those liberties that have made us \nthe greatest democracy in history but at the same time to enhance our \nsecurity so we can maintain that democracy and maintain the leadership \nwe have given the rest of the world.\n  We completed our work 6 weeks after the September 11 attacks. I \ncompare this to what happened after the bombing of the Federal Building \nin Oklahoma City in 1995. It took a year to complete the legislation \nafter that. We have done this in 6 weeks. But there has been a lot of \ncooperation. There have been a lot of Senators and a lot of House \nMembers in both parties and dedicated staff who have worked around the \nclock.\n  I think of my own staff--and this could be said of many others, \nincluding the Presiding Officer's staff and the ranking member's \nstaff--who were forced out of their offices because of the recent \nscares on Capitol Hill, and they continue to work literally in phone \nbooths and in hallways and from their homes and off laptops and cell \nphones.\n  I made a joke in my own hide-away office. To those who have ever \nwatched ``The X-Files,'' there is a group called ``the lone gunmen,'' \nwho are sort of these computer nerds who meet in a small house trailer. \nI am seeing some puzzled looks around the Senate as I say this. But \nthey have all these wires hanging from the ceiling and laptops and all, \nand they do great things. That is the way our office looked. But they \nwere working around the clock on this legislation to get something \nbetter. There was some unfortunate rhetoric along the way, but again, \nthe reality overcame it. We have a good piece of legislation.\n\n  As we look back to when we began discussions with the administration \nabout this bill, there were sound and legitimate concerns on both sides \nof the Capitol, both sides of the aisle, about the legislation's \nimplication for America's rights and freedoms. There was also a sincere \nand committed belief that we needed to find a way to give law \nenforcement authority new tools in fighting terrorism.\n  This is a whole new world. It is not similar to the days of the cold \nwar where we worried about armies marching against us or air forces \nflying against us or navies sailing against us. This is not that world. \nNobody is going to do that because we are far too powerful. Since the \nend of the cold war, with the strength of our military, nobody is going \nto do a frontal attack. But as the Presiding Officer and everyone else \nknows, a small dedicated group of terrorists, with state-supported \nefforts, can wreak havoc in an open and democratic Nation such as ours.\n  Anybody who has visited the sites of these tragedies doesn't need to \nbe told the results. We know our Nation by its very nature will always \nbe vulnerable to these types of attacks. None of us serving in the \nSenate today will, throughout our service, no matter how long it is, \nsee a day where we are totally free of such terrorist attacks. That is \nthe sad truth. Our children and our grandchildren will face the \npossibilities of such terrorist attacks because that is the only way \nthe United States can be attacked. But that doesn't mean we are \ndefenseless. It doesn't mean we suddenly surrender.\n\n[[Page S11015]]\n\n  We have the ability, with our intelligence agencies and our law \nenforcement, to seek out and stop people before this happens. We are in \nan open session today, so I won't go into the number of times we have \ndone that. But in the last 10 years, we have had, time and time again, \nduring the former Bush administration, during the Clinton \nadministration, and in the present administration, potential terrorist \nattacks thwarted. People have either been apprehended or eliminated.\n  Everybody in America knows our life has changed. Whether the security \nchecks and the changes in our airlines are effective or not, we know \nthey are reality. We know travel is not as easy as it once was. We will \nbe concerned about opening mail. We will worry when we hear the sirens \nin the night. But we are not going to retreat into fortress America. We \nare going to remain a beacon of democracy to the rest of the world. \nAmericans don't run and hide. Americans face up, as we have, to \nadversities, whether they be economic or wars or anything else.\n  We began this process knowing how we had to protect Americans. It was \nnot that we were intending to see how much we could take out of the \nadministration's proposal, but it was with a determination to find \nsensible, workable ways to do the same things to protect America the \nadministration wanted but with checks and balances against abuse. We \nhave seen at different times in this Nation's history how good \nintentions can be abused. We saw it during the McCarthy era.\n  Following the death of J. Edgar Hoover, we found how much \ntotalitarian control of the FBI hurt so many innocent people without \nenhancing our security. We saw it during the excesses of the special \nprosecutor law enacted with good intentions.\n  We wanted to find checks and balances. We wanted to make sure we \ncould go after terrorism. We wanted to make sure we could go after \nthose who would injure our society, those who would strike at the very \ndemocratic principles that ironically make us a target. But we wanted \nto do it with checks and balances against abuse. That is what we did. \nIn provision after provision, we added those safeguards that were \nmissing from the administration's plan.\n  By taking the time to read and improve the antiterrorism bill, \nCongress has done the administration a great favor in correcting the \nproblems that were there. We have used the time wisely. We have \nproduced a far better bill than the administration proposed. Actually, \nit is a better bill than either this body or the House initially \nproposed. The total is actually greater than the sum of the parts.\n  We have done our utmost to protect Americans against abuse of these \nnew law enforcement tools, and there are new law enforcement tools \ninvolved. In granting these new powers, the American people but also \nwe, their representatives in Congress, grant the administration our \ntrust that they are not going to be misused. It is a two-way street. We \nare giving powers to the administration; we will have to extend some \ntrust that they are not going to be misused.\n  The way we guarantee that is congressional oversight. Congressional \noversight is going to be crucial in enforcing this compact. If I might \nparaphrase former President Reagan: We will entrust but with oversight.\n  We will do this. The Republican chairman and his ranking member in \nthe House of Representatives intend to have very close oversight. I can \nassure you that I and our ranking member will have tight oversight in \nthe Senate.\n  Interestingly enough, the 4-year sunset provision included in this \nfinal agreement will be an enforcement mechanism for adequate \noversight.\n  We did not have a sunset provision in the Senate bill. The House \nincluded a 5-year provision. The administration wanted even 10 years. \nWe compromised on 4. It makes sense. It makes sense because with \neverybody knowing there is that sunset provision, everybody knows they \nare going to have to use these powers carefully and in the best way. If \nthey do that, then they can have extensions. If they don't, they won't. \nIt also enhances our power for oversight.\n  This is not precisely the bill that Senator Hatch would have written. \nIt is not precisely the bill I would have written, or not precisely the \nbill the Presiding Officer or others on the floor would have written. \nBut it is a good bill. It is a balanced bill. It is a greatly improved \npiece of legislation. It is one that sets up the checks and balances \nnecessary in a democratic society that allow us to protect and preserve \nour security but also protect and preserve our liberties.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, shortly after the September 11 attack on \nAmerica, the President of the United States asked Congress to pass \nlegislation that would provide our law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies the tools they needed to wage war on the terrorists in our \nmidst. These tools represent the domestic complement to the weapons our \nmilitary currently is bringing to bear on the terrorists' associates \noverseas. At the same time, the President asked that, in crafting these \ntools, we remain vigilant in protecting the constitutional freedoms of \nall Americans--certainly of all law-abiding Americans.\n  After several weeks of negotiations with Chairman Leahy, the House of \nRepresentatives, and the administration, we have developed bipartisan \nconsensus legislation that will accomplish both of these goals. It \nenhances our ability to find, track, monitor, and prosecute terrorists \noperating here in the U.S. without in any way undermining civil \nliberties.\n  We can never know whether these tools would have prevented the attack \non America, but, as the Attorney General has said, it is certain that \nwithout these tools we did not stop the vicious acts of last month.\n  I personally believe that if these tools had been in law--and we have \nbeen trying to get them there for years--we would have caught those \nterrorists. If these tools could help us now to track down the \nperpetrators--if they will help us in our continued pursuit of \nterrorists--then we should not hesitate to enact these measures into \nlaw. God willing, the legislation we pass today will enhance our \nabilities to protect and prevent the American people from ever again \nbeing violated as we were on September 11.\n  This legislation truly represents the product of intense, yet \nbipartisan, negotiations. Senator Leahy and I carried out a painstaking \nreview of the antiterrorism proposal submitted by the administration. \nThere have been several hearings on this legislation in the Senate--not \njust this year, but in prior years--on some of the provisions and \nfeatures that we have in here, including discussions during the \nenactment of the 1996 Antiterrorism Effective Death Penalty Act, called \nthe Dole-Hatch bill.\n  We have heard from countless experts and advocates on all sides of \nthis issue in this debate. Of late, we have also worked closely with \nChairman Sensenbrenner in the House, Mr. Conyers, the ranking member on \nthe House Judiciary Committee, and others in our effort to complete \nlegislation that could receive near unanimous approval and support in \nthe Congress. Although I do not expect every Senator to vote in favor \nof this legislation, Senator Leahy and I have worked tirelessly to \naccommodate every concern. While Members ultimately may differ on some \nof these proposals, I know we all share the same overriding concern, \nand that is protecting our country from further harm.\n  The bill before us, which I hope we will pass today, differs in \nseveral respects from the legislation we passed in the Senate 2 weeks \nago. These changes result from negotiations with our House \ncounterparts, and some of the changes are certainly not objectionable. \nFor example, we have included language requiring prosecutors to notify \nFederal courts when they have disclosed grand jury information to other \nFederal agencies for national security purposes. Also, the bill \nincludes a provision requiring law enforcement to provide detailed \nreports concerning their use of the FBI's so-called Carnivore computer \nsurveillance system. These changes will properly encourage the law \nenforcement community to use these tools responsibly.\n  Unfortunately, not all of the changes are welcome. For instance, our \neffort to mitigate the unforeseen problems created by a change in the \nlaw governing the discipline of Federal prosecutors was rebuffed by the \nHouse of\n\n[[Page S11016]]\n\nRepresentatives. As a result, Federal prosecutors will continue to be \nhampered by the myriad and often contradictory State bar rules, and \nsometimes very politicized State bar rules. Even more alarming, Federal \nlaw enforcement authorities in the State of Oregon will continue to be \nprohibited from engaging in legitimate undercover activity--even \nundercover activity designed to infiltrate a terrorist cell. That is \nridiculous. Nevertheless, we could not get our House counterparts to \nresolve that problem.\n  Another troublesome change concerns the 4-year sunset provision. As \nmy colleagues know, the legislation that passed the Senate 2 weeks ago \nby a vote of 96-1 did not contain a sunset. This omission was \nintentional and wise. In my opinion, a sunset will undermine the \neffectiveness of the tools we are creating here and send the wrong \nmessage to the American public that somehow these tools are \nextraordinary.\n  One hardly understands the need to sunset legislation that both \nprovides critically necessary tools and protects our civil liberties. \nFurthermore, as the Attorney General stated, how can we sunset these \ntools when we know full well that the terrorists will not sunset their \nevil intentions? I sincerely hope we undertake a thorough review and \nfurther extend the legislation once the 4-year period expires. At \nleast, we will have 4 years of effective law enforcement against \nterrorism that we currently do not have.\n  Despite these provisions, the legislation before us today deserves \nunanimous support. The core provisions of the legislation we passed in \nthe Senate 2 weeks ago remain firmly in place. For instance, in the \nfuture, our law enforcement and intelligence communities will be able \nto share information and cooperate fully in protecting our Nation \nagainst terrorist attacks.\n\n  Our laws relating to electronic surveillance also will be updated. \nElectronic surveillance conducted under the supervision of a Federal \njudge happens to be one of the most powerful tools at the disposal of \nour law enforcement community. We now know that e-mail, cellular \ntelephones, and the Internet have been the principal tools used by \nterrorists to coordinate their attacks, and our law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies have been hamstrung by laws that were enacted \nlong before the advent of these technologies. This bill will modernize \nour laws so our law enforcement agencies can deal with the world as it \nis, rather than with the world as it existed 20 years ago.\n  Also, the legislation retains the compromise immigration proposals \nthat I negotiated with Senator Leahy, Senator Kennedy, Senator Kyl, \nSenator Brownback, and also Senator Feinstein, who has played a \nsignificant role. She and Senator Kyl have both played significant \nroles leading up to this particular bill, and over the last 5 years in \nparticular. We have worked hard to craft language that allows the \nAttorney General to be proactive, rather than reactive, without \nsacrificing the civil liberties of noncitizens.\n  In total, the amendments made by this legislation to the Immigration \nand Nationality Act reflect, and account for, the complex and often \nmutating nature of terrorist groups by expanding the class of \ninadmissible and deportable aliens and providing a workable mechanism \nby which the Attorney General may take into custody suspected alien \nterrorists. Further, the legislation breaks down some of the barriers \nthat have in the past prevented the State Department, the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service, the FBI, and others from effectively \ncommunicating with each other. If we are to fight terrorism, we cannot \nallow terrorists, or those who support terrorists, to enter or to \nremain in our country.\n  Finally, the bill provides the administration with powerful tools to \nattack the financial infrastructure of terrorism. For instance, the \nlegislation expands the President's authority to freeze the assets of \nterrorists and terrorist organizations and provides for the eventual \nseizure of such assets. These financial tools will give our Government \nthe ability to choke off the financing that these dangerous \norganizations need in order to survive.\n  The legislation provides numerous other tools--too many to mention \nhere--to aid our war against terrorism. Many of these were added at the \nrequest of our Senate colleagues, and I commend all of them for their \ninput.\n  Before I yield the floor, I must take a moment to acknowledge the \nhard work by my staff, the staff of Senator Leahy, and the \nrepresentatives of the administration, from the White House and the \nJustice Department and elsewhere, who were involved in the negotiation \nof this bill. These people have engaged in discussions literally around \nthe clock over the 6 weeks to produce this legislation. So I thank \neverybody who has worked on this legislation.\n  This is a major anticrime, antiterrorism bill. It is probably the \nmost important bill we will enact this year, certainly with regard to \nnational security and terrorism. I thank everybody involved, and I will \nmake further remarks about that later in the debate.\n  With that, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, it is my hope that today as we pass this \nantiterrorism legislation and as we will in future days take action on \nissues of resources to fight antiterrorism and changes in \norganizational structure, we will be making as significant a national \nstatement about our will and determination to eliminate the scourge of \nglobal terrorism as previous generations did about other scourges that \nafflicted our country.\n  It was not that long ago that America was beset by the scourge of \norganized crime. Many of our communities had been seriously invaded by \nthese insidious influences of organized crime. People, many of whom \noccupy the chairs that we now occupy in this very Chamber, decided a \nhalf century or more ago that was intolerable and we would take the \nnecessary steps to recapture the essential values of our country.\n  I think it is fair to say we live in a much safer and more secure \nAmerica because of those efforts. I hope that in years in the future \nthose who occupy this Chamber will look back with a similar belief that \nthe actions we are taking now have had a similar effect in terms of \nmaking this a more secure, not just America but world for our children \nand grandchildren.\n  With that hope, I wish to talk about a few of the provisions of this \nlegislation that relate directly to America's intelligence community \nand the role it will play in securing that future.\n  First, a bit of history. For most of America's history, we have been \nextremely uncomfortable with the idea of clandestine intelligence. It \nran contrary to our basic spirit of national openness. While the \nBritish have had a well-developed intelligence system since the \nNapoleonic wars, our first adventure in this field really is a product \nof the Second World War, and as soon as the war was over, the military \nintelligence services were essentially collapsed.\n  Two years later, President Truman recognized that with the advent of \nthe Soviet Union and the development of what we came to know as the \nIron Curtain that separated the Soviet Union from the free world, we \nwere going to have to have some capability to understand what this \nlarge adversary was about and therefore prepare ourselves. So in 1947 \nthe National Security Act was adopted which created the Central \nIntelligence Agency and from that the other intelligence agencies which \nnow constitute America's intelligence community.\n  For 40 years that intelligence community was focused on one target: \nthe Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies. We knew that community. \nThe United States had been dealing with Russia since even before John \nQuincy Adams was our Ambassador in St. Petersburg. It was a homogenous \nenemy. Most of the countries spoke Russian, and therefore if we had \ncommand of that language, we could understand what most of the Warsaw \nPact nations were saying. It was also an old style symmetrical enemy: \nWe were matching tanks for tanks, nukes for nukes.\n  With the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world changed in terms of \nintelligence requirements. Suddenly, instead of one enemy, we had \ndozens of enemies. Suddenly, instead of having command of one language \nwhich made us linguistically competent, there were scores of languages \nwe had to learn to speak. In\n\n[[Page S11017]]\n\nAfghanistan alone, there are more than a half dozen languages with \nwhich one must have some familiarity in order to understand what is \nbeing said there. And instead of symmetrical relationships, we now have \nsmall groups of a dozen or a hundred or a thousand or so against a \nnation the size of the United States of America. So our intelligence \ncommunity has been challenged to respond to this new reality. This \nlegislation is going to accelerate that response.\n\n  Let me focus, in my limited time, on three areas within this \nlegislation that I think will be significantly beneficial.\n  The first goes to the reality that we have had, in large part, out of \nthis history of unease with dealing with clandestine information, an \norientation to treat terrorist activities as crimes and put up yellow \ntape, secure the crime scene, hold the information very close because \nwe did not want to have it infected so that the evidence could not be \nused at a subsequent trial that would lead to the conviction of the \nperpetrator. In the course of that, we also shut off the ability to \nshare information which might allow us to anticipate the future actions \nof those same perpetrators and interdict an act of terrorism before it \nhad occurred.\n  We take some significant steps to overcome that orientation by the \nprovisions contained in this legislation which will require the sharing \nof criminal justice information with intelligence agencies. I \nunderscore the word ``require'' because even as recently as today's \nWashington Post, there is an article describing the legislation which \nuses the term ``the authority to share,'' as if this were a permissive \nrequirement.\n  In fact, the legislation very explicitly makes it mandatory. I refer \nto page 308 beginning at line 9 where it states that the Attorney \nGeneral or the head of any other Department or Agency of the Federal \nGovernment with law enforcement responsibilities shall --shall--\nexpeditiously disclose to the Director of Central Intelligence pursuant \nto guidelines developed foreign intelligence acquired by an element of \nthe Department of Justice or any element of such Department or Agency, \nas the case may be, in the course of a criminal investigation.\n  We are closing that gap which has in the past been a major source of \nlimitation and frustration to our ability to predict and interdict \nfuture actions.\n  Second, we are dealing with the issue of the empowerment of the \nDirector of Central Intelligence. We tend to think of the CIA as being \nthe lead agency for our intelligence community. In fact, that is not \ncorrect. If one looks at an organizational chart, across the top is the \nDirector of Central Intelligence. Under the Director of Central \nIntelligence is a series of agencies, of which the CIA is one, which \nhave operational responsibility.\n  If one looks at that chart, one assumes the Director of Central \nIntelligence is the head coach, the leader with the ability to command \nand control the intelligence community. In fact, because of other \nauthorities, including budget authority and personnel authorities and \nsome culture of individuality by agencies, the Director of Central \nIntelligence has not been fully empowered.\n  We take a step in this legislation towards giving the Director of \nCentral Intelligence greater authority and in a very significant area. \nWe have a limited capability to eavesdrop on the communication of \npotential adversaries, including terrorists. Under the current \nstructure, it is primarily the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, which actually operates and targets our electronic \nsurveillance, as to which target will be listened to first if we cannot \nlisten to everybody because we do not have, for instance, enough people \nwho can understand the exotic language in which the communication is \nbeing spoken.\n  This legislation will establish the fact it is the Director of \nCentral Intelligence who will decide what the strategic priorities for \nthe use of our electronic surveillance will be. So if the Director of \nCentral Intelligence is aware we face a terrorist attack from a \nspecific terrorist organization which speaks a specific language, those \ncommunications will be given the priority for purposes of how we will \nuse our available electronic surveillance capability.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence will then also, at the back end \nof that process, have the primary responsibility for determining how to \ndisseminate that information. The nightmare that exists, and will exist \nuntil we complete a full review of what happened on September 11, is we \nare going to find someplace a tape of a conversation we secured which \nwill disclose what would have been key information as to what was being \nprepared, what plot was being matured which resulted in the terror of \nSeptember 11.\n  These provisions are intended to prioritize, on the front end, what \nwe will gather information against and, on the back end, who will be \nfirst in line to get the information that has come from that \nsurveillance.\n  A third provision goes to the criticism that the intelligence \ncommunity has become risk adverse; that we have been reticent to take \non the hardest targets because they are hard, because they may result \nin failure and nonaccomplishment of the mission. As President Kennedy \nsaid as we started our space program, we start this not because it is \neasy but because it is hard and it will challenge us to our fullest.\n  One of the areas in which we have become risk adverse has been the \narea of hiring foreign nationals to do work which it is very difficult \nfor Americans to do, not because we are not smart, capable people, but \nif we are going to hire someone or secure the services of someone who \ncan get close to an ominous figure such as Osama bin Laden, frankly, it \nis probably somebody who is pretty similar to bin Laden. It is someone \nwho can gain his confidence. That may well mean he has been an \nassociate of bin Laden in the past, has engaged in some of the \nactivities we so abhor.\n  Today there is a sense within the intelligence community we should \nnot hire people who have that kind of background because they are \npotentially unreliable but also because they bring a dirty background.\n  This legislation, through a sense-of-the-Congress statement, reverses \nthat and says our priority goal in employing persons to assist in our \nantiterrorism activity should be to acquire services of persons who can \nbe of greatest assistance to us in determining the plans and intentions \nof the terrorists, even if it means we might have to hire someone with \nwhom we would not personally like to have a social or other \nrelationship.\n  That is a statement of our commitment to this intelligence community; \nthat we, the Congress, are prepared to back them up when they take some \nof these high-risk undertakings and that we will understand there is \nthe risk of failure but it is better to risk failure than to be cowered \nby the unwillingness to engage in important but high-risk ventures.\n  So those are three illustrative provisions which are in the \nintelligence section of this legislation, which I think have the \npotential of the same impact on our capacity to rid the world of the \nscourge of terrorism as similar actions have so contributed to our \nability to reduce the influence of organized crime within this Nation.\n  I urge the adoption of this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank my colleague, Senator Hatch \nof Utah, for giving me time to speak in support of the bill. I want to \nparticularly direct attention to the immigration provisions in the \nbill.\n  Last month, our Nation was attacked by extremists who hoped to \nundermine our way of life and the liberties we enjoy. These individuals \nand the groups they represent want our country to recoil in terror and \ncapitulate to fear. This we will not do.\n  We have before us today legislation that stands firm before those who \nmean us harm. This antiterrorism package, the product of an earnest \nbipartisan effort, is an intelligent and thorough response to the \nimmediate security needs of our Nation. I commend in particular the \nimmigration provisions of this legislation, which will strengthen our \nimmigration laws to better combat terrorism.\n\n[[Page S11018]]\n\n  My heartfelt gratitude is to my colleagues on the Immigration \nSubcommittee and to the committee's leadership--Senator Hatch, Senator \nLeahy, and others--for their dedication and diligence in crafting what \nI think is fine legislation.\n  This antiterrorist package will enhance the ability of our consuls \noverseas and our immigration officers at home to intercept and remove \nboth alien terrorists and those who support them. This is a daunting \ntask.\n  We had a hearing last week on trying to intercept people coming into \nthis country who mean us harm, and it is difficult in the sense we have \nnearly 350 million people a year, non-U.S. citizens, who enter this \ncountry, and we are looking for those few who mean us harm. This is a \ndifficult task. This legislation helps to make it easier. We are \nlooking for a needle in a haystack, and this legislation helps us in \nfinding that or gives us a bigger magnet to be able to find it.\n  This legislation will capture not only those individuals who commit \nacts of terror but also those who enhance, enable, and finance them. It \ndoes so through several forceful changes to our current immigration \nlaws. Among those changes is an expanded definition of terrorism, one \nthat encompasses not only the acts of terrorism but the network of \nterrorism.\n  This legislation will also permit the Attorney General to promptly \ntake into custody and detain those aliens who pose a threat to the \nsafety or security of this Nation. At the same time, it will provide \nthe Secretary of State with better information and better tools to \nidentify terrorists and to deny them access to our country.\n  Perhaps most important of all, this legislation will improve the flow \nof information between the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the \nDepartment of State, and the law enforcement and intelligence \ncommunities. This is important. What we have is several stovepipes of \ninformation, and we need to be able to get those collected to be able \nto stop the terrorists before they enter our land.\n  This increased flow of information will allow those agencies tasked \nwith protecting our borders to better coordinate and thereby thwart any \nterrorist seeking to reach our shores. This is not to say this \nlegislation is unmindful of innocent visitors or the lawful permanent \nresidents of our country. To the contrary. These immigration \nprovisions contain appropriate safeguards to protect the liberties of \npersons whom we want in this country.\n\n  I am pleased to report this legislation is carefully crafted to \ncombat terrorism without compromising the values or the economy of the \nUnited States or the values that guide our immigration laws. This \nlegislation represents a profound and essential improvement in our \nimmigration laws. We need these changes if our immigration laws are to \nbe an effective defense against the threat of terrorism we face today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation and note as well we \nare continuing to refine further other potential areas where we can \nmake changes in our immigration laws to better be able to catch those \nwho seek to enter our country to do us harm. Senator Kennedy and I are \nworking on bipartisan legislation to do just that. We hope to introduce \nthis next week.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to address my colleagues on this \nimportant legislation. I reserve the remainder of our time, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may need.\n  I see the Senator from Wisconsin, so I am only going to take 2 or 3 \nminutes at this point.\n  A number of Senators have asked some of the areas where this changes. \nWe had a separate, bipartisan, bicameral negotiation, and we shaped and \nchanged the legislation as originally proposed by the Attorney General \nand the administration. I will speak at greater length as we go on.\n  We improved security on the northern border, the 4,000-mile wonderful \nborder between our country and Canada, another democratic nation. The \nState of the Presiding Officer borders Canada, as does mine. It is just \na short drive from the Canadian border. Many members of my wife's \nfamily came from Canada. We have always had historic and economic ties \nwith Canada. Partly because we have taken so much for granted, we have \nalso shortchanged this relationship. We should look at the border for \nour sake and for the sake of Canada. We have greatly improved security \non the northern border by adding better technology, more Customs and \nINS agents. That helps.\n  We added something the administration did not include--money \nlaundering. I learned as a prosecutor--and most Members know this--if \nyou want to learn something, follow the money. If you want to stop \nterrorism, one way is to cut off the money supply.\n  Third, we have added programs to enhance information sharing in \ncoordination with State and local law enforcement, grants for local \ngovernments to respond to bioterrorism, to increase payments to \nfamilies of fallen firefighters, police officers, and other public \nsafety officers. That is important.\n  Cooperation is necessary. The mayor of New York City, Mayor Giuliani, \ncalled me saying the police commissioner has justifiable concerns about \nthe previous lack of cooperation from the Federal Government in their \nown antiterrorism efforts, although New York City has one of the best \nantiterrorist units in the country. The mayor of Baltimore has called, \nas have other mayors.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Washington \nPost op-ed piece by Robert D. Novak in today's paper entitled ``Same \nOld FBI.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Same Old FBI\n\n       Behind the facade of cooperation following the Sept. 11 \n     attacks, less than amicable relations between New York Mayor \n     Rudolph Giuliani and the FBI have further deteriorated. \n     According to New York City sources, the mayor has engaged in \n     more than one shouting match with FBI Assistant Director \n     Barry Mawn.\n       It's the same old problem because it's the same old FBI. \n     Newly appointed, much acclaimed Director Robert Mueller makes \n     little difference. The bureau refuses to share information \n     with local police agencies. It won't permit security \n     clearances for high local officials. Law enforcement officers \n     around the country say that attitude lent itself to \n     catastrophe on Sept. 11 and could permit further disasters.\n       Last Friday in Washington, Mueller--amiable and agreeable--\n     sat down with big city police chiefs and promised things will \n     get better. The chiefs doubt whether Mueller or Tom Ridge, \n     the new homeland security director, can change the bureau's \n     culture, described to me by one police chief as ``elitist and \n     arrogant.'' Efforts to enlist members of Congress into \n     pressing for reform find politicians awed by the FBI \n     mystique.\n       The FBI's big national security section in New York City \n     long has grappled with the New York Police Department. ``the \n     FBI's attitude has been that if you need to know, we'll tell \n     you,'' one New York police source told me. That ``need'' \n     never occurs, with the FBI adamant against any local anti-\n     terrorism activity. The locals, in turn, complain about the \n     feds failing to follow important leads.\n       Giuliani is not venting his outrage in this time of crisis, \n     but sources report a high private decibel level by the mayor. \n     The complaint to Mawn is that the NYPD is out of the loop, \n     its senior officers not even granted security clearances.\n       Such complaints are common across the country, but only a \n     few police chiefs speak publicly--notably Edward Norris of \n     Baltimore (who complained in congressional testimony), \n     Michael Chitwood of Portland, Maine, and Dan Oates of Ann \n     Arbor, Mich.\n       Chitwood's experience is most bizarre. He was infuriated to \n     learn that the FBI knew of a visit to Portland by two Sept. \n     11 hijackers but did not inform him. When his police pursued \n     a witness of that visit, the FBI threatened to arrest the \n     chief. ``I ignored them,'' Chitwood told me. Has cooperation \n     with the bureau improved? ``Not a bit,'' he said. Only \n     Tuesday he learned from reading his local newspaper about a \n     plane under federal surveillance parked at the Portland \n     airport for seven weeks.\n       Oates is familiar with the FBI, having tried to work with \n     the feds during 21 years with the NYPD before retiring this \n     year to go to Ann Arbor. As a deputy chief who was commanding \n     officer of NYPD intelligence, he describes the FBI as \n     ``obsessed with turf.''\n       Closing doors to police officers particularly infuriates \n     Oates. ``The security clearance issue is a tired old excuse \n     that allows the FBI not to share,'' he told me. ``They should \n     hand out 10,000 security clearances to cops around the \n     country.'' Oates and other police chiefs believe Sept. 11 \n     might have been averted had the FBI alerted local police \n     agencies about a Minnesota flight school's report of an Arab \n     who wanted instructions for steering a big jet but not for \n     landing or taking off.\n       Police chiefs would open the FBI to the same probing of \n     decisions and actions that they routinely perform after the \n     fact. They\n\n[[Page S11019]]\n\n     also would like the same rules for the bureau that govern \n     most of the nation's police departments. In the FBI, nobody \n     takes the fall for blundering.\n       A promise that things will change in the FBI was implicit \n     in Director Mueller's remarks to city police chiefs last \n     Friday. Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Timoney, \n     another NYPD veteran who is more cautious in his criticism of \n     the feds than his former colleague Oates, sounded skeptical \n     after the meeting. ``I'm hopeful,'' he told me, but he would \n     make no predictions.\n       What he hopes for is the safety of the American people. The \n     police chiefs of America want a top-to-bottom cleaning of the \n     FBI that will require leadership from the Oval Office. If \n     George W. Bush doubts the urgency, he should talk to Rudy \n     Giulianai.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. We have to dramatically increase that cooperation or stop \nthe noncooperation and start cooperating.\n  We have added humanitarian relief to immigrant victims of the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks. A lot of immigrants became victims of \nthat attack. They suddenly became orphans or were spouses of people \nkilled.\n  We added help to the FBI to hire translators. I shudder to think how \nmuch information was available before September 11 that was never \ntranslated that might have prevented this.\n  We have added more comprehensive victims assistance; measures to \nfight cyber-crime; measures to fight terrorism against mass \ntransportation systems; important measures to use technology to make \nour borders more secure.\n  Last, Madam President, and I cannot emphasize this enough, the Senate \nshould never give a blank check to our law enforcement or to any \nPresident or Attorney General of either party. We have to protect the \nliberties of our people. Who watches the watchers? We watch.\n  I said earlier, as Benjamin Franklin once said, a nation that would \ntrade its liberties for security deserves neither.\n  We can have our security and we can protect our liberties but only if \nwe have adequate checks and balances. People who are professional law \nenforcement say give us the checks and balances. We give enormous power \nto Federal, State, and local law enforcement, but with that there have \nto be checks and balances. We have all seen times where if law \nenforcement is unchecked, innocent people can be hurt.\n  I was a prosecutor for 8 years, and I know we have to have checks and \nbalances. We have done that. You cannot simply have a case and say: Do \nthis, we will set aside this pesky Constitution for the moment.\n  We cannot do that. We built in checks and balances that were not in \nthe original proposal. Ultimately, that will be the best thing for the \ncountry.\n  We will give law enforcement translators, tools, computers, and other \nthings necessary to help them. We stand united as a nation. We know the \nonly way to protect ourselves is to stop the terrorists before they \nstrike. Going to the funerals after the strike is too late. We will do \nthat, but we will do it protecting the foundations of our Constitution \nand freedom which made us such a great democracy in the first place.\n  None of us have any idea how long we will be in the Senate. I hope my \ncolleagues are willing to stay here as long as they can. When I leave \nthe Senate, as I will, I want to leave knowing I have done my best to \nprotect our freedoms. I have said over and over again, the Senate is \nthe conscience of the Nation. As much as any piece of legislation, this \nhas to reflect our conscience.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I have asked for this time to speak \nabout the antiterrorism bill, H.R. 3162. As we address this bill, of \ncourse, we are especially mindful of the terrible events of September \n11 and beyond, which led to this bill's proposal and its quick \nconsideration in the Congress.\n  This has been a tragic time in our country. Before I discuss this \nbill, let me first pause to remember, through one small story, how \nSeptember 11 has irrevocably changed so many lives. In a letter to the \nWashington Post recently, a man, as he went jogging near the Pentagon, \ncame across the makeshift memorial built for those who lost their \nlives. He slowed to a walk as he took in the sight before him, the red, \nwhite, and blue flowers covering the structure. Off to the side, was a \nsmaller memorial with a card that read: Happy birthday, Mommy. Although \nyou died and are no longer with me, I feel as if I still have you in my \nlife. I think about you every day.\n  After reading the card, the man felt as if he were ``drowning in the \nnames of dead mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters.'' The author of \nthis letter shared a moment in his own life that so many of us have \nhad, the moment where televised pictures of the destruction are made \npainfully real to us. You read a card, see the anguished face of a \nloved one, and then, suddenly, we feel the enormity of what has \nhappened to so many American families and to all of us as a people.\n  We also had our initial reactions to the attack. My first and most \npowerful emotion was a solemn resolve to stop these terrorists. That \nremains my principal reaction to these events. But I also quickly \nrealized, as many did, that two cautions were necessary. I raised them \non the Senate floor the day after the attacks.\n  The first caution was that we must continue to respect our \nConstitution and protect our civil liberties in the wake of the \nattacks.\n  As the chairman of the Constitution subcommittee of the Judiciary \nCommittee I recognize fully that this is a different world, with \ndifferent technologies, different issues, and different threats.\n  Yet we must examine every item that is proposed in response to these \nevents to be sure we are not rewarding these terrorists and weakening \nourselves by giving up the cherished freedoms that they seek to \ndestroy.\n  The second caution I issued was a warning against the mistreatment of \nArab Americans, Muslim Americans, South Asians, or others in this \ncountry. Already, one day after the attacks, we were hearing news \nreports that misguided anger against people of these backgrounds had \nled to harassment, violence, and even death.\n  I suppose I was reacting instinctively to the unfolding events in the \nspirit of the Irish statesman John Philpot Curran, who said:\n\n       The condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is \n     eternal vigilance.\n\n  During those first few hours after the attacks, I kept remembering a \nsentence from a case I had studied in law school. Not surprisingly, I \ndidn't remember which case it was, who wrote the opinion, or what it \nwas about, but I did remember these words:\n\n       While the Constitution protects against invasions of \n     individual rights, it is not a suicide pact.\n\n  I took these words as a challenge to my concerns about civil \nliberties at such a momentous time in our history; that we must be \ncareful to not take civil liberties so literally that we allow \nourselves to be destroyed.\n  But upon reviewing the case itself, Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, I \nfound that Justice Arthur Goldberg had made this statement but then \nruled in favor of the civil liberties position in the case, which was \nabout draft evasion. He elaborated:\n\n       It is fundamental that the great powers of Congress to \n     conduct war and to regulate the Nation's foreign relations \n     are subject to the constitutional requirements of due \n     process. The imperative necessity for safeguarding these \n     rights to procedural due process under the gravest of \n     emergencies has existed throughout our constitutional \n     history, for it is then, under the pressing exigencies of \n     crisis, that there is the greatest temptation to dispense \n     with fundamental constitutional guarantees which, it is \n     feared, will inhibit governmental action.\n\n  The Justice continued:\n\n       The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers \n     and people, equally in war and peace, and covers with the \n     shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, \n     and under all circumstances . . . In no other way can we \n     transmit to posterity unimpaired the blessings of liberty, \n     consecrated by the sacrifices of the Revolution.\n\n  I have approached the events of the past month and my role in \nproposing and reviewing legislation relating to it in this spirit. I \nbelieve we must, we must, redouble our vigilance. We must redouble our \nvigilance to ensure our security and to prevent further acts of terror. \nBut we must also redouble our vigilance to preserve our values and the \nbasic rights that make us who we are.\n  The Founders who wrote our Constitution and Bill of Rights exercised \nthat vigilance even though they had recently fought and won the \nRevolutionary War. They did not live in comfortable and easy times of \nhypothetical\n\n[[Page S11020]]\n\nenemies. They wrote a Constitution of limited powers and an explicit \nBill of Rights to protect liberty in times of war, as well as in times \nof peace.\n  Of course, there have been periods in our nation's history when civil \nliberties have taken a back seat to what appeared at the time to be the \nlegitimate exigencies of war. Our national consciousness still bears \nthe stain and the scars of those events: The Alien and Sedition Acts, \nthe suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War, the internment of \nJapanese-Americans, German-Americans, and Italian-Americans during \nWorld War II, the blacklisting of supposed communist sympathizers \nduring the McCarthy era, and the surveillance and harassment of antiwar \nprotesters, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., during the Vietnam \nWar. We must not allow these pieces of our past to become prologue.\n  Even in our great land, wartime has sometimes brought us the greatest \ntests of our Bill of Rights. For example, during the Civil War, the \nGovernment arrested some 13,000 civilians, implementing a system akin \nto martial law. President Lincoln issued a proclamation ordering the \narrest and military trial of any persons ``discouraging volunteer \nenlistments, or resisting militia drafts.'' Wisconsin provided one of \nthe first challenges of this order. Draft protests rose up in Milwaukee \nand Sheboygan. And an anti-draft riot broke out among Germans and \nLuxembourgers in Port Washington, WI. When the government arrested one \nof the leaders of the riot, his attorney sought a writ of habeas \ncorpus. His military captors said that the President had abolished the \nwrit. The Wisconsin Supreme Court was among the first to rule that the \nPresident had exceeded his authority.\n  In 1917, the Postmaster General revoked the mailing privileges of the \nnewspaper the Milwaukee Leader because he felt that some of its \narticles impeded the war effort and the draft. Articles called the \nPresident an aristocrat and called the draft oppressive. Over dissents \nby Justices Brandeis and Holmes, the Supreme Court upheld the action.\n  We all know during World War II, President Roosevelt signed orders to \nincarcerate more than 110,000 people of Japanese origin, as well as \nsome roughly 11,000 of German origin and 3,000 of Italian origin.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced legislation to set up a commission to \nreview the wartime treatment of Germans, Italians, and other Europeans \nduring that period. That bill came out of heartfelt meetings in which \nconstituents told me their stories. They were German-Americans, who \ncame to me with some trepidation. They had waited 50 years to raise the \nissue with a member of Congress. They did not want compensation. But \nthey had seen the Government's commission on the wartime internment of \npeople of Japanese origin, and they wanted their story to be told, and \nan official acknowledgment as well with regard to what had happened to \nthem. I hope, that we will move to pass this important legislation \nearly next year. We must deal with our nation's past, even as we move \nto ensure our nation's future.\n  (Mrs. STABENOW assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Now some may say, indeed we may hope, that we have come \na long way since those days of infringements on civil liberties. But \nthere is ample reason for concern. And I have been troubled in the past \n6 weeks by the potential loss of commitment in the Congress and the \ncountry to traditional civil liberties.\n  As it seeks to combat terrorism, the Justice Department is making \nextraordinary use of its power to arrest and detain individuals, \njailing hundreds of people on immigration violations and arresting more \nthan a dozen ``material witnesses'' not charged with any crime. \nAlthough the Government has used these authorities before, it has not \ndone so on such a broad scale. Judging from Government announcements, \nthe Government has not brought any criminal charges related to the \nattacks with regard to the overwhelming majority of these detainees.\n\n  For example, the FBI arrested as a material witness the San Antonio \nradiologist Albader Al-Hazmi, who has a name like two of the hijackers, \nand who tried to book a flight to San Diego for a medical conference. \nAccording to his lawyer, the Government held Al-Hazmi incommunicado \nafter his arrest, and it took 6 days for lawyers to get access to him. \nAfter the FBI released him, his lawyer said:\n\n       This is a good lesson about how frail our processes are. \n     It's how we treat people in difficult times like these that \n     is the true test of the democracy and civil liberties that we \n     brag so much about throughout the world.\n\n  I agree with those statements.\n  Now, it so happens--and I know the Presiding Officer is aware of that \nbecause she has been very helpful on this issue--that since early 1999, \nI have been working on another bill that is poignantly relevant to \nrecent events: legislation to prohibit racial profiling, especially the \npractice of targeting pedestrians or drivers for stops and searches \nbased on the color of their skin. Before September 11, people spoke of \nthe issue mostly in the context of African-Americans and Latino-\nAmericans who had been profiled. But after September 11, the issue has \ntaken on a new context and a new urgency.\n  Even as America addresses the demanding security challenges before \nus, we must strive mightily also to guard our values and basic rights. \nWe must guard against racism and ethnic discrimination against people \nof Arab and South Asian origin and those who are Muslim.\n  We who do not have Arabic names or do not wear turbans or headscarves \nmay not feel the weight of these times as much as Americans from the \nMiddle East and South Asia do. But as the great jurist Learned Hand \nsaid in a speech in New York's Central Park during World War II:\n\n       The spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to \n     understand the minds of other men and women; the spirit of \n     liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside \n     its own without bias. . . .\n\n  Was it not at least partially bias, however, when passengers on a \nNorthwest Airlines flight in Minneapolis a month ago insisted that \nNorthwest remove from the plane three Arab men who had cleared \nsecurity?\n  Of course, given the enormous anxiety and fears generated by the \nevents of September 11, it would not have been difficult to anticipate \nsome of these reactions, both by our government and some of our people. \nSome have said rather cavalierly that in these difficult times we must \naccept some reduction in our civil liberties in order to be secure.\n  Of course, there is no doubt that if we lived in a police state, it \nwould be easier to catch terrorists. If we lived in a country that \nallowed the police to search your home at any time for any reason; if \nwe lived in a country that allowed the government to open your mail, \neavesdrop on your phone conversations, or intercept your email \ncommunications; if we lived in a country that allowed the government to \nhold people in jail indefinitely based on what they write or think, or \nbased on mere suspicion that they are up to no good, then the \ngovernment would no doubt discover and arrest more terrorists.\n  But that probably would not be a country in which we would want to \nlive. And that would not be a country for which we could, in good \nconscience, ask our young people to fight and die. In short, that would \nnot be America.\n  Preserving our freedom is one of the main reasons we are now engaged \nin this new war on terrorism. We will lose that war without firing a \nshot if we sacrifice the liberties of the American people.\n  That is why I found the antiterrorism bill originally proposed by \nAttorney General Ashcroft and President Bush to be troubling.\n  The administration's proposed bill contained vast new powers for law \nenforcement, some seemingly drafted in haste and others that came from \nthe FBI's wish list that Congress has rejected in the past. You may \nremember that the Attorney General announced his intention to introduce \na bill shortly after the September 11 attacks. He provided the text of \nthe bill the following Wednesday, and urged Congress to enact it by the \nend of the week. That was plainly impossible, but the pressure to move \non this bill quickly, without deliberation and debate, has been \nrelentless ever since.\n  It is one thing to shortcut the legislative process in order to get \nFederal financial aid to the cities hit by terrorism. We did that, and \nno one complained that we moved too quickly. It\n\n[[Page S11021]]\n\nis quite another to press for the enactment of sweeping new powers for \nlaw enforcement that directly affect the civil liberties of the \nAmerican people without due deliberation by the peoples' elected \nrepresentatives.\n  Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed at least to some extent, and \nwhile this bill has been on a fast track, there has been time to make \nsome changes and reach agreement on a bill that is less objectionable \nthan the bill that the administration originally proposed.\n  As I will discuss in a moment, I have concluded that this bill still \ndoes not strike the right balance between empowering law enforcement \nand protecting civil liberties. But that does not mean that I oppose \neverything in the bill. By no means. Indeed many of its provisions are \nentirely reasonable, and I hope they will help law enforcement more \neffectively counter the threat of terrorism.\n  For example, it is entirely appropriate that with a warrant the FBI \nbe able to seize voice mail messages as well as tap a phone. It is also \nreasonable, even necessary, to update the federal criminal offense \nrelating to possession and use of biological weapons. It made sense to \nmake sure that phone conversations carried over cables would not have \nmore protection from surveillance than conversations carried over phone \nlines. And it made sense to stiffen penalties and lengthen or eliminate \nstatutes of limitation for certain terrorist crimes.\n  There are other non-controversial provisions in the bill that I \nsupport--those to assist the victims of crime, to streamline the \napplication process for public safety officers benefits and increase \nthose benefits, to provide more funds to strengthen immigration \ncontrols at our Northern borders--something that the Presiding Officer \nand I understand--to expedite the hiring of translators at the FBI, and \nmany other such provisions.\n\n  In the end, however, my focus on this bill, as Chair of the \nConstitution Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee in the Senate, was \non those provisions that implicate our constitutional freedoms. And it \nwas in reviewing those provisions that I came to feel that the \nadministration's demand for haste was inappropriate; indeed, it was \ndangerous. Our process in the Senate, as truncated as it was, did lead \nto the elimination or significant rewriting of a number of audacious \nproposals that I and many other members found objectionable.\n  For example, the original administration proposal contained a \nprovision that would have allowed the use in U.S. criminal proceedings \nagainst U.S. citizens of information obtained by foreign law \nenforcement agencies in wiretaps that would be illegal in this country. \nIn other words, evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search \noverseas was to be allowed in a U.S. court.\n  Another provision would have broadened the criminal forfeiture laws \nto permit--prior to conviction--the freezing of assets entirely \nunrelated to an alleged crime. The Justice Department has wanted this \nauthority for years, and Congress has never been willing to give it. \nFor one thing, it touches on the right to counsel, since assets that \nare frozen cannot be used to pay a lawyer. The courts have almost \nuniformly rejected efforts to restrain assets before conviction unless \nthey are assets gained in the alleged criminal enterprise. This \nproposal, in my view, was simply an effort on the part of the \nDepartment to take advantage of the emergency situation and get \nsomething that they've wanted to get for a long time.\n  As I have indicated, the foreign wiretap and criminal forfeiture \nprovisions were dropped from the bill that we considered in the Senate. \nOther provisions were rewritten based on objections that I and others \nraised about them. For example, the original bill contained sweeping \npermission for the Attorney General to get copies of educational \nrecords without a court order. The final bill requires a court order \nand a certification by the Attorney General that he has reason to \nbelieve that the records contain information that is relevant to an \ninvestigation of terrorism.\n  So the bill before us is certainly improved from the bill that the \nadministration sent to us on September 19, and wanted us to pass on \nSeptember 21. But again, in my judgement, it does not strike the right \nbalance between empowering law enforcement and protecting \nconstitutional freedoms. Let me take a moment to discuss some of the \nshortcomings of the bill.\n  First, the bill contains some very significant changes in criminal \nprocedure that will apply to every federal criminal investigation in \nthis country, not just those involving terrorism. One provision would \ngreatly expand the circumstances in which law enforcement agencies can \nsearch homes and offices without notifying the owner prior to the \nsearch. The longstanding practice under the fourth amendment of serving \na warrant prior to executing a search could be easily avoided in \nvirtually every case, because the government would simply have to show \nthat it had ``reasonable cause to believe'' that providing notice `may' \nseriously jeopardize an investigation.'' This is a significant \ninfringement on personal liberty.\n\n  Notice is a key element of fourth amendment protections. It allows a \nperson to point out mistakes in a warrant and to make sure that a \nsearch is limited to the terms of a warrant. Just think about the \npossibility of the police showing up at your door with a warrant to \nsearch your house. You look at the warrant and say, ``yes, that's my \naddress, but the name on the warrant isn't me.'' And the police realize \na mistake has been made and go away. If you're not home, and the police \nhave received permission to do a ``sneak and peek'' search, they can \ncome in your house, look around, and leave, and may never have to tell \nyou that ever happened.\n  That bothers me. I bet it bothers most Americans.\n  Another very troubling provision has to do with the effort to combat \ncomputer crime. I want the effort to stop computer crime. The bill \nallows law enforcement to monitor a computer with the permission of its \nowner or operator, without the need to get a warrant or show probable \ncause.\n  I want to tell you, Madam President, I have been at pains to point \nout things I can support in this bill. I think that power is fine in a \ncase of a so-called denial of service attack. What is that? That is \nplain old computer hacking. You bet. We need to be able to get at that \nkind of crime.\n  Computer owners should be able to give the police permission to \nmonitor communications coming from what amounts to a trespasser on the \ncomputer, a real trespasser.\n  But we tried to point out as calmly and as constructively as possible \non the floor that, as drafted in this bill, the provision might permit \nan employer to give permission to the police to monitor the e-mails of \nan employee who has used her computer at work to shop for Christmas \ngifts. She violated the rules of her employer regarding personal use of \nthe computer. Or someone who uses a computer at a library or at a \nschool and happens to go to a gambling or pornography site in violation \nof the Internet use policies of the library or the university might \nalso be subjected to Government surveillance--without probable cause \nand without any time limit at all. With this one provision, fourth \namendment protections are potentially eliminated for a broad spectrum \nof electronic communications.\n  I am also very troubled by the broad expansion of Government power \nunder the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, known as FISA. When \nCongress passed FISA in 1978, it granted to the executive branch the \npower to conduct surveillance in foreign intelligence investigations \nwithout having to meet the rigorous probable cause standard under the \nfourth amendment that is required for criminal investigations. There is \na lower threshold for obtaining a wiretap order from the FISA court \nbecause the FBI is not investigating a crime, it is investigating \nforeign intelligence activities. But the law currently requires that \nintelligence gathering be the primary purpose of the investigation in \norder for this much lower standard to apply.\n  The bill changes that requirement. The Government now will only have \nto show that intelligence is a ``significant purpose'' of the \ninvestigation. So even if the primary purpose is a criminal \ninvestigation, the heightened protections of the fourth amendment will \nnot apply.\n  It seems obvious that with this lower standard, the FBI will be able \nto try to\n\n[[Page S11022]]\n\nuse FISA as much as it can. And, of course, with terrorism \ninvestigations, that won't be difficult because the terrorists are \napparently sponsored or at least supported by foreign governments. So \nthis means the fourth amendment rights will be significantly curtailed \nin many investigations of terrorist acts.\n  The significance of the breakdown of the distinction between \nintelligence and criminal investigations becomes apparent when you see \nother expansions of Government power under FISA in this bill.\n  Another provision that troubles me a lot is one that permits the \nGovernment, under FISA, to compel the production of records from any \nbusiness regarding any person if that information is sought in \nconnection with an investigation of terrorism or espionage.\n  I want to be clear here, as well, we are not talking about travel \nrecords directly pertaining to a terrorist suspect, which we can all \nsee obviously can be highly relevant to an investigation of a terrorist \nplot. FISA already gives the FBI the power to get airline, train, \nhotel, car rental, and other records of a suspect.\n  But this bill does much more. Under this bill, the Government can \ncompel the disclosure of the personal records of anyone--perhaps \nsomeone who worked with, or lived next door to, or went to school with, \nor sat on an airplane with, or had been seen in the company of, or \nwhose phone number was called by--the target of the investigation.\n\n  Under this new provision, all business records can be compelled, \nincluding those containing sensitive personal information, such as \nmedical records from hospitals or doctors, or educational records, or \nrecords of what books somebody has taken out from the library. We are \nnot talking about terrorist suspects, we are talking about people who \njust may have come into some kind of casual contact with the person in \nthat situation. This is an enormous expansion of authority under a law \nthat provides only minimal judicial supervision.\n  Under this provision, the Government can apparently go on a fishing \nexpedition and collect information on virtually anyone. All it has to \nallege, in order to get an order for these records from the court, is \nthat the information is sought for an investigation of international \nterrorism or clandestine intelligence gathering. That is it. They just \nhave to say that. On that minimal showing, in an ex parte application \nto a secret court, with no showing even that the information is \nrelevant to the investigation, the Government can lawfully compel a \ndoctor or a hospital to release medical records or a library to release \ncirculation records. This is truly a breathtaking expansion of police \npower.\n  Let me turn to a final area of real concern about this legislation, \nwhich I think brings us full circle to the cautions I expressed on the \nday after the attacks. These are two very troubling provisions dealing \nwith our immigration laws in the bill.\n  First, the administration's original proposal would have granted the \nAttorney General extraordinary powers to detain immigrants \nindefinitely, including legal permanent residents. The Attorney General \ncould do so based on mere suspicion that the person is engaged in \nterrorism. I believe the administration was really overreaching here. I \nam pleased that our distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Leahy, was able to negotiate some protections. The bill now \nrequires the Attorney General to charge the immigrant within 7 days \nwith a criminal offense or immigration violation. In the event the \nAttorney General does not charge the immigrant, the immigrant must be \nreleased.\n  This protection is an improvement, but the provision remains \nfundamentally flawed. Even with this 7-day charging requirement, the \nbill would nevertheless continue to permit the indefinite detention in \ntwo situations. First, immigrants who win their deportation cases may \nbe continued to be held if the Attorney General continues to have \nsuspicions. Second, this provision creates a deep unfairness to \nimmigrants who are found not to be deportable for terrorism but have an \nimmigration status violation, such as overstaying a visa. If the \nimmigration judge finds that they are eligible for relief from \ndeportation, and therefore can stay in the country--for example, if \nthey have longstanding family ties here--nonetheless, the Attorney \nGeneral can continue to hold them indefinitely.\n  I am pleased that the final version of the legislation includes a few \nimprovements over the bill that passed the Senate. In particular, the \nbill would require the Attorney General to review the detention \ndecision every 6 months. And it would only allow the Attorney General \nor the Deputy Attorney General--not lower level officials--to make that \ndetermination.\n\n  While I am pleased these provisions are included in the bill, I \nbelieve it still falls short of meeting even basic constitutional \nstandards of due process and fairness.\n  The bill continues to allow the Attorney General to detain persons \nbased on mere suspicion. Our system normally requires higher standards \nof proof for a deprivation of liberty. For example, deportation \nproceedings themselves are subject to a clear and convincing evidence \nstandard. And, of course, criminal convictions require proof beyond a \nreasonable doubt. The bill also continues to deny detained persons a \ntrial or a hearing where the Government would be required to prove that \nthat person is, in fact, engaged in terrorist activity. I think this is \nunjust and inconsistent with the values of our system of justice that \nwe hold dearly.\n  Another provision in the bill that deeply troubles me allows the \ndetention and deportation of people engaging in innocent associational \nactivity. It would allow for the detention and deportation of \nindividuals who provide lawful assistance to groups that are not even \ndesignated by the Secretary of State as terrorist organizations but \ninstead have engaged in something vaguely defined as ``terrorist \nactivity'' sometime in the past. To avoid deportation, the immigrant is \nrequired to prove a negative: That he or she did not know, and should \nnot have known, that the assistance would further terrorist activity.\n  I think this language creates a very real risk that truly innocent \nindividuals could be deported for innocent associations with \nhumanitarian or political groups that the Government later chooses to \nregard as terrorist organizations. Groups that could fit this \ndefinition could include Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, and even the \nNorthern Alliance fighting the Taliban in northern Afghanistan. So this \nreally amounts to a provision of ``guilt by association,'' which I \nthink violates the first amendment.\n  Speaking of the first amendment, under this bill, a lawful permanent \nresident who makes a controversial speech that the Government deems to \nbe supportive of terrorism might be barred from returning to his or her \nfamily after taking a trip abroad.\n  Despite assurances from the administration at various points in this \nprocess that these provisions that implicate associational activity \nwould be improved, there have been no changes in the bill on these \npoints since it passed the Senate.\n  Here is where my caution in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks \nand my concern about the reach of the antiterrorism bill come together. \nTo the extent that the expansion of new immigration powers that the \nbill grants the Attorney General are subject to abuse, who do we think \nis most likely to bear the brunt of that abuse? It probably won't be \nimmigrants from Ireland. It probably won't be immigrants from El \nSalvador or Nicaragua or immigrants from Haiti or Africa. Most likely \nit will be immigrants from Arab, Muslim and South Asian countries.\n  In the wake of these terrible events, our Government has been given \nvast new powers, and they may fall most heavily on a minority of our \npopulation who already feel particularly, acutely the pain of this \ndisaster.\n  Concerns of this kind have been raised with the administration. \nSupporters of this bill have just told us: Don't worry, the FBI would \nnever do that. I call on the Attorney General and the Justice \nDepartment to ensure that my fears are not borne out.\n  The antiterrorism bill we consider in the Senate today, of course, \nhighlights the march of technology and how that march cuts both for and \nagainst personal liberty. But Justice Brandeis foresaw some of the \nfuture in a 1928 dissent when he wrote:\n\n\n[[Page S11023]]\n\n\n       The progress of science in furnishing the Government with \n     means of espionage is not likely to stop with wire-tapping. \n     Ways may some day be developed by which the Government, \n     without removing papers from secret drawers, can reproduce \n     them in court, and by which it will be enabled to expose to a \n     jury the most intimate occurrences of the home. . . . Can it \n     be that the Constitution affords no protection against such \n     invasions of individual security?\n\n  We must grant law enforcement the tools that it needs to stop this \nterrible threats, but we must give them only those extraordinary tools \nthat they need and that relate specifically to the task at hand.\n  In the play, ``A Man for All Seasons,'' Sir Thomas More questions the \nbounder Roper whether he would level the forest of English laws to \npunish the Devil. ``What would you do?'' More asks, ``Cut a great road \nthrough the law to get after the Devil?'' Roper affirms, ``I'd cut down \nevery law in England to do that.'' To which More replies:\n\n       And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round \n     on you--where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? \n     This country's planted thick with laws from coast to coast . \n     . . and if you cut them down . . . d'you really think you \n     could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, \n     I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake.\n\n  We must maintain our vigilance to preserve our laws and our basic \nrights. We in this body have a duty to analyze, to test, to weigh new \nlaws that the zealous and often sincere advocates of security would \nsuggest to us. That is what I have tried to do with the anti-terrorism \nbill, and that is why I will vote against this bill when the roll is \ncalled.\n  Protecting the safety of the American people is a solemn duty of the \nCongress. We must work tirelessly to prevent more tragedies like the \ndevastating attacks of September 11. We must prevent more children from \nlosing their mothers, more wives from losing their husbands, and more \nfirefighters from losing their heroic colleagues. But the Congress will \nfulfill its duty only when it protects both the American people and the \nfreedoms at the foundation of American society.\n  So let us preserve our heritage of basic rights. Let us practice as \nwell as preach that liberty, and let us fight to maintain that freedom \nthat we call America.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Leahy, I yield 10 \nminutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HATCH. May I make a few comments before?\n  Mr. REID. When the Senator from Utah finishes his remarks, I ask that \nthe Senator from North Dakota be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I rise to address briefly a couple of the points made by \nthe distinguished Senator from Wisconsin.\n  First, what he called a ``sneak and peek'' search warrant, these \nwarrants are already used throughout the United States, throughout our \nwhole country. The bill simply codifies and clarifies the practice \nmaking certain that only a Federal court, not an agent or prosecutor, \ncan authorize such a warrant.\n  Let me be clear. Courts already allow warrants under our fourth \namendment. It is totally constitutional. It has been held so almost \nfrom the beginning of this country; some will say from the beginning of \nthis country. Together with Senator Leahy, we carefully drafted a \nprovision that standardizes this widely accepted practice.\n  Second, to respond to the suggestion that the legislation is not \nproperly mindful of our constitutional liberties--my friend from \nWisconsin talks theoretically about maybe the loss of some civil \nliberties--I would like to talk concretely about the loss of liberty of \nalmost 6,000 people because of the terrorist acts on September 11. I am \na little bit more concerned right now about their loss of life. I am \neven more concerned now that they have lost their lives that thousands \nof other Americans don't lose their lives because we fail to act and \nfail to give law enforcement the tools that are essential.\n  It is a nice thing to talk about theory. But we have to talk about \nreality. We have written this bill so the constitutional realities are \nthat the Constitution is not infringed upon and civil liberties are not \ninfringed upon except to the extent that the Constitution permits law \nenforcement to correct difficulties.\n  Yes, I think we must protect the Constitution, and that has been at \nthe top of my list all through my 25 years in the Congress. This bill \ndoes just that. Nothing in this bill undermines constitutional liberty. \nNothing in this bill comes remotely close to the Alien and Sedition \nAct, which, of course, was held to be unconstitutional, or the \ninternment of Japanese prisoners of war, which was a disgrace--there is \nno question about it, but at that point it was held to be \nconstitutional--or the other outrages that have occurred in the past \nthat were mentioned by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The tools we are promoting in this legislation have been carefully \ncrafted to protect civil liberties. In addition to protecting civil \nliberties, give law enforcement the tools they need so we, to the \nextent we possibly can, will be able to protect our citizens from \nevents and actions such as happened on September 11 of this year.\n  Thousands of Americans died that day, thousands. That is real. We \nhave been told there may be some other actions taken by terrorists. \nThat may be real. To the extent that may be real, we sure want to make \nsure our law enforcement people, within the constraints of the \nConstitution, have the optimum law enforcement tools they need to do \nthe job.\n  As the past few weeks have made clear, these terrorists still have a \ngun pointed at the heads of all the American people. Under such \ncircumstances, it is our sworn duty to do everything in our power, \nwithin the bounds of the Constitution, to protect and defend our \npeople. That is what this bill does.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin worries about the ``possible'' loss of \ncivil liberties. That is laudable. But I am more concerned about the \nactual loss of the thousands of lives that have been lost and the \npotential of other lives that may be lost because we don't give law \nenforcement the tools they need.\n  This bill protects us, to the extent that we possibly can, against \nfurther attacks such as occurred on September 11 and many, many other \npotential attacks as well.\n  I think most people in this country would be outraged to know that \nvarious agencies of Government, the intelligence community, and law \nenforcement community, under current law--until this bill is passed--\ncannot exchange information that might help interdict and stop \nterrorism. People are outraged when they hear this. And they ought to \nbe.\n  The fact is that that is the situation. I know the heads of the \nCriminal Division of the Justice Department have said that: Unless we \ncan share this information, we cannot pick up the people who are \nterrorists, whom we need to stop, in time to stop them. I think they \nwould be outraged to know that, under title III, you cannot \nelectronically surveil a terrorist unless there is some underlying \ncriminal predicate. In many cases, there is no underlying criminal \npredicate, so you can't do to terrorists what we can do for health care \nfraud, or for sexual exploitation of children, or for the Mafia, or for \ndrug dealers.\n  People would be amazed to know we treat terrorism with kid gloves in \nthe current criminal code. This bill stops that. I think most people \nwould be amazed to know that pen register trap-and-trace devices are \nnot permitted against terrorists under provisions of the law today. You \ncan't get the numbers called out of the phone and you can't get the \nnumbers called into the phone. That is what that means. This bill \nremedies that so we can get these numbers and do what has to be done.\n  I think most people are shocked to find out that you can't \nelectronically surveil the terrorists. You have to go after the phone, \nand then you have to get a warrant in every jurisdiction where that \nphone shows up. Terrorists don't pay any attention to those antiquated \nlaws. They just buy 10 cell phones, talk for a while, and throw it out \nthe window. We have to be able to track terrorists. Under current law, \nwe cannot do that with the efficiency that needs to be used here. I \ndon't see any\n\n[[Page S11024]]\n\ncivil liberties violated there, but I see some of them protected. I \nthink of the civil liberties of those approximately 6,000 people who \nlost their lives, and potentially many others if we don't give law \nenforcement the tools they need to do the job. That is what this bill \ndoes.\n  I will have more to say, perhaps, on this later. I wanted to make \nthese particular points. I am happy to retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that I may follow the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand we are under a time agreement and I am \nallotted 10 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the legislation that is on the floor is \nlegislation I will vote for and support. I think it advances our \ncountry's interests in dealing with the issue of terrorism. But I don't \nwant to talk about what is in the bill; I want to talk about something \nthat is not now in the bill and should be. I want to ask the question, \nWhy?\n  I came to the floor an hour ago and was surprised to find out that \nsomething about which I care very much, something agreed to in the \nSenate, is now no longer in this legislation. Here is the issue. I held \nand chaired a hearing in my subcommittee on Appropriations a couple \nweeks ago. The Customs Service was there and Immigration was there. \nThey said we have a system in this country called the advance passenger \ninformation system. It is a system under which international air \ncarriers electronically transmit to the Customs Service passenger and \ncargo manifests, so that before they enter and are cleared for \ndeparture, we know who is on that plane and what is on that plane, so \nwe can determine whether there are people who should not be allowed to \nenter this country. That is the advance passenger information system. \nIt works, but it is voluntary and only 85 percent of the carriers are \ncomplying.\n  I asked at my hearing of Customs and Immigration: Should this be \nmandatory? They said: Absolutely, we need you to make this mandatory.\n  When we had the antiterrorism bill on the floor of the Senate, I had \ncleared an amendment in the managers' package that would make this \nmandatory. Let me tell you of the airlines that do not comply, for \nwhich we don't get advance passenger information: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, \nRoyal Jordanian, Pakistani International, to name a few airlines that \ndo not comply under the voluntary standard and give us no advance \npassenger information.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I commend the Senator. I think \nhe is absolutely right. We had it in the Senate bill. It was a \nworthwhile provision that I think we need to include later, since we \ncan't do it on this bill at this point. I will support him in every way \npossible to get this done in the future. I commend the Senator for \nbringing this to the attention of this body because I have to say the \nHouse absolutely would not permit us to put that in the bill.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I inquire of the Senator from Utah, what possibly could \nbe their motive to not want this in the antiterrorism bill?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think it came down to a jurisdictional argument. That is \nmy opinion. We understand that around here, but we are trying to solve \nterrorism now. The Senator's point is a very good point. My main reason \nfor interrupting him at this point is to commend him and tell him I \nwill do everything in my power to get that passed. I think it is \ncritical that the other 15 percent be made mandatory, that they have to \ncomply, because most of the airlines comply on a voluntary basis.\n  I am sorry to interrupt the Senator. I reserve my time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Utah. It is not his fault. I understand he strongly supports this. \nI kind of felt blind-sided an hour ago when I was told this wasn't in \nthe bill we are discussing because we had cleared it. Apparently, some \nfolks from the other side of this Capitol have this notion of muscle \nflexing with respect to jurisdictional standards. Frankly, I don't \nunderstand that on an issue that is this important. We need advance \npassenger information clearing--not on a voluntary basis but on a \nmandatory basis. Somehow it got left out.\n  I thank the Senator from Utah for his cooperation because we are \ngoing to get this done. This needs to be done. If we have a few small-\nminded people in this Capitol simply protecting their turf and who \ndon't seem to worry about combating terrorism, we will move beyond them \nand we are not going to pay much attention to their concerns.\n  If I might ask, how much time remains on my 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to mention two other issues, and they don't relate \ndirectly to this bill. They are very important to me.\n  We are talking about antiterrorism activities. We have an \norganization down at the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset \nControl. I happen to fund that area, as I am chairman of the \nAppropriations subcommittee that funds that. I want to say something I \nsaid before the terrorist attacks of September 11. OFAC, in my \njudgment, ought to be using its resources to track terrorists and track \nthe trail left by terrorists with the movement of money around the \nglobe.\n  But in August I pointed out that what OFAC was doing--at least with \nsome of its resources--and it appears that 10 percent of the resources \nof OFAC is devoted to chasing little old ladies in tennis shoes from \nIllinois who join a bicycle club from Canada and go bicycling in Cuba \nand 15 months later get a letter from the Treasury Department that they \nhave a $9,500 fine. That is one example of a retired teacher from \nIllinois. OFAC is chasing retired folks who go on a bicycling trip to \nCuba with a Canadian bicycling Club, and she was fined $9,500. I talked \nto her and others who have been fined.\n  There was a $55,000 fine for someone who was with some friends in the \nCayman Islands and they decided to go to Cuba for the weekend. This guy \nis wondering what on Earth has happened. He was not supposed to travel \nto Cuba, but he didn't know it. OFAC is supposed to be tracking \nterrorists, but they are chasing retired schoolteachers from Illinois \nfor taking a bicycling trip in Cuba.\n  Let's stop this foolishness and track the trail of terrorists. It \ndoesn't make sense to be doing what OFAC has been doing. First of all, \nit is embarrassing. I understand the restrictions on travel, which we \nshould change and we will change, but should we be using 10 percent of \nthe assets of OFAC to track these people down and levy civil fines at a \ntime when terrorists are designing approaches to kill Americans? What \non Earth is going on here?\n  I say to Treasury and OFAC, if they are listening: Get busy doing the \nright things. Get right about public policy initiatives that we are \nfunding you to do.\n  Let me mention one additional item, if I may, and again it relates to \nantiterrorism, not necessarily just to this bill, and that is the issue \nof northern border security. We have a 4,000-mile border between the \nUnited States and Canada, with 128 ports of entry, and 100 of them are \nnot staffed at night. At 10 o'clock at night, the security between the \nUnited States and Canada is an orange rubber cone, just a big old \norange rubber cone. It cannot talk. It cannot walk. It cannot shoot. It \ncannot tell a terrorist from a tow truck. It is just a big fat dumb \nrubber cone sitting in the middle of the road.\n  Those who want to come in illegally at 11 or 12 o'clock at night and \nare polite about it will stop in front of the rubber cone, remove the \nrubber cone, drive through, and replace it. Those who do not care will \nshred it at 60 miles an hour. That is supposed to be security in this \ncountry.\n  We know a terrorist came across that northern border at Port Angeles. \nThis particular Middle Eastern terrorist was going to create \nsubstantial bombing activities of public facilities at the turn of the \nmillennium in Los Angeles. We know the terrorists know where it is easy \nto get through our border and where it is not.\n  Having said all that, that a rubber cone is no substitute for \nsecurity, the Treasury Department has said to this\n\n[[Page S11025]]\n\nCongress that none of the $20 billion we appropriated for security is \ngoing to go for increased resources at the northern border for Customs. \nThe other side, Immigration and Border Patrol, are going to get \nincreased resources, but the Treasury Department says: No, we do not \nneed additional resources with the Customs Service.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. I am just asking these \npeople who are thinking through these issues to start thinking the \nright way. We do need additional resources. That is why we provided the \n$20 billion. We do need additional security on the northern border. \nYes, orange rubber cones are inexpensive. They are also ineffective. \nThey are no substitute for security in this country. I know I am going \na bit afield from this bill, but I wanted to make the other two points \nabout OFAC and what it is doing and northern border security because \nthat, too, relates to the issue of antiterrorism and this country's \nability to deal with the terrorist threats.\n  I conclude by saying I came here to talk about the advance passenger \ninformation system. I, again, feel terrible it was left out of this \nbill because we had agreement in the Senate. I understand some folks in \nthe House refused to move on this issue.\n  One way or another I am going to get this done in the next couple of \nweeks. I will find a bill, a vehicle. This is going to get done. I \nappreciate the willingness of the Senator from Vermont and the Senator \nfrom Utah to help me do that. That is a glaring omission from this \nbill, and if the House does not want to do it on this bill, we will \nforce them to do it on another bill.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, on behalf of senator Leahy, I yield 10 \nminutes to the Senator from Massachusetts, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat his remarks follow--there is an order already in effect for \nSenator Wellstone to be heard now--the remarks of Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, this is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation we will consider during this Congress. The horrific loss of \nlife and destruction that occurred on September 11, the crime against \nhumanity, changed us as a country. The Uniting and Strengthening \nAmerica Act is an opportunity to help ensure that such terrorist \nattacks do not occur again. We need to improve all aspects of our \ndomestic security, including by enhancing our intelligence capacities \nso that we can identify possible future attacks in their planning \nstages and prevent them from happening. We must be vigilant and willing \nto invest the resources and time required to gather the information \nthat we need to protect ourselves and our way of life.\n  I appreciate the enormous amount of time and energy that my \ncolleagues in both Chambers have put into this legislation. They have \ndone their best to balance the risk of further terrorist attacks with \npossible risks to civil liberties. This comprehensive bill includes \nmeasures to enhance surveillance; improve the working relationship \namong Federal, State, and local agencies; strengthen border control; \npermit the detention of certain suspects who may be the subject of \ninvestigative efforts; help crime victims; respond to bioterrorism; and \ncrack down on money laundering.\n  I am especially supportive of two new important provisions added in \nconference that will enhance domestic preparedness against future \nattacks, at the local level: the First Responders Assistance Act, and \nthe Grant Program for State and Local Domestic Preparedness Support. \nThese provisions authorize grants to State and local authorities to \nrespond and prevent acts of terrorism, particularly for terrorism \ninvolving weapons of mass destruction and biological, nuclear, and \nchemical devices; and revises an existing grant program to provide 1, \nadditional flexibility to purchase needed equipment; 2, training and \ntechnical assistance to State and local first responders; and 3, a more \nequitable allocation of funds to all States.\n  Last week I traveled to Moorhead, Mankato and Rochester, MN and \ntalked with firefighters and first-responders about this very issue. \nThey told me they desperately need training and equipment to address \nour new terrorism risks. These local grants are extremely important to \naddress the needs our most important asset in the fight against \nterrorism: those law enforcement and emergency personnel on the front \nlines.\n  Although I still have some reservations about certain provisions of \nthe bill as they might affect civil liberties, and wish that it were \nmore tightly targeted to address only actions directly related to \nterrorism or suspected terrorism, I am pleased with the inclusion of \nseveral key civil liberty safeguards. The bill requires certain \nelectronic reports to go to a judge when pen registers are used on the \ninternet; includes provisions requiring notification to a court when \ngrand jury information is disclosed; and contains a 4-year sunset with \nlimited grandfathering for several of the electronic surveillance \nprovisions.\n  The bill expands the Regional Information Sharing Systems Program to \npromote information sharing among Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement have a critical role to play in preventing and \ninvestigating terrorism, and this bill provides them benefits \nappropriate to such duty. The bill streamlines and expedites the Public \nSafety Officers' Benefits application process for family members of \nfire fighters, police officers and other emergency personnel who are \nkilled or suffer a disabling injury in connection with a future \nterrorist attack. And it raises the total amount of the Public Safety \nOfficers' Benefit Program payments from approximately $150,000 to \n$250,000.\n\n  This bill will also make an immediate difference in the lives of \nvictims of terrorism and their families. It refines the Victims of \nCrime Act and by doing so improves the way in which its crime fund is \nmanaged and preserved. It replenishes the emergency reserve of the \nCrime Victims Fund with up to $50 million and improves the mechanism to \nreplenish the fund in future years. The USA Act also increases security \non our northern border, including the border between Canada and my \nState of Minnesota. It triples the number of Border Patrol, Customs \nService, and INS inspectors at the northern border and authorizes $100 \nmillion to improve old equipment and provide new technology to INS and \nthe Customs Service at that Border.\n  On the criminal justice side, the bill clarifies existing \n``cybercrime'' law to cover computers outside the United States that \naffect communications in this country and changes sentencing guidelines \nin some of these cases. It provides prosecutor better tools to go after \nthose involved in money laundering schemes that are linked to \nterrorism, and it adds certain terrorism-related crime as predicates \nfor RICO and money-laundering. At the same time, the bill establishes \nprocedures to protect the rights of persons whose property may be \nsubject to confiscation in the exercise of the government's \nantiterrorism authority. It strengths our Federal laws relating to the \nthreat of biological weapons and enhances the Government's ability to \nprosecute suspected terrorists in possession of biological agents. It \nwill prohibit certain persons, particularly those from countries that \nsupport terrorism, from possessing biological agents. And it will \nprohibit any person from possessing a biological agent of a type of \nquantity that is not reasonably justified by a peaceful purpose.\n  I support these much-needed measures. And I especially support the \nfour-year sunset provision for several of the electronic surveillance \nprovisions. I do wish, however, that some provisions were might tightly \ntargeted to address only actions directly related to terrorism or \nsuspected terrorism. It is for this reason, I believe we will need to \nmonitor the use of new authorities provided to law enforcement agents \nto conduct surveillance. The bill broadens the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, FISA, by extending FISA surveillance authority to \ncriminal investigations, even when the primary purpose is not \nintelligence gathering. The bill limits this ability by authorizing \nsurveillance only if a significant purpose of it is to gather \nintelligence information. I hope this new FISA authority will be used \nfor the purpose of investigating and preventing terrorism or\n\n[[Page S11026]]\n\nsuspected terrorism, and not for other domestic purposes. The bill also \nallow surveillance to follow a person who uses multiple communications \ndevices or locations, the so-called ``roving-wiretap.'' Again, I am \nhopeful this new authority will not be abused.\n  We have done our best in this bill to maximize our security while \nminimizing the impact some of these changes may have on our civil \nliberties. Nearly all of us have probably said since September 11 that \nif that day's terror is allowed to undermine our democratic principles \nand practices, then the terrorists will have won a victory. We should \npass this bill today. And we should also commit ourselves to monitoring \nits impact of civil liberties in the coming months and years.\n  Our challenge is to balance our security with our liberties. While it \nis not perfect, I believe we are doing that in this bill.\n  Madam President, it is a jarring analogy, but I use it to explain how \nI arrived at my decision on this legislation. In 1940 and 1941, the \nGermans engaged in an unprecedented attack on the civilian population \nof Great Britain. The goal was to weaken citizens in their fight \nagainst Nazism. At the end of that attack, 20,000 people were killed. \nOn September 11 in our country, close to 6,000 innocent people were \nmassacred.\n  It is absolutely the right thing to take the necessary steps to try \nto prevent this from happening and to provide protection to people in \nour country.\n  There are many provisions in this legislation with which I agree. \nThey are important to people in Minnesota, Michigan, and around the \ncountry, by way of what we need to do to protect our citizens.\n  When it comes to electronic surveillance, as Senator Feingold has \nstated with considerable eloquence, the legislation goes too far and \ngoes beyond world terrorists, who I think are a real threat to people \nin our country and other nations as well.\n  How do I balance it out? My view is that I support this legislation \nbecause all of the positive issues, which I will go into in a moment, \nthat are so important to the people I represent have to do with \nprotecting the lives of people. If we do not take this action and we \nare not able to protect people, then more people can die, more people \nwill be murdered. That is irreversible. We cannot bring those lives \nback.\n  This legislation has a 4-year sunset. I said when the Senate passed \nthe bill that I would reserve final judgment as to whether I vote for \nthe final product based on whether there will be a 4-year sunset when \nit comes to electronic surveillance. We can monitor--there will be some \nabuses, I think--we can monitor that, and if there are abuses, it is \nreversible; we can change it. That is why I err on the side of \nprotecting people, and it is why I support this legislation.\n  The bill includes measures to enhance surveillance, to improve the \nworking relationships of Federal, State, and local agencies--that has \nto happen--to strengthen control of the Canadian border. For our States \nup North, that is very important. When it comes to the detention of \ncertain suspects who may be the subject of investigative efforts, there \nare safeguards against unlimited detention.\n  I thank Senator Leahy and Senator Hatch and others for pulling back \nfrom some of the original proposals which made this a much better piece \nof legislation.\n  There is a crackdown on money laundering. I thank Senator Sarbanes \nand Senator Kerry and others for their fine work.\n  There is another provision that is very important. The First \nResponders Assistance Act and grant program all go together. When I \ntraveled to greater Minnesota last week, when I went to Moorhead, \nMankato, Rochester, and Duluth, I spoke with fire chiefs and all said: \nWe are the first responders. We know that from New York. Please get \nsome resources back to the local level. It is a local public safety \nmodel where if you give us the resources, let us assess our needs--we \nhave the training; we may need additional equipment--if you are going \nto talk about the ways we can best protect people, we are going to \nprotect people where they live, where they work, or where their \nchildren go to school. Getting the resources to the local community, \nthe fire chiefs, and police chiefs is critically important.\n  As I said, there are some key civil liberty safeguards. The bill \nrequires certain electronic reports to go to a judge when pen registers \nare used on the Internet. It includes provisions requiring notification \nto a court when grand jury information is disclosed, and it contains \nthe 4-year sunset when it comes to the electronics surveillance \nprovisions. That is critically important.\n  The bill streamlines and expedites the public safety officers \nbenefits application for the firefighters and the police officers and \nothers who were killed and suffered disabling injuries.\n  It raises the total amount of the Public Safety Officers' Benefits \nProgram.\n  The Victims Crime Act is in this bill.\n  It improves the way the crime fund is managed. It replenishes the \nemergency fund for crime victims up to $50 million. This is really \nimportant.\n  These are the important provisions.\n  On the other hand, I do wish some of the provisions were more tightly \ntargeted to address only actions directly related to terrorism or \nsuspected terrorism. It is for this reason that I think it is \ncritically important each and every Senator and Representative monitor \nthe use of new authorities provided to the law enforcement agency to \nconduct surveillance.\n  We are going to have to monitor this aspect very closely. It has been \nsaid, and it should be said, we do not want to pass legislation that \nundermines our democratic principles or practices. If we do that, the \nterrorists have won a victory. If I thought this was such legislation, \nI would not support it.\n  I will say this one more time: From my point of view, this \nlegislation is better than it was when it passed the Senate. The sunset \nprovision is critically important. Ultimately, where I come down is if \nwe do not take some of these steps with some of the provisions I have \noutlined, which are very important, very positive in protecting people, \nand more people are killed and there is more loss of life of innocent \npeople, you cannot bring those lives back.\n  I am not a lawyer, and this is my layperson way of analyzing this. If \nthere are some abuses with the surveillance, we monitor it, we can pass \nnew legislation, and we can change it. It sunsets in 4 years. That is \nreversible. I err on the side of protection for people.\n  I wish we did not even have to consider this legislation. I wish we \nwere not even living in these times. I believe terrorism is going to be \na part of our lives. I think it is going to be a part of our children's \nlives. I think it is going to be a part of our grandchildren's lives. I \nthink this is going to be the struggle for several generations to come. \nNo one action and no one step is going to end it. I think that is now \nthe world, unfortunately, in which we live. That is now the world in \nwhich all of God's children live.\n  There are some things we are going to have to do differently and, as \nI said, we must be vigilant. Where there are excesses, we need to \nchange that. I do believe this legislation is an important step in the \ndirection of trying to prevent this and providing protection to our \ncitizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support the conference report before the \nSenate today. It reflects an enormous amount of hard work by the \nmembers of the Senate Banking Committee and the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. I congratulate them and thank them for that work.\n  I particularly thank Senator Daschle, Senator Leahy, Senator \nSarbanes, Senator Hatch, and Senator Levin for their work in developing \nthis legislation. I am pleased the Conference Report includes what I \nconsider to be a very important provision regarding money laundering \nthat has been hard fought over and, frankly, long awaited for. We have \nbeen working on this for quite a few years, almost 10 years or more \nwhen I was a member of the Banking Committee and within the Foreign \nRelations Committee where I was Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nNarcotics, Terrorism and International Operations. This really is the \nculmination of much of that work.\n\n[[Page S11027]]\n\n  I am pleased at the compromise we have reached on the antiterrorism \nlegislation, as a whole, which includes the sunset provision on the \nwiretapping and electronic surveillance component. It has been a source \nof considerable concern for people, and I think the sunset provision \nprovides Congress a chance to come back and measure the record \nappropriately, and that is appropriate.\n  The reason I think the money-laundering provision is so important is \nit permits the United States--it really authorizes and gives to the \nSecretary of the Treasury the power to be able to enforce the interests \nof the United States. It allows the Secretary to deny banks and \njurisdictions access to our economy if in the last measure they are not \ncooperative in other ways to prevent money laundering from being a tool \navailable to terrorists.\n  This is a bill I introduced several years ago that assists our \nability to be able to crack down on the capacity for criminal elements, \nnot just terrorists, who are criminals themselves. But also narcotics \ntraffickers, arms proliferators, people who traffic in people \nthemselves. There are all kinds of criminal enterprises which benefit \nfrom access to the American financial system. All of these will now be \non notice that our law enforcement community has additional tools to \nuse to be able to close the incredible benefits of access to the \nAmerican financial marketplace.\n  The global volume of laundered money staggers the imagination. It is \nestimated to be 2 to 5 percent of the gross domestic product of the \nUnited States. That is $600 billion to $1.5 trillion that is laundered, \nthat comes into the country or passes through banks without \naccountability. Those funds escape the tax system, for one thing. So \nfor legitimate governments struggling to fairly distribute the tax base \nwhile the average citizen who gets their paycheck deducted or those \ngood corporate citizens and others who live by the rules, they are \nliterally being required to assume a greater burden because other \npeople using the laundering and lack of accountability escape that \nresponsibility.\n  The effects of money laundering go far beyond the parameters of law \nenforcement, creating international political issues and generating \nvery genuine domestic political crises. International criminals have \ntaken advantage of the technology and the weak financial supervision in \nmany jurisdictions to simply smuggle their funds into our system. \nGlobalization and advances in communications and technologies have \nallowed them to move their illicit gains with much more secrecy, much \nfaster, commingled, and in other ways that avoid or complicate \nsignificantly the ability of prosecutors to be able to do their job.\n\n  Many nations, some of them remote, small islands that have no real \nassets of their own, have passed laws solely for the purpose of \nattracting capital illicitly, as well as legally. By having the legal \ncapital that is attracted by virtue of the haven that is created, they \nprovide the cover for all of the illicit money. There are places not so \nfar away from us, islands in the Caribbean and elsewhere, which at last \ncount I remember $400 billion of assets that supposedly belong to this \nisland in about 1 square mile of the downtown area, most of which was \nthe property of entities that had a brass plate on a door and a fax \nmachine inside, perhaps a telephone number, and that was sort of the \nfull extent of the corporate entity.\n  So there is $400 billion on an island that everybody knows is not on \nthe island. Where does it go? It goes back into the financial \nmarketplace where it earns interest, is invested, goes into legitimate \nefforts, much of it legitimate money to begin with but a whole portion \nof it not. I might add, with the knowledge of people involved in those \nbusinesses and many of the banks that receive it.\n  So if one is going to cope with an al-Qaida, with a terrorist entity \nsuch as Osama bin Laden, who moves his money into this legitimate \nmarketplace, law enforcement has to have the ability to be able to hold \npeople accountable where it is legitimate to do so.\n  Now obviously we do not want to do that where there is a legitimate \nenterprise, and we do not want to create a crossing of the line of the \ncorporate veil that has been protected for a long period of time, and I \nam not urging that we do that. But we do have to have a system in \nplace, where probable cause exists, for law enforcement entities.\n  I spent a number of years as a prosecutor. We make pretty good \njudgments in the law enforcement community about probable cause. They \nare not always without question, and they are not, obviously, without \nerror at times. We understand that. We have a pretty good system in the \nUnited States to protect against that. What we are trying to do with \nthis legislation is to put those protections in place, but even as we \nput in a series of steps that allow the Secretary of the Treasury to be \nable to target a particular area as a known money-laundering problem, \nand then be able to require of the government of that entity, a \ncooperative effort. It is only if the entity or government's \ncooperative effort at several different stages is not forthcoming that \nthe Secretary would ultimately consider exercising the power to denying \nthat entity as a whole, or individual banks or other financial \ninstitutions, access to our financial marketplace and to its benefits.\n\n  I believe this leverage will be critical in our ability to wage a war \non terrorism, as well as to be able to wage a sufficient law \nenforcement effort against the criminal enterprises that exist on a \nglobal basis.\n  I think the Secretary will have a number of different options and it \nwill provide a transparency and an accountability that is absent today.\n  Let me comment on one criticism that is often raised by some \nopponents of this legislation who do not like the idea that the United \nStates should somehow put in place sanctions against an entity that has \na lower tax rate than we happen to have. I emphasize there is nothing \nin this legislation that empowers us to take action because another \ngovernment has a lower tax rate. That is their privilege. It is \nhealthy, as all Members know, to have competition in the marketplace of \ntaxes, too. The Chair is a former Governor and he knows well the \ncompetition between States. States will say: We will not have a sales \ntax; we will not have an excise tax; we will try to make ourselves more \nbusiness friendly. We want to be as competitive and as low tax as we \nconceivably can be.\n  We are not seeking to try to address those jurisdictions that simply \nmake themselves more competitive on a tax basis. What we are trying to \naddress are those jurisdictions that not only have lower taxes but use \nthe lower taxes, coupled with a complete absence of accountability, a \ncomplete absence of transparency, a complete absence of living by the \nlaw enforcement standards of other parts of the world, to knowingly \nattract the illicit gains that come from criminal activity or that \nattract and move terrorist money through the world.\n  We are simply putting into place the standards by which most of the \ndeveloped world is living. Ultimately we hope all countries will adopt \nappropriate money laundering standards so we can all live in a safer \nworld.\n  Passage of this legislation is going to make it a lot more difficult \nfor new terrorist organizations to develop. I can remember a number of \nyears ago when I was chairing the subcommittee on Narcotics, Terrorism \nand International Operations, I conducted an investigation into a bank \ncalled BCCI, the Bank of Credit Commerce International. We uncovered a \ncomplex money-laundering scheme involving billions of dollars. \nFortunately, BCCI was forced to close. We were able to bring many of \nthose involved in it to justice. But we have learned since the closing \nthat BCCI was a bank that had a number of Osama bin Laden's accounts. \nWe learned when BCCI closed, we dealt Osama bin Laden a very serious \nblow.\n  So as the Congress gives final approval to this legislation in \nresponse to these attacks, we need to keep in our focus the benefits \nthat will come to us by pressing these money laundering standards on \nbanks. With the passage of this legislation, terrorist organizations \nwill not be able to move funds as easily and they will not be able to \nhave their people move within our country with bank accounts that we \ncannot\n\n[[Page S11028]]\n\npenetrate, with major sources of funding transferred to them from the \nMiddle East or elsewhere to empower them to be able to do the kind of \nthings they did on September 11.\n  I also point out this bill will require the U.S. financial \ninstitutions to use appropriate caution and diligence when opening and \nmanaging accounts for foreign financial institutions. It will actually \nprohibit foreign shell banks, those who have no physical location in \nany country, from opening an account in the United States. Think about \nthat. We currently allow a bank that has no physical presence \nanywhere--a bank--to open an account in the United States. That is \ntoday. With this legislation, that will change. It is high time.\n  The conference report expands the list of money-laundering crimes and \nwill assist our law enforcement efforts in making it easier to \nprosecute those crimes. It requires the Federal Reserve to take into \nconsideration the effectiveness financial institutions in combating \nmoney-laundering activities before any merger is approved. We will have \nan ability to judge the road traveled before we open up new \nopportunities for financial institutions.\n  The following is a description of the legislative intent of the \nCounter Money Laundering and Foreign Anti-Corruption Act of 2001 which \nwas included in section 311 of subtitle A--International Counter Money \nLaundering and Related Measures of the conference report. First, the \nSecretary of the Treasury determines whether ``reasonable grounds exist \nfor concluding'' that a foreign jurisdiction, a financial institution \noperating in a foreign jurisdiction, or a type of international \ntransaction, is of ``primary money laundering concern.'' In making this \ndetermination, the Secretary must consult with the Secretary of State, \nthe Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, and the United States \nTrade Representative. The Secretary is also directed to consider any \nrelevant factor, including the quality of a jurisdiction's bank \nsecrecy, bank supervision, and anti-money laundering laws and \nadministration, the extent to which a particular institution or type of \ntransaction is involved in money laundering as compared to legitimate \nbanking operations, whether the U.S. has a mutual legal assistance \ntreaty with the jurisdiction and whether the jurisdiction has high \nlevels of official or internal corruption.\n  Second, if a jurisdiction, institution, or transaction is found to be \na ``primary money laundering concern,'' the Secretary then selects from \na menu of five ``special measures'' to address the identified issue. \nthese five special measures are: requiring additional record keeping \nand/or reporting on particular transactions; requiring reasonable and \npracticable steps to identify the beneficial foreign owner of an \naccount opened or maintained in a domestic financial institution; \nrequiring the identification of those using a foreign bank's payable-\nthrough account with a domestic financial institution; requiring the \nidentification of those using a foreign bank's correspondent account \nwith a domestic financial institution; and restricting or prohibiting \nthe opening or maintaining of certain corresponding accounts for \nforeign financial institutions. The special measure relating to the \nrestriction or prohibition of accounts can only be imposed by \nregulation. However, nothing in this legislation will in any way \nrestrict the right of the Secretary of the Treasury to impose a rule \nimmediately and to ask for comment at the same time. The other four \nspecial measures may not remain in effect for more than 120 days, \nexcept pursuant to a rule promulgated on or before the end of the 120-\nday period beginning on the date of the issuance of such order.\n  In choosing which ``special measure'' to impose and how to tailor it, \nthe Secretary shall consider the extent to which they are used to \nfacilitate or promote money laundering, the extent to which they are \nused for legitimate business purposes and the extent to which such \naction will sufficiently guard against money laundering. The Secretary \nis also to consult with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve. If the Secretary is considering prohibiting or \nrestricting correspondent accounts, he is also to consult with the \nSecretary of State and the Attorney General. The Secretary is also \nobligated to consider three factors: whether other countries or \nmultilateral groups are taking similar actions; whether the imposition \nof the measure would create a significant competitive disadvantage for \nU.S. firms, including any significant cost or compliance; the extent to \nwhich the action would have an adverse systemic impact on the payment \nsystem and legitimate business; and the effect of such action on United \nStates national security and foreign policy.\n  Within 10 days of invoking any of the special measures against a \nprimary money laundering concern, the Secretary must notify the House \nand Senate Banking Committees of any such action taken.\n  The conference report includes a provision within section 351 \nrelating to reporting of suspicious transactions which clarifies that \nthe ``safe harbor'' from civil liability for filing a Suspicious \nActivity Report (SAR) applies in any litigation, including suit for \nbreach of contract or in an arbitration proceeding and clarifies the \nprohibition on disclosing that a SAR has been filed.\n  Section 353 of the conference report also includes a provision that \nincreases penalties for violation of Geographic Targeting Orders (GTO) \nby making it a civil and criminal offense on par with existing law to \nfile reports required by a Geographic Targeting Order; requiring \nstructuring transactions to fall below a GTO-lowered threshold a civil \nand criminal offense on par with structuring generally; and extends the \npresumptive GTO period from 60 to 180 days.\n  Finally, section 355 of the conference report includes a provision \nthat grants financial institutions civil immunity for including \nsuspicions of criminal wrongdoing in a written reference on a current \nor former employer.\n  It has been brought to my attention that this bill, as originally \npassed by the House, contained a rule of construction which could have \nlimited our ability to provide assistance and cooperation to our \nforeign allies in their battle against money laundering. The House-\npassed rule of construction could have potentially limited the access \nof foreign jurisdictions to our courts and could have required them to \nnegotiate a treaty in order to be able to take advantage of our money-\nlaundering laws in their fight against crime and terrorism. The \nconference report did not include a rule of construction because the \nCongress has always recognized the fundamental right of friendly \nnations to have access to our courts to enforce their rights. Foreign \njurisdictions have never needed a treaty to have access to our courts. \nSince some of the money-laundering conducted in the world today also \ndefrauds foreign governments, it would be hostile to the intent of this \nbill for us to interject into the statute any rule of construction of \nlegislative language which would in any way limit our foreign allies \naccess to our courts to battle against money laundering. That is why we \ndid not include a rule of construction in the conference report. That \nis why we today clarify that it is the intent of the legislature that \nour allies will have access to our courts and the use of our laws if \nthey are the victims of smuggling, fraud, money laundering, or \nterrorism. I make these remarks today because there should be no \nconfusion on this issue and comments made by others should not be \nconstrued as a reassertion of this rule of construction which we have \nsoundly rejected. Our allies have had and must continue to have the \nbenefit of U.S. laws in this fight against money laundering and \nterrorism.\n  Smuggling, money laundering, and fraud against our allies are an \nimportant part of the schemes by which terrorism is financed. It is \nessential that our money laundering statutes have appropriate scope so \nour law enforcement can fight money laundering wherever it is found and \nin any form it is found. By expanding the definition of ``Specified \nUnlawful Activity'' to include a wide range of offenses against \nfriendly nations who are our allies in the war against terrorism, we \nare confirming that our money laundering statutes prohibit anyone from \nusing the United States as a platform to commit money laundering \noffenses against foreign jurisdictions in whatever form that they \noccur. it should be clear that our intention that the\n\n[[Page S11029]]\n\nmoney laundering statues of the United States are intended to insure \nthat all criminals and terrorists cannot circumvent our laws. We shall \ncontinue to give our full cooperation to our allies in their efforts to \ncombat smuggling and money laundering, including access to our courts \nand the unimpeded use of our criminal and civil laws.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we must act on many fronts to wage a \nsuccessful fight against terrorism. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 will \nprovide our law enforcement agencies with significant new tools to \nfight this battle on the home front. There are many good things in this \nbill. I am especially pleased that the bill includes language to allow \nthe tripling of manpower on our northern border. The bill also includes \na provision to set a new technology standard for our visa program so we \ncan better identify people coming into this country. I am very proud of \nthe many tools in the bill for law enforcement. This legislation \nincreases the number of FISA judges to speed law enforcement's ability \nto get taps in place and going and contains excellent new provisions to \nhelp law enforcement and banks better track and freeze financial assets \nof terrorists. Further, the bill provides for expedited hiring and \ntraining of FBI translators. Finally, the legislation takes steps to \nallow better sharing of information between the law enforcement and \nintelligence communities, although I believe this sharing and \ncoordination would be better accomplished with a process for judicial \nreview.\n  But I have my concerns, as well, with the scope and the pace of these \nsweeping changes. We may have gone further than we really need to go to \naddress terrorism. Thanks to the extremely hard work of Senator Leahy \nand his staff, Senator Hatch and others in both houses of Congress, \nthis legislation is much more carefully tailored to addressing \nterrorism than the legislation proposed by the Administration only a \nshort month ago. But I remain concerned about several provisions such \nas those involving wiretap authorities, pen register and trap and \ntrace, computer trespass, access to business records and other new \nlegal authorities which will not require a showing by the government of \nprobable cause or allow for any meaningful judicial review. The scope \nof these provisions may make them susceptible to abuse--allowing \ninappropriate, possibly unconstitutional, intrusion into the privacy of \nAmerican citizens. I am pleased that some of the most disconcerting \nprovisions of this legislation will expire in four years. This \n``sunset'' provision will give Congress the opportunity to evaluate the \nimplementation of these new laws, and reassess the need for the \nchanges.\n  I would like to believe that the government's new ability to place \nwiretaps on the lines of American citizens--in secret with limited \nreporting and opportunity for oversight by Congress --will not be \nabused. I would like to believe that technologies like Carnivore will \nnot be used to derive content from email communications. But I am \nskeptical.\n  Several other aspects of this bill, when taken together, could also \ninterfere with Americans' enjoyment of their right to privacy without \nproviding value in the fight against terrorists. Those of us who feel \nstrongly about how new powers might chip away at traditional privacy \nrights will pay close attention to how law enforcement uses these \ntools.\n  The bill's ostensible purpose in regard to searches of personal \ncommunication is to facilitate the sharing of information gathered in a \nlaw enforcement context with the intelligence community. There is a \ndifference, however, between facilitating the sharing of information \nbetween the law enforcement and intelligence communities, and blurring \nthe line between the missions of the two communities. Where information \nis sought for the purpose of law enforcement, we must ensure that \nfourth amendment protections apply. Our fear about the legislation \ncomes from a legitimate concern that information gathered ostensibly \nfor intelligence and defense purposes could be used for law enforcement \npurposes. The intelligence community does not prosecute and lock up its \ntargets; it uses information to intervene against foreign nationals \nseeking to harm America or Americans. But the law enforcement community \nhas a different mission, to catch and prosecute criminals in our courts \nof law. Because law enforcement acts upon U.S. citizens, it must do so \nwithin the bounds of the Constitution. The differences in these \nmissions must be acknowledged, and we must be vigilant to maintain the \ndistinctions.\n  Last week, Senator Leahy and I discussed here on the floor the need \nto maintain strict oversight of the law enforcement community's use of \nnew authorities enumerated in this legislation. Today I want to \nreiterate the need for that oversight, the need for regular Government \nAccounting Office reports to Congress of the use of the new authorities \nunder FISA and pen register and trap and trace law and the need for the \nCommittee on the Judiciary to scrutinize the use of these new \nauthorities regularly. I am pleased that many members of the Senate \nbelieve we must pursue this duty diligently.\n  I am also pleased that the final version of this legislation \nincorporates a four-year limit on the applicability of these and many \nother search authorities. With this ``sunset,'' law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies will be able to use new powers to identify and \nact on terrorist efforts and Congress will have the ability to review \nfully the implications of the new law.\n  We can all agree that the events on September 11 have focused America \non the fight against terrorism, and we applaud the efforts of the \nadministration in the weeks since that tragic day. Clearly, there were \nfailures in our investigative network, and this legislation will help \navoid such failures in the future, allowing greater sharing of \ninformation that could foil terrorists before they carry out their \nbrutal schemes against innocent civilians.\n  The question then becomes how to make sure that the new authority \nisn't abused--in fact used for law enforcement purposes or fishing \nexpeditions. Over many years and with great effort, we have crafted a \ncareful balance in protecting personal privacy. The bottom line is this \nlegislation could circumvent or supersede Federal and State privacy \nlaws that have balanced law enforcement needs and privacy concerns, \ngoing well beyond the changes to the law needed for intelligence \ngathering. This is no ordinary time for our country. But in this \nprocess we must remember those Fourth Amendment rights that we have so \ndiligently fought for in the past.\n  I am proud of this Congress for acting promptly and thoughtfully in \nresponse to the horrific events of September 11. That day was an \nawakening to Americans, signaling the urgency for this government to \nchange how we deal with terrorism. This legislation does much to \nfacilitate better information gathering and sharing between our law \nenforcement and intelligence communities and greater protection of our \nborders from the intrusion of terrorists. I am hopeful that those of us \nin government have the wisdom and prudence to use these new powers in \nsuch a way as to not undermine the freedoms we seek to protect.\n  Mr. President, currently, there is no single technology standard in \nplace that allows the Federal Government to confirm with certainty the \nidentity of aliens seeking entry into the United States through the \nvisa program. Insufficient identification technology is available to \nour consular officers responsible for reviewing visa applications to \nfacilitate a comprehensive background check of persons applying for a \nUnited States visa. Consular officers lack the technology to verify \nthat a person seeking a visa has not previously sought or received a \nvisa using another name or identity. Similarly, there is no widely \nimplemented technology that allows United States border inspectors to \nconfirm the identity of persons seeking admittance into the United \nStates using a visa.\n  Pursuant to Section 403(c) of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, the \nFederal Government is required to develop and implement a technology \nstandard that can facilitate extremely high confidence in confirming \nthe identity of an alien seeking a visa or seeking entry into the \nUnited States pursuant to a visa.\n  The standard required by these provisions will facilitate the capture \nand sharing of all relevant identity information regarding the alien \napplicant,\n\n[[Page S11030]]\n\nincluding biometrics, and information relevant to determining the \neligibility of such a person for entry into the United States from and \nbetween all relevant departments and agencies through compatible, \ninteroperable systems.\n  The purpose of this subsection is to ensure that United States \nGovernment will establish a technology standard to allow: 1, the State \nDepartment, at the time a person applies for a United States visa, to \ndo a comprehensive background check against databases of known aliens \nineligible for entry into the United States; 2, the State Department to \nverify the identity of a person applying for a United States visa as a \nperson who has not on a previous occasion sought a visa using a \ndifferent name or identity; and 3, United States border inspectors and \npreclearance agents to confirm that a person seeking entry to the \nUnited States on the basis of a visa is the same person who obtained \nthe visa from the Department of State.\n  Although it is understood by Congress that technological advances may \nrequire revisions to any standard adopted pursuant to this provision, \nit is expected that the standard will initially incorporate appropriate \nbiometric technologies to compare identity information provided by the \nvisa applicant to criminal, immigration and intelligence databases that \nuse a fingerprint biometric or a facial recognition biometric.\n  Further, to obtain the greatest protection of United States citizens \nby excluding persons ineligible for entry into the United States, the \nDepartment of State, the Department of Justice and other appropriate \ndepartments of the Federal Government should work with the governments \nof other countries to encourage such countries to adopt the standard \nestablished pursuant to this subparagraph and to establish \ninternational interoperability of identity databases. In particular, it \nwill be beneficial to the United States to facilitate adoption of this \ntechnology standard for appropriate identity information exchange with \nCanada and Mexico. It would further benefit the security of United \nStates citizens to encourage adoption of this standard by those \ncountries for whose citizens the United States, Canada or Mexico do not \nrequire a visa to enter the respective country.\n  Paragraph (1) requires the Department of Justice and Department of \nState, through the National Institute of Standards and Technology \n(NIST), and in consultation with other Federal law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies deemed appropriate by the Attorney General or the \nSecretary of State, to develop a technology standard to facilitate \nconfirmation of the identity of persons seeking a visa or persons using \na visa to enter the United States. The Departments of Justice and State \nshall also consult with Congress in the development of this standard \nthrough the reporting process described in paragraph (4) of this \nsubsection.\n  This technology standard will enable the Department of State to \nconfirm that a person seeking a visa is not known to the Federal \nGovernment as a person ineligible for a visa, or is a person who has \nsought or obtained a visa using a different name or identity. The \ntechnology standard will also enable Federal inspectors at all ports of \nentry and preclearance locations to confirm that a person seeking entry \nto the United States using a visa is the same as the person to which \nthe Department of State issued the visa, and is not a person sought by \nthe Federal Government to be excluded from entry to the United States.\n  The technology standard must be developed and certified by NIST \nwithin two years of the date of enactment of this subsection.\n  Paragraph (2) provides that the technology standard described in \nparagraph (1) shall be the basis for a cross-agency, cross-platform \nelectronic database system that is a cost-effective, efficient, fully \nintegrated means to share law enforcement and intelligence information \nnecessary to confirm the identity of a person applying for a United \nStates visa, or such a person seeking to enter the United States using \na visa.\n  Paragraph (3) requires that the system described in paragraph (2) \nshall be implemented in a manner that is readily and easily accessible \nto all consular officers responsible for the issuance of United States \nvisas; all Federal inspection agents at United States border inspection \npoints (including any preclearance locations); and all law enforcement \nand intelligence officers responsible for investigation or \nidentification of aliens admitted to the United States pursuant to a \nvisa, provided that such officers are provided access to this system \npursuant to regulation.\n  Paragraph (4) provides that the Attorney General and the Secretary of \nState jointly and in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, \nshall report to Congress within 18 months of the date of enactment of \nthis Act, and every two years thereafter, describing the development, \nimplementation and efficacy of the technology standard described in \nthis subsection. The report must also consider the privacy implications \nand applicability of Federal privacy laws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the Senator as much time as he requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Utah, the leader on our side on \nthis committee.\n  I want to talk just in specifics about one area with which this bill \ndeals. We know that as a result of the tragedy of September 11 and the \ncontinuing problems we are having with anthrax and other threats from \nabroad, we need to do a better job of seeing who comes into this \ncountry to make sure people who wish to do us harm are, if possible, \nscreened out before they get here so people who are visitors from \nabroad who engage in things that are inappropriate, who violate the \nterms of their visas or their other status, can be removed.\n  So after the September 11 incident happened and people started \ntalking about problems in immigration, I spent a full day traveling \nwith representatives from the INS in my State. We are in the heartland, \nbut Missouri is directly involved because many of these visitors come \nto Missouri as well. I know the people at our major ports have even \ngreater problems, but we saw the problems firsthand.\n  I said: Why can't you get somebody out of the country if they \noverstay their visa?\n  And they asked a very logical question: How do you know where they \nare? We don't have a good system.\n  I said: Is it possible?\n  They said: You probably could not give us enough INS enforcement \nagents to make sure we could find every person. They come in, they say \nthey are going to go to Branson, MO, or they are going to visit the \nArch in Missouri, and they may go to one or two other lesser tourist \nattractions across the country, and we don't know where they are.\n  As a result of discussions with them and some great assistance I \nreceived from my cosponsors, Senator Conrad and Senator Snowe, we put \ntogether what we think are some significant improvements in the way we \ndeal with visitors to this country to lessen the likelihood that they \nwill be able to participate in causing harm to citizens of the United \nStates. So we have put together the Visa Integrity and Security Act. I \nexpress our sincere appreciation to the managers of this bill and to \nour colleagues in the House for adopting these principles and putting \nthem into the bill.\n  This is not going to be a total solution. Nobody can expect that we \nare going to do a 100-percent job. But when we look at what has \nhappened in the past, we think this is going to be a significant \nimprovement.\n  As Senator Snowe pointed out, Sheik Rahman, who has been in prison \nfor his part in the first bombing of the World Trade Center, had been \non a watch list, the Foreign Intelligence Watch List, for years, and \nnobody told the State Department or the INS, and they gave him \npermanent status in the United States. That was after he had been \nidentified.\n  We are saying the criminal agencies, the law enforcement agencies \nhave to talk with the State Department, the people who are issuing \nthese visas, and let them know we should not let this guy back into the \nUnited States. He came and went five times. That is just not \nacceptable.\n  I also trust the State Department will change the directions in their\n\n[[Page S11031]]\n\nmanual which has said in recent years that merely urging terrorist \nactivities or belonging to a terrorist organization do not disqualify \nyou from coming to the United States. I mean, if you are a member of \nal-Qaida, you say: Oh, well, he may not be one of the murderers?\n\n  Give me a break. If there is any ground for keeping somebody out of \nthe United States, it ought to be that they are a member of al-Qaida. I \nhope in the future we can share that information and make sure they do \nnot come in.\n  So one of the things we require is that the FBI share the National \nCriminal Information System with the State Department and the INS. We \nare going to ask the Director of Homeland Security to report to \nCongress on the need for any other Federal agencies, intelligence \nagencies, to share or feed their information into this database.\n  One of the things we know now is that people can come in under one \nname and then change names and we don't know exactly who they are. We \ndon't have a foolproof method of identifying these people who come into \nthe United States. Isn't it about time we know for certain, before they \neven come in, who they are? Doesn't it make sense that we know for \ncertain who they are when they are in the United States?\n  I talked with the dean of the engineering school at the University of \nMissouri at Columbia. He said 10 years ago it wouldn't be possible but \nnow, clearly, we have the technology to do this. So this bill instructs \nthe Attorney General to implement an automated system to track the \nentry and exit of visa holders, to make sure who they are, where they \nare, and what their status is.\n  Back in my time, we used to talk about fingerprints. Now the term is \na biometric system. There are a number of different systems to review. \nThere can be digitized facial profiles, digitized photos of the iris of \nthe eye, whatever is most feasible and effective there--to select that. \nWe need to put some money in putting the machinery in our consular \noffices overseas so when somebody comes in and presents himself to get \na visa to get into the country, we can find out and make a record, \npermanently, of who they are. No more using stolen passports.\n  One of our partners in Western Europe who operates under the visa \nwaiver system has a problem with 60,000 stolen passports. Right now, if \nyou buy a passport or take somebody else's visa, we have a tough time \ntracking them. But once they get that biometric card, we know \npositively. We have a modern-day thumbprint on them. We can check them \nout overseas; we can check them in our records. When they come to the \nport of entry, we check them at the port of entry to make sure they are \nwho they say they are. And if they do not get out of the country in \ntime, we turn that information over to law enforcement agencies, so if \nthere is a contact with a law enforcement agency, this rings a bell: \nYou are out of status. You stayed too long. Or if a student leaves the \nschool, departs the school which he or she is supposed to attend or an \nH-1B visa holder leaves the job he or she is supposed to have, that is \nreported to the INS and they can turn over that information. Any law \nenforcement official in the United States who comes in contact with him \nwill know that person is out of status.\n  Somebody says: Why is it important to know if they are out of status? \nMany people who are out of status and performing activities that are \nhighly suspicious may not rise to the level of criminal indictment or \nfor a criminal information to be filed against them, but if they are \ninvolved in suspicious activities and they are out of status, they are \nviolating the terms of their visa and they can be deported and we \npotentially can avoid problems before they actually occur.\n  This is not going to be 100 percent effective. But when people are \nout of status, particularly if they are acting suspiciously, we will \nhave a record on them, and we need to tighten up the system to know \nwhen they leave. Right now, it just depends upon the airlines, making \nsure they tell us who leaves the country. That is not good enough. We \nneed to keep a record of who comes in and who leaves so we know who is \noverstaying their visa. They say 4 to 6 million people are here \nillegally because they overstayed their visa, and we don't have any \nidea how to find them. At least if we have a biometric card, when they \ncome in contact with a law enforcement agency, then we can do that.\n  Student visas are another thing. A lot of people focused on the \nstudent visas. That is a small portion of the people who come to the \nUnited States. There were a couple of people involved in the September \n11 tragedy who were here on student visas.\n  Hanni Hanjour came here supposedly to study English in California and \nnever showed up at school. The school didn't know he was coming. They \ndidn't tell anybody. The next time we heard from him he was apparently \npiloting the plane that went into the Pentagon.\n  It is not the student visas that are the problem. All visas are \nproblems. But in this bill we authorize almost $37 million to implement \nthe system that Congress dictated 4 or 5 years ago to track the people \nwho come into the United States and to get a solid tracking system to \nknow if they are overstaying their visa. If they do not show up for \nschool, then the schools would have to notify the INS. It would apply \nthe same requirements to language schools, to vocational schools, and, \nyes, especially to flight schools. So we would know who was coming in.\n  This data system which has been put on the slow road is to be speeded \nup and to be fully in effect by the beginning of January 2003. So we \nwill have a better system.\n  Let me say a brief word about student visa holders. The foreign \nstudents who come to this land are a vitally important part of our \neducational system. We are very proud in Missouri to have a number of \nschools with a significant number of foreign students who bring their \nculture, their experience, and their knowledge to this country. In my \nview, one of the best foreign relation tools we have is to share \neducation with the future leaders of other countries.\n  I have traveled extensively in Asia. I have found that many of the \ngovernmental leaders, scientific leaders, and leaders in journalism \nhave studied in my State. They come up to me and ask how the Missouri \nTigers are doing. They know what we are about. We have a good basis to \ntalk with them.\n  I was in Malaysia in August to talk about the potential that we have \nto gain great medical insight and perhaps advances through \nbiotechnology using the information in genes in the Malaysian rain \nforest. Two of the leaders graduated from the University of Missouri.\n  These are in the bill. The visa waiver program needs to be tightened \nup so countries that just send their citizens into our country without \ngoing through the visa process--we need to work with them and negotiate \nwith them so they have a strong, positive identifier, and so we have \nthe same kind of identification with them as we do with these other \nstates.\n  I know many people want to speak on this. I, again, express my \nappreciation to the managers of the bill. I thank my cosponsors, \nSenator Conrad and Senator Snowe. I urge adoption of this measure which \nI think is going to move us significantly in the right direction of \npreventing terrorist activities in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will take a moment. How much time is \nremaining to the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 43 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom New York has been waiting on the floor for some time. How much \ntime is the Senator from New York going to want?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for 7 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I see the distinguished senior Senator from California. \nHow much time does she want?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will take 1 additional minute; 8 minutes.\n  That was meant to be a joke.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am trying to think how to react to that, considering the \nsize of the State of Vermont--other than to say that when Vermont was \nadmitted to the Union it had twice the population of California when \nCalifornia was admitted to the Union. Every day now California gains \nthe population of Vermont.\n  Mr. President, I ask that 8 minutes of my time be given to the \nSenator from\n\n[[Page S11032]]\n\nNew York and 8 minutes to the Senator from California, both of whom are \nvalued members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the manager of the bill and others \nwho are waiting permit me 15 seconds to mention what has occurred?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill for \nincluding the provisions that Senator Bond, myself, and Senator Snowe \nauthored to tighten our borders, to provide coordination with schools \nand employers when visa holders come to this country, to coordinate the \nwork of our intelligence agencies with the INS and the State Department \nso we are confident of who is coming in, and to impose these new \nprovisions using biometrics so we really know who is coming to our \ncountry.\n  I thank the managers very much, and I thank Senator Bond for his \nleadership.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond. I thank Senator \nConrad and Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first, let me thank our senior Senator from Vermont \nand our senior Senator from Utah for their leadership on this bill; and \nalso the many who have worked on it.\n  It is good that we have brought this bill in a timely fashion before \nthe Senate. On the one hand, we didn't rush so much that we did the \nbill in a day or two. On the other hand, we didn't have a great need to \nwait in terms of security. I think it is coming to the floor at the \nright time with enough deliberation and care but at the same time not \ndelaying too much because the security problems America faces are large \nand at times seem almost overwhelming.\n  If there is one key word that underscores this bill, it is \n``balance.'' In the new post-September 11 society that we face, balance \nis going to be a key word. Technology has forced us to recalibrate in \nmany different ways. The technology that allowed these horrible people \nto do what they did to my city and to America and the technology that \nallows law enforcement to try to catch up with them changes rapidly. No \nlaw can sit still as that technology changes and still be effective.\n  The balance between the need to update our laws given the new \nchallenges and the need to maintain our basic freedoms which \ndistinguish us from our enemies is real.\n  There have been some on the right who have said just pass anything. \nWe just have to go after the terrorists and forget about our freedoms \nand our civil liberties. There are some on the left who say only look \nat the civil liberties aspect. They are both wrong. Fortunately, \nneither prevailed in this fine piece of work that we have before us. \nBalance and reason have prevailed.\n  This is the Senate working at its best under a crisis situation but \nstill with care and an appropriate degree of deliberation.\n  It is also an example of the two parties coming together, and of the \nadministration and the Congress coming together. In a sense, in this \nbill there is something for everyone to like and something for everyone \nto dislike, which may well show that it will end up in the right place.\n  I would like to talk about a few parts of the bill. The trap-and-\ntrace provision is basically a proposal that Senator Kyl and I put \ntogether a couple years ago which is basically in the bill intact. It \nis vital. If you ask law enforcement what they need, they need a \nstandard when they have somebody who is a terrorist or a potential \nterrorist, that would allow a wiretap to be made so they can find that \nperson.\n  In the old days it was easy. It was not easy to get a new telephone. \nYou had to go to the phone company to get one, and it would take a few \nweeks. Now people have cell phones; and anyone, for an illicit or bad \npurpose, can get a cell phone every day. In fact, we know some of the \nhijackers regularly bought new cell phones.\n  Without this new process, without nationalizing trap-and-trace \nauthority so you can follow the numbers that are called--you still \ncannot look at content without going to a judge--law enforcement would \nbe powerless. It still confounds me that a simple provision such as \nthis, which does not change the balance but simply updates the \ntechnology we need, had been held up for so long. Fortunately, it is \nhere now. Or unfortunately, it took an awful incident to make it \nhappen.\n  Most of the terrorists--and other criminals as well: money \nlaunderers, drug dealers--are pretty technologically savvy. To put \nhandcuffs on law enforcement so they cannot be as technologically \nsavvy, would make no sense.\n  I was also proud to work on the money laundering provision. Law \nenforcement has often said: Show me the money, and I will show you the \nterrorists. Let's be honest about it. The money-laundering provision is \nnot going to stop the flow of money completely to the terrorists. They \ncan still have couriers and packets and things such as that. But what \nit does do, No. 1, is make it harder, and, No. 2, it gives us \ninformation, the ability to find information, and find the flow of who \nis connected to whom, how, where, why, and when.\n  Again, the late Senator Coverdell and I had a money-laundering bill \nthat is not terribly different than the provisions in this bill. We had \nintroduced it a couple years ago.\n  I see my friend from Michigan. He has come to the Chamber. He has \ndone great work in relation to money laundering, as has the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, and so many others.\n  As to information sharing, again, we need to share information more \nquickly and more rapidly among our various law enforcement agencies and \nbetween law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\n  When we are facing a war where it is more likely that more civilians \nwill die than military personnel, the homefront is a warfront. The old \nhigh wall between foreign intelligence and domestic law enforcement has \nto be modified. The bill does a good job of that.\n  There is a provision that would improve communication between Federal \nlaw enforcement and local law enforcement, which Senator Clinton and I \nbelieve needs tightening up. There were procedural, not substantive, \nobjections raised to it. We hope to bring that measure back either as a \nfreestanding measure or as part of some other legislation.\n  The other provisions in the bill are good as well. I believe in \nimmigration. I think immigrants are great for America. But immigrants \ndo not have the exact same rights as citizens. They never have, nor \nshould they. To say that somebody who is not a U.S. citizen and might \nbe suspicious should be detained for a short period of time while law \nenforcement checks them out--after all, they are trying to enter the \ncountry, which is a privilege, not a right--makes sense. To say they \nshould be detained indefinitely without going to a judge cuts too far \nagainst the grain of the freedoms we have. Once again, this bill seeks \na balance.\n\n  Finally, as to the sunset, I was very much opposed to the House 2-\nyear sunset. How could we have law enforcement adapt to a new law \nknowing that by the time they get geared up, it is almost going to be \nsunsetted? In fact, I think you do it the other way. If a law is good, \nyou put it on the books permanently, and then you reexamine it. You do \nnot automatically have it off the books. That means you do not trust \nthe product you put together.\n  Four years is about the minimum amount of time that would be \nacceptable to me. I thought 5 would be better, or, frankly, no sunset. \nPutting the burden of proof the other way would have made more sense, \nstill. But a 4-year sunset, again, shows compromise.\n  Mr. President, I have said this in this Chamber before. In this new \nworld in which we live, everyone has to give a little bit. We are \nasking our citizens to give a little bit. We are asking our Armed \nForces to give a lot. And that applies to us as well.\n  I hope and pray--and I believe it has happened in this bill--there is \na bit of a new attitude. Even if you cannot get everything your way, at \nleast you give the benefit of the doubt to the compromise that has been \nput together because we have to move things forward, and this bill does \nthat.\n  In conclusion, the scourge of terrorism is going to be with us for a \nwhile. Law enforcement has a lot of catching up to do. There is no \nquestion\n\n[[Page S11033]]\n\nabout it. In this bill, at least, we give them fair and adequate tools \nthat do not infringe on our freedoms but, at the same time, allows them \nto catch up a lot more quickly.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from California \nwould yield for a unanimous consent request.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nremarks of the Senator from California, I be recognized for the time \nallotted to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Americans tend to be a very open \npeople. Americans, to a great extent, have looked at Government, \nsaying: Just leave me alone. Keep Government out of my life. At least \nthat is the way it was before September 11. What I hear post-September \n11 are people saying: What is my Government going to do to protect me?\n  As we look back at that massive, terrible incident on September 11, \nwe try to ascertain whether our Government had the tools necessary to \nferret out the intelligence that could have, perhaps, avoided those \nevents. The only answer all of us could come up with, after having \nbriefing after briefing, is we did not have those tools. This bill aims \nto change that. This bill is a bill whose time has come. This bill is a \nnecessary bill. And I, as a Senator from California, am happy to \nsupport it.\n  This legislation brings our criminal and national security laws in \nline with developing technologies so that terrorists will no longer be \nable to stay one step ahead of law enforcement. And believe me, they \ncan today.\n  Right now, for example, terrorists can evade Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act wiretaps, which are device-specific, by simply \nswitching cell phones every few hours. This legislation fixes that and \nallows for roving FISA wiretaps, the same as are currently allowed for \nsuspected criminals under the domestic law enforcement portions of the \nlaw known as title III.\n  And because modern communications often travel through countless \njurisdictions before reaching their final destination, investigators \nmust now get court orders from every one of those jurisdictions. They \ncan have to get 15, 20 court orders to carry out a wiretap. This bill \nwould change that, allowing for just one court order from the \noriginating jurisdiction.\n  And the bill recognizes that voice mails and e-mails should be \ntreated alike when law enforcement seeks access to them. Technology, as \nit changes, changes the ability to conduct an intelligence \nsurveillance. This bill attempts to keep a very careful balance between \nthe personal right to privacy and the Government's right to know, in an \nemergency situation, to be able to protect its citizens.\n  It also increases information sharing between the intelligence \ncommunity and law enforcement. As a matter of fact, it mandates it. \nCriminal investigations often result in foreign intelligence. This \ninformation, up to this point, is not shared with the intelligence \ncommunity. After this bill becomes law, it must be shared.\n  And it makes it easier for law enforcement to defeat those who would \nuse the computers of others to do mischief.\n  For example, with the Zombie computer, I invade your computer and, by \ninvading your computer, go into 1,000 other computers and am able to \nget one of them to open the floodgates of a dam. This bill prevents \nthat.\n  Overall, this bill gives law enforcement and the intelligence \ncommunity the tools they need to go after what is an increasingly \nsophisticated terrorist element.\n  I am very pleased this legislation also includes a number of \nprovisions I drafted with Senator Graham well before the events on \nSeptember 11--title 9 of this bill. These provisions give the Director \nof the CIA, as head of the intelligence community, a larger role with \nregard to the analysis and dissemination of foreign intelligence \ngathered under FISA. These mandate that law enforcement share \ninformation with the intelligence community.\n  And title 9 improves the existing Foreign Terrorist Asset Tracking \nCenter which helps locate terrorist assets. It authorizes additional \nresources to help train local law enforcement to recognize and handle \nforeign intelligence.\n  We now have these anti-terrorist teams throughout the country. They \nneed to be trained, and they need to learn the tools of the trade and \nget the security clearances so they can tap into these databases.\n  I agree with the 4-year sunset included for certain surveillance \nprovisions in the bill. In committee I suggested a 5-year sunset. The \nHouse had 2 years. It is now 4 years. That is an appropriate time. It \ngives us the time to review whether there were any outrageous uses of \nthese provisions or whether uses were appropriate under the basic \nintent of the bill.\n  Let me briefly touch on a related topic of great importance in the \nwar against terrorism. As an outgrowth of the Technology, Terrorism, \nand Government Information Subcommittee, today Senator Jon Kyl of \nArizona and I held a press conference indicating a bill we will shortly \nintroduce to create a new, central database, a database that is a \nlookout database into which information from intelligence, from law \nenforcement, from all Federal agencies will go. That database will be \nfor every visa holder, every person who crosses borders coming in and \nout of this country. The legislation will provide for ``smart visa \ncards'', reform the visa waiver program, reform the unregulated student \nprogram, and improve and beef up identity documents.\n  I passed around at the press conference a pilot's license, easily \nreproducible, no biometric data, no photograph, perforated around the \nedges showing that it had been removed from a bigger piece. This is the \npilot's license that every 747 pilot carries, every private pilot \ncarries. It is amazing to me that this can be a Federal document and be \nas sloppy as it is in this time.\n  We intend to see that identity documents are strengthened to provide \nnot only photographs, but biometric data as well (such as fingerprints \nor facial recognition information). And the data system would be such \nthat it is flexible and scalable so as biometric technology and \nrequirements progress, the database can keep up.\n  Both Senator Kyl and I also met with Larry Ellison, the CEO of \nOracle. Oracle has stated that they are willing to devote some 1,500 \nengineers to develop a national identity database. What we are \nproposing is different from that. He said they would devote their \nsoftware free of charge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may just have 1 minute to conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. We are not proposing a national identity card, but we \ndo believe this kind of database could be prepared by a company such as \nOracle--they have offered to give it to the Government for free or by \nNEC, which did a state-of-the-art fingerprint system for San Francisco. \nWe believe this should be under the auspices of the Homeland Security \nDirector, that these decisions need to be made rapidly, and that we \nneed to get cracking to close the loopholes that have made the United \nStates of America one giant sieve.\n  This bill, which I am so happy to support, takes a giant step forward \nin that direction. I thank both the chairman of the committee and the \nranking member for their diligence on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the antiterrorism bill which the Senate is \nabout to pass reflects the sentiments the American people have \nexpressed since the events of September 11--that we must act swiftly \nand strongly to defend our country without sacrificing our most \ncherished values. The Senate antiterrorism legislation meets that test. \nIt responds to these dangerous times by giving law enforcement agencies \nimportant new tools to use in combating terrorism without denigrating\n\n[[Page S11034]]\n\nthe principles of due process and fairness embedded in our \nConstitution.\n  The bill is not perfect. In fact, during the Senate's consideration \nof its bill, I supported three amendments offered by Senator Feingold. \nEach of the Feingold amendments would have strengthened privacy \nprotections for American citizens without undermining law enforcement \nefforts to investigate terrorists. One amendment would have maintained \nlimits in Federal and State law on law enforcement access to personal \nrecords, particularly with regards to sensitive medical and financial \ninformation. A second amendment would have required law enforcement to \nascertain that a surveillance target under the antiterrorism bill's \nexpanded wiretap authority was actually in the house that was bugged or \nusing the phone that was tapped before surveillance could be initiated. \nThe third amendment that I supported would have placed sensible limits \non the government's ability to intercept computer communications. Among \nthese limits were the type of investigation and the length of \nsurveillance in which the government could utilize new surveillance \nauthority provided in the antiterrorism bill.\n  While the amendments I supported were not adopted the bill before us \nis much stronger from a civil liberties standpoint than the legislation \nthat was initially proposed by the administration. This is due in large \npart to the strong commitment to civil liberties and the tireless \nefforts of Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy.\n  The bill also bolsters Federal criminal laws against terrorism in \nseveral important areas, including extending the statute of limitations \nfor terrorist offenses and modernizing surveillance laws to permit \ninvestigators to keep pace with new technologies like cell phones and \nthe Internet.\n  Michigan's economy and security depend on the Federal Government \nproviding adequate resources for inspection and law enforcement at the \nState's northern border. I am pleased that the final bill now before us \nalso includes significant new funding to increase security and improve \ntraffic flow at the northern border.\n  Finally, this legislation includes a landmark set of provisions that \nI have been proud to sponsor that will strengthen and modernize U.S. \nanti-money laundering laws. Osama bin Laden has boasted that his modern \nnew recruits know the ``cracks'' in ``Western financial systems'' like \nthey know the ``lines in their hands.'' Enactment of this bill will \nhelp seal the cracks that allow terrorists and other criminals to use \nour financial systems against us.\n  The final money laundering provisions appear in Title 3 of the bill \nand represent a significant advance over existing law. Here are some of \nthe anti-money laundering provisions that I authored and that are \nincluded in the final bill.\n  For the first time, all U.S. financial institutions--not only banks \nbut securities firms, insurance companies, money transmitters, and \nother businesses that transfer funds or engage in large cash \ntransactions--will have a legal obligation to exercise due diligence \nbefore allowing a foreign financial institution to open a correspondent \naccount with them and thereby gain entry into the U.S. financial \nsystem.\n  For the first time, U.S. banks and securities firms will be barred \nfrom opening accounts for foreign shell banks that have no physical \npresence anywhere and no affiliation with another bank.\n  For the first time, U.S. prosecutors will be able to freeze and seize \na depositor's funds in a foreign financial institution's correspondent \naccount to the same extent under civil forfeiture laws as a depositor's \nfunds in other U.S. financial accounts.\n  For the first time, foreign corruption offenses such as bribery and \nmisappropriation of funds by a public official will qualify as \npredicate offenses that can trigger a U.S. money laundering \nprosecution.\n  Still other provisions in the bill give U.S. law enforcement a host \nof new tools to investigate and prosecute money laundering crimes, \nespecially crimes involving a foreign financial institution.\n  Here are some of the other key provisions in the bill that make \nlandmark changes in U.S. anti-money laundering laws.\n  For the first time, all U.S. financial institutions will have a legal \nobligation to verify the identity of their customers, and all customers \nwill have a legal obligation to tell the truth about who they are.\n  For the first time, all U.S. financial institutions will be required \nto have anti-money laundering programs.\n  For the first time, the U.S. Treasury Secretary will have legal \nauthority to designate specific foreign financial institutions, \njurisdictions, transactions or accounts as a ``primary money laundering \nconcern'' and use special measures to restrict or prohibit their access \nto the U.S. marketplace.\n  For the first time, bulk cash smuggling over U.S. borders will be a \nprosecutable crime, and suspect funds will be subject to forfeiture \nproceedings.\n  Just like we are tightening our border controls to restrict access to \nthe United States across its physical borders, the bill's anti-money \nlaundering provisions will tighten our financial controls to restrict \naccess into the U.S. financial system. They will require our financial \ninstitutions to take new steps, to do more work, and to exercise \ngreater caution before opening up the financial system of the United \nStates.\n  When the anti-money laundering provisions first passed the Senate on \nOctober 11, I gave a floor statement explaining a number of the \nprovisions that had been taken from the Levin-Grassley anti-money \nlaundering bill, S. 1371. While I do not want to repeat all of that \nlegislative history here, some important improvements were made during \nthe House-Senate negotiations that I would like to comment on in order \nto explain their intent and impact.\n  First is the shell bank ban in Section 313 of the final bill. That \nprovision appeared in both the House and Senate bills, with only a few \ndifferences. The primary difference is that the House provision applied \nonly to ``depository institutions,'' while the Senate bill was intended \nto ban both U.S. banks and U.S. securities firms from opening accounts \nfor shell banks. The final bill takes the broader approach advocated by \nthe Senate and applies the shell bank ban to both U.S. banks and U.S. \nsecurities firms. This broader ban is intended to make sure that \nneither U.S. banks nor U.S. securities firms open accounts for shell \nbanks, which carry the highest money laundering risks in the banking \nworld. This broader ban means, for example, that a bank that had shell \nbanks as clients and was required to close those accounts under this \nprovision would not be able to circumvent the ban simply by switching \nits shell bank clients to accounts at an affiliated broker-dealer. The \ngoal instead is to close off the U.S. financial system to shell banks \nand institute a broad ban on shell bank accounts.\n  In my floor statement of October 11, I explained the related \nrequirement in Section 313 that U.S. financial institutions take \nreasonable steps to ensure that other foreign banks are not allowing \ntheir U.S. accounts to be used by shell banks. The purpose of this \nlanguage is to prevent shell banks from getting indirect access to the \nU.S. financial system by operating through a correspondent account \nbelonging to another foreign bank. That requirement was included in \nboth the House and Senate bills, and in the final version of the \nlegislation. It is a key provision because it will put pressure on all \nforeign financial institutions that want to do business in the United \nStates to cut off the access that shell banks now enjoy in too many \ncountries around the world.\n  I also explained on October 11 that the shell bank ban contains one \nexception that is intended to be narrowly construed to protect the U.S. \nfinancial system from shell banks to the greatest extent possible. This \nexception, which is identical in both the House and Senate bills and is \nunchanged in the final version of the legislation, allows U.S. \nfinancial institutions to open an account for a shell bank that meets \ntwo tests: the shell bank is affiliated with another bank that \nmaintains a physical presence, and the shell bank is subject to \nsupervision by the banking regulator of that affiliated bank. The \nintent of this exception is to allow U.S. financial institutions to do \nbusiness with shell branches of large, established banks on the \nunderstanding that\n\n[[Page S11035]]\n\nthe bank regulator of the large, established bank will also supervise \nthe established bank's branch offices worldwide, including any shell \nbranch. As explained in my earlier floor statement, U.S. financial \ninstitutions are cautioned not to abuse this exception, to exercise \nboth restraint and common sense in using it, and to refrain from doing \nbusiness with any shell operation that is affiliated with a poorly \nregulated bank.\n  The House-Senate negotiations also added a new provision to Section \n313 giving U.S. financial institutions a 60-day period to wind up and \nclose any existing accounts for shell banks and to institute the \nreasonable procedures called for to ensure that other correspondent \naccounts with foreign financial institutions are not being used by \nshell banks. As I suggested on October 11, one possible approach with \nrespect to other correspondent accounts would be for the U.S. financial \ninstitution to develop standard language asking the foreign financial \ninstitution to certify that it is not and will not allow any shell bank \nto use its U.S. accounts and then to rely on that certification absent \nany evidence to the contrary.\n  A second provision I want to discuss in detail is the due diligence \nrequirement in Section 312 of the final bill. This provision also \nappeared in both the House and Senate bills, again with only a few \ndifferences in wording. This provision is intended to tighten U.S. \nanti-money laundering controls by requiring all U.S. financial \ninstitutions to exercise due diligence when opening or managing \ncorrespondent or private banking accounts for foreign financial \ninstitutions or wealthy foreign individuals. The purpose of this \nrequirement is to function as a preventative measure to stop rogue \nforeign financial institutions, terrorists or other criminals from \nusing U.S. financial accounts to gain access to the U.S. financial \nsystem.\n  The most important change made to the due diligence requirement \nduring the House-Senate negotiations was to make the definitional \nprovisions in section 311 also apply to section 312. Specifically, the \nHouse and Senate negotiators amended what is now Section 311(e) to make \nsure that its provisions would be applied to both the new 31 U.S.C. \n5318A and the new subsections (i) and (j) of 31 U.S.C. 5318 created by \nSections 311, 312 and 313 of the final bill.\n  As I mentioned in my floor statement on October 11, one of the key \nchanges that the Senate Banking Committee made to the due diligence \nrequirement when they took that provision from the Levin-Grassley bill, \nS. 1371, was to make the due diligence requirement apply to all U.S. \nfinancial institutions, not just banks. The Banking Committee expanded \nthe scope of the due diligence requirement by deleting the Levin-\nGrassley references to ``banks'' and substituting the term ``financial \ninstitutions'' which, in Section 5312(a)(2) of the Bank Secrecy Act, \nincludes not only banks, but also securities firms, insurance \ncompanies, money exchanges, and many other businesses that transfer \nfunds or carry out large cash transactions. The House Financial \nServices Committee adopted the same approach as the Senate Committee, \nusing the term ``financial institution'' in its due diligence provision \nrather than, for example, the term ``depository institution'' which the \nHouse Committee used in its version of the shell bank ban. The bottom \nline, then, is that both the House and Senate expanded the due \ndiligence provision to apply to all U.S. financial institutions, not \njust banks.\n  During the House-Senate negotiations on the final version of the \nanti-money laundering legislation, Section 311(e) of the bill was \namended to make it applicable to both the due diligence requirement \ncreated by Section 312 and to the shell bank ban created by Section \n313. Section 311(e) establishes several new definitions for such terms \nas ``account'' and ``correspondent account,'' and also directs or \nauthorizes the Treasury Secretary to issue regulations to clarify other \nterms. By making those definitions and regulatory authority applicable \nto the due diligence requirement and shell bank ban, the House-Senate \nnegotiators helped ensure that the same terms would be used \nconsistently across Sections 311, 312 and 313. In addition, the change \nhelps clarify the scope of the due diligence and shell bank provisions \nin several respects.\n  First, the change makes the definition of ``account'' applicable to \nthe due diligence requirement. This definition makes it clear that the \ndue diligence requirement is intended to apply to a wide variety of \nbank accounts provided to foreign financial institutions or private \nbanking clients, including checking accounts, savings accounts, \ninvestment accounts, trading accounts, or accounts granting lines of \ncredit or other credit arrangements. The clear message is that, before \nopening any type of account for a foreign financial institution or a \nwealthy foreign individual and giving that account holder access to the \nUnited States financial system, U.S. financial institutions must use \ndue diligence to evaluate the money laundering risk, to detect and \nreport possible instances of money laundering, and to deny access to \nterrorists or other criminals.\n  The definition also ensures that the shell bank ban applies widely to \nbar a shell bank from attempting to open virtually any type of \nfinancial account available at a U.S. financial institution.\n  Second, the change makes it clear that the definition of \n``correspondent account'' applies to the due diligence requirement. \nThis clarification is important, because the definition makes it clear \nthat ``correspondent accounts'' are not confined to accounts opened for \nforeign banks, as specified in S. 1371, but encompass accounts opened \nfor any ``foreign financial institution.'' This broader reach is in \nkeeping with the effort of the Senate Banking Committee and the House \nFinancial Services Committee to expand the due diligence requirement to \napply to all financial institutions, not just banks. It means, for \nexample, that U.S. financial institutions must use due diligence when \nopening accounts not only for foreign banks, but also for foreign \nsecurities firms, foreign insurance companies, foreign exchange houses, \nand other foreign financial businesses.\n  Section 311(e)(4) authorizes the Treasury Secretary to further define \nterms used in subsection (e)(1), and Treasury may want to use that \nauthority to issue regulatory guidance clarifying the scope of the term \n``foreign financial institution'' to help U.S. financial institutions \nunderstand the extent of their due diligence obligation under the new \n31 U.S.C. 5318(i). In fashioning this regulatory guidance, Treasury \nshould keep in mind the intent of Congress in issuing this new due \ndiligence requirement--to require all U.S. financial institutions to \nuse greater care when allowing any foreign financial institution inside \nthe U.S. financial system.\n  The significance of applying the ``correspondent account'' definition \nto the shell bank ban is, again, to ensure that the ban applies widely \nto bar a shell bank from opening virtually any type of financial \naccount available at a U.S. financial institution.\n  Third, due to the change made by House-Senate negotiators, Section \n311(e)(3) directs the Treasury Secretary to issue regulations defining \n``beneficial ownership of an account'' for purposes of both the new 31 \nU.S.C. 5318A and the new subsections (i) and (j) of 31 U.S.C. 5318. How \nthe regulations define ``beneficial ownership'' will have profound \nimplications for these new provisions as well as for other aspects of \nU.S. anti-money laundering laws. Section 311(e)(3) directs Treasury to \naddress three sets of issues in defining beneficial ownership: the \nsignificance of ``an individual's authority to fund, direct, or manage \nthe account''; the significance of ``an individual's material interest \nin the income or corpus of the account''; and the exclusion of \nindividuals whose beneficial interest in the income or corpus of the \naccount is immaterial.''\n  The issue of beneficial ownership is at the heart of the fight \nagainst terrorists and other criminals who want to use our financial \ninstitutions against us. Terrorists and other criminals want to hide \ntheir identity as well as the criminal origin of their funds so that \nthey can use their U.S. accounts without alerting law enforcement. They \nwant to use U.S. and international payment systems to move their funds \nto their operatives with no questions asked. They want to deposit their \nfunds in interest-bearing accounts to\n\n[[Page S11036]]\n\nincrease the financial resources available to them. They want to set up \ncredit card accounts and lines of credit that can be used to finance \ntheir illegal activities. Above all, they do not want U.S. financial \ninstitutions determining who exactly is the owner of their accounts, \nsince that information can lead to closure of the accounts, seizure of \nassets, exposure of terrorist or criminal organizations, and other \nactions by law enforcement.\n  After the September 11 attack, it is more critical than ever that \nU.S. financial institutions determine exactly who is the beneficial \nowner of the accounts they open. Another provision of the final bill, \nSection 326 which was authored by House Financial Services Committee \nChairman Oxley, requires financial institutions to verify the identify \nof their customers. That provision gets at the same issue--that our \nfinancial institutions need to know who they are dealing with and who \nthey are performing services for.\n  Some financial institutions have pointed out the difficulties \nassociated with determining the beneficial owner of certain accounts. \nBut these are not new issues, and they can be dealt with in common \nsense ways. U.S. tax administrators and financial regulators have years \nof experience in framing ownership issues. Switzerland has had a \nbeneficial ownership requirement in place for years, and in fact \nrequires accountholders to sign a specific document, called ``Form A,'' \ndeclaring the identify of the account's beneficial owner. The \ndifficulties associated with determining beneficial ownership can be \naddressed.\n  There will, of course, be questions of interpretation. No one wants \nfinancial institutions to record the names of the stockholders of \npublicly traded companies. No one wants financial institutions to \nidentify the beneficiaries of widely held mutual funds. That is why \nthis section directs the Treasury Secretary to issue regulatory \nguidance in this area.\n  At the same time, there are those who are hoping to convince Treasury \nto turn the definition of beneficial ownership inside out, and declare \nthat attorneys or trustees or asset managers who direct payments into \nor out of an account on behalf of unnamed parties can somehow qualify \nas the ``beneficial owner of the account.'' Others will want to \nconvince Treasury that offshore shell corporations or trusts can \nqualify as the beneficial owner of the accounts they open. But those \nare exactly the types of accounts that terrorists and criminals use to \nhide their identities and infiltrate U.S. financial institutions. And \nthose are exactly the accounts for which U.S. financial institutions \nneed to verify and evaluate the real beneficial owners.\n  The beneficial ownership regulation will be a challenging \nundertaking. But there is plenty of expertise to draw upon, from FATF, \nthe Basel Committee, U.S. financial and tax regulators, other countries \nwith beneficial ownership requirements and, of course, from our own \nfinancial community.\n  Fourth, Section 311(e)(2) directs the Treasury Secretary to issue \nregulations clarifying how the term ``account'' applies to financial \ninstitutions other than banks. This authority should be read in \nconjunction with Section 311(e)(4) which allows, but does not require, \nthe Secretary to issue regulations defining other terms in the new 31 \nU.S.C. 5318A and the new subsections (i) and (j) of 31 U.S.C. 5318. \nThese two regulatory sections should, in turn, be read in conjunction \nwith Section 312(b)(1) which directs the Secretary to issue regulations \nfurther clarifying the due diligence policies, procedures and controls \nrequired under that section. Together, these grants of regulatory \nauthority provide the Treasury Secretary with ample authority to issue \nregulatory guidance to help different types of financial institutions \nunderstand what is expected of them in the area of due diligence. Such \nguidance may be needed by banks, securities firms, insurance companies, \nexchange houses, money service businesses and other financial \ninstitutions. The guiding principle, again, is to ensure that U.S. \nfinancial institutions exercise appropriate due diligence before \nopening accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign \nindividuals seeking access to the U.S. financial system.\n  These grants of regulatory authority can also be used by Treasury to \nensure that the shell bank ban established by Section 313 is as broad \nand effective as possible to keep shell banks out of the U.S. financial \nsystem.\n  Next is due diligence and correspondent banking. Section 312 imposes \nan ongoing, industry-wide legal obligation on all types of financial \ninstitutions operating in the United States to exercise appropriate \ncare when opening and operating correspondent accounts for foreign \nfinancial institutions to safeguard the U.S. financial system from \nmoney laundering. The general obligation to establish appropriate and \nspecific due diligence policies, procedures and controls when opening \ncorrespondent accounts is codified in a new 31 U.S.C. 5318(i)(1).\n\n  Subsection 5318(i)(2) specifies additional, minimum standards for \nenhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls that must be \nestablished by U.S. financial institutions for correspondent accounts \nopened for two specific categories of foreign banks: banks operating \nunder offshore banking licenses and banks operating in foreign \ncountries that have been designated as raising money laundering \nconcerns. These two categories of foreign banks were identified due to \ntheir higher money laundering risks, as explained in the extensive \nstaff report and hearing record of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, copies of which I released earlier this year.\n  Subsection 5318(i)(2) provides two alternative ways in which a \nforeign country can be designated as raising money laundering concerns. \nThe first way is if a country is formally designated by an \nintergovernmental group or organization of which the United States is a \nmember. Currently, the most well known such group is the Financial \nAction Task Force on Money Laundering, also known as FATF, which is \ncomposed of about 30 countries and is the leading international group \nfighting money laundering. In 2000, after a lengthy fact-finding and \nconsultative process, FATF began issuing a list of countries that \nFATF's member countries formally agreed to designate as noncooperative \nwith international anti-money laundering principles and procedures. \nThis list, which names between 12 and 15 countries, is updated \nperiodically and has become a powerful force for effecting change in \nthe listed jurisdictions. The second way a country may be designated \nfor purposes of the enhanced due diligence requirement is if the \ncountry is so designated by the Treasury Secretary under the procedures \nprovided in the new Section 5318A. This second alternative enables the \nUnited States to act unilaterally as well as multilaterally to require \nU.S. financial institutions to take greater care in opening \ncorrespondent accounts for foreign banks in jurisdictions of concern.\n  The House and Senate bills contained one minor difference in the \nwording of the provision regarding foreign country designations by an \nintergovernmental group or organization under the new 31 U.S.C. \n5318(i)(2)(A)(ii)(I). The House bill included a phrase, not in the \nSenate bill, stating that the foreign country designation had to be one \nwith which the Secretary of Treasury concurred, apparently out of \nconcern that an intergovernmental group or organization might designate \na country as noncooperative over the objection of the United States. \nThe final version of the provision includes the House approach, but \nuses statutory language making it clear that U.S. concurrence in the \nforeign country designation may be provided by the U.S. representative \nto the relevant international group or organization, whether or not \nthat representative is the Secretary of Treasury or some other U.S. \nofficial.\n  The new 31 U.S.C. 5318(i)(2) states that the enhanced due diligence \npolicies, procedures and controls that U.S. financial institutions must \nestablish for correspondent accounts with offshore banks and banks in \njurisdictions designated as raising money laundering concerns must \ninclude at least three elements. They must require the U.S. financial \ninstitution to ascertain the foreign bank's ownership, to carefully \nmonitor the account to detect and report any suspicious activity, and \nto determine whether the foreign bank is allowing any other banks to \nuse its U.S. correspondent account and, if so, the identity of those \nbanks and related due diligence information.\n\n[[Page S11037]]\n\n  The three elements specified in Section 5318(i)(2) for enhanced due \ndiligence policies, procedures and controls are not meant to be \ncomprehensive. Additional reasonable steps would be appropriate before \nopening or operating accounts for these two categories of foreign \nbanks, including steps to check the foreign bank's past record and \nlocal reputation, the jurisdiction's regulatory environment, the bank's \nmajor lines of business and client base, and the extent of the foreign \nbank's anti-money laundering program. Moreover, other categories of \nforeign financial institutions will also require use of enhanced due \ndiligence policies, procedures and controls including, for example, \noffshore broker-dealers or investment companies, foreign money \nexchanges, foreign casinos, and other foreign money service businesses.\n  Now I would like to discuss due diligence and private banking. The \nnew Section 5318(i) also addresses due diligence requirements for \nprivate banking accounts. The private banking staff report issued by \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations explains why these types \nof private banking accounts are especially vulnerable to money \nlaundering and why initial and ongoing due diligence reviews are needed \nto detect and report any suspicious activity.\n  The House and Senate versions of this provision were very similar. \nThe primary difference between them is that the House bill included a \ndefinition of ``private banking accounts'' that originally appeared in \nthe Levin-Grassley bill, S. 1371, while the Senate left the term \nundefined. The final version of Section 5318(i) includes the House \ndefinition. It has three elements. First, the account in question must \nrequire a $1 million minimum aggregate of deposits. Second, the account \nmust be opened on behalf of living individuals with a direct or \nbeneficial ownership interest in the account. Third, the account must \nbe assigned to, administered, or managed in part by, a financial \ninstitution employee such as a private banker, relationship manager or \naccount officer. The purpose of this definition is to require U.S. \nfinancial institutions to exercise due diligence when opening and \noperating private banking accounts with large balances controlled by \nwealthy foreign individuals with direct access to the financial \nprofessionals responsible for their accounts.\n  U.S. financial institutions with private banking accounts are \nrequired by the new Section 5318(i)(1) to establish appropriate and \nspecific due diligence policies, procedures and controls with respect \nto those accounts. Section 5318(i)(3) states that, at a minimum, the \ndue diligence policies, procedures and controls must include reasonable \nsteps to ascertain the identity of the accountholders, including the \nbeneficial owners; to ascertain the source of funds deposited into the \naccount; and to monitor the account to detect and report any suspicious \nactivity. If the account is opened for or on behalf of a senior foreign \npolitical figure or a close family member or associate of the political \nfigure, the U.S. financial institution must use enhanced due diligence \npolicies, procedures and controls with respect to that account, \nincluding closely monitoring the account to detect and report any \ntransactions that may involve the proceeds of foreign corruption. The \nenhanced due diligence requirements for private banking accounts \ninvolving senior foreign political figures are intended to work in \ntandem with the guidance issued on this subject by Treasury and federal \nbanking regulators in January 2001.\n  The accounts covered by the private banking definition are not \nconfined to accounts at U.S. banks, but also cover accounts opened at \nother types of financial institutions, including securities firms which \nhave developed lines of business offering similar types of accounts to \nwealthy foreign individuals. In addition, the section is intended to \ncover not only private banking accounts physically located inside the \nUnited States, but also private banking accounts that are physically \nlocated outside of the United States but managed by U.S. personnel from \ninside the United States. For example, the private banking \ninvestigation conducted by my Subcommittee found that it was a common \npractice for some U.S. private banks to open private banking accounts \nfor foreign clients in an offshore or bank secrecy jurisdiction, but \nthen to manage those accounts using private bankers located inside the \nUnited States. In such cases, the U.S. financial institution is \nrequired to exercise the same degree of due diligence in opening and \nmanaging those private banking accounts as it would if those accounts \nwere physically located within the United States.\n  Another area of inquiry involves the $1 million threshold. Some \nfinancial institutions have asked whether the $1 million minimum would \nbe met if an account initially held less than the required threshold, \nor the account's total deposits dipped below the threshold amount on \none or more occasions, or the same individual held accounts both inside \nand outside the private bank and kept the private bank account's total \ndeposits below the threshold amount. Such inquires are reminiscent of \nstructuring efforts undertaken to avoid certain anti-money laundering \nreporting requirements. Such structuring efforts have not been found \nacceptable in avoiding other anti-money laundering requirements, and \nthe language of the private banking provision is intended to preclude \nsuch maneuvering here.\n  The purpose of the private banking provision is to require U.S. \nfinancial institutions to exercise due diligence when opening or \nmanaging accounts with large deposits for wealthy foreign individuals \nwho can use the services of a private banker or other employee to move \nfunds, open offshore corporations or accounts, or engage in other \nfinancial transactions that carry money laundering risks. Because it is \nthe intent of Congress to strengthen due diligence controls and protect \nthe U.S. financial system to the greatest extent possible in the \nprivate banking area, the private banking definition should be \ninterpreted in ways that will maximize the due diligence efforts of \nU.S. financial institutions.\n  Finally, the House-Senate negotiators adjusted the effective date of \nthe due diligence provision. The new effective date gives the Treasury \nSecretary 180 days to issue regulations clarifying the due diligence \npolicies, procedures and controls required under the new 31 U.S.C. \n5318(i). These regulations are, again, intended to provide regulatory \nguidance to the range of U.S. financial institutions that will be \ncompelled to exercise due diligence before opening a private banking or \ncorrespondent banking account. Section 312(b) states that, whether or \nnot the Treasury Secretary meets the 180-day deadline for regulations, \nthe due diligence requirement will go into effect no later than 270 \ndays after the date of enactment of the legislation. That means, \nwhether or not the Treasury Secretary issues any regulations, after 270 \ndays, U.S. financial institutions will be legally required to establish \nappropriate and specific due diligence policies, procedures and \ncontrols for their private banking and correspondent accounts, \nincluding enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls \nwhere necessary.\n  In addition to due diligence and the Shell Bank provisions, my \nOctober 11 floor statement discusses several other bill provisions \nincluding those that add foreign corruption offenses to the list of \ncrimes that can trigger a U.S. money laundering prosecution, and those \nthat close a forfeiture loophole applicable to correspondent accounts \nfor foreign financial institutions. I will not repeat that legislative \nhistory again, but I do want to mention one other provision that I \nauthored to expand use of Federal receivers in money laundering and \nforfeiture proceedings.\n  The Federal receivers provision is contained in Section 317 of the \nfinal bill, and I want to make three points about it. First, this \nprovision comes out of the work of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations which found that many money laundering crimes include \nsuch complex flows of money across international lines that the average \nprosecutor does not have the time or resources needed to chase down the \nmoney, even when that money represents savings stolen or defrauded from \nhundreds of crime victims in the United States. In too many money \nlaundering cases, the crime victims will never see one dime of their \nlost savings. The Federal receiver provision in Section 317 is intended \nto provide Federal prosecutors and the Federal and State regulators \nworking with\n\n[[Page S11038]]\n\nthem the option of using a court-appointed receiver to chase down the \nlaundered funds.\n  Second, the provision is intended to allow any U.S. district court to \nappoint a Federal receiver in a money laundering or forfeiture \nproceeding, whether criminal or civil, if so requested by the Federal \nprosecutor or Federal or State regulator associated with the \nproceeding. The only restriction is that the court must have \njurisdiction over the defendant whose assets the receiver will be \npursuing. Jurisdiction may be determined in the context of the criminal \nor civil proceeding before the court, including under new language in \nother parts of Section 317 making it clear that a district court has \njurisdiction over any foreign financial institution that has a \ncorrespondent account at a U.S. financial institution; over any foreign \nperson who has committed a money laundering offense involving a \nfinancial transaction occurring in whole or in part in the United \nStates; and over any foreign person that has converted to their own use \nproperty that is the subject of a U.S. forfeiture order, as happened in \nthe Swiss American Bank case described in the Subcommittee's staff \nreport.\n  The third point about the Federal receiver provision is that it is \nintended to make it clear that Federal receivers appointed under U.S. \nmoney laundering laws may make requests and may obtain financial \ninformation from the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in \nTreasury and from foreign countries as if the receiver were standing in \nthe shoes of a federal prosecutor. This language is essential to \nincrease the effectiveness of receivers who often have to work quickly, \nin foreign jurisdictions, in cooperation with foreign law enforcement \nand financial regulatory personnel, and who need clear statutory \nauthority to make use of international information sharing arrangements \navailable to assist U.S. law enforcement. The provision is intended to \nmake it clear that the Federal receiver has the same access to \ninternational law enforcement assistance as a Federal prosecutor would \nif the prosecutor were personally attempting to recover the laundered \nfunds. The language is also intended to make it clear that Federal \nreceivers are bound by the same policies and procedures that bind all \nFederal prosecutors in such matters, and that Federal receivers have no \nauthority to exceed any restrictions set by the Attorney General.\n  Finally, I would like to take note of two other provisions that are \nincluded in the final bill. They are Section 352 authored by Senate \nBanking Committee Chairman Sarbanes to require all U.S. financial \ninstitutions to establish anti-money laundering programs, and Section \n326 authored by House Financial Services Committee Chairman Oxley to \nrequire all U.S. financial institutions to verify the identity of their \ncustomers. Both are strong requirements that apply to all U.S. \nfinancial institutions and, in the case of the Oxley provision, to all \nfinancial accounts. Both represent important advances in U.S. anti-\nmoney laundering laws by codifying basic anti-money laundering \nrequirements. I commend my colleagues for enacting these basic anti-\nmoney laundering controls into law and filling in some of the gaps that \nhave made our anti-money laundering safeguards less comprehensive than \nthey need to be.\n  The clear intention of both the House and the Senate bills, and the \nfinal bill being enacted by Congress today, is to impose anti-money \nlaundering requirements across the board that reach virtually all U.S. \nfinancial institutions. Congress has determined that broad anti-money \nlaundering controls applicable to virtually all U.S. financial \ninstitutions are needed to seal the cracks in our financial systems \nthat terrorists and other criminals are all too ready to exploit.\n  There are many other noteworthy provisions of this legislation, from \nrequirements involving legal service of subpoenas on foreign banks with \nU.S. accounts, to new ways to prosecute money laundering crimes, to new \narrangements to increase cooperation among U.S. financial institutions, \nregulators and law enforcement to stop terrorists and other criminals \nfrom gaining access to the U.S. financial system. There just is not \nsufficient time to go into them all.\n  To reiterate, the antiterrorism bill we have before us today would be \nvery incomplete--only half of a toolbox--without a strong anti-money-\nlaundering title to prevent foreign terrorists and other criminals from \nusing our financial institutions against us. With the anti-money-\nlaundering provisions in this bill, the antiterrorism bill gives our \nenforcement authorities a valuable set of additional tools to fight \nthose who are attempting to terrorize this country.\n  Osama bin Laden has boasted that his modern new recruits know, in his \nwords, the ``cracks'' in ``Western financial systems'' like they know \nthe ``lines in their own hands.'' Enactment of this bill with these \nprovisions will help seal those cracks that allow terrorists and other \ncriminals to use our own financial systems against us.\n  The intention of this bill is to impose anti-money-laundering \nrequirements across the board that reach virtually all U.S. financial \ninstitutions.\n  Our Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, spent 3 \nyears examining the weaknesses and the problems in our banking system \nwith respect to money laundering by foreign customers, including \nforeign banks. Through 6 days of hearings and 2 major reports, one of \nwhich contained case studies on 10 offshore banks, we developed S. 1371 \nto strengthen our anti-money-laundering laws. A strong bipartisan group \nof Senators joined me in pressing for its enactment, including Senators \nGrassley, Sarbanes, Kyl, DeWine, Bill Nelson, Durbin, Stabenow, and \nKerry.\n  The major elements of S. 1371 are part of the legislation we are now \nconsidering.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to give a few thank-yous. First, I \nthank Senator Sarbanes, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. He \nsaw the significance of the money laundering issue in the fight against \nterrorism, and I thank him for his quick action, his bipartisan \ninclusive approach, and his personal dedication to producing tough, \nmeaningful legislation. I also thank him for allowing my staff to \nparticipate fully in the negotiations to reconcile the anti-money-\nlaundering legislation passed by the House and the Senate.\n  I extend my thanks and congratulations to the Senate Banking \nCommittee and the House Financial Services Committee for a fine \nbipartisan product that will strengthen, modernize, and revitalize U.S. \nanti-money-laundering laws. Congressman Oxley and Congressman LaFalce \njumped right into the issue, committed themselves to producing strong \nlegislation, and did the hard work needed to produce it. The \nnegotiations were a model of House-Senate collaboration, with \nbipartisan, productive discussions leading to a legislative product \nthat is stronger than the legislation passed by either House and which \nis legislation in which this Congress can take pride.\n  I also extend my thanks to Senator Daschle, Senator Lott, and Senator \nLeahy for taking the actions that were essential to ensure that the \nanti-money-laundering title was included in the antiterrorism bill. \nSenator Daschle made it very clear that without these provisions no \nantiterrorism bill would be complete. Senator Leahy took actions of all \nkinds to make sure that, in fact, the anti-money laundering provisions \nwere included in the final bill.\n  I thank Senator Grassley who joined me in this effort early on and \nwho worked with me every step of the way win enactment of the anti-\nmoney laundering legislation into law.\n  Senator Stabenow I thank for her quick and decisive action during the \nBanking Committee's consideration of this bill. Without her critical \nassistance, we would not be where we are today. I also thank Senator \nKerry for his consistent, strong and informed role in fashioning this \nlandmark legislation.\n  Finally I want to give a few thank-yous to staff. Elise Bean of my \nstaff first and foremost deserves all of our thanks for her heroic \nefforts on this legislation. She and Bob Roach of our Subcommittee \nstaff led the Subcommittee investigations into money laundering and did \nvery detailed work on private banking and correspondent banking that \nlaid the groundwork for the legislation we are passing today. I want to \nthank them both.\n\n[[Page S11039]]\n\n  I want to thank Bill Olson of Senator Grassley's office for jumping \nin whenever needed and lending strong support to this legislative \neffort. Similar thanks go to John Phillips of Senator Kerry's office \nwho was there at all hours to make sure this legislation happened.\n  Similar thanks go to Senator Sarbanes' staff on the Senate Banking \nCommittee--especially Steve Harris, Marty Gruenberg, Patience Singleton \nand Steve Kroll, who put in long hours, maintained a high degree of \nboth competency and professionalism, and provided an open door for my \nstaff to work with them.\n  I also want to thank the staff of the House Financial Services \nCommittee--Ike Jones, Carter McDowell, Jim Clinger and Cindy Fogleman. \nThey put in long hours, knew the subject, and were dedicated to \nachieving a finished product of which we could all be proud.\n  Our thanks also go to Laura Ayoud of the Senate Legislative Counsel's \noffice who literally worked around the clock during the negotiations on \nthis legislation and, through it all, kept a clear eye and a cheerful \npersonality. Her work was essential to this product.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Before I make my statement and before Senator Levin \nleaves the floor, I wish to acknowledge the very substantial \ncontribution that Senator Levin made to the money-laundering title that \nis in this bill, which I think is an extremely important title. In \nfact, you can't watch any program on television that has experts \ntalking about what we ought to be doing with respect to this terrorism \nchallenge when either the first or second thing they mention is to dry \nup the financial sources of the terrorists, and that, of course, comes \nright back to the money laundering.\n  Senator Levin, over a sustained period of time, in the government \noperations committee, held some very important hearings, issued very \nsignificant reports, and formulated a number of recommendations. This \ntitle is, in part, built on the recommendations that Senator Levin put \nforward at an earlier time. I simply acknowledge his extraordinary \ncontribution to this issue. I acknowledge Senator Kerry as well. There \nwere two proposals. They both had legislation in them and we used those \nas building blocks in formulating this title. We think it is a very \nstrong title and that it can be a very effective tool in this war \nagainst terrorism, and against drugs, and against organized crime. It \nshould have been done a long time ago, but it is being done now.\n  Before the able Senator from Michigan leaves the floor, I thank him \nand acknowledge his tremendous contribution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Again, I thank Senator Sarbanes for his great leadership, \nalong with Senator Leahy, which made this possible.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of this \nlegislation--in particular, title III, the International Money \nLaundering Abatement and Financial Antiterrorism Act, which was \nincluded as part of the antiterrorism legislation. Of course, that bill \nwas approved yesterday by the House of Representatives and will be \napproved very shortly by this body.\n  Title III represents the most significant anti-money-laundering \nlegislation in many, many years--certainly since money laundering was \nfirst made a crime in 1986. The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs, which I have the privilege of chairing, marked up \nand unanimously approved the key anti-money-laundering provisions on \nOctober 4. Those provisions were approved unanimously, 21-0. Those were \napproved as Title III of S. 1510, the Uniting and Strengthening America \nAct on October 11 by a vote of 96-1. H.R. 3004, the Financial \nAntiterrorism Act, which contained many of the same provisions and \nadded important additional provisions, passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 412-1 on October 17.\n  Title III of this conference report represents a skillful melding of \nthe two bills and is a result of the strong contribution made by House \nFinancial Services Committee and chairman Michael Oxley and ranking \nmember John LaFalce, working with Senator Gramm, the ranking member of \nthe Senate committee, and myself.\n  President Bush said on September 24, when he took executive branch \naction on the money-laundering issue:\n\n       We have launched a strike on the financial foundation of \n     the global terror network.\n\n  Title III of our comprehensive antiterrorism package supplies the \narmament for that strike on the financial foundation of the global \nterror network. Terrorist attacks require major investments of time, \nplanning, training, practice, and financial resources to pay the bills. \nOsama bin Laden may have boasted, ``Al-Qaida includes modern, educated \nyouth who are as aware of the cracks inside the Western financial \nsystem as they are aware of the lines in their hands,'' but with title \nIII, we are sealing up those cracks.\n  Money laundering is the transmission belt that gives terrorists the \nresources to carry out their campaigns of carnage, but we intend, with \nthe money-laundering title of this bill, to end that transmission belt \nin its ability to bring resources to the networks that enable \nterrorists to carry out their campaigns of violence.\n  I need not bring to the attention of my colleagues the fact that \npublic support across the country for anti-money-laundering legislation \nis extremely strong. Jim Hoagland put it plainly in the Washington \nPost:\n\n       This crisis offers Washington an opportunity to force \n     American and international banks to clean up concealment and \n     laundering practices they now tolerate or encourage, and \n     which terrorism can exploit.\n\n  This legislation takes up that challenge in a balanced and forceful \nway.\n  Title III contains, among other provisions, authority to take \ntargeted action against countries, institutions, transactions, or types \nof accounts the Secretary of the Treasury finds to be of primary money-\nlaundering concern.\n  It also contains critical requirements of due diligence standards \ndirected at correspondent accounts opened at U.S. banks by foreign \noffshore banks and banks in jurisdictions that have been found to fall \nsignificantly below international anti-money-laundering standards.\n  It prohibits U.S. correspondent accounts for offshore shell banks, \nthose banks that have no physical presence or employees anywhere and \nthat are not part of a regulated and recognized banking company.\n  The title also contains an important provision from the House bill \nthat requires the issuance of regulations requiring minimum standards \nfor verifying the identity of customers opening and maintaining \naccounts at U.S. financial institutions, and it very straightforwardly \nrequires all financial institutions to establish appropriate anti-\nmoney-laundering programs.\n  Title III also includes several provisions to enhance the ability of \nthe Government to share more specific information with banks, and the \nability of banks to share information with one another relating to \npotential terrorist or money-laundering activities.\n  In addition, it provides important technical improvements in anti-\nmoney-laundering statutes, existing statutes, and mandates to the \nDepartment of the Treasury to act or formulate recommendations to \nimprove our anti-money-laundering programs.\n  This is carefully considered legislation. While the committee moved \nexpeditiously, its movement was based upon and reflects the efforts \nwhich have been made over a number of years on this issue.\n  As I indicated earlier, Senator Carl Levin, Senator Kerry, and in \naddition, Senator Charles Grassley have led farsighted efforts to keep \nmoney-laundering issues on the front burner. Others in the Congress \nhave also been involved with this issue over time. The House Banking \nCommittee, under the leadership of then-Chairman Jim Leach and ranking \nmember John LaFalce, approved a money-laundering bill in June of 2000 \nby a vote of 31-1. It was very similar to the legislation introduced by \nSenator Kerry.\n  As the successor to Congressman Leach, House Financial Services \nChairman Oxley has continued the commitment to fighting money \nlaunderers to maintain the integrity of our financial system and, now, \nto help ensure the safety of our citizens.\n  We have been guided in our work by the testimony presented to the \ncommittee on September 26. We heard from a number of expert witnesses \nand from the Under Secretary of the Treasury\n\n[[Page S11040]]\n\nGurule, Assistant Attorney General Chertoff, and Ambassador Stuart \nEizenstat, the former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. All of the \nwitnesses advocated stronger and more modern money-laundering laws.\n  Before describing the provisions of Title III in greater detail, I \nwant to single out a number of our colleagues and their staffs for \ntheir extraordinary contributions.\n  I have already spoken about House Financial Services Committee \nChairman Oxley and ranking member LaFalce, but I want to note their \npersonal willingness and that of their staffs to work overtime to \nensure that the House and Senate reached agreement on this important \nlegislation. In fact, last week when the office buildings were closed \ndown, we met here in a room in the Capitol on Wednesday evening, well \nbeyond midnight, and resumed early the next morning and continued \nthroughout the day on Thursday, finally resolving all of our issues by \nthe end of that afternoon.\n\n  I am truly grateful to all the members of the Senate Banking \nCommittee for their strong, positive, and constructive contributions to \nthe Senate-approved version of Title III. I indicated it was approved \nby the committee on a 21-0 vote. Ranking member Senator Gramm provided \ncritical support.\n  Senators Stabenow, Johnson, and Hagel were instrumental in producing \na compromise to resolve a dispute over one of the package's most \nimportant provisions.\n  Senator Enzi brought his expertise as an accountant to bear in \nrefining another critical provision.\n  Senator Schumer, who has been involved in past efforts to address \nmoney-laundering activities, played an important role, as did Senators \nDodd, Bayh, Carper, Corzine, Allard, and Crapo who either offered \namendments or made other important contributions for improvements in \nthis title.\n  I also want to take a moment to recognize those members of our staff \nwho devoted so many hours to crafting this important and comprehensive \nlegislation, literally all night in a couple of instances along the way \nin the legislative process: Steve Kroll, Patience Singleton, Steve \nHarris, Lynsey Graham, Vince Meehan, Marty Gruenberg, and Jesse Jacobs \non the Banking Committee's majority staff. And on the Banking \nCommittee's minority staff, I want to underscore the work of Wayne \nAbernathy, Linda Lord, and Madelyn Simmons.\n  I also thank Elise Bean from Senator Levin's staff and John Phillips \nfrom John Kerry's staff who worked closely with us and made significant \ncontributions.\n  Finally, I take special note of Laura Ayoud of the Legislative \nCounsel's office. Mrs. Ayoud worked countless hours from the very \nbeginning so that the committee print and a substitute for the Banking \nCommittee markup were all produced on time and with the utmost accuracy \nand professionalism. I must say, I think the Senate is extremely \nfortunate to have professionals of the caliber of Mrs. Ayoud in the \nLegislative Counsel's office. I tip my hat not only to her, but to the \nextraordinary record of professionalism and dedicated service which the \nLegislative Counsel's office renders to the Senate.\n  Title III addresses all aspects of our defenses against money \nlaundering. Those defenses generally fall into three parts. The first \nis the Bank Secrecy Act passed in 1970. It requires financial \ninstitutions to keep standardized transaction records and report large \ncurrency transactions and suspicious transactions, and it mandates \nreporting of the movement of more than $10,000 in currency into and out \nof our country.\n  The Bank Secrecy Act is so named because it bars bank secrecy in \nAmerica by preventing financial institutions from maintaining opaque \nrecords or disregarding their records altogether. Secrecy is a hiding \nplace for crime, and Congress has barred our institutions from allowing \nthose hiding places.\n  The second part of our money-laundering defenses are the criminal \nstatutes first enacted in 1986 that make it a crime to launder money \nand that allow criminal and civil forfeiture of the proceeds of crime.\n  The third part is a statutory framework that allows information to be \ncommunicated to and between law enforcement officials. Our goal must be \nto assure, to the greatest extent consistent with reasonable privacy \nprotections--and we understood the necessity of balancing these \nconsiderations--to assure ourselves that necessary information can be \nused by the right persons in real time to cut off terrorism and crime.\n  Title III modernizes provisions in all three areas to meet today's \nthreats in a global economy. Its provisions are divided into three \nsubtitles dealing respectively with international counter-money-\nlaundering measures, sections 311 through 330; Bank Secrecy Act \namendments and related improvements, sections 351 through 366; and \ncurrency crimes and protections, sections 371 through 377.\n  There are 46 provisions in Title III. At this time, I want to \nsummarize some of the bill's most important provisions.\n  Section 311 gives the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with \nother senior government officials, authority to impose one or more of \nfive new ``special measures'' against foreign jurisdictions, entities, \ntransactions or accounts that in the determination of the Secretary, \nafter consultation with other senior federal officials, poses a \n``primary money laundering concern'' to the United States. The special \nmeasures all involve special recordkeeping and reporting measures--to \neliminate the curtains behind which launderers hide. In extreme cases \nthe Secretary is permitted to bar certain kinds of inter-bank accounts \nfrom especially problematic jurisdictions. The statute specifies the \nconsiderations the Secretary must take into account in using the new \nauthority and contains provisions to supplement the Administrative \nProcedure Act to assure that any remedies--except certain short-term \nmeasures--are subject to full comment from all affected persons.\n  This new provision gives the Secretary real authority to act to close \noverseas loopholes through which U.S. financial institutions are \nabused. At present the Secretary has no weapons except Treasury \nAdvisories, which do not impose specific requirements, or full economic \nsanctions which suspend financial and trade relations with offending \ntargets. President Bush's invocation of the International Economic \nEmergency Powers Act, IEEPA, several weeks ago was obviously \nappropriate. But there are many other situations in which we will not \nwant to block all transactions, but where we will want to do more than \nsimply advise financial institutions about under-regulated foreign \nfinancial institutions or holes in foreign countermoney laundering \nefforts. Former Deputy Secretary Eizenstat testified before the \nCommittee in September that adding this tool to the Secretary's arsenal \nwas essential.\n  Section 312 focuses on another aspect of the fight against money \nlaundering, the financial institutions that make the initial decisions \nabout what foreign banks to allow inside the United States. It requires \nU.S. financial institutions to exercise appropriate due diligence when \ndealing with private banking accounts and interbank correspondent \nrelationships with foreign banks. With respect to foreign banks, the \nsection requires U.S. financial institutions to apply appropriate due \ndiligence to all correspondent accounts with foreign banks, and \nenhanced due diligence for accounts sought by offshore banks or banks \nin jurisdictions found to have substandard money laundering controls or \nwhich the Secretary determines to be of primary money laundering \nconcern under the new authority given him by section 311.\n  The section also specifies certain minimum standards for the enhanced \ndue diligence that U.S. financial institutions are required to apply to \naccounts opened for two categories of foreign banks with high money \nlaundering risks--offshore banks and banks in jurisdictions with weak \nanti-money laundering and banking controls. These minimum standards \nwere developed from, and are based upon, the factual record and \nanalysis contained in the comprehensive report on correspondent banking \nand money laundering that was prepared by the staff of the Senate \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which Senator Levin chairs.\n  Section 312 is essential to title III. It addresses, with appropriate \nflexibility, mechanisms whose very importance for the conduct of \ncommercial banking\n\n[[Page S11041]]\n\nmakes them special targets of money launderers, as illustrated in \nSenator Levin's extensive reports and hearings. The intent of the \nstatute is to provide special due diligence rules which will apply to \ncorrespondent relationships maintained for foreign financial \ninstitutions not merely by domestic banks but by all types of financial \ninstitutions operating in the United States, subject to the authority \nof the Secretary of the Treasury to define the appropriate \ncorrespondent relationships by regulation where appropriate. Given the \nscope of the applicable definition of correspondent account, in new \nsection 5318A (which also applies for purposes of new section 5318(i)), \nthe general due diligence obligations of new section 5318(i)(1) apply \nto all correspondent accounts maintained by U.S. financial institutions \nfor any foreign financial institution (i.e., not simply foreign \ndepository institutions).\n  The statutory intent with respect to private banking accounts is \nsimilar; that is, the statute is intended to provide special due \ndiligence rules for private banking accounts maintained for non-United \nStates persons not merely by depository institutions operating in the \nUnited States, but by all types of financial institutions operating in \nthe United States and defined in 31 U.S.C. 5312, subject to the \nauthority of the Secretary of the Treasury to define the appropriate \ndefinitions of the relevant terms by regulation.\n  The question has been raised whether the due diligence provisions of \nsection 312 are ``discretionary.'' The answer is no. The provisions are \nto apply whether or not any rules are issued by the Treasury or whether \nthe Treasury takes any other implementing action (in contradistinction \nto the provisions of new section 5318A, which must be affirmatively \ninvoked by the Secretary. The Secretary is given authority to issue \nregulations ``further delineating'' the ``due diligence policies, \nprocedures, and controls'' required by new subsection 5318(i), but \nthose regulations must of course be consistent with the statutory \nlanguage and intent to require all U.S. financial institutions to \nexercise the required standard of care in dealing with the risk of the \nmisuse of the financial mechanisms with which the subsection deals.\n  A provision of section 319 of title III requires foreign banks that \nmaintain correspondent accounts in the United States to appoint agents \nfor service of process within the United States and authorizes the \nAttorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury to issue a summons \nor subpoena to any such foreign bank seeking records, wherever located, \nrelating to such a correspondent account. U.S. banks must sever \ncorrespondent arrangements with foreign banks that do not either comply \nwith or contest any such summons or subpoena, upon notification from \nthe Attorney General or Secretary of the Treasury.\n  All of these provisions send a simple message to foreign banks doing \nbusiness through U.S. correspondent accounts: be prepared, if you want \nto use our banking facilities, to operate in accordance with U.S. law.\n  Section 313 of title III also builds on the factual record before the \nBanking Committee to bar from the United States financial system pure \n``brass-plate'' shell banks created outside the U.S. that have no \nphysical presence anywhere and are not affiliated with any recognized \nbanking institution. These shell banks carry the highest money \nlaundering risks in the banking world because they are inherently \nunavailable for effective oversight--there is no office where a bank \nregulator or law enforcement official can go to observe bank \noperations, review documents or freeze funds. Thus the ban on provision \nof correspondent banking services for such brass-plate institutions is \na particularly important part of title III. New 31 U.S.C. 5318(j) is \nintended to be vigorously enforced and strictly applied, especially in \nlight of the relief provided in the statute for special banking \nvehicles that are affiliated with operating institutions and are \nsubject to financial supervision along with those institutions.\n\n  Section 325 permits the Secretary to deal with abuse of another \nrecognized commercial banking mechanism--concentration accounts that \nare used to commingle related funds temporarily in one place pending \ndisbursement or the transfer of funds into individual client accounts. \nConcentration accounts have been used to launder funds, and the bill \nauthorizes the Secretary to issue rules to bar the use of concentration \naccounts to move client funds anonymously, without documentation \nlinking particular funds to their true owners. I believe that the \nSecretary must move promptly to exercise the regulatory authority \ngranted by this section.\n  Section 326 will help ensure that individuals opening accounts with \nU.S. financial institutions provide information adequate to enable law \nenforcement and supervisory agencies to identify accounts maintained by \nindividuals suspected of terrorist activities. The section requires the \nSecretary of the Treasury to prescribe regulations in consultation with \neach federal functional regulators to set minimum standards and \nprocedures concerning the verification of customers' identity, \nmaintenance of records of identity verification, and consultation at \naccount opening of lists of known or suspected terrorists provided to \nthe financial institution by a government agency. This section also \nrequires the Secretary of the Treasury to submit recommendations to \nCongress, within 6 months of enactment, on the most effective way to \nrequire foreign nationals to provide financial institutions in the \nUnited States with accurate identity information.\n  It is the intent of section 326 that regulations pursuant to that \nsection do not place obligations solely on the shoulders of the \nNation's financial institutions, without placing any obligations on \ntheir customers. The contemplated regulations should therefore include \nprovisions relating to the obligations of individuals to provide \naccurate information in connection with account-opening procedures, so \nthat in appropriate cases penalties may apply under the Bank Secrecy \nAct to customers who willfully mislead bank officials about matters of \ncustomer identity.\n  Section 352 requires financial institutions to establish minimum \nantimoney laundering programs that include appropriate internal \npolicies, management, employee training, and audit features. This is \nnot a ``one-size-fit-all'' requirement; in fact its very generality \nrecognizes that different types of programs will be appropriate for \ndifferent types and sizes of institutions. It is our intention, by \nusing general language in the amended provision, that the content of \nthe relevant antimoney laundering programs will necessarily vary with \nthe details of the particular financial institutions involved and the \nmoney laundering risks to which the nature of such institution and its \nfinancial products exposes the institution. Treasury regulations \npursuant to this section should allow adjustment of the extent of \nantimoney laundering programs for smaller businesses but not exempt \nbusinesses from the requirement altogether simply because of their \nsize.\n\n  A number of improvements are made to the suspicious activity \nreporting rules. First, technical changes strengthen the safe harbor \nfrom civil liability for institutions that report suspicious activity \nto the Treasury, Sec. 351. The provisions not only add to the \nprotection for reporting institutions; they also address individual \nprivacy concerns by making it clear that government officers may not \ndisclose suspicious transaction reports information except in the \nconduct of their official duties. Section 356 also requires the \nissuance of final suspicious transaction reporting rules applicable to \nbrokers and dealers in securities by July 1, 2002; senior officials of \nthe relevant agencies must meet expeditiously to resolve the policy \nissues raised at staff levels about the content of the necessary \nregulations and the extent to which suspicious transaction reporting \nrules should be the same for banking and securities.\n  Sections 359 and 373 of the title deal with underground banking \nsystems such as the Hawala, which is suspected of being a channel used \nto finance the al Qaeda network. Section 359 makes it clear that \nunderground money transmitters are subject to the same recordkeeping \nrules--and the same penalties for violating those rules--as above-\nground, recognized, money transmitters. It also directs the Secretary \nof the Treasury to report to Congress, within 1 year, on the need for \nadditional legislation or regulatory controls relating to underground \nbanking\n\n[[Page S11042]]\n\nsystems. Section 373 clarifies that operators of a money transmitter \nbusiness can be prosecuted under Federal law for operating an illegal \nmoney transmitting business if they do not have a required State \nlicense.\n  Section 360 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the \nUnited States Executive Director of each of the international financial \ninstitutions to use such Director's ``voice and vote'' to support loans \nand other use of resources to benefit nations that the President \ndetermines to be contributing to efforts to combat international \nterrorism, and to require the auditing of each international financial \ninstitution to ensure that funds are not paid to persons engaged in or \nsupporting terrorism.\n  Section 371 creates a new Bank Secrecy Act offense involving the bulk \nsmuggling of more than $10,000 in currency in any conveyance, article \nof luggage or merchandise or container, either into or out of the \nUnited States, and related forfeiture provisions. This provision has \nbeen sought for several years by both the Departments of Justice and \nTreasury.\n  Other provisions of the bill address relevant provisions of the \nCriminal Code. These provisions were worked out with the House and \nSenate Judiciary Committees and are included in title III because of \ntheir close relationship to the provisions of title 31 added or \nmodified by title III.\n  The most important is section 315, which expands the list of \nspecified unlawful activities under 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957 to include \nforeign corruption offenses, certain U.S. export control violations, \noffenses subject to U.S. extradition obligations under multilateral \ntreaties, and various other offenses. The Department of Justice should \nmake use of the expanded authority, created by section 315, to make the \nrisk of detection to foreign kleptocrats immediate and palpable.\n\n  Section 316 establishes procedures to protect the rights of persons \nwhose property may be subject to confiscation in the exercise of the \ngovernment's antiterrorism authority. This provision is designed to \nassure that there is no situation in which the defendant in a \nforfeiture action will lack the opportunity to challenge the forfeiture \nsimply because of the authority under which the forfeiture is sought.\n  Section 319 treats amounts deposited by foreign banks in interbank \naccounts with U.S. banks as having been deposited in the United States \nfor purposes of the forfeiture rules, but grants the Attorney General \nauthority, in the interest of fairness and consistent with the United \nStates' national interest, to suspend a forfeiture proceeding based on \nthat presumption. This closes an important forfeiture loophole.\n  A third important set of provisions modernize information-sharing \nrules to reflect the reality of the flight against money laundering and \nterrorism.\n  Section 314 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue \nregulations to encourage cooperation among financial institutions, \nfinancial regulators and law enforcement officials and to permit the \nsharing of information by law enforcement and regulatory authorities \nwith such institutions regarding persons reasonably suspected, based on \ncredible evidence, of engaging in terrorist acts or money laundering \nactivities. The section also allows banks to share information \ninvolving possible money laundering or terrorist activity among \nthemselves--with notice to the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  Section 330 states the sense of Congress that the President should \ndirect certain cabinet officers to seek negotiations with foreign \nsupervisory agencies to ensure that foreign institutions maintain \nadequate records relating to any foreign terrorist organization or \nperson engaged in any financial crime and to make such records \navailable to U.S. law enforcement and financial supervisory personnel.\n  Section 355 permits but does not require, a bank to include \ninformation, in a response to a request for an employment reference by \na second bank, about the possible involvement of a former institution-\naffiliated party in potentially unlawful activity, and creates a safe \nharbor from civil liability for the bank that includes such information \nin response to an employment reference request, except in the case of \nmalicious intent.\n  Section 358 contains amendments to various provisions of the Bank \nSecrecy Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and the Fair Credit \nReporting Act to permit information subject to those statutes to be \nused in the conduct of United States intelligence or \ncounterintelligence activities to protect against international \nterrorism.\n  Section 361 seeks to enhance the ability of FinCEN to address money \nlaundering and terrorism. The section makes FinCEN a bureau of the \nTreasury and requires the Secretary to establish operating procedures \nfor the government-wide data access service and communications center \nthat FinCEN operates. In recognizing FinCEN's evolution and maturity, \nit is not our intention to require existing delegations of authority to \nbe reissued simply because FinCEN's organizational status has changed \nfrom Treasury office to Treasury bureau.\n  The modernization of our money-laundering laws represented by Title \nIII is long overdue. It is not the work of one or two weeks but \nrepresents years of careful study and a bipartisan effort to produce \nprudent and effective legislation. The care taken in producing the \nlegislation extends to several provisions calling for reporting on the \neffect of the legislation and a provision for a three-year review of \nthe effectiveness of the legislation. Title III responds, as I have \nindicated, to the statement of Assistant Attorney General Chertoff, the \nhead of the Department of Justice's Criminal Division. I want to \nexpress my appreciation to him, Under Secretary Gurule at the Treasury, \nand his associates for their help in this effort.\n  At the hearing on September 26, Assistant Attorney General Chertoff \nsaid, and I quote him, ``We are fighting with outdated weapons in the \nmoney-laundering arena today.'' Without this legislation, the cracks in \nthe financial system of which bin Laden spoke would remain open. We \nshould not, indeed we cannot, allow that to continue. And that is why \nenactment of this legislation is so important.\n  Title III is a balanced effort to address a complex area of national \nconcern. It is the result of a truly bipartisan effort on both sides of \nCongress working closely with the executive branch, with the White \nHouse, with the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of \nJustice. I very strongly urge support for this essential component of \nthe antiterrorism package.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nTitle III--International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-\n           Terrorism Act of 2001--Section-by-Section Summary\n\n     Section 301. Short title and table of contents\n     Section 302. Findings and purposes\n     Section 303. 4-Year congressional review-expedited \n         consideration\n       Section 313 provides that the provisions added and \n     amendments made by Title III will terminate after September \n     30, 2004, if the Congress enacts a joint resolution to that \n     effect, and that any such joint resolution will be considered \n     by the Congress expeditiously.\n\n\n subtitle a. international counter-money laundering and related matters\n\n     Section 311. Special measures for jurisdictions, financial \n         institutions, or international transactions or accounts \n         of primary money laundering concern\n       Section 311 adds a new section 31 U.S.C. 5318A, entitled \n     ``Special measures for jurisdictions, financial institutions, \n     or international transactions of primary money laundering \n     concern,'' to the Bank Secrey Act. The new section gives the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other senior \n     government officials, authority (in the Secretary's \n     discretion), to impose one or more of five new ``special \n     measures'' against foreign jurisdictions, foreign financial \n     institutions, transactions involving such jurisdictions or \n     institutions or one more types of accounts, that the \n     Secretary, after consultation with Secretary of State and the \n     Attorney General, determines to pose a ``primary money \n     laundering concern'' to the United States. The special \n     measures include: (1) requiring additional recordkeeping or \n     reporting for particular transactions, (2) requiring the \n     identification of the foreign beneficial owners of certain \n     accounts at a U.S. financial institution, (3) requiring the \n     identification of customers of a foreign bank who use an \n     interbank payable-through account opened by that foreign bank \n     at a U.S. bank, (4) requiring the identification of customers \n     of a foreign bank who use an interbank correspondent account \n     opened by that foreign\n\n[[Page S11043]]\n\n     bank at a U.S. bank, and (5) after consultation with the \n     Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Chairman of \n     the Federal Reserve Board, restricting or prohibiting the \n     opening or maintaining of certain interbank correspondent or \n     payable through accounts. Measures 1-4 may not be imposed for \n     more than 120 days except by regulation, and measure 5 may \n     only be imposed by regulation.\n     Section 312. Special due diligence for correspondent accounts \n         and private banking accounts\n       Section 312(a) of the Act adds a new subsection (1), \n     entitled ``Due Diligence for United States Private Banking \n     and Correspondent Banking Accounts involving Foreign \n     Persons,'' to 31 U.S.C. 5318. The new subsection requires a \n     U.S. financial institution that maintains a correspondent \n     account or private banking account for a non-United States \n     person (or that person's representative) to establish \n     appropriate, specific, and, where necessary, enhanced due \n     diligence procedures that are reasonably designed to detect \n     and report instances of money laundering through such \n     accounts. For this purpose, a correspondent account is \n     defined in the new section 5318A, added to the Bank Secrecy \n     Act by section 311 of Title III.\n       The general requirement is supplemental by two additional, \n     more specific, due diligence standards that are required for \n     certain types of correspondent and private banking accounts.\n       Correspondent Accounts.--In the case of certain \n     correspondent accounts, the additional standards required by \n     subsection 5318(i)(2) require a U.S. financial institution \n     to, at a minimum, do three things. First, it must ascertain \n     the identity, and the nature and extent of the ownership \n     interests, of the owners of any foreign bank correspondent \n     whose shares are not publicly traded. Second, it must conduct \n     enhanced scrutiny of the correspondent account to guard \n     against money laundering and satisfy its obligation to report \n     suspicious transactions under the terms of 31 U.S.C. 5318(g). \n     Third, it must ascertain whether any foreign bank \n     correspondent in turn provides correspondent accounts to \n     third party foreign banks; if so the U.S. financial \n     institution must ascertain the identity of those third party \n     foreign banks and related due diligence information required \n     under the general rules of paragraph 5318(i)(1).\n       These additional standards apply to correspondent accounts \n     requested or maintained by or on behalf of any foreign bank \n     operating under (i) an offshore banking license (defined by \n     the statute as a banking license that bars the licensee from \n     conducting banking activities with citizens of, or in the \n     local currency of, the jurisdiction that issued the license), \n     or (ii) under a banking license issued (A) by any country \n     designated as noncooperative with international anti-money \n     laundering principles by an intergovernmental body of which \n     the United States is a member, with the concurrence of the \n     U.S. representative to such body, or (B) by a country that \n     has been designated by the Secretary of the Treasury as \n     warranting special measures (i.e., the special measures \n     authorized by new section 31 U.S.C. 5318A, added by section \n     311 of Title III), due to money laundering concerns.\n       Private Banking Accounts.--In the case of private banking \n     accounts, the additional standards required by subsection \n     5318(i)(3) require a U.S. financial institution to, at a \n     minimum, do two things. First, the U.S. financial institution \n     must take reasonable steps to ascertain the identity of the \n     nominal and beneficial owners of the account and the source \n     of funds deposited into the account, as needed to guard \n     against money laundering and report any suspicious \n     transactions under the terms of 31 U.S.C. 5318(g). Second, \n     the U.S. financial institution must take reasonable steps to \n     conduct enhanced scrutiny, that is reasonably designed to \n     detect and report transactions that may involve the proceeds \n     of foreign corruption, for any private banking account that \n     is requested or maintained by, or on behalf of, a senior \n     foreign political figure (or any immediate family member or \n     close associate of such a political figure).\n       A private banking account for this purpose is any account \n     or combination of accounts that requires a minimum aggregate \n     deposit of at least $1 million, is established on behalf of \n     one or more individuals who have either a direct or \n     beneficial ownership interest in the account, and that is \n     assigned to, or administered or managed by, in whole or in \n     part, an officer, employee or agent of a financial \n     institution who serves as liaison between the institution \n     and the account's direct or beneficial owner or owners.\n       Effective Date; Regulations.--31 U.S.C. 5318(j) will take \n     effect 270 days after the date of enactment of Title III as \n     part of the Uniting to Save America Act and will apply to \n     otherwise covered correspondent and private banking accounts, \n     whether opened before, on, or after the date of enactment. \n     Section 312(b) of Title III requires the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, in consultation with the appropriate federal \n     functional regulators of the affected financial institutions, \n     to further delineate, by regulation, the due diligence \n     policies, procedures, and controls required under new \n     subsection 5318(j), not later than 180 days of the date of \n     enactment. However, the new subsection will take effect \n     whether or not final regulations are issued before the 270th \n     day following enactment, and any failure to issue regulations \n     whether before or after the effective date is in no way to \n     affect the enforceability of subsection 5318(j).\n     Section 313. Prohibition on United States correspondent \n         accounts with foreign shell banks\n       Section 313(a) of the Act adds a new subsection (j), \n     entitled ``Prohibition on United States Correspondent \n     Accounts with Foreign Shell Banks'' to 31 U.S.C. 5318. The \n     new subsection bars any depository institution or registered \n     broker-dealer in securities, operating in the United States, \n     from establishing, maintaining, administering, or managing a \n     correspondent account in the United States for a foreign \n     bank, if the foreign bank does not have ``a physical presence \n     in any country.'' The subsection also includes a requirement \n     that any financial institution covered by the subsection must \n     take reasonable steps (as delineated by Treasury regulations) \n     to ensure that it is not providing the prohibited services \n     indirectly to a ``no-physical presence bank,'' through a \n     third party foreign bank correspondent of the U.S. \n     institution. The prohibition does not apply, however, to a \n     correspondent account provided by a U.S. institution to a \n     foreign ``no physical presence'' bank if that foreign bank is \n     an affiliate of a depository institution (including a credit \n     union or foreign bank) that does have a physical presence in \n     some country and if the foreign shell bank is subject to \n     supervision by a banking authority that regulates its \n     ``physical presence'' affiliate in that country. Both the \n     terms ``affiliate'' and ``physical presence'' are defined in \n     the new subsection.\n       Section 313(b) provides that the ban on provision of \n     correspondent accounts for brass-plate banks will take effect \n     at the end of the 60 day period ending on the date of \n     enactment.\n     Section 314. Cooperative efforts to deter money laundering\n       Section 314 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to issue \n     regulations, within 120 days of the date of enactment, to \n     encourage cooperation among financial institutions, financial \n     regulators and law enforcement officials, and to permit the \n     sharing of information by law enforcement and regulatory \n     authorities with such institutions regarding persons \n     reasonably suspected, based on credible evidence, of engaging \n     in terrorist acts or money laundering activities. Section 314 \n     also allows (with notice to the Secretary of the Treasury) \n     the sharing of information among banks involving possible \n     terrorist or money laundering activity, and requires the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to publish, at least semiannually, \n     a report containing a detailed analysis of patterns of \n     suspicious activity and other appropriate investigative \n     insights derived from suspicious activity reports and law \n     enforcement investigations.\n     Section 315. Inclusion of foreign corruption offenses as \n         money laundering crimes\n       Section 315 amends 18 U.S.C. 1956 to include foreign \n     corruption offenses, certain U.S. export control violations, \n     certain customs and firearm offenses, certain computer fraud \n     offenses, and felony violations of the Foreign Agents \n     Registration Act of 1938, to the list of crimes that \n     constitute ``specified unlawful activities'' for purposes of \n     the criminal money laundering provisions. These changes in \n     law mean that the U.S. will no longer allow a rapacious \n     foreign dictator to bring his funds to the U.S. and hide them \n     without fear of detection or prosecution.\n     Section 316. Anti-terrorist forfeiture protection\n       Section 316 establishes procedures to protect the rights of \n     persons whose property may be subject to confiscation in the \n     exercise of the government's anti-terrorism authority.\n     Section 317. Long-arm jurisdiction over foreign money \n         launderers\n       Section 317 amends 18 U.S.C. 1956 to give United States \n     courts ``long-arm'' jurisdiction over foreign persons \n     committing money laundering offenses in the United States, \n     over foreign banks opening U.S. bank accounts, and over \n     foreign persons who convert assets ordered forfeited by a \n     U.S. court. The amendments made by section 317 also permit a \n     federal court dealing with such foreign persons to issue a \n     pre-trial restraining order or take other action necessary to \n     preserve property in the United States to satisfy an ultimate \n     judgment. Finally, the amendment also permits the appointment \n     by a federal court of a receiver to collect and take custody \n     of a defendant's assets to satisfy criminal or civil money \n     laundering or forfeiture judgments.\n     Section 318. Laundering money through a foreign bank\n       Section 318 expands the definition of financial institution \n     for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1956 and 1957 to include banks \n     operating outside of the United States.\n     Section 319. Forfeiture of funds in United States interbank \n         accounts\n       Section 319 contains a number of provisions that are \n     designed to deal with practical issues raised by money \n     laundering control and financial transparency, relating \n     primarily to correspondent accounts at U.S. financial \n     institutions.\n       First, section 319 amends 18 U.S.C. 981 to treat amounts \n     deposited by foreign banks in interbank accounts with U.S. \n     banks as having been deposited in the United States for \n     purposes of the forfeiture rules, but grants the Attorney \n     General authority, in the interest of justice and consistent \n     with the United\n\n[[Page S11044]]\n\n     States' national interest, to suspend a forfeiture proceeding \n     that is otherwise based on the ``U.S. deposit'' presumption.\n       Second, section 319 adds a new subsection (k) to 31 U.S.C. \n     5318 to require U.S. financial institutions to reply to a \n     request for information from a U.S. regulator relating to \n     anti-money laundering compliance within 120 hours of receipt \n     of such a request, and to require foreign banks that maintain \n     correspondent accounts in the United States to appoint agents \n     for service of process within the United States; the new 31 \n     U.S.C. 5318(k) authorizes the Attorney General and the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to issue a summons or subpoena to \n     any such foreign bank seeking records, wherever located, \n     relating to such a correspondent account. Finally, the \n     provision requires the U.S. depository institution or broker-\n     dealer that maintains the account to sever correspondent \n     arrangements with any foreign bank within 10 days of \n     notification by the Attorney General or the Secretary of the \n     Treasury (each after consultation with the other) that the \n     foreign bank has neither complied with nor contested any such \n     summons or subpoena.\n       Finally, Section 319 amends section 413 of the Controlled \n     Substances Act to authorize United States courts to order a \n     convicted criminal to return property located abroad and to \n     order a civil forfeiture defendant to return property located \n     abroad pending trial on the merits.\n     Section 320.  Proceeds of foreign crimes\n       Section 320 amends 18 U.S.C. 981 to permit the United \n     States to institute forfeiture proceedings against the \n     proceeds of foreign criminal offenses found in the United \n     States.\n     Section 321.  Financial institutions specified in subchapter \n         II of chapter 53 of Title 31, United States Code\n       Section 321 amends 31 U.S.C. 5312(2) to add credit unions, \n     futures commission merchants, commodity trading advisors, and \n     registered commodity pool operators to the definition of \n     ``financial institution'' for purposes of the Bank Secrecy \n     Act, and to include the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \n     within the term ``federal functional regulator'' for purposes \n     of the Bank Secrecy Act.\n     Section 322.  Corporation represented by a fugitive\n       Section 322 extends the existing prohibition, in 18 U.S.C. \n     2466, against the maintenance of a forfeiture proceeding on \n     behalf of a fugitive to include a proceeding by a corporation \n     whose majority shareholder is a fugitive and a proceeding in \n     which the corporation's claim is instituted by a fugitive.\n     Section 323.  Enforcement of foreign judgments\n       Section 323 permits the government to seek a restraining \n     order to preserve the availability of property subject to a \n     foreign forfeiture or confiscation judgment.\n     Section 324.  Report and recommendation\n       Section 324 directs the Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the Attorney General, the Federal banking \n     agencies, the SEC, and other appropriate agencies to evaluate \n     operation of the provisions of Subtitle A of Title III of the \n     Act and recommend to Congress any relevant legislative \n     action, within 30 months of the date of enactment.\n     Section 325.  Concentration accounts at financial \n         institutions\n       Section 325 amends 31 U.S.C. 5318(h) to authorize the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to issue regulations concerning the \n     maintenance of concentration accounts by U.S. depository \n     institutions, to prevent an institution's customers from \n     anonymously directing funds into or through such accounts.\n     Section 326.  Verification of identification\n       Sec, 326(a) adds a new subsection (l) to 31 U.S.C. 5318 to \n     require the Secretary of the Treasury to prescribe by \n     regulation, jointly with each federal functional regulator, \n     minimum standards for financial institutions and their \n     customers regarding the identity of the customer that shall \n     apply in connection with the opening of an account at a \n     financial institution; the minimum standards shall require \n     financial institutions to implement, and customers (after \n     being given adequate notice) to comply with, reasonable \n     procedures concerning verification of customer identity, \n     maintenance of records of identity verification, and \n     consultation at account opening of lists of known or \n     suspected terrorists provided to the financial institution by \n     a government agency. The required regulations are to be \n     issued within one year of the date of enactment.\n       Section 326(b) requires the Secretary of the Treasury, \n     again in consultation with the federal functional regulators \n     (as well as other appropriate agencies), to submit a report \n     to Congress within six months of the date of enactment \n     containing recommendations about the most effective way to \n     require foreign nationals to provide financial institutions \n     in the United States with accurate identity information, \n     comparable to that required to be provided by U.S. nationals, \n     and to obtain an identification number that would function \n     similarly to a U.S. national's tax identification number.\n     Section 327.  Consideration of anti-money laundering record\n       Section 327 amends section 3(c) of the Bank Holding Company \n     Act of 1956, and section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Act to require the Federal Reserve Board and the \n     Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, respectively, to \n     consider the effectiveness of a bank holding company or bank \n     (within the jurisdiction of the appropriate agency) in \n     combating money laundering activities, including in overseas \n     branches, in ruling on any merger or similar application by \n     the bank or bank holding company.\n     Section 328.  International cooperation on identification of \n         originators of wire transfers\n       Section 328 requires the Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     State, to take all reasonable steps to encourage governments \n     to require the inclusion of the name of the originator in \n     wire transfer instructions sent to the United States, and to \n     report annually to the House Committee on Financial Services \n     and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n     Affairs concerning progress toward that goal.\n     Section 329.  Criminal penalties\n       Section 329 provides criminal penalties for officials who \n     violate their trust in connection with the administration of \n     Title III.\n     Section 330.  International cooperation in investigations of \n         money laundering, financial crimes, and the finances of \n         terrorist groups\n       Section 330 states the sense of the Congress that the \n     President should direct the Secretary of State, the Attorney \n     General, or the Secretary of the Treasury, as appropriate and \n     in consultation with the Federal Reserve Board, to seek \n     negotiations with foreign financial supervisory agencies and \n     other foreign officials, to ensure that foreign financial \n     institutions maintain adequate records relating to any \n     foreign terrorist organization or its membership, or any \n     person engaged in money laundering or other financial crimes, \n     and make such records available to U.S. law enforcement and \n     financial supervisory personnel when appropriate.\n\n\n    Subtitle B. Bank Secrecy Act Amendments and Related Improvements\n\n     Section 351. Amendments relating to reporting of suspicious \n         activities\n       Section 351 restates 31 U.S.C. 5318(g)(3) to clarify the \n     terms of the safe harbor from civil liability for financial \n     institutions filing suspicious activity reports pursuant to \n     31 U.S.C. 5318(g). The amendments to paragraph (g)(3) also \n     create a safe harbor from civil liability for banks that \n     provide information in employment references sought by other \n     banks pursuant to the amendment to the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Act made by Section 355 of Title III.\n     Section 352. Anti-money laundering programs\n       Section 352 amends 31 U.S.C. 5318(h) to require financial \n     institutions to establish anti-money laundering programs and \n     grants the Secretary of the Treasury authority to set minimum \n     standards for such programs. The anti-money laundering \n     program requirement takes effect at the end of the 180 day \n     period beginning on the date of enactment of the Act and the \n     Secretary of the Treasury is to prescribe regulations before \n     the end of that 180 day period that consider the extent to \n     which the requirements imposed under amended section 5318(h) \n     are commensurate with the size, location, and activities of \n     the financial institutions to which the regulations apply.\n     Section 353. Penalties for violations of geographic targeting \n         orders and certain recordkeeping requirements, and \n         lengthening effective period of geographic targeting \n         orders\n       Section 353 amends 31 U.S.C. 5321, 5322, and 5324 to \n     clarify that penalties for violation of the Bank Secrecy Act \n     and its implementing regulations also apply to violations of \n     Geographic Targeting orders issued under 31 U.S.C. 5326, and \n     to certain recordkeeping requirements relating to funds \n     transfers. Section 353 also amends 31 U.S.C. 5326 to make the \n     period of a geographic target order 180 days.\n     Section 354. Anti-money laundering strategy\n       Section 354 amends 31 U.S.C. 5341(b) to add ``money \n     laundering related to terrorist funding'' to the list of \n     subjects to be dealt with in the annual National Money \n     Laundering Strategy prepared by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     pursuant to the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes \n     Strategy Act of 1998.\n     Section 355. Authorization to include suspicions of illegal \n         activity in written employment references\n       Section 355 amends section 18 of the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Act to permit (but not require) a bank to include \n     information, in a response to a request for an employment \n     reference by a second bank, about the possible involvement of \n     a former institution-affiliated party in potentially unlawful \n     activity. A bank that provides information to a second bank \n     under the terms of this amendment is protected from civil \n     liability arising from the provision of the information \n     unless the first bank acts with malicious intent.\n     Section 356. Reporting of suspicious activities by securities \n         brokers and dealers; investment company study\n       Section 356(a) directs the Secretary of the Treasury, after \n     consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission and \n     the Federal Reserve Board, to publish proposed regulations, \n     on or before December 31, 2002, and final regulations on or \n     before July 1, 2002, requiring broker-dealers to file \n     suspicious activity reports.\n       Section 356(b) authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, \n     to prescribe regulations requiring futures commission \n     merchants, commodity trading advisors, and certain commodity \n     pool operators to submit suspicious activity reports under 31 \n     U.S.C. 5318(g). To a significant extent, the authorization \n     clarifies and restates the terms of existing law, but it also \n     signals our concern that the Treasury move quickly to\n\n[[Page S11045]]\n\n     determine the extent to which suspicious transaction \n     reporting by commodities firms is necessary as a part of the \n     nation's anti-money laundering programs.\n       Section 356(c) requires the Secretary of the Treasury, the \n     SEC and Federal Reserve Board to submit jointly to Congress, \n     within one year of the date of enactment, recommendations for \n     effective regulations to apply the provisions of 31 U.S.C. \n     5311-30 to both registered and unregistered investment \n     companies, as well as recommendations as to whether the \n     Secretary should promulgate regulations treating personal \n     holding companies as financial institutions that must \n     disclose their beneficial owners when opening accounts or \n     initiating funds transfers at any domestic financial \n     institution.\n     Section 357. Special report on administration of Bank Secrecy \n         provisions\n       Section 357 directs the Secretary of the Treasury to submit \n     a report to Congress, six months after the date of enactment, \n     on the role of the Internal Revenue Service in the \n     administration of the Bank Secrecy Act, with emphasis on \n     whether IRS Bank Secrecy Act information processing \n     responsibility (for reports filed by all financial \n     institutions) or Bank Secrecy Act audit and examination \n     responsibility (for certain non-bank financial institutions) \n     should be retained or transferred.\n     Section 358. Bank Secrecy provisions and anti-terrorist \n         activities of the United States intelligence agencies\n       Section 358 contains amendments to various provisions of \n     the Bank Secrecy Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and \n     the Fair Credit Reporting Act, to permit information to be \n     used in the conduct of United States intelligence or \n     counterintelligence activities to protect against \n     international terrorism.\n     Section 359. Reporting of suspicious activities by \n         underground banking systems\n       Section 359 amends various provisions of the Bank Secrecy \n     Act to clarify that the Bank Secrecy Act treats certain \n     underground banking systems as financial institutions, and \n     that the funds transfer recordkeeping rules applicable to \n     licensed money transmitters also apply to such \n     underground systems. Section 359 also directs the \n     Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress, within \n     one year of the date of enactment, on the need for \n     additional legislation or regulatory controls relating to \n     underground banking systems.\n     Section 360.  Use of authority of the United States Executive \n         Directors.\n       Section 360 authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to \n     instruct the United States Executive Director of each of the \n     international financial institutions (for example, the IMF \n     and the World Bank) to use such Director's ``voice and vote'' \n     to support loans and other use of resources to benefit \n     nations that the President determines to be contributing to \n     United States efforts to combat international terrorism, and \n     to require the auditing of each international financial \n     institution to ensure that funds are not paid to persons \n     engaged in or supporting terrorism.\n     Section 361.  Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\n       Section 361 adds a new section 310 to Subchapter I of \n     chapter 3 of title 31, United States Code, to make the \n     Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (``FinCEN'') a bureau \n     within the Department of the Treasury, to specify the duties \n     of FinCEN's Director, and to require the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to establish operating procedures for the \n     government-wide data access service and communications center \n     that FinCEN maintains. Section 361 also authorizes \n     appropriations for FinCEN for fiscal years 2002 through 2005. \n     Finally, Section 361 requires the Secretary to study methods \n     for improving compliance with the reporting requirements for \n     ownership of foreign bank and brokerage accounts by U.S. \n     nationals imposed by regulations issued under 31 U.S.C. 5314; \n     the required report is to be submitted within six months of \n     the date of enactment and annually thereafter.\n     Section 362.  Establishment of highly secure network.\n       Section 362 directs the Secretary of the Treasury to \n     establish, within nine months of enactment, a secure network \n     with FinCEN that will allow financial institutions to file \n     suspicious activity reports and provide such institutions \n     with information regarding suspicious activities warranting \n     special scrutiny.\n     Section 363.  Increase in civil and criminal penalties for \n         money laundering.\n       Section 363 increases from $100,000 to $1,000,000 the \n     maximum civil and criminal penalties for a violation of \n     provisions added to the Bank Secrecy Act by sections 311, 312 \n     and 313 of this Act.\n     Section 364.  Uniform protection authority for Federal \n         Reserve facilities.\n       Section 364 authorizes certain Federal Reserve personnel to \n     act as law enforcement officers and carry fire arms to \n     protect and safeguard Federal Reserve employees and premises.\n     Section 365.  Reports relating to coins and currency received \n         in nonfinancial trade or business.\n       Section 365 adds 31 U.S.C. 5331 (and makes related and \n     conforming changes) to the Bank Secrecy Act to require any \n     person who receives more than $10,000 in coins or currency, \n     in one transaction or two or more related transactions in the \n     course of that person's trade or business, to file a report \n     with respect to such transaction with FinCEN; regulations \n     implementing the new reporting requirement are to be \n     promulgated within six months of enactment.\n     Section 366.  Efficient use of current transaction report \n         system.\n       Section 366 requires the Secretary of the Treasury to \n     report to the Congress before the end of the one year period \n     beginning on the date of enactment containing the results of \n     a study of the possible expansion of the statutory system for \n     exempting transactions from the currency transaction \n     reporting requirements and ways to improve the use by \n     financial institutions of the statutory exemption system as a \n     way of reducing the volume of unneeded currency transaction \n     reports.\n\n\n                      Subtitle C. Currency Crimes\n\n     Section 371.  Bulk cash smuggling.\n       Section 371 creates a new Bank Secrecy Act offense, 31 \n     U.S.C. 5332, involving the bulk smuggling of more than \n     $10,000 in currency in any conveyance, article of luggage or \n     merchandise or container, either into or out of the United \n     States, and related forfeiture provisions.\n     Section 372.  Forfeiture in currency reporting cases.\n       Section 372 amends 31 U.S.C. 5317 to permit confiscation of \n     funds in connection with currency reporting violations \n     consistent with existing civil and criminal forfeiture \n     procedures.\n     Section 373.  Illegal money transmitting business.\n       Section 373 amends 18 U.S.C. 1960 to clarify the terms of \n     the offense stated in that provision, relating to knowing \n     operation of an unlicensed (under state law) or unregistered \n     (under federal law) money transmission business. Section 373 \n     also amends 18 U.S.C. 981(a) to authorize the seizure of \n     funds involved in a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1960.\n     Section 374.  Counterfeiting domestic currency and \n         obligations.\n       Section 374 makes a number of changes to the provisions of \n     18 U.S.C. 470-473 relating to the maximum sentences for \n     various counterfeiting offenses, and adds to the definition \n     of counterfeiting in 18 U.S.C. 474 the making, acquiring, \n     etc. of an analog, digital, or electronic image of any \n     obligation or other security of the United States.\n     Section 375.  Counterfeiting foreign currency and \n         obligations.\n       Section 375 makes a number of changes to the provisions of \n     18 U.S.C. 478-480 relating to the maximum sentences for \n     various counterfeiting offenses involving foreign obligations \n     or securities and adds to the definition of counterfeiting in \n     18 U.S.C. 481 the making, acquiring, etc. of an analog, \n     digital, or electronic image of any obligation or other \n     security of a foreign government.\n     Section 376.  Laundering the proceeds of terrorism.\n       Section 376 amends 18 U.S.C. 1956 to add the provision of \n     support to designated foreign terrorist organizations to the \n     list of crimes that constitute ``specified unlawful \n     activities'' for purposes of the criminal money laundering \n     statute. (This provision was originally included in another \n     title of the terrorism legislation.)\n     Section 377.  Extraterritorial jurisdiction.\n       Section 377 amends 18 U.S.C. 1029 to vest United States \n     authorities with extraterritorial jurisdiction over acts \n     involving access device, credit card and similar frauds that \n     would be crimes if committed within the United States and \n     that are directed at U.S. entities or linked to U.S. \n     activities.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what Senator Daschle would like to do, and \nthis has been cleared with the two managers, is have a vote before 2 \np.m. today, approximately 5 minutes to 2 p.m. There is a meeting at the \nWhite House. There are a number of very important hearings, one \nincluding the Secretary of State. We are waiting for one more Senator \nwho has 15 minutes. We understand that Senator Specter is on his way.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote on passage of the \nCounterterrorism Act occur at 1:55 p.m. Further, that there be 10 \nminutes of closing debate. I will alter that by saying whatever time \nSenator Specter does not use, it will be divided between the two \nmanagers of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to state my \nsupport\n\n[[Page S11046]]\n\nfor the pending legislation. This is very important legislation in \nresponse to the atrocious terrorist attacks of September 11. We will at \nsome date in the future conduct congressional oversight to make a \ndetermination as to whether there were any deficiencies in our \nintelligence operations prior to the September 11 attacks. However, we \nshould wait until the appropriate time because our intelligence \nentities are busy now collecting intelligence to avoid any recurrence \nof the terrorist attacks. But it is important that law enforcement have \nappropriate tools at their disposal to combat terrorists. In the United \nStates that means careful legislation which is in accordance with our \nconstitutional rights and our civil liberties.\n\n  I believe Congress has responded appropriately in this matter with \ndue deliberation. There is obviously a temptation in the face of what \noccurred on September 11 to respond spontaneously or reflexively, but \nwe have undertaken this legislation, I think, with appropriate care and \nnow have a good product.\n  I had expressed concerns when the bill was on the Senate floor that \nthere could be some question about the adequacy of the deliberative \nprocess because the Supreme Court of the United States has held acts of \nCongress unconstitutional where they questioned the thoroughness or \ndeliberation. I think this bill as presented today does meet that \nstandard.\n  The legislation has very important provisions under the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act where a modification has been made to \nauthorize electronic surveillance where there is a ``significant'' \nrather than a ``primary'' purpose, allowing use of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act.\n  I chaired the Judiciary subcommittee, which did Department of Justice \noversight, getting into the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in \nsome detail with respect to the Wen Ho Lee case. This is a change which \nis necessary, and I believe it is a change which will pass \nconstitutional muster.\n  The electronic surveillance adds terrorism to wiretap predicates. It \nis rather surprising that terrorism, or allegations of terrorism, have \nnot been sufficient to authorize electronic surveillance in the past. \nThis corrects a long-standing deficiency.\n  The pen register has been expanded for nationwide orders, which makes \nsense on an administrative level and does not conflict with any issues \nof civil liberties or constitutional rights. The bill increases the \ncivil liability for unauthorized disclosure of wiretapping information, \nwhich I think is important.\n  One of the key provisions of the bill is the sunset provisions \nrelating to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, electronic \nsurveillance, and information sharing which expire on December 31, \n2005, with an appropriate exception for ongoing investigations. This \nwill enable us to see how this expanded power will work out and will \nrequire reauthorization, new legislation, if we wish to continue it \nbeyond.\n  The provisions on immigration are important, requiring the Department \nof Justice and the FBI to share certain information with the State \nDepartment and INS. The issues regarding detention, I think, have been \nvery substantially improved to be sure that there is a protection of \nconstitutional rights while giving law enforcement an adequate \nopportunity to conduct the inquiries which they need.\n  The provisions on money laundering, I think, are very important \nadditions to take a stand, to stop terrorist organizations such as al-\nQaida and terrorists such as Osama bin Laden not to be financed through \nthe laundering which has been possible through laxity of the banking \nregulations.\n  In short, I believe this is a very significant step forward. There is \na very heavy overhang over Washington, DC, today with what is happening \nhere with our efforts to respond in so many ways to September 11. Now \nwith the anthrax, we are all concerned about what may happen in the \nfuture.\n  Having served as chairman of the Intelligence Committee back in the \n1995-1996 time period and chairing the appropriations subcommittee on \nterrorism, I am glad to see us move forward with this legislation which \nwill give law enforcement the tools which would give them a better \nopportunity to prevent any more sneak attacks, any recurrence of the \ndastardly deeds of September 11.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a joint \nmemorandum on the immigration provisions of H.R. 3162 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nJoint Memorandum of Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Senator Sam Brownback \n   on the Immigration Provisions of ``The Uniting and Strengthening \n   America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and \n                    Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001''\n\n       The U.S.A. PATRIOT Act of 2001 contains certain immigration \n     provisions worked out between the Administration and members \n     of both parties. Because the legislation was developed \n     outside the ordinary committee process, it was not \n     accompanied by the usual reports elaborating on the \n     background and purpose of its provisions. This memorandum is \n     accordingly submitted on behalf of the Chairman and Ranking \n     Member of the Subcommittee on Immigration of the Senate \n     Committee on the Judiciary to provide some background and \n     explanations for these provisions.\n\n                    TITLE IV: PROTECTING THE BORDER\n\n\n               subtitle A--protecting the northern border\n\n     Section 401  Ensuring Adequate Personnel on the Northern \n         Border\n       This section permits the Attorney General to lift the cap \n     on the number of ``full time equivalent'' employees that the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) may assign to \n     the northern border.\n     Section 402  Northern Border Personnel\n       This section triples the number of Border Patrol agents, \n     INS Inspectors, and Customs Service employees in each state \n     along the northern border. It also funds any additional staff \n     and facilities needed to support northern border personnel. \n     Further, this section provides $50 million to the INS and $50 \n     million to the Customs Service to improve technology to \n     monitor the northern border and to acquire additional \n     equipment for this purpose.\n     Section 403  Requiring Sharing by the Federal Bureau of \n         Investigation of Certain Criminal Record Extracts with \n         Other Federal Agencies in Order to Enhance Border \n         Security\n       This section provides the State Department and the INS with \n     electronic access to the information contained in the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation's National Crime Information Center \n     Interstate Identification Index (NCIC-III), Wanted Persons \n     File, and other files maintained by the National Crime \n     Information Center. This information is to be used in \n     determining whether a visa applicant or an applicant for \n     admission to the United States has a criminal history.\n       Under this section, the FBI must provide the State \n     Department and the INS with extracts from its criminal \n     history records and periodically update those extracts. \n     Within four months of enactment of this legislation, the \n     State Department must issue regulations regarding the proper \n     use of the information provided by the FBI. Within two years \n     of enactment, the Attorney General and the Secretary of State \n     will report to Congress on the implementation of this \n     section.\n       Further, this section directs the Attorney General and the \n     Secretary of State, working with the National Institute of \n     Standards and Technology (NIST) and other agencies, to \n     develop and certify a technology standard that can conform \n     the identity of a visa applicant or applicant for admission. \n     As these agencies do not utilize a single technology, the \n     development of a technology standard will facilitate the \n     collection and sharing of relevant identity information \n     between all the pertinent agencies. In particular, this \n     section instructs those agencies to investigate the use of \n     biometric technology. The technology standard must be \n     developed and certified by NIST within two years of the date \n     of enactment of this subsection.\n     Section 404  Limited Authority to Pay Overtime\n       This section eliminates the $30,000 limit on overtime pay \n     for INS personnel during 2001. The limit was contained in the \n     2001 Department of Justice Appropriations Act, which did not \n     contemplate the extraordinary demands that have been placed \n     on the INS since the terrorist attacks of September 11.\n     Section 405  Report on the Intergrated Automated Fingerprint \n         Identification System for Points of Entry and Overseas \n         Consular Posts\n       This provision instructs the Attorney General, in \n     consultation with the heads of other federal agencies, to \n     report to Congress on the feasibility of enhancing the FBI's \n     Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System \n     (IAFIS), and other identification systems, to better identify \n     foreign nationals wanted in connection with criminal \n     investigations in the United States and abroad.\n\n\n              subtitle b: enhanced immigration provisions\n\n     Section 411  Definitions Relating to Terrorism\n       Under current law, unless otherwise specified, an alien is \n     inadmissible and deportable for engaging in terrorist \n     activity only when\n\n[[Page S11047]]\n\n     the alien has used explosives or firearms. Because a \n     terrorist can use a knife, a box-cutter, or an airplane in a \n     terrorist act, this section expands the definition of \n     terrorist activity to include the use of any ``other weapon \n     or dangerous device.'' The language looks to the purpose, not \n     the instrument, in determining whether an activity is \n     terrorist in nature.\n       Current immigration law contains no provision acknowledging \n     organized terrorist threats per se and therefore contains no \n     ground for inadmissibility or deportability based on \n     activities involving ``terrorist organizations.'' Section 411 \n     defines terrorist organization to include: (1) an \n     organization expressly designated by the Secretary of \n     State under current section 219 of the INA; (2) an \n     organization otherwise designated as a terrorist \n     organization by the Secretary of State, in consultation \n     with the Attorney General, after finding that such \n     organization engages in terrorist activities, as defined \n     by section 212(a)(3)(iv)(I), (II) and (III), or provides \n     material support to further terrorist activity; or (3) any \n     group of two of more individuals that commits, plans, or \n     prepares to commit terrorist activities.\n       This section adds three grounds of inadmissibility for \n     individuals who, while not members of terrorist \n     organizations, may advocate terrorism. These include (1) \n     under new INA section 212(a)(3)(B)(i)(IV)(bb), being a \n     representative of a group ``whose public endorsement of \n     terrorist activity'' the Secretary of State has determined \n     undermines United States efforts to combat terrorism; (2) \n     under new INA section 212(a)(3)(B)(i)(VI), using one's \n     ``position of prominence within any country to endorse or \n     espouse terrorist activity, or persuade others to support \n     terrorist activity or a terrorist organization, in a way that \n     the Secretary of State determines'' undermines United States \n     efforts to combat terrorism; or (3) under new INA section \n     212(a)(3)(B)(i)(VII), being a spouse or child of a person \n     inadmissible under this section, unless the spouse or child \n     did not know or reasonably should not have known of the \n     activity causing the inadmissibility, or the spouse or child \n     has renounced such activity.\n       This section clarifies the circumstances under which the \n     provision of material support, solicitation of funds, or \n     solicitation of membership for a terrorist organization can \n     be the basis for a charge permitting the removal of an alien. \n     It provides that, after an organization is designated as a \n     terrorist organization by the Secretary of State, any \n     provision of material support or solicitation of funds or \n     membership, as defined in subsection (iv) of INA section \n     212(a)(3)(B), for a designated organization may be the basis \n     for a charge of removal. With respect to activity prior to \n     the designation of the organization, or with respect to non-\n     designated organizations under section 212(a)(3)(B)(vi)(III), \n     only activity that was or is intended to further terrorist \n     activity of the organization is prohibited by this section.\n     Section 412  Mandatory Detention of Suspected Terrorists; \n         Habeas Corpus; Judicial Review\n       The section creates INA section 236A, giving the Attorney \n     General the authority to certify and therefore detain persons \n     who pose a terrorist or security threat to the United States. \n     The power to certify is limited to the Attorney General and \n     the Deputy Attorney General. This section also provides \n     judicial review of this authority in habeas corpus \n     proceedings.\n       This section sets forth the standards for certification, \n     custody, and detention. All persons certified under these new \n     provisions shall be placed in custody and detained until \n     removed or decertified. Persons who are not removable would \n     be released from custody upon conclusion of the proceedings.\n       Further, it permits certification of aliens whom the \n     Attorney General has ``reasonable grounds to believe'' are \n     described under the terrorism grounds of the INA or are \n     engaged in any other activity that endangers the national \n     security of the United States. ``Reasonable grounds'' is a \n     higher standard than mere ``reason to believe'' and requires \n     objective, articulatable grounds.\n       The Attorney General must, in certified cases, either \n     initiate removal proceedings within seven days or release the \n     alien. In cases not involving an alien certified by the \n     Attorney General, proceedings should continue to be initiated \n     within the time provided by the regulations. See 66 Fed. Reg. \n     48335 (amending 8 CFR Sec. 237.3(d)). The seven-day window to \n     initiate proceedings is limited to cases certified under \n     section 236A and should be used judiciously, with charges \n     filed as promptly as possible.\n       For aliens whose removal is unlikely in the reasonably \n     foreseeable future, the Attorney General is required to \n     demonstrate that release of the alien will adversely affect \n     national security or the safety of the community or any \n     person before detention may continue beyond the removal \n     period. Indefinite detention of aliens is permitted only in \n     extraordinary circumstances. Zadvydas v. Davis, 121 S. Ct. \n     2491 (2001).\n       The Attorney General shall review the certification of an \n     alien every six months and, when appropriate, revoke the \n     certification and release the alien under such conditions as \n     the Attorney General deems appropriate. The alien may submit \n     documentation or other evidence to be considered by the \n     Attorney General in reviewing his or her certification.\n       The Attorney General's decision to certify and detain an \n     alien is subject to judicial review in habeas corpus \n     proceedings. This review encompasses both procedural \n     protections and the merits of the Attorney General's \n     certification decision and any decision to extend detention \n     beyond the expiration of the removal period where removal is \n     unlikely in the reasonably foreseeable future. Habeas corpus \n     review is permitted in any appropriate district court of the \n     United States, but appeals are limited to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, with review \n     available in the United States Supreme Court by petition for \n     certiorari or by original petition for habeas corpus. \n     Restricting appellate review to a single court protects the \n     government's interest in uniformity, while providing an alien \n     with a meaningful opportunity to seek judicial review.\n     Section 413  Multilateral Cooperation Against Terrorists\n       The records of the State Department pertaining to the \n     issuance of or refusal to issue visas to enter the United \n     States are confidential and can be used only in the \n     formulation and enforcement of U.S. law. This section allows \n     the State Department to provide such records to a foreign \n     government on a case-by-case basis for the purpose of \n     preventing, investigation, or punishing acts of terrorism.\n     Section 414  Visa Integrity and Security\n       In 1996, Congress enacted legislation mandating the \n     development of an automated entry/exit control system to \n     record the entry and departure of every non-U.S. citizen \n     arriving in the United States. The INS lacks the \n     technology and funding to implement this measure at all \n     ports of entry, especially on the land border. Last year \n     Congress amended the law to establish reasonable \n     implementation deadlines. This provision directs the \n     Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     State, to fully implement the entry/exit system, as \n     amended, as expeditiously as practicable, with particular \n     focus on the utilization of biometric technology and the \n     development of tamper-resistant documents. To that end, \n     this section also authorizes the appropriation of such \n     funds as may be necessary to implement this system.\n       The entry/exit system will notify the INS whether foreign \n     nationals departed the United States under the terms of their \n     visas. Since the vast majority of persons who enter the \n     United States do not pose a threat to our safety or security, \n     this provision requires that the information obtained from \n     the entry/exit system be interfaced with intelligence and law \n     enforcement databases to enable authorities to focus on \n     apprehending those few who do pose a threat.\n       Federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies maintain \n     ``look out lists'' containing the names of foreign nationals \n     who pose safety or security threats. Not all critical \n     information is currently shared with the INS and the State \n     Department, which are the two agencies charged with \n     determining who is granted a visa or admitted to the United \n     States. This provision requires the Office of Homeland \n     Security to submit a report to Congress assessing the \n     information that these two agencies need to effectively \n     screen out those who might pose a threat to the United \n     States.\n     Section 415  Participation of Office of Homeland Security on \n         Entry Task Force\n       This section includes the new Office of Homeland Security \n     as a participant in the Entry and Exit Task Force established \n     by the Immigration and Naturalization Service Data Management \n     Improvement Act of 2000.\n     Section 416  Foreign Student Monitoring Program\n       In 1996, Congress established a program to monitor foreign \n     students and exchange visitors to the United States, funded \n     by user fees. While a pilot phase of this program ended in \n     1999, this system has not been implemented nationwide. This \n     section requires the system to be fully implemented and \n     temporarily funds the program through January 2003.\n       Currently, all institutions of higher education that enroll \n     foreign students or exchange visitors are required to \n     participate in the monitoring program. This section also \n     expands the list of institutions to include air flight \n     schools, language training schools, and vocational schools.\n     Section 417  Machine Readable Passports\n       The Visa Waiver Program permits nationals of participating \n     countries to enter the United States without obtaining \n     nonimmigrant visas. Countries participating in the program \n     must have low nonimmigrant visa refusal rates, have machine \n     readable passport programs, and not compromise the law \n     enforcement interests of the United States.\n       This section requires the Secretary of State to conduct an \n     annual audit of the program to assess measures to prevent the \n     counterfeiting and theft of passports and to ascertain \n     whether participating countries have established a program to \n     develop tamper-resistant passports. Results of the audit will \n     be reported to Congress.\n       Currently, nationals of participating countries have until \n     October 1, 2007 to obtain machine-readable passports to seek \n     admission to the United States. This section advances the \n     deadline to October 1, 2003, but permits the Secretary of \n     State to waive the requirements imposed by the deadline for \n     all nationals of a program country, if that country is making \n     sufficient progress to provide their nationals with machine-\n     readable passports.\n\n[[Page S11048]]\n\n     Section 418  Prevention of Consulate Shopping\n       This section directs the State Department to examine the \n     concerns, if any, created by the practice of certain aliens \n     to ``shop'' for a visa between issuing posts.\n\n\n    SUBTITLE C: PRESERVATION OF IMMIGRATION BENEFITS FOR VICTIMS OF \n                               TERRORISM\n\n     Section 421  Special Immigrant Status\n       The section provides permanent residence as special \n     immigrants to the spouses and children of certain victims of \n     the terrorist attacks. They include aliens who would have \n     obtained permanent residence through a family or employment-\n     based category, but for death, disability, or loss of \n     employment as a direct result of the terrorist attacks on \n     September 11, 2001. Permanent residence would be granted to \n     the fiance or fiancee (and children) of a U.S. citizen who \n     died in the attacks. Permanent residence would also be \n     granted to the grandparents of a child whose parents died in \n     attacks, if either parent was a U.S. citizen or a permanent \n     resident.\n     Section 422  Extension of Filing or Reentry Deadlines\n       This section creates safeguards so that aliens seeking \n     immigration benefits are not adversely affected by the \n     terrorist attacks. For aliens in lawful nonimmigrant status \n     at the time of the terrorist attacks, this section extends \n     the filing deadline for an extension of status request or \n     change of status request where the alien was unable to meet \n     the filing deadline due to the terrorist attacks. Deadlines \n     are similarly extended for aliens unable to reenter in time \n     to request an extension of status, aliens unable to enter \n     during the period of visa validity or parole, and aliens \n     unable to depart within their period of lawful status or \n     voluntary department. The section also protects recipients of \n     diversity visas who were adversely affected by the terrorist \n     attacks.\n     Section 423  Humanitarian Relief for Certain Surviving \n         Spouses and Children\n       Current law provides that an alien who was the spouse of a \n     U.S. citizen for at least two years before the citizen died \n     shall remain eligible for immigrant status as an immediate \n     relative. This eligibility also applies to the children of \n     the alien. This section provides that if the U.S. citizen \n     died as a direct result of the terrorist attacks, the alien \n     can seek permanent residence even if the marriage was less \n     than two years old.\n       This section also protects the spouse and unmarried sons \n     and daughters of a permanent resident killed in the terrorist \n     attacks by allowing them to seek permanent residence either \n     through a pending visa petition (filed by or on behalf of the \n     deceased) or by filing a ``self-petition'' based on their \n     relationship to the deceased permanent resident.\n     Section 424  `Age-Out' Protection for Children\n       By providing a brief filing extension, this provision \n     ensures that no alien will ``age out of eligibility to \n     immigrate as the result of the terrorist attacks. Aliens who \n     turn 21 years of age while their applications are pending are \n     no longer considered children under the INA, and therefore \n     ``age out'' of eligibility to immigrate.\n     Section 425  Temporary Administrative Relief\n       This section provides temporary administrative relief to an \n     alien lawfully present on September 10, who was the spouse, \n     parent, or child of someone killed or disabled by the \n     terrorist attacks and otherwise not entitled to relief.\n     Section 426  Evidence of Death, Disability, or Loss \n         Employment\n       This section directs the Attorney General to establish \n     evidentiary standards regarding on constitutes death, \n     disability, or loss of employment ``as a direct result'' of \n     the terrorist attacks. Regulations are not required to \n     implement the provisions of this subtitle.\n     Section 427  No Benefit to Terrorists or Family Members of \n         Terrorists\n       No benefit under this subtitle will be provided to anyone \n     involved in the terrorist attacks on September 11 or to any \n     family member of such an individual.\n     Section 428  Definitions\n       The term `specified terrorist activity' means any terrorist \n     activity conducted against the United States, its government, \n     or its people of the United States on September 11, 2001.\n\n                               title viii\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, several provisions of title VIII would \nestablish criminal prohibitions or expand existing criminal laws to \ndeter terrorist conduct. My understanding is that the Senate certainly \ndoes not intend title VIII to criminalize otherwise lawful and \nauthorized United States Government activities. Would the Senator \nconfirm my understanding of the intent and effect of title VIII?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator's understanding is absolutely correct. Unless \nexpressly provided, none of the general restrictions in title VIII are \nintended to criminalize lawful and authorized United States Government \nactivities.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 6 years ago I stood on this floor and \ncalled upon the Senate to join the fight against terrorism in the wake \nof the horrific bombing in Oklahoma City. Back then some argued \nterrorism was something that usually happened far away, in distant \nlands, over distant conflicts. Well, that's all changed.\n  Terrorism has come to America.\n  We have to be a little proactive now. Back then, I proposed a series \nof precise anti-terrorism tools to help law enforcement catch \nterrorists before they commit their deadly act, not ever imagining the \nevents of September 11.\n  In particular, I said that it simply did not make sense that many of \nour law enforcement tools were not available for terrorism cases.\n  For example, the FBI could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia, \nbut they could not get one to investigate terrorists. To put it \nbluntly, that was crazy! What's good for the mob should be good for \nterrorists.\n  Anyway, some of my proposals were enacted into law in 1996, a number \nwere not.\n  There were those who decided that the threat to Americans was \napparently not serious enough to give the President all the changes in \nlaw be requested.\n  Today, 5 years later, I again call on my colleagues to provide law \nenforcement with a number of the tools which they declined to pass back \nthen. The anti-terrorism bill we consider today is measured and \nprudent. It has been strengthened considerably since the Administration \noriginally proposed it in mid-September. It takes a number of important \nsteps in waging an effective war on terrorism.\n  It allows law enforcement to keep up with the modern technology these \nterrorists are using. The bill contains several provisions which are \nidentical or nearly identical to those I previously proposed.\n  For example: it allows the FBI to get wiretaps to investigate \nterrorists, just like they do for the Mafia or for drug kingpins; it \nallows the FBI to get a roving wiretap to investigate terrorists--so \nthey can follow a particular suspect, regardless of how many different \nforms of communication that person uses; and it allows terrorists to be \ncharged with Federal ``racketeering offenses,'' serious criminal \ncharges available against organizations which engage in criminal \nconduct as a group, for their crimes.\n  I am pleased that the final version of the bill we are considering \ntoday contains three provisions that I fought for.\n  First, section 613 incorporates a bill that Senator Hatch and I \nintroduced earlier this year, S. 899. Named in honor of Delaware State \ntrooper Francis Collender, who was tragically killed while on a traffic \nstop in Odessa, DE this past February, S. 899 and section 613 of this \nbill will raise the one-time death benefit paid to the families of \nslain or permanently disabled law enforcement officers. For too long, \nthis benefit has stood at $100,000. It was indexed for inflation and \ncurrently stands at $151,000, but even this is far too low for the \nfamilies of these heroes to make ends meet. The bill we consider today \nraises this benefit to $250,000, continues to index it for inflation, \nand makes it applicable to the family of any law enforcement or fire \npersonnel who lost their life on or after January 1, 2001. It's the \nleast we can do for the Collender family, the least we can do for the \nhundreds of families who tragically lost a loved one on September 11, \nand I'm grateful my colleagues have agreed we need to include my bill \nin this larger anti-terrorism bill today.\n  Second, section 817 is based on legislation I introduced in the 106th \nCongress, S. 3202. It may shock my colleagues that under current law, \nanyone, including convicted felons, fugitives, and aliens from \nterrorist-sponsoring states, can possess anthrax or other biological \nagents. And under current law, the FBI has no tool at its disposal to \ncharge someone with possession of anthrax. Possession of anthrax, or \nany other dangerous biological agent, is legal, unless the FBI can make \na case that the suspect intended to use the agent as a weapon. This far \ntoo high a hurdle for our investigators to overcome in many cases, and \nindeed the FBI has informed me it has hindered several of their past \nbioweapons investigations. Section 817 closes this loophole. It \nprohibits certain classes of individuals, felons, illegal aliens, \nfugitives and others, from ever possessing these dangerous biological \nagents. And for everyone else, my provision says you need to be able to \nshow you possessed this stuff with a peaceful or\n\n[[Page S11049]]\n\nbona fide research reason. If not, you're going to be charged with a \nfelony and you face up to ten years in Federal prison.\n\n  Finally, section 1005 of this bill incorporates my First Responders \nAssistance Act. I have spoken with too many local police officers, \nchiefs, firemen and women, and others who feel left out of our fight \nagainst terrorism. I commend FBI Director Mueller for recently pledging \nto do a better job sharing information with our State and local law \nenforcement people, but clearly more needs to be done. Who responds \nfirst to a terrorist incident? On September 11 it was the New York City \nand Arlington County, VA police and fire departments. That's always \ngoing to be the case, local law enforcement is our first line of \ndefense against terrorists, and we need to give them the tools they \nneed to get that job done well.\n  My provision will, for the first time, give State and local \nenforcement and fire personnel the opportunity to apply directly to the \nJustice Department to receive terrorism prevention assistance. \nSpecifically, departments will now be able to get help purchasing gas \nmasks, hazardous material suits, intelligence-gathering equipment, \ntwenty-first century communications devices and other tools to help \nthem respond to terrorist threats. This section also creates a new \nanti-terrorism training grant program that will fund seminars and other \ntraining sessions to help local police departments better analyze \nintelligence information they come across, help local fire departments \nacquire the knowledge they need to respond to critical incidents, and \nassist those agencies who may be called upon to stabilize a community \nafter a terrorist incident. It is my intent that these funds go to \nprofessional law enforcement organizations who are in some instances \nalready delivering this type of training. The Department of Justice's \nOffice for Domestic Preparedness does some of this, but their program \nis a block grant sent to the Governor. I want to involve local police \nand fire departments directly in the fight against terrorism, and this \nsection is an important step towards meeting that goal. The funds \nauthorized, $100 million over the next four years, may not be enough to \nget the job done, but it's a good start. I thank the Police Executives \nResearch Forum for working with me to craft this proposal, and I look \nforward to seeing significant dollars allocated to it in future \nspending bills.\n  So this bill contains many provisions critical to law enforcement. \nSome may say it doesn't go far enough.\n  I have to say, I was disappointed that the Administration dropped \nsome proposals from an early draft of its bill, measures which I called \nfor five years ago. Those measures are not in the bill we consider \ntoday, but I continue to believe that they're common-sense tools we \nought to be giving to our men and women of law enforcement.\n  We should be extending 48-hour emergency wiretaps and pen-registers, \ncaller-ID-type devices that track incoming and outgoing phone calls \nfrom suspects, to terrorism crimes. This would allow police, in an \nemergency situation, to immediately obtain a surveillance order against \na terrorist, provided the police go to a judge within 48 hours and show \nthat they had the right to get the wiretap and that emergency \ncircumstances prevented them from going to the judge in the first \nplace. Now, this emergency tool is available only for organized crime \ncases and the bill we consider today does not expand this power to \nterrorist investigations.\n  We should be extending the Supreme Court's ``good faith'' exception \nto wiretaps. This well-accepted doctrine prevents criminals in other \ntypes of offenses from going free when the police make an honest \nmistake in seizing evidence or statements from a suspect. We should \napply this good faith exception to terrorist crimes as well, to prevent \nterrorists from getting away when the police make an honest mistake in \nobtaining a wiretap.\n  I'm pleased Chairman Leahy and the Administration were able to reach \nconsensus on the two areas which gave me some pause in the \nAdministration's original proposal: those provisions dealing with \nmandatory detention of illegal aliens and with greater information \nsharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities.\n  The agreement reached has satisfied me that these provisions will not \nupset the balance between strong law enforcement and protection of our \nvalued civil liberties.\n  This bill is not perfect. No one here claims it embodies all the \nanswers to the question of how best to fight terrorism. But I am \nconfident that by updating our surveillance laws, by taking terrorism \nas seriously as we do organized crime, and by recognizing the important \nrole state and local law enforcement has to play in this campaign, that \nwe are taking a step in the right direction by passing this bill today.\n\n\n                             Antiterrorism\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the anti-\nterrorism bill. The bill will provide our Nation's law-enforcement \npersonnel with important tools to more effectively investigate and \nprevent further attacks against the people of the United States.\n  At the outset, I want to make clear that we did not rush to pass ill-\nconceived legislation.\n  During the past two Congresses, when I chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Technology and Terrorism, the Subcommittee \nheld 19 hearings on terrorism. I want to repeat that: 19. The witnesses \nwho appeared before the Subcommittee included the then-Director of the \nFBI Louis Freeh and representatives of all three of the \ncongressionally-mandated commissions on terrorism that have issued \nreports over the last two years. Additional hearings on terrorism were \nheld by the full Judiciary Committee and by other committees.\n  Many of the provisions proposed by the Attorney General, and included \nin the legislation we sent to the President today, mirror the \nrecommendations of one or more of the major terrorism commissions and \nhave already been examined by the committee of jurisdiction. In fact, \nsome of these provisions had already been voted on and passed by the \nSenate in other legislation.\n  Indeed, as I will discuss more fully in a minute, the language sent \nforward by the Attorney General to establish nationwide trap and trace \nauthority was included in the Hatch-Feinstein-Kyl Amendment to the \nrecently passed Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill. Much of \nthe remaining language in that amendment was included in the \nCounterterrorism Act of 2000, which the Senate passed last fall, after \na terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole killed 17 American sailors and \ninjured another 39. That bill was based on recommendations of the \nbipartisan, congressionally-mandated National Commission on Terrorism, \nknown as the Bremmer Commission, which was established in 1998 in \nresponse to the embassy bombings in Tanzania and Kenya.\n  One particularly important provision, which was included in both the \nCJS bill and the current bill, updates the law to keep pace with \ntechnology. The provision on pen registers and trap and trace devices: \none, would allow judges to enter pen/trap orders with nationwide scope; \nand two, would codify current case law that holds that pen/trap orders \napply to modern communication technologies such as e-mail and the \nInternet, in addition to traditional phone lines.\n  Nationwide jurisdiction for a court order will help law-enforcement \nto quickly identify other members of a criminal organization such as a \nterrorist cell. Indeed, last year Director Freeh testified before the \nTerrorism Subcommittee that one of the problems law-enforcement faces \nis ``the jurisdictional limitation of pen registers and trap-and-trace \norders issued by federal courts.''\n  He continued: ``Today's electronic crimes, which occur at the speed \nof light, cannot be effectively investigated with procedural devices \nforged in the last millennium during the infancy of the information \ntechnology age.''\n  Prior to the legislation we passed today, in order to track a \ncommunication that was purposely routed through Internet Service \nProviders located in different States, law-enforcement was required to \nobtain multiple court orders. This is because, under existing law, a \nFederal court can order only those communications carriers within its \ndistrict to provide tracing information to law enforcement.\n\n[[Page S11050]]\n\n  According to Director Freeh's testimony before the Terrorism \nSubcommittee, ``As a result of the fact that investigators typically \nhave to apply for numerous court orders to trace a single \ncommunication, there is a needless waste of time and resources, and a \nnumber of important investigations are either hampered or derailed \nentirely in those instances where law enforcement gets to a \ncommunications carrier after that carrier has already discarded the \nnecessary information.''\n  This bill solves the problem.\n  I would also like to address another important provision.\n  The bill will more clearly to criminalize the possession of \nbiological and toxin agents by those who should not possess them. The \nbill would amend the implementing legislation for the 1972 ``Convention \non the Prohibition of the Development, Production, and Stockpiling of \nBacteriological, Biological, and Toxin Weapons and on their \nDestruction,'' BWC. Article I of the BWC prohibits the development, \nproduction, stockpiling, acquisition, or retention of Microbial or \nother biological agents, or toxins, whatever their origin or method of \nproduction, of types and in quantities that have no justification for \nprophylactic, protective, or other peaceful purposes. It is not the \nintent of the BWC, nor is it the intent of Section 802, to prevent the \nlegitimate application of biological agents or toxins for prophylactic, \nprotective, bona fide research, or other peaceful purposes. These \npurposes include, inter alia, medical and national health activities, \nand such national security activities as may include the confiscation, \nsecuring, and/or destruction of possible illegal biological substances.\n  In addition to the other provisions in this anti-terrorism \nlegislation that will provide our law enforcement communities with the \ntools to weed out and stop terrorism, I want to express my support for \nthe immigration provisions upon which the administration, key members \nof the House Judiciary Committee, Senators Hatch, Kennedy, Leahy and I \nhave reached agreement, and which are included in this bill.\n  We must not forget, however, that the United States will continue to \nface overwhelming infrastructure and personnel needs at our consular \noffices abroad, along both the southern and northern border, and in our \nimmigration offices throughout the United States. And, in addition to \nthe provisions included in this anti-terrorism bill, the U.S. \ngovernment will need additional tools to keep terrorists out of the \ncountry and, once they are in the country, find them and remove them. \nThat means, among other things, eliminating the ability of terrorists \nto present altered international documents, and improving the \ndissemination of information about suspected terrorists to all \nappropriate agencies. After hearing first-hand about the extraordinary \nweaknesses of our immigration and visa processing systems, Senate \nJudiciary Terrorism Subcommittee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein and I will \nsoon introduce legislation to better equip our government with the \ntools necessary to make our immigration and visa processing systems \nmore secure.\n  With that said, the anti-terrorism bill will certainly provide a \nbetter legal framework for keeping foreign terrorists out of the United \nStates, and detaining them should they enter.\n  First, this anti-terrorism bill clarifies that the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation is authorized to share data from its ``most wanted \nlist,'' and any other information contained in its national crime-\ninformation system, with the Immigration Naturalization Service and the \nState Department. This will help the INS and State Department identify \nsuspected terrorists before they come to the United States, and, should \nthey gain entry, will help track them down on our soil. It also allows \nthe State Department, during a U.S. criminal investigation, to give \nforeign governments information on a case-by-case basis about the \nissuance or refusal to issue a U.S. visa.\n  The bill will also clarify U.S. law prohibiting the entry of, and \nrequiring the removal of, individual alien terrorists. It will probably \nsurprise the Members of this body a great deal to know that, under \ncurrent law, a terrorist alien is not considered either inadmissible \nto, or deportable from, the United States even if he or she has \n``endorsed or espoused terrorist activity that undermines the efforts \nof the United States to fight terrorism,'' or has provided ``material \nsupport to a terrorist organization.'' Nor is an individual deportable \nfor being a ``representative of a terrorist organization.'' The anti- \nterrorism bill makes it clear to U.S. officials considering whether to \nallow someone to come to the country, that a person meeting any one of \nthese criteria is not welcome to come here. Although the final bill \nprohibits admission of individuals who have endorsed terrorism or are \nrepresentatives of a terrorist organization, neither of those criteria \nwill make such an individual deportable. I will work to make it clear \nthat such criteria are deportable.\n\n  In addition, the anti-terrorism package that we are debating today \nfurther defines what is considered by the United States to be a \nterrorist organization. Under current law, a terrorist organization \nmust be designated by the Secretary of State under Section 219 of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act. This process can take several months, \nand has been criticized by some experts as potentially politically \ncorruptible. Under this final package, Section 219 designations will \nremain in effect. A separate designation process is added, whereby an \norganization can be designated by the Secretary of State or the \nAttorney General, in consultation with each other, with seven days' \nnotice to the leadership of the House and Senate and the congressional \ncommittees of jurisdiction. Additionally, an organization, whether or \nnot it is formally designated by the Secretary of State or the Attorney \nGeneral, can be considered to be terrorist if it is made up of two or \nmore individuals who commit or plan to commit terrorist activities.\n  This anti-terrorism package also has provisions regarding temporary \ndetention. It allows for the temporary detention of aliens who the \nAttorney General certifies that he has ``reasonable grounds to believe \nis inadmissible or deportable under the terrorism grounds.'' This \ncompromise represents a bipartisan understanding that the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States needs the flexibility to detain suspected \nterrorists. Under the compromise that Members have reached, the \nAttorney General must charge an alien with a deportable violation or he \nmust release the alien. In this final version, if the charge is not \nsustained, or if withholding of deportation is granted by an \nimmigration judge then the alien must be released. In addition, the \nunderlying certification, and all collateral matters, can be reviewed \nby any U.S. District Court and any appeals can be heard by U.S. Appeals \nCourt for the District of Columbia. The Attorney General, under this \nfinal version, is required to review all individual certifications \nevery six months, and any alien certified can ask that the Attorney \nGeneral review the case.\n  Finally, this package will determine whether ``consular shopping,'' \ni.e. someone has a visa application pending from his or her home \ncountry, but goes to another country for adjudication, is a problem. If \nso, the Secretary of State must recommend ways to remedy it. Another \nprovision prevents countries that do not have machine-readable \npassports from participating in the Visa Waiver Program, although the \nSecretary of State is allowed to provide a waiver for countries that do \nnot provide such passports. I do not support the waiver authority, but \nam pleased that the overall requirement is included. Another provision \nauthorizes $36.8 million for quick implementation of the INS foreign \nstudent tracking system, a program that I have repeatedly urged be \nimplemented. The final package also includes relief for immigrants, who \nbut for the tragic events of September 11, are here legally and could \nnow lose their legal status.\n  As former chairman and now ranking Republican of the Judiciary \nCommittee's Terrorism Subcommittee, I have long suggested, and strongly \nsupported, many of the anti-terrorism and immigration initiatives now \nbeing advocated by Republicans and Democrats alike. In my sadness about \nthe overwhelming and tragic events that took thousands of precious \nlives, I am resolved to push forward to make the United States a safer \nplace for its millions of law-abiding citizens and legal immigrants. \nThat means delivering justice to those who are responsible for\n\n[[Page S11051]]\n\nthe lives lost on September 11, and reorganizing our institutions of \ngovernment so that the law-abiding can continue to live their lives in \nfreedom.\n  Finally, let me address briefly the concern voiced by some that we \nare in danger of ``trampling civil liberties.'' I reiterate that we did \nnot rush, that we have had thorough, deliberative hearings, and that \nmany of the proposals within this bill have already been passed by the \nSenate. Nothing in the current bill impinges on civil liberties. The \nbill will give Federal agencies fighting terrorism the same tools we \nhave given those fighting illicit drugs, or even postal fraud. Many of \nthe tools in the bill are modernizations of the criminal law, \nnecessitated by the advent of the Internet.\n  While some of these tools are extremely helpful in terrorism \ninvestigations, it makes no sense to refuse to apply these common sense \nchanges to other crimes that are committed, like kidnaping, drug \ndealing, and child pornography. It is unwise to limit these tools to \nonly terrorism offenses because often, at the outset of an \ninvestigation of a particular person or crime, law enforcement does not \nknow what you are dealing with. A credit-card fraud case or a false \nimmigration documents case may turn out to be connected to funding or \nfacilitating the operations of a terrorist group. We should give law \nenforcement the tools it needs to have the best chance of discovering \nand disrupting these activities.\n  We have a responsibility to the people of this nation to ensure that \nthose who are charged with protecting us from future terrorist attacks \nare empowered to do so. This is not a zero sum game. We can both ensure \nour security and protect our liberties.\n  We cannot afford to lose this race against terror, and we cannot \nafford to give the enemy in this war a full lap head-start. I support \nthis bill. I commend President Bush and General Ashcroft for submitting \na sound proposal to the Senate, and for their tremendous efforts during \nthe past month.\n\n\n                              section 1012\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have a number of questions about the substance, scope \nand procedure of section 1012 of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. I am \nconcerned that there are some significant issues which this provision \nhas not addressed, notwithstanding its noble intentions. Would the \ngentleman be able to clarify some of these issues for me?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will do my best to clarify the intent and operation of \nthis section for the gentleman.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Would the gentleman please explain how the Secretary of \nDOT will determine whether an individual seeking an original or renewed \nlicense presents a security risk?\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Secretary will rely upon the background records check \nto be done by the Justice Department. Any further analysis to be done \nby the Secretary on this issue should be explained following a \nCongressional directive to do so, in regulations issued by the \nSecretary for notice and comment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Does the section make clear what standards will be \napplied to determine if a security risk is presented by an individual?\n  Mr. LEAHY. At this time the section does not and that matter should \nbe clarified in subsequent legislation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am concerned that the review process could be delayed \nand a person seeking renewal of a hazmat license could be unable to \nwork due to matters beyond his or her control.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The gentleman is correct. Regulations need to be issued by \nthe Secretary specifying time periods and making it clear that delays \nnot due to the applicant should not force him to be out of work and \nthat his existing hazmat license will remain in effect pending \ncompletion of the security risk review process.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am troubled by the lack of due process protections \nfor the applicant. What is the gentleman's opinion on this subject?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree with the gentleman. The section needs to be \nclarified by legislation and regulations issued making clear that any \napplicant denied a hazmat license because of a security risk will be \nadvised of the reasons for such denial and given an opportunity to \npresent any comments he or she deems appropriate. We need to provide \nthe applicant with a right to challenge the Secretary's decision and \ninsure due process is protected.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Finally, isn't there a concern that foreign drivers \ntransporting hazmat present an equal, if not a greater, security risk \nthan that presented by U.S. drivers? If so, how will we deal with \nforeign drivers because they do not appear to be covered by section \n1012.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I fully agree with the gentleman. The legislation must \naddress foreign drivers to cover adequately the security risks \napplicable to hazmat transportation.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the September 11 terrorist attack has \nbrought to the forefront numerous flaws in how we control and manage \nimmigration in this country. It is now clear that the control of our \nborders has become a matter of national security.\n  Let me first state that I have no doubt that most aliens who enter \nthis country are innocent, hard-working people who make important \ncontributions to our society. America can continue our tradition of \nsupporting reasonable legal immigration, but I am concerned that we are \nallowing illegal immigration to get out of control.\n  According to the most recent census data, there are at least 7 and \npossibly as many as 8 million illegal aliens in the United States. The \nnumber has at least doubled just since 1990. This trend is very \ntroubling and has to be reversed. We must do more to stop illegal \naliens from entering our country, and we must do more to deport those \nwho are already here illegally. Our previous efforts, such as the 1996 \nImmigration Act, have proven to be inadequate.\n  This is not only a matter of upholding our laws, it is a matter of \nmaintaining the safety and security of our country. We do not even know \nhow some of the September 11 hijackers got into the country. This is \nnot acceptable. We must do more to track and keep out those who wish to \nharm our country and terrorize our citizens.\n  The Antiterrorism Act we are considering today contains some reforms \nin this area and is a step in the right direction. It expands the \nnumber of Border Patrol agents, INS inspectors, and Customs agents \nalong the Northern Border. Also, it provides for greater data-sharing, \nincluding giving the INS easier access to the criminal history \ninformation contained in the NCIC database. Moreover, it grants the \nAttorney General greater authority to detain those who may be involved \nin terrorist activity, although we should continue to review this issue \nand grant the Attorney General greater power in the future.\n  In addition to immigration, this bill contains other crucial reforms \nthat will update our wiretapping laws and allow greater sharing of \nintelligence and law enforcement information. I strongly supported this \nbill during Judiciary Committee hearings, including in one hearing in \nthe Constitution Subcommittee of which I am Ranking Member. I am \npleased that we are finalizing this bill today.\n  However, this bill is only a beginning. It is a move in the right \ndirection, not an end in itself. Much more needs to be done to protect \nour nation from illegal immigration.\n  I believe one important measure could be to return to annual \nregistration for immigrants who are in the United States. Requiring \nimmigrants to register each year would help the INS keep track of where \nimmigrants are in the United States, and whether they have overstayed \ntheir visas. In addition, it would benefit aliens by helping them prove \nhow long they have been in the United States.\n  An alien registration system existed before 1981. However, the system \nbecame inactive at that time due to lack of funds and administrative \ndifficulties. I think the time has come to reconsider this program. \nRecent technology, such as scanners, can help address some of the \nrecord-keeping problems that harmed the old system.\n  There are many other reform possibilities. Currently, when an alien \ncommits a crime in the United States and is ordered deported, some home \ncountries refuse to take him back. This creates huge difficulties for \nus, especially when the alien has completed his prison sentence. I \nbelieve the United States should respond in kind by not granting visas \nto countries that have such a policy. This would encourage\n\n[[Page S11052]]\n\ncountries to live up to their responsibilities. Also, we need to look \ninto expanding the use of identification cards for aliens, including \nmore fingerprinting.\n  The antiterrorism bill demonstrates that the Congress is committed to \naddressing the problems we face regarding immigration. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to continue our important work in this \narea. It must remain a top priority. We should not rest until we have \nillegal immigration under control in this country.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the anti-\nterrorism legislation we have before us, the USA PATRIOT Act. I \nsupported the Senate bill when it passed 2 weeks ago, and this bill--\nwhich was overwhelmingly passed by the House yesterday--retains key \nprovisions that give our Government the tools it needs to combat \nterrorism.\n  One of the key issues during the House-Senate negotiations was that \nof the so-called ``sunset.'' While the Senate-passed bill ensured these \nprovisions would remain in effect as long as necessary, the House voted \nto suspend the bill's provisions in 5 years. Ultimately, the bill \nbefore us today includes a four year sunset. While I believe the \nprovisions of this bill will be needed to combat terrorism beyond 4 \nyears, it is fair to say Congress should review the provisions and make \nan assessment of their effectiveness in 4 years.\n  Let me also say I am pleased to have worked in conjunction with \nSenator Bond and Senator Conrad in supporting the Visa Integrity and \nSecurity Act. This bill addresses many of the concerns we raised, such \nas the importance of information sharing among government law \nenforcement and intelligence agencies with the State Department and \ntightening tracking controls on those entering the U.S. on student \nvisas, including those attending flight schools. These are critical \nissues, and I commend both Senators for their efforts, and I am pleased \nthe bill before us contains provisions from this bill on information \nsharing and the use of biometric technology for the entry and exit of \naliens.\n  With this legislation, we take reasonable, constitutional steps to \nenhance electronic and other forms of surveillance, without trampling \non the rights of Americans. We will also institute critical measures to \nincrease information sharing by mandating access to the FBI's National \nCrime Information Center, or NCIC, by the State Department and INS.\n  Incredibly, while intelligence is frequently exchanged, no law \nrequires agencies like the FBI and CIA to share information on \ndangerous aliens with the State Department or INS. While I am pleased \nthe bill before us ensures information sharing between the FBI, State \nDepartment and INS, I believe it does not go far enough as other \ncrucial agencies, such as the DEA, CIA, or DoD, that may have \ninformation the State Department and INS need, but are still not \nrequired to share information. In short, by only providing access to \nthe FBI's NCIC system, we are not summoning the sum total of U.S. \nGovernment information on individual aliens which is now needed in our \nwar on terrorism.\n  I saw firsthand the consequences of serious inadequacies in \ncoordination and communication during my 12 years as ranking member of \nthe House Foreign Affairs International Operations Subcommittee and \nchair of the subcommittee's Senate counterpart.\n  Access to the FBI's NCIC system by the State Department is a first \nstep, and one that I advocated in 1993, after the Justice Department \nruled that because the State Department was not a ``law enforcement \nagency,'' it no longer had free access to the NCIC. Tellingly, after \nruling, the visa denial rate for past criminal activities plunged a \nremarkable 45 percent--stark evidence that we can't afford to tie the \nhands of America's overseas line of defense against terrorism.\n  Although my legislation designated the State Department a ``law \nenforcement agency'' for purposes of accessing the NCIC when processing \nany visa application, whether immigrant or non-immigrant, a revised \nprovision enacted in 1994 only provided the State Department with free \naccess for purposes of processing immigrant visas--dropping my \nrequirement for non-immigrant visas eventually used by all 19 suspected \nhijackers. Even that limited law was sunsetted in 1997 with a brief 6-\nmonth extension to 1998.\n  Currently, U.S. posts check the lookout database called the Consular \nLookout and Support System--Enhanced, or CLASS-E, prior to issuing any \nvisa. CLASS-E contains approximately 5.7 million records, most of which \noriginate with U.S. embassies and consulates abroad through the visa \napplication process. The INS, DEA, Department of Justice, and other \nfederal agencies also contribute lookouts to the system, however, this \nis voluntary.\n  To further fortify our front-line defenses against terrorism--to turn \nback terrorists at their point of origin--information sharing should be \nmandatory, not voluntary. That is why I introduced a bill that would \nrequire that law enforcement and the intelligence community share \ninformation with the State Department and INS for the purpose of \nissuing visas and permitting entry into the U.S. And while my bill \nwould have gone farther than the legislation before us, by including \nthe DEA, CIA, Customs and the Department of Defense in the mandated \ninformation-sharing network, I am pleased that this bill we are \nconsidering at least mandates access to the NCIC by INS and the State \nDepartment.\n\n  The bottom line is, if knowledge is power, we are only as strong as \nthe weakest link in our information network. Therefore, we must ensure \nthat the only ``turf war'' will be the one to protect American turf.\n  Another important issue is that of verifying the identity of a visa \nholder. Once a visa is issued at the point of origin, we should be \nensuring that it is the same person who shows up at the point of entry. \nThe fact is, we don't know how many, if any, of the 19 terrorists \nimplicated in the September 11 attacks entered the U.S. on visas that \nwere actually issued to someone else.\n  Currently, once a visa is issued by the State Department, it then \nfalls to INS officials at a port-of-entry to determine whether to grant \nentry. The problem is, no automated system is utilized to ensure that \nthe person holding the visa is actually the person who was issued the \nvisa. In other words, the INS official has to rely solely on the \nidentification documents the person seeking entry is carrying--making \nthat official's job that much more difficult.\n  There is a better way, and legislation I introduced would require the \nestablishment of a fingerprint-based check system to be used by State \nand INS to verify that the person who received the visa is the same \nperson at the border crossing station trying to enter the country.\n  Simply put, it requires the State Department and INS to jointly \ncreate an electronic database which stores fingerprints, and that other \nagencies may use as well. When a foreign national receives a visa, a \nfingerprint is taken, which then is matched against the fingerprint \ntaken by INS upon entry to the U.S. This is a common sense approach \nthat would take us one step closer to minimizing the threat and \nmaximizing our national security.\n  The fact of the matter is fingerprint technology, one part of the \nlarger category of biological factors that can be used for \nidentification known as biometrics, is not new. In fact, the U.S. \nGovernment has already employed biometrics to verify identities at \nmilitary and secret facilities, at ports-of-entry, and for airport \nsecurity, among many others.\n  The bill before us includes a provision that requires the Attorney \nGeneral to report on the feasibility of enhancing the FBI's Integrated \nAutomated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) or other \nidentification systems to identify visa holders who may be wanted in a \ncriminal investigation in the U.S. or abroad before they are issued a \nvisa or permitted entry or exit to the U.S.\n  This surely doesn't sound all that much different than the \nlegislation I have proposed. I am pleased this bill at least starts us \ndown the road toward implementing biometric technologies, and I hope \nthis can be achieved as soon as possible.\n  Although I would prefer an even stronger bill and indeed worked \ntoward the inclusion of measures that would have accomplished this \ngoal, this legislation negotiated by the House and Senate is vital to \nour national security, and I am proud to support it. The\n\n[[Page S11053]]\n\nwar on terrorism is a war on many fronts. Some of the battles will be \ngreat in scale, many will be notable by what is not seen and by what \ndoesn't happen, namely, that individuals who pose a serious threat to \nthis nation never see these shores and never set foot on our soil.\n  Many of our greatest victories will be measured by the attacks that \nnever happen, in battles we win before they ever have a name, in \nconflicts we prevent before they ever claim one American life. I hope \nwe will pass and enact legislation that will help make that possible, \nand urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan op-ed from The Bangor Daily News.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Bangor Daily News, Oct. 24, 2001]\n\n Homeland Security and the ``Three C's'': Coordination, Communication, \n                            and Cooperation\n\n                   (By U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snow)\n\n       This week, Congress is expected to send to the President \n     landmark legislation for a new era: a bill designed to bring \n     the full resources of the federal government to bear in our \n     war against terrorism. One of the most critical elements of \n     this anti-terrorism package--which also includes expanded \n     authority to hunt down and identify terrorist activity within \n     our own borders--addresses the ``Three C's'' that have been \n     lacking among those federal agencies that are integral to \n     preventing terrorism: coordination, communication, and \n     cooperation.\n       Incredibly, there is no provisions of current law that \n     mandates State Department access to sources such as the FBI's \n     National Crime Information Center (NCIC). This system, which \n     maintains arrest and criminal information from a wide variety \n     of federal, state, and local sources as well as from Canada, \n     will be used by the State Department to deny visas to \n     dangerous aliens. Similar to legislation I introduced in \n     1993, the bill pending in conference will finally make such \n     information-sharing a requirement, and when combined with the \n     new Office of Homeland Security should help ensure that our \n     federal agencies are as united in the effort against \n     terrorism as the American people. I urged conferees to \n     further strengthen this requirement, so both State and the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) have access to \n     the full range of information gathered by U.S. intelligence \n     and law enforcement agencies.\n       During my twelve years as ranking member of the House \n     Foreign Affairs International Operations Subcommittee and \n     Chair of the subcommittee's Senate counterpart, I saw \n     firsthand why removing impediments to a cooperative federal \n     effort is a national imperative. Perhaps the most egregious \n     example came to light in our investigations into the comings-\n     and-goings of radical Egyptian cleric Sheikh Omar Abdel \n     Rahman, mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.\n       Astoundingly, we found that in the period since 1987 when \n     Sheikh Rahman was placed on the State Department lookout \n     list, he entered and exited the U.S. five times totally \n     unimpeded. Even after the State Department formally revoked \n     his visa, INS granted him permanent residence status. When he \n     was finally caught on July 31, 1991, reentering the U.S., he \n     was immediately released back into U.S. society to allow him \n     to pursue a multi-year appeal process.\n       Just as unbelievable is the fact that, even after the 1993 \n     attack on the World Trade Center, membership in a terrorist \n     organization in and of itself--with the exception of the \n     PLO--was not sufficient grounds for visa denial. Rather, the \n     Immigration Act of 1990 required the government to prove that \n     an individual either was personally involved in a terrorist \n     act, or planning one. This absurd threshold made it almost \n     impossible to block individuals, such as Sheikh Rahman, from \n     entering the country legally. Legislation I introduced in \n     1993 removed that bureaucratic and legal obstacle--yet it \n     took nearly three more years to enact it as part of the Anti-\n     Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.\n       Further, to respond to the trail of errors we uncovered, \n     provisions from my bill were enacted in a year later, in \n     1994, requiring modernization in the State Department's \n     antiquated microfiche ``lookout'' system to keep dangerous \n     aliens from entering the United States. Recognizing the need \n     to mate these new technologies with the need for the most \n     comprehensive, current and reliable information, the bill \n     also attempted to address the issue of access. Tellingly, \n     after the State Department lost free access to the NCIC \n     because of a 1990 Justice Department ruling that the State \n     Department was not a ``law enforcement agency'', the visa \n     denial rate for past criminal activities plunged a \n     remarkable 45 percent.\n       Therefore, my 1993 bill also designated the State \n     Department a ``law enforcement agency'' for purposes of \n     accessing the NCIC as well as other FBI criminal records when \n     processing any visa application, whether immigrant or non-\n     immigrant. Unfortunately, a revised provision also enacted in \n     1994 provided the State Department with free access to these \n     FBI resources only for purposes of processing immigrant \n     visas--dropping my requirement for non-immigrant visas \n     eventually used by all 19 of the suspected hijackers. Even \n     that limited law was allowed to expire, despite my \n     legislation enacted in 1996 repealing the requirement that \n     visa applicants be informed of the reason for a denial--a \n     provision that law enforcement agencies legitimately believed \n     could impede ongoing investigations, or reveal sources and \n     methods.\n       Having introduced my own legislation after the attacks to \n     mandate information sharing among all agencies such as the \n     FBI, CIA, DEA, Customs, INS and the State Department, I would \n     have preferred that the recently-passed anti-terrorism bill \n     go even further. Nevertheless, re-instating State Department \n     access to the NCIC for both types of visas is a critical step \n     in ensuring that information sharing will no longer be \n     voluntary and ad hoc.\n       To further fortify our front-line defenses against \n     terrorism and turn back terrorists at their point of origin, \n     I also proposed mandating information sharing by establishing \n     Terrorist Lookout Committees, comprised of the head of the \n     political section of each embassy and senior representatives \n     of all U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The \n     committees would be required to meet on a monthly basis to \n     review and submit names to the State Department for inclusion \n     in the visa lookout system. Unfortunately, Senators did not \n     reach agreement on amendments that could be added to the \n     anti-terrorism bill, so the package was ultimately passed \n     with no modifications. Consequently, I will continue to work \n     to pass this important measure separately.\n       Clearly, the catastrophic events of September 11 have \n     catapulted us into a different era, and everything if forever \n     changed. We must move heaven and earth to remove the \n     impediments that keep us from maximizing our defense against \n     terrorism, and that means changing the prevailing system and \n     culture by re-focusing on the ``Three C's'' of coordination, \n     communication and cooperation. The bottom line is, if \n     knowledge is power, we are only as strong as the weakest link \n     in our information network--therefore, we must ensure that \n     the only ``turf war'' will be the one to protect American \n     turf. In our fight against terrorism, we can do no less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time be divided \nequally between the distinguished chairman and myself.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes for each side.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as we wind down the debate and move to \nfinal passage, I want to continue my acknowledgment of those who worked \nso hard and were instrumental in getting this legislation enacted. I \nstart again by expressing my gratitude to Senators Kyl and Feinstein \nfor their efforts. No Senators have worked harder over the past few \nyears in such a bipartisan manner on terrorist missions. They have both \ndone an excellent job. Also, Senators Bob Graham and Shelby, who \ncosponsored this legislation, deserve credit for significant \ncontributions. In the Intelligence Committee, of course, Senator \nSarbanes and Senator Phil Gramm are to be praised for the money \nlaundering provisions of the package. They developed that in this bill. \nI credit the hard work of other fellow members of the Judiciary \nCommittee; in particular, Senators Biden and Schumer, who have devoted \ntheir energy to several of these proposals. Their assistance was \ninstrumental in shaping this final product.\n  Next, I thank my dedicated staff and my chief counsel and staff \ndirector, Makan Delrahim, who has been instrumental in putting this \nbill together. I also thank my crime policy counsels on the Judiciary \nCommittee: Jeff Taylor, whose background as a federal prosecutor was \ncrucial in crafting the many technical provisions of this legislation, \nas well as Stuart Nash, another former federal prosecutor, and Leah \nBelaire, each of whom has brought invaluable expertise to this process; \nmy lead immigration counsel, Dustin Pead, and our tireless legislative \nassistant, Brigham Cannon, each has provided critical assistance. I am \nalso grateful to Elizabeth Maier on Senator Kyl's staff, David Neal on \nSenator Brownback's staff, and Esther Olavarria on Senator Kennedy's \nstaff, for their input on the immigration provisions. I also extend our \nthanks to Sharon Prost, my former chief counsel who recently was \nappointed by President Bush to serve as a Federal appellate judge, for \nher wise counsel on this legislation.\n  In addition, I personally thank our Chairman, Senator Leahy. I \nreserve that until the end. His staff deserve a lot of credit and I \npersonally thank\n\n[[Page S11054]]\n\nthem for their long hard hours. I thank personally his chief counsel \nand staff director, Bruce Cohen, and other members of his staff: Beryl \nHowell, Julie Katzman, Ed Barron, Ed Pagano, Tim Lynch, David James, \nand John Eliff, each of whose expertise I personally found invaluable. \nI am grateful to them for the many long hours they devoted to drafting \nthis bill and helping ensure that our final product has strong \nbipartisan support. I enjoyed working with them and I certainly always \nenjoy working with Senator Leahy and appreciate the good things we were \nable to do.\n  The Department of Justice has been of great assistance to us in \nputting this bill together. In particular, I would like to thank \nAttorney General John Ashcroft and his Deputy Larry Thompson for their \nwise counsel, their leadership, and their quick response to our many \nquestions and concerns. Michael Chertoff, the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Criminal Division was a frequent participant in our \nmeetings, as was Assistant Attorneys General Dan Bryant and Viet Dinh. \nJustice Department lawyers Jennifer Newstead, John Yoo, John Elwood, \nPat O'Brien, and Carl Thorsen were also important and valuable \nparticipants in this process.\n\n  The White House Counsel and Congressional Liaison staff provided \nessential contributions at all stages of this process. Judge Al \nGonzales, the White House Counsel, provided key guidance with the help \nof his gifted staff, including Deputy White House Counsel Tim Flanagan \nand Associate Counsels Courtney Elwood, Brett Kavanaugh, and Brad \nBerenson.\n  The White House Congressional Liaison office, together with the Vice \nPresident's office, worked nonstop to keep this process moving forward \nand were critically responsive to any requests the Senate had. Nick \nCalio, Ziad Ojakli, and Heather Wingate with the White House, and Nancy \nDorn and Candy Wolff with the Vice President's office, deserve our \ngratitude for all the assistance they have given us.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I must recognize the diligence and invaluable \nassistance provided by leadership staff on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mark Childress and Andrea Larue with Majority Leader Daschle's \noffice, and David Hoppe, Sharon Soderstrom, and John Mashburn with \nSenator Lott's office, all deserve our collective thanks. These \ndedicated professionals selflessly gave up their nights and weekends to \nfacilitate passage of this final product. Also, I take special pride in \nthanking Stewart Verdery, who now works for Senator Nickles but \npreviously worked on my Judiciary Committee staff, for his cooperation \nand assistance in this process.\n  As we close debate on this legislation, I would like to note that the \nfundamental obligation of government is to protect our citizens from \nharm and every member of this Senate, by virtue of the sworn oath of \nthe office we hold, must do everything in his or her power to ensure \nthat the heinous attacks of September 11 are never repeated. We must \nnever forget the more than 5,000 innocent men, women, and children who \nlost their lives on American soil some 6 weeks ago.\n  I am grateful that I have been able to work on this matter with the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont. I am grateful we have been able to \npull together, in a relatively short period of time, an antiterrorism \nbill that really is going to make a difference in all our lives. So I \nurge my colleagues' support for this important legislation, thank my \ncolleagues for all their help.\n  Mr. President. The Department of Justice has prepared an excellent \nand precise analysis of the legislation, with which I fully agree. I \nask unanimous consent that the analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                Overview\n\n       In the wake of the tragic, criminal act of violence \n     perpetrated against the United States on September 11, the \n     Bush Administration proposed legislation that would provide \n     the Department of Justice with the tools and resources \n     necessary to disrupt, weaken, and counter the infrastructure \n     of terrorist organizations, to prevent or thwart terrorist \n     attacks, and to punish or defeat in battle perpetrators of \n     terrorist acts.\n       On October 24, the House passed a bill which contains a \n     substantial number of the key provisions originally requested \n     by the Administration. The Department of Justice strongly \n     supports this bill and urges the Senate to act quickly so \n     that these new authorities can be made available to \n     prosecutors and agents who are working around the clock to \n     prevent future attacks and to bring the perpetrators of \n     September 11 to justice.\n       The events of September 11, 2001 demonstrate that terrorist \n     acts are perpetuated by expertly organized, highly \n     coordinated, and well financed organizations, operating \n     without regard to borders, to advance their agendas. The \n     fight against terrorism thus is both a war to defend the \n     security of our nation and our citizens against terrorism and \n     a unified criminal justice effort.\n       Existing laws fail to provide our national security \n     authorities and law enforcement with certain critical tools \n     they need to fight and win the war against terrorism. Indeed, \n     we have tougher laws for fighting organized crime and drug \n     trafficking than for combating the threat of terrorism. For \n     example, technology has dramatically outpaced our statutes. \n     Many of our most important intelligence gathering laws were \n     enacted decades ago, in and for an era of rotary telephones. \n     Meanwhile, our enemies use e-mail, the Internet, mobile \n     communications and voice mail. Until Congress provides law \n     enforcement with the tools necessary to identify, dismantle \n     and punish terrorist organizations, we are fighting an uphill \n     battle.\n       Making the fight against terrorism a national priority must \n     not and will not mean that the rights and freedoms guaranteed \n     to all Americans under the Constitution will become victims \n     of this war. In this law enforcement mission, as in all that \n     we undertake at the Department of Justice, the protection of \n     the rights and privacy of all Americans is the principle that \n     guides us--the outcome which, if not achieved, renders our \n     efforts meaningless.\n       This new terrorist threat to Americans on our soil is a \n     turning point in America's history. It is a new challenge for \n     law enforcement. Our fight against terrorism is not solely or \n     primarily a criminal justice endeavor--it is defense of our \n     nation and its citizens. We cannot wait for terrorists to \n     strike to begin investigations and take action. We must \n     prevent first, and prosecute second. The anti-terrorism \n     proposals that have been submitted by the Administration and \n     considered by the House and Senate represent careful, \n     balanced, and long overdue improvements to our capacity to \n     combat terrorism.\n\n\n                                Process\n\n       The Administration reached bipartisan agreement with the \n     leadership of the House and Senate and the chairmen and \n     ranking members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees \n     on a bill which was passed by the House on October 24 by an \n     overwhelming majority.\n       The Department of Justice strongly supports this bill and \n     urges the Senate to act quickly so that these new authorities \n     can be made available to prosecutors and agents who are \n     working around the clock to prevent future attacks and to \n     bring the perpetrators of September 11 to justice. Although \n     the compromises reflected in specific provisions of the bill \n     do not in every case meet the Administration's original \n     goals, the bill does overall substantially achieve each and \n     every one of the Administration's objectives.\n\n\n                  discussion on substantive provisions\n\n        Enhancing domestic security against terrorism (title I)\n\n       These provisions would provide new funding and structural \n     reforms in the fight against terrorism. A counterterrorism \n     fund would be established to address terrorism issues within \n     the Department of Justice with regard to investigations and \n     damage to components as a result of terrorism (Sec. 101); \n     discrimination against Arab and Muslim Americans is condemned \n     (Sec. 102); additional funding would be provided for the \n     FBI's technical support center (Sec. 103); the National \n     Electronic Crime Task Force Initiative would be expanded \n     (Sec. 105); and the military would be authorized to assist \n     state and local law enforcement in chemical weapons \n     emergencies (Sec. 104).\n       The President's powers under the International Economic \n     Emergency Powers Act would be expanded in cases of military \n     hostilities and regarding the use of classified information \n     (Sec. 106). President Bush signed a new Executive Order under \n     the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) \n     blocking the assets of, and transactions with, terrorist \n     organizations and certain charitable, humanitarian, and \n     business organizations that finance or support terrorism. At \n     present, however, the President's powers are limited to \n     freezing assets and blocking transactions with such \n     individuals and entities. Starving terrorist organizations of \n     the funds that sustain them requires that we do more. When we \n     encounter drug traffickers, for instance, we don't just \n     freeze assets, we seize assets.\n\n              Enhanced surveillance procedures (title II)\n\n       These provisions of the bill address gaps in the coverage \n     of the federal electronic surveillance statutes (particularly \n     the wiretap statute, the pen registers and trap and trace \n     statute, and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act). The \n     key element that unites these provisions is the goal of \n     making the statutes technology-neutral: that is, ensuring \n     that the same existing authorities that apply to telephones, \n     for example, are made applicable to computers and use of e-\n     mail on the Internet. It is critically important to\n\n[[Page S11055]]\n\n     note that in drafting these provisions, the Department's \n     goal was and remains ensuring that the scope of the \n     authority remains the same--in other words, that no more \n     or less information as is currently obtainable through a \n     particular device (for example, a pen register) on a \n     telephone, is obtainable from a computer.\n       Law enforcement must have intelligence gathering tools that \n     match the pace and sophistication of the technology utilized \n     by terrorists. Critically, we also need the authority for law \n     enforcement to share vital information with our national \n     security and intelligence agencies in order to prevent future \n     terrorist attacks.\n       Terrorist organizations increasingly take advantage of \n     technology to hide their communications from law enforcement. \n     Today's terrorist communications are carried over multiple \n     mobile phones and computer networks--frequently by multiple \n     telecommunications providers located in different \n     jurisdictions. To facilitate their criminal acts, terrorists \n     do not discriminate among different kinds of technology. \n     Regrettably, our intelligence gathering laws don't give law \n     enforcement the same flexibility.\n       The bill creates a technology-neutral standard for \n     intelligence gathering, ensuring law enforcement's ability to \n     trace the communications of terrorists over mobile phones, \n     computer networks and any new technology that may be \n     developed in the coming years.\n       We are not seeking changes in the protections in the law \n     for the privacy of law-abiding citizens. The bill would \n     streamline intelligence gathering procedures only. Except for \n     under those circumstances authorized by current law, the \n     content of communications would remain off-limits to \n     monitoring. The information captured by this technology-\n     neutral standard would be limited to the kind of information \n     you might find in a phone bill, such as the phone numbers \n     dialed by a particular telephone.\n       The Department strongly opposed the two-year ``sunset'' on \n     these critical provisions in the original House version of \n     the legislation. The President and the Attorney General have \n     stressed that the threat of terrorism will not ``sunset''; \n     rather the fight against terrorism will be a long struggle, \n     and law enforcement must have the necessary tools to fight \n     this war over the long term. However, law enforcement must \n     have these tools now. To calm fears of a permanent authority, \n     the bill now includes a four-year ``sunset'' provision for \n     several provisions as noted during the discussion of the \n     impacted provisions, at which time it is the Administration's \n     hope that these changes in surveillance law will be made \n     permanent.\n\n   Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) amendments (title II)\n\n       These provisions sharpen the tools used by the FBI, CIA, \n     and NSA for collecting intelligence on international \n     terrorists and other targets under FISA, 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1801-63. The amendments in this area would enable \n     the agents and case officers of the FBI and CIA and the \n     analysts of NSA to respond more quickly and efficiently to \n     crises and to operational opportunities against terrorists \n     and other targets.\n\n             Period of FISA Surveillance and Search Orders\n\n       Problem: Currently, with limited exceptions, applications \n     to the FISA Court for its authorization to conduct electronic \n     surveillance and physical search must be renewed by the Court \n     every 90 and 45 days, respectively. Applications to the Court \n     for surveillance and search against foreign terrorists and \n     spies are noncontroversial but bog down the agencies and clog \n     the Court.\n       Solution: The legislation would, for the conduct of \n     electronic surveillance and physical search against foreign \n     terrorists and spies, extend the duration of an approval \n     order to 120-days with extension possible for up to a year \n     for electronic surveillance and would extend the duration for \n     searches from 45 to 90 days. (Sec. 207). This provision would \n     sunset in four-years.\n\n                         Multi-Point Authority\n\n       Problem: Foreign terrorists and spies are trained to change \n     mobile or ground-line phones, hotel rooms, and restaurants in \n     order to defeat surveillance. Currently, to effect FISA \n     coverage at a new facility, DOJ must develop and draft a new \n     application, get it certified by the Director of FBI and \n     signed by the Attorney General, and find and present it to a \n     judge on the FISA Court. This delays or defeats our coverage \n     of these targets and impairs our ability to investigate and \n     detect terrorism and espionage.\n       Solution: The bill would enable the FBI, in response to \n     such actions by FISA targets that thwart coverage (Sec. 206), \n     to serve an order on a previously unidentified vendor or \n     facility in order to maintain the coverage. Congress passed a \n     similar provision for Title III a few years ago. These \n     provisions will sunset in four years.\n\n                  Mobility--Nationwide Search Warrants\n\n       As communications technology now provides significant \n     mobility to its users, who can pass from jurisdiction to \n     jurisdiction in minutes, law enforcement and intelligence \n     officers need that same flexibility.\n       The bill provides for nationwide search warrants for voice \n     mail (Sec. 209), e-mail (as long as the issuing court has \n     jurisdiction over the offense being investigated) (Sec. 220), \n     and in investigations involving terrorism (Sec. 219).\n\n                    Foreign Intelligence Information\n\n       Problem: Currently, as interpreted, the FISA requires that \n     the FBI Director or other senior official certify that the \n     collection of foreign intelligence is ``the purpose'' of \n     the FISA search or surveillance. As interpreted by the \n     FISA Court, that standard has hindered the Department's \n     ability to coordinate multi-faceted responses to \n     international terrorism, which involve foreign \n     intelligence and criminal investigations and equities.\n       Solution: The bill would change this standard. The bill \n     would require certification that the collection of foreign \n     intelligence is ``a significant purpose,'' rather than ``the \n     purpose,'' of the FISA search or surveillance; however, this \n     provision is subject to the four-year sunset applicable to \n     several FISA provisions. (Sec. 218).\n\n                Foreign Intelligence Information Sharing\n\n       Problem: Currently, with few exceptions, criminal \n     investigators may not share grand jury or Title III \n     information with the intelligence agencies. Records obtained \n     through grand jury subpoenas and insights gained through \n     Title III remain inaccessible to agencies that need such \n     information in their operations and analysis.\n       Solution: The bill would enable foreign intelligence \n     information obtained in a criminal investigation, including \n     information obtained through a grand jury or Title III, to be \n     shared with intelligence and other federal officers, subject \n     to the four-year sunset and would require the court to be \n     notified after any such information sharing occurs in the \n     case of grand jury information. (Sec. 203). In addition, the \n     Attorney General must establish procedures for the release of \n     information when it pertains to a case against a United \n     States citizen. Also, the FBI has been authorized to expedite \n     the hiring of translators capable of translating any \n     information gathered under these and other procedures \n     (Sec. 205).\n\n       Pen Register: Business Records; National Security Letters\n\n       Problem: The ability of the FBI to obtain basic records as \n     a part of an international terrorist or other intelligence \n     investigation has been hampered by cumbersome procedures \n     concerning pen registers, business records, and national \n     security letters. As the current investigation of flight \n     school records makes clear, our ability to gain quick access \n     to such information may be critical to an investigation.\n       Solution: The legislation would enable the FBI to obtain \n     toll, business, and other records more efficiently by \n     eliminating the requirement of a showing that there is a \n     nexus to a foreign power, and applying a standard of \n     relevance to an intelligence or counterintelligence \n     investigation. This new standard is limited to protection \n     against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence \n     activities and may not be based solely on First Amendment \n     activities. (Sec. Sec. 214, 215, 216). Pen/trap provisions \n     would also now apply to Internet traffic, as well as \n     telephone communications, while excluding Internet Service \n     Providers (ISPs) and other entities complying with wiretap \n     orders from liability based on any surveillance under these \n     provisions. See also (Sec. Sec. 201, 202, expanding \n     predicates for obtaining surveillance authority). These \n     provisions are subject to the four-year sunset.\n\n Broadened Scope of Subpoenas for Records of Electronic Communications \n                         and Subscriber Records\n\n       The bill would permit the disclosure of information such as \n     means of payment for electronic services, including bank \n     account and credit card numbers, pursuant to subpoena. The \n     bill would treat cable companies acting in their capacity of \n     providing Internet services the same as other ISPs and \n     telephone companies in this regard, removing them from the \n     protections of laws governing cable privacy, the intent of \n     which was and is to prevent disclosure of shows watched in \n     the privacy of one's home not benign information such as \n     account numbers and forms of payment. (Sec. 225). ISPs would \n     also be permitted under the bill to disclose information of \n     stored electronic communications where such communications \n     indicate a risk of immediate death or injury. (Sec. Sec. 210, \n     211, 212).\n\n             Delayed Notice of Execution of Search Warrant\n\n       The bill would permit delayed notice of execution of a \n     search warrant in criminal investigations, for a reasonable \n     time thereafter, where notice of the execution would have an \n     adverse result. (Sec. 213).\n\n International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing \n                        Act of 2001 (title III)\n\n       Title III of the bill is designed to impede the financing \n     of terrorist activities. It accomplishes that goal by \n     allowing the government to confiscate the assets of foreign \n     terrorist organizations, the terrorists themselves and those \n     who aid them. In addition, it allows the United States \n     government to restrain those assets after indictment but \n     before any final adjudication to ensure those assets are \n     available to satisfy a judgment of forfeiture.\n       Law enforcement must be able to ``follow the money'' in \n     order to identify and neutralize terrorist networks.\n       The bill gives law enforcement the ability to seize the \n     assets of terrorist organizations. In addition, criminal \n     liability is imposed on those who knowingly engage in \n     financial transactions--money laundering--involving the \n     proceeds of terrorist acts. In addition, financial \n     institutions are encouraged to participate in this endeavor \n     by providing civil\n\n[[Page S11056]]\n\n     liability immunity to financial institutions that disclose \n     suspicious activity. (Sec. 314). The bill further includes \n     financial institutions in this endeavor by requiring them to \n     have anti-money laundering programs. (Sec. Sec. 314, 352).\n       The bill would expand the scope of predicate money \n     laundering offenses to include providing material support for \n     terrorist organizations. (Sec. 301). These offenses would \n     further not be limited to conduct occurring within the United \n     States, as long as the tools of the offense are in or passed \n     through the United States. (Sec. Sec. 302, 377).\n       Various common banking problems are also addressed in the \n     bill, such as shell banks, correspondent accounts, and \n     concentration accounts. (Sec. Sec. 312, 313, 325). Treasury \n     would be authorized to order special measures be taken by \n     financial institutions where they are involved in such \n     accounts or other primary money laundering concerns. \n     (Sec. 311). Information would be made available as to such \n     crucial facts as the beneficial, as opposed to nominal, owner \n     of a bank account and minimum standards and policies would be \n     put into effect to deal with correspondent and concentration \n     accounts involving foreign persons. (Sec. Sec. 312, 313, 325, \n     326).\n       Employee references would be permitted to include reference \n     to suspicious activity by the employee without fear of \n     liability and other cooperation among financial institutions, \n     law enforcement, and regulatory authorities would be \n     encouraged. (Sec. Sec. 314, 330, 355).\n       These money laundering provisions are all subject to the \n     four-year sunset.\n\n                    Protecting the border (title IV)\n\n       The legislation expands the grounds for deeming an alien \n     inadmissible or deportable from the United States for \n     terrorist activity, provides for the mandatory detention of \n     aliens whom the Attorney General certifies pose a risk to the \n     national security, and facilitates information sharing within \n     the U.S. and with foreign governments. Current law allows \n     some aliens who are threats to the national security to enter \n     and remain in the United States. The provisions in the bill \n     correct those inadequacies and are necessary tools to prevent \n     detain and remove aliens who are national security threats \n     from the United States. The Attorney General would also have \n     the authority to detain suspected terrorists who are threats \n     to national security, as long as removal proceedings or \n     criminal charges are filed within 7 days. (Sec. 412). In the \n     rare cases where removal is determined appropriate but is not \n     possible, detention may continue upon a review by the \n     Attorney General every 6 months. (Sec. 412). The bill further \n     would expand the definition of terrorists for purpose of \n     inadmissibility or removal to include public endorsement of \n     terrorist activity or provision of material support to \n     terrorist organizations. (Sec. 411). The bill further expands \n     the types of weapons the use of which can be considered \n     terrorist activity. (Sec. 411).\n       The ability of alien terrorists to move freely across \n     borders and operate within the United States is critical to \n     their capacity to inflict damage on the citizens and \n     facilities in the United States. Under current law, the \n     existing grounds for removal of aliens for terrorism are \n     limited to direct material support of an individual \n     terrorist. The bill would expand these grounds for removal to \n     include material support to terrorist organizations. \n     (Sec. 412).\n       To address the need for better border patrol, additional \n     border patrol officers would be authorized, specifically on \n     the northern border which has, during the investigation into \n     the September 11th events, been shown to be extremely \n     problematic. (Sec. Sec. 401, 402). To aid INS agents, the FBI \n     would also be required to provide criminal records \n     information to those agents. (Sec. 403).\n       The bill addresses not only unwelcome suspected terrorist \n     aliens but also immigrants who may need additional \n     consideration to stay within the United States where their \n     loved ones were victims of terrorist activity. \n     (Sec. Sec. 421-428).\n\n        Removing obstacles to investigating terrorism (title V)\n\n       The bill authorizes the Attorney General and Secretary of \n     State to pay rewards related to terrorism investigations. It \n     also provides for the DNA data collection from those \n     convicted of terrorism offenses and the coordination of \n     Federal law enforcement agencies. (Sec. Sec. 501, 502, 503, \n     504).\n\n      Providing for victims and public safety officers (title VI)\n\n       The bill establishes procedures for expedited payment of \n     public safety officers involved in the prevention, \n     investigation, rescue or recovery efforts related to a \n     terrorist attack, as well as providing increases to the \n     Public Safety Officer Benefit Program. (Sec. Sec. 611-614).\n\n               Increased information sharing (title VII)\n\n       The bill would require information sharing among Federal, \n     State and Local law enforcement, thus, providing the \n     necessary full picture needed to address terrorism. \n     (Sec. 711).\n\nSubstantive criminal law/criminal procedure: Strengthening the criminal \n                   law against terrorism (title VIII)\n\n       These provisions reform substantive and procedural criminal \n     law to strengthen federal law enforcement's ability to \n     investigate, prosecute, prevent, and punish terrorist crimes. \n     There are substantial deficits in each of these areas which \n     impede or weaken our antiterrorism efforts.\n       We must make fighting terrorism a national priority in our \n     criminal justice system. Current law makes it easier to \n     prosecute members of organized crime than to crack down on \n     terrorists who can kill thousands of Americans in a single \n     day. The same is true of drug traffickers and individuals \n     involved in espionage--our laws treat these criminals and \n     those who aid and abet them more severely than terrorists.\n       Our investigation has found that wide terrorist networks, \n     not isolated individuals, are responsible for the September \n     11 attacks. Whether the members of these networks are in the \n     United States or in other countries, they and those who aid \n     them must be subject to the full force of our laws. Just as \n     the law currently regards those who harbor persons engaged in \n     espionage, the bill would make the harboring of terrorists a \n     criminal offense. The bill also increases the penalties for \n     conspiracy to commit terrorist acts to a serious level as \n     we have done for many drug crimes.\n\n                             Key Provisions\n\n       Removing impediments to effective prosecution--elimination \n     of statute of limitations for offenses creating the risk of \n     death or personal injury and extending the statute for all \n     other terrorism offenses to 8 years (Sec. 809).\n       Removing impediments to effective investigation--single \n     jurisdiction search warrants; expanded jurisdiction to \n     include terrorism against U.S. facilities abroad. (Sec. 804).\n       Strengthening substantive criminal law--prohibition on \n     harboring terrorists and on material support of terrorists \n     (Sec. Sec. 803, 805, 807); making terrorist crimes RICO \n     predicates (Sec. 813); extending powers of asset forfeiture \n     to terrorists' assets (Sec. 806); including altering \n     cyberterrorism offense (Sec. 814); expanding the offense of \n     possession of bioweapons (prohibiting possession of \n     biological toxins by felons and aliens) (Sec. 817); creating \n     a federal offense for attacking mass transportation systems \n     (Sec. 801); expanding definition of domestic terrorism and \n     offenses of the crime of terrorism, requiring a showing of \n     coercion of government as an element of the offense \n     (Sec. Sec. 802, 808).\n       Strengthening criminal penalties--longer prison terms and \n     postrelease supervision of terrorists (Sec. 812); higher \n     conspiracy penalties for terrorists (Sec. 811); alternative \n     maximum sentences up to life for terrorism offenses \n     (Sec. 810).\n\n                    Improved intelligence (title IX)\n\n       The bill authorizes the Director of the CIA to establish \n     requirements and provide for the collection of foreign \n     intelligence. The Director would also be asked to ensure \n     proper dissemination of foreign intelligence information. \n     Only if the appropriate officials have all the relevant \n     information will prevention, investigation, and prosecution \n     be fully functioning. The bill also would provide for the \n     tracking of terrorist assets as part of the collection of \n     information. (Sec. Sec. 901, 905).\n\n                        Miscellaneous (title X)\n\n       The bill would finally require the Department of Justice \n     Inspector General to designate an official to receive civil \n     liberty and civil rights complaints and report those \n     complaints to Congress. The presumption is that such \n     information will be used in determining the continuing \n     viability of the provisions in the bill subject to sunset in \n     2005.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Utah for his comments. Senator Hatch and I, over the last \ngeneration, have spent a great deal of time with each other on a many \nissues, on numerous committees, especially the Judiciary Committee. But \nwe have spent so much time together on this, we even appear to be \ncoordinating wardrobes with gray suits and blue shirts today. But I \nappreciate his help.\n  I appreciate so many who helped on crafting and moving forward with \nthis legislation. I thank our leader, Senator Daschle. It would have \nbeen impossible for us to be here at this point without his steadfast \ncommitment to the committee system and his willingness to have the \ncommittee work diligently to improve the legislation initially \npresented by the Administration. On my behalf and on behalf of the \nAmerican people, I want to publicly acknowledge his vital role in this \nlegislation. Senator Reid has also provided valuable counsel and \nassistance as we have moved first the original Senate USA Act, S. 1510, \nand now the House-passed bill, H.R. 3162.\n  Many others also helped us: Senator Hatch and Senator Specter and \nSenator Grassley and Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer, Senator Cantwell, \nand so many others on the Judiciary committee.\n  I said many times we are merely constitutional impediments to staff.\n  In particular, I want to thank Mark Childress and Andrea LaRue on the \nstaff of Majority Leader Daschle, and David Hoppe on the staff of \nRepublican Leader Lott. I would also like to thank Markan Delrahim, \nJeff Taylor, Stuart Nash, and Leah Belaire with Senator Hatch, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Melody Barnes and Esther \nOlavarria with Senator Kennedy, Neil McBride, and Eric Rosen with \nSenator Biden, Bob Schiff with Senator Feingold, and Stacy Baird and \nBeth Stein with Senator Cantwell. I also want to thank Bill Jensen of \nthe Legislative Counsel's office.\n  Finally, I would like to thank my own Judiciary Committee staff, \nespecially Bruce Cohen, Beryl Howell, Julie Katzman, Ed Pagano, John \nElliff, David James, Ed Barron, Tim Lynch, Susan Davies, Liz McMahon, \nManu Bhardwaj, and Tara Magner. These are people who are more than just \naccomplished Senate staffs, they are close personal friends.\n\n  I think of the way they have worked, also, with personal office staff \nsuch as Luke Albee, J.P. Dowd, David Carle, and others. These are dear \nfriends, but they are also people who bring such enormous expertise--\nexpertise they had in their other careers before they came to the \nSenate, and how helpful this is.\n  Mr. President, we are about to vote and we will vote in a matter of \nminutes. I want us to think just for a moment why we are here. We have \nall\n\n[[Page S11059]]\n\nshared the sadness, the horror of September 11. We are seeing Members \nof Congress and staffs threatened, tragic deaths in the Postal Service, \nthose who died in the Pentagon, those who died at the Twin Towers.\n  It is also almost a cliche to say America under attack, but that is \nwhat it is. Each of us has a job helping to respond to that. We are not \nRepublicans or Democrats in that, we are Americans preserving our \nNation and preserving our democracy. But, you know, we preserve it not \njust for today, we preserve it for the long run. That presents the kind \nof questions we have to answer in a bill such as this.\n  I suspect terrorist threats against the United States will exist \nafter all of us, all 100 of us, are no longer serving in the Senate. It \nis a fact of life. It will come from people who hate our democracy, \nhate our diversity, hate our success. But that doesn't mean we are \ngoing to stop our democracy, our diversity, or our success.\n  Think what we cherish in this Nation. Our first amendment, for \nexample, giving us the right to speak out about what we want--as we \nwant. How many countries even begin to give that freedom?\n  Also, in that same first amendment, the right to practice any \nreligion we want, or none if we want.\n  The leaders of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch and I, belong \nto different religions which we hold deeply. I think we gain a great \ndeal of inner strength from our respective faiths. But we know we are \nnot judged by our religion. That is something we must protect and hold. \nWe are judged by how well we do in representing our States and our \nNation.\n  Because we face terrible terrorist attacks today, we should not \nsuccumb tomorrow by giving up what makes us a great nation. That has \nbeen my benchmark throughout the work I have done in this bill.\n  I spoke of the people who bring so much to this. I was just talking \nwith Beryl Howell, a brilliant lawyer, who, with Bruce Cohen, has led \nour team on all this. She is a former prosecutor. How much she learned \nfrom her prior experiences and how much she brought here. Bruce Cohen, \nwho was in private practice and came here, probably is as knowledgeable \nabout Senate practice as anybody I know of, and he has brought that \nknowledge here. There are so many others I could name.\n  I have to think of my own case. Probably my 26 years here in the \nSenate, in many ways led up to this moment because I have never brought \nmore of my own experiences or knowledge to bear than on this.\n  There was a rush, an understandable and even, some may say, \njustifiable rush, to pass legislation immediately after these terrible \nevents. I understand that, the United States having been attacked \nwithin our borders for the first time, really, by an outside power \nsince the War of 1812--attacked terribly, devastatingly. Who can forget \nthe pictures we saw over and over again on television?\n  So I can understand the rush to do something, anything. But I used \nevery bit of credibility I had as a Senator to say, wait, let us take \ntime. I applaud people such as Senator Daschle who, using his great \npower as majority leader, said we will take the time to do this right, \nand backed me up on this. Other Senators from both sides of the aisle \nsaid, OK, let's work together.\n  I know the Senator from Utah shared the same anger that I did at the \nterrorists, and perhaps had been reluctant at first to join with me on \nthat. But then the Senator from Utah and I worked day and night, \nweekends, evenings, and everything else to put together the best \npossible bill.\n  We worked with our friends and our colleagues in both parties in the \nother body. Ultimately, we do nothing to protect America if we pass a \nbill which for short-term solutions gives us long-term pain by \ndestroying our Constitution or our rights as Americans.\n  There are tough measures in this legislation. Some may even push the \nenvelope to the extent that we worry. That is why we put in a 4-year \nsunset. We have also built in constitutional checks and balances within \nthe court system and within even some of the same agencies that will be \ngiven new enforcement powers. But we also will not forget our rights \nand responsibilities and our role as U.S. Senators.\n  We will not forget our role and our responsibilities as Senators to \ndo oversight. Senator Hatch and I are committed to that. We will bring \nthe best people from both sides of aisle, across the political \nspectrum, to conduct effective oversight.\n  I have notified Attorney General Ashcroft and Director Mueller that \nwe will do that to make sure these powers are used within the \nconstitutional framework to protect all of us. I said earlier on this \nfloor what Benjamin Franklin said: that the people who would trade \ntheir liberties for security and deserve neither.\n  We will enhance our security in this bill, but we will preserve our \nliberties. How could any one of us who have taken an oath of office to \nprotect the Constitution do otherwise?\n  Like the distinguished Presiding Officer, I have held different \nelective offices. As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, we take \nseriously our duties and our roles in each of those. He was a Member of \nthe House and was the Governor of one of the original 13 States. I was \na prosecutor and am a U.S. Senator from the 14th State. But all of us \ntake this responsibility, because none of us are going to be here \nforever.\n  I want to be able to look back at my time in the U.S. Senate and be \nable to tell my children, my grandchildren, and my friends and \nneighbors in Vermont--the State I love so much--that I came home having \ndone my best.\n  We have so much in this country--so much. But it is our rights and \nour Constitution that give us everything we have, which allows us to \nuse the genius of so many people who come from different backgrounds \nand different parts of the world. That makes us stronger. We become \nweak if we cut back on those rights.\n  We have had some difficult times in our Nation where we have not \nresisted the temptation to cut back. Here we have. The American people \nwill know that this Congress has worked hard to protect us with this \nbill.\n  I will vote for this legislation knowing that we will continue to do \nour duty, and to follow it carefully to make sure that these new powers \nare used within our Constitution.\n  I suggest that all time be yielded, and that we be prepared to vote. \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for himself and Mr. \n     Cochran, proposes an amendment numbered 1969.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate, the \nfiscal year 2002 appropriations bill for agriculture, rural \ndevelopment, the Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies. \nThis bill was approved by the Appropriations Committee without dissent, \nand I hope it will receive the support of all Senators. I believe this \nbill strikes an appropriate balance of programs, consistent with the \ninterests of Senators, to meet the needs of the farm sector, the \nenvironment, and rural America generally; nutrition assistance to our \nNation's most vulnerable citizens; provide adequate resources to the \nFood and Drug Administration for protection of our food supply and \nother aspects of public health; and to support other national and \ninternational priorities.\n  This bill provides $73.9 billion in new budget authority for both \nmandatory and discretionary programs under our subcommittee's \njurisdiction, and is within our 302(b) allocation. This bill is $2.8 \nbillion below the level provided for fiscal year 2001, and is $78 \nmillion below the President's request. Let me restate, this bill is \nbelow the President's request.\n  Although this bill is $2.8 billion below the level provided last \nyear, I should explain that the fiscal year 2001 bill included $3.6 \nbillion in emergency spending for natural disaster and market loss \nrelated assistance to farmers and rural communities. No emergency \nfunding is provided in the bill now before the Senate, and when \ncompared to the non-emergency spending for fiscal year 2001, we are \nproviding an increase of approximately $850,000. That amount represents \nan increase of slightly more than 1 percent from the previous year.\n  Before I go any further, I want to publicly thank my friend from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, ranking member on the Subcommittee, for \nhis help and guidance. I also want to thank his staff: Rebecca Davies, \nminority clerk for the subcommittee, Martha Scott Poindexter, and \nRachelle Schroder. Without their help and expertise, presentation of \nthis bill to the Senate today would not have been possible. I owe a \ngreat deal of gratitude to Senator Cochran and his staff, as do all \nSenators.\n  Mr. President, when someone refers to this bill simply as the \n``Agriculture'' appropriations bill, one might be left with the \nimpression that it relates only to programs important to the farming \ncommunity. While this bill does much to support our Nation's farmers, \nit also does much more. This bill provides substantial funding for \nagriculture research, including human nutrition research, \nbiotechnology, energy alternatives, and many other important areas of \ninquiry. It also provides increases in conservation programs that \nprotect our soil, water, and air resources, including examination of \nglobal change, and other critical aspects of environmental protection.\n  This bill also supports rural communities through economic \ndevelopment programs and assistance for basic needs such as housing, \nelectricity, safe drinking water and waste disposal systems, and to \nhelp move rural America into the information age by promoting new \ntechnologies in the area of telecommunications and internet services. \nMore and more, Americans are seeking relief from the congestion and \nsprawl of urban centers, and with the proper tools, rural America holds \ngreat promise for viable job opportunity alternatives. Programs in this \nbill do much to help rural communities provide the infrastructure \nnecessary to create those jobs.\n  In addition, funding in this bill supports many nutrition and public \nhealth related programs. These include the food stamp, school lunch, \nand other nutrition assistance programs such as the Women, Infants, and \nChildren program--WIC. This bill also provides funding for the Food and \nDrug Administration, which includes an increase for the Office of \nGeneric Drugs to help make lower cost medications available to \nAmericans as quickly as possible. Funding for the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and other agencies, included in this bill will also \nhelp guarantee that the food Americans eat is not only the most \nnutritious and affordable in the world, but that it is also the safest.\n\n  Assistance in this bill does not stop at our shores. This bill also \nincludes a number of international programs such as Public Law 480, \nwhich provide humanitarian food assistance to people in dire need \naround the world. This bill also supports international trade through a \nnumber of programs designed to open, maintain, and expand markets for \nU.S. production overseas.\n  Before I describe some of the specific program included in this bill, \nlet me offer a few observations in view of recent events. World \nheadlines this past year have described the devastation to the rural \nsector of the United Kingdom and other areas where foot and mouth \ndisease outbreaks have raged out of control. Should such outbreaks \noccur in this country, the effect to the farm sector, and the general \neconomy, would be staggering. Thankfully, this country has a strong set \nof safeguards to keep our shores safe from problems such as foot and \nmouth disease. But our safeguards are only as strong as the weakest \npart.\n  More recently, we all witnessed the horrific events of September 11. \nSuddenly, we were reminded that the significant concerns were held, in \nregard to accidental introductions of exotic pests and disease, may \npale in comparison to what could befall this country by design. This is \ntrue for protection of our food supply, and in order to ensure that our \npublic health system has the resources for immediate response to any \nthreat at any time.\n  Last week, events occurring in the United States Senate, itself, \nreminded us of the need to keep strong our nation's defenses in regard \nto public health and safety. This bill, with jurisdiction for the food \nand Drug Administration, the Food Safety Inspection\n\n[[Page S11061]]\n\nService, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, numerous \nresearch agencies, and other vital parts of government, place this bill \ndirectly on the front line for safety and security for the American \npeople.\n  Our determination is strong, and our commitment is steadfast. This \nsubcommittee is engaged in the struggle against terror, ignorance, and \ninjustice, and we will prevail.\n  We must stay ever vigilant, especially in view of our growing global \neconomy, and global exposure, to keep USDA, the FDA, and other relevant \nagencies alert and well prepared to meet the prospect of invasion by \nforeign pests and disease or threats conveyed by any other medium. We \ngive high deference to items important to national defense, and we must \nnot lose sight that many of the challenges to our border inspectors, \nanimal health experts, public health officials, and others play as \nimportant a role in our national defense as do those in our armed \nforces.\n\n  We on this subcommittee have engaged Secretary Veneman, Secretary \nThompson, and others in an ongoing dialogue so that we can do our best \nto understand what resources the various departments and agencies under \nthe jurisdiction of this subcommittee require. We will continue these \ndiscussions as the administration allocates supplemental resources \nalready provided by the Congress, and as we consider further \nappropriations actions.\n  As I stated at the outset, I believe this bill provides a proper \nbalance of priorities within the limitation of resources provided to \nthis subcommittee. I would like to highlight a few of the programs \nsupported by this bill:\n  This bill provides $2.305 billion for agricultural research \nactivities. This represents an increase of nearly $200 million above \nthe fiscal year 2001 level, and includes programs of the Agricultural \nResearch Service--the USDA-in house research agency; the Cooperative \nState Research, Education, and Extension Service, which supports the \nlong-standing State and Federal partnership in research and extension \nactivities; and other research agencies of the Department of \nAgriculture. This appropriated amount is in addition to the $120 \nmillion also available through the Initiative for Future Agriculture \nand Food Systems.\n  Agricultural production in this country is without parallel anywhere \nin the history of the world. Research has made that possible, and is \none of the most important investments we can make to assure that \nAmerican farmers continue that success and pass it on to the American \nconsumer. This bill continues important support for those efforts.\n  Regulatory and marketing activities at the Department of Agriculture \nare strongly supported by this bill, which includes $1.445 billion for \nfood safety inspection, animal and plant health safety programs, \noversight of marketing transparency and fairness, and other activities. \nThis level reflects an increase of nearly $100 million above the \nprevious year.\n  This bill also includes a number of programs that directly support \nthe farm sector. USDA farm credit serves the need of farmers in the \nacquisition and operations of farms all across this country. It should \nbe noted, that many of today's farmers are nearing retirement age and \nwithout USDA farm credit programs, it would be very difficult for many \nyoung farmers to acquire the capital necessary to enter into this \nimportant occupation of high up-front costs, and high risk. Farm \nprograms in this bill including farm credit, mediation, and the cost of \nsupporting local Farm Service Agency offices, are funded at $1.487 \nbillion, an increase of more than $200 million from last year.\n  Americans do not only benefit from the abundance and quality of \nproducts grown on the farm, they also benefit from the wise land \nstewardship practiced by farmers and ranchers. This bill provides $980 \nmillion for conservation programs. This funding, in large part, \nprovides support to Natural Resource Conservation Service staff, who \nprovide conservation technical assistance to farmers, ranchers, rural \ncommunities, and others at the local level. This bill also includes a \nnew account for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program, which will \nprovide assistance to repair the many water conservation structures \nlocated throughout the country that, due to age and condition, now pose \na risk to life and property.\n  This funding is also in addition to other conservation programs such \nas the Conservation Reserve Program and the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, which have been authorized as direct spending \nmeasures under the 1996 farm bill. This bill also allows the Secretary \nof Agriculture to transfer funds from a number of mandatory programs to \nprovide technical assistance for the Conservation Reserve Program in a \nway that does not detract from USDA's ability to provide discretionary \nconservation assistance for other ongoing natural resource needs.\n\n  It has often been noted that little of the general economic \nprosperity of the last decade made its way to rural America. This bill \nprovides $2.794 billion for rural development programs. This is an \nincrease of $318 million from the fiscal year 2001 level. Of this \namount, slightly more than $1 billion is for the Rural Community \nAdvancement Program, which includes the rural water and waste water \nloan and grants program, and is an increase of $243 million from last \nyear's level.\n  This bill also includes $35.8 billion for domestic food programs, the \nlargest single area of spending in this bill. These programs include \nthe Food Stamp Program and Child Nutrition Programs, such as the School \nLunch and School Breakfast Programs. In addition, this bill provides \n$4.247 billion for the WIC Program. This amount is an increase of $204 \nmillion from last year's level and $110 million above the amount \nrequested by the President.\n  In addition to support of domestic programs, funding in this bill \nalso helps the United States meet international challenges both in the \narea of promoting free trade, and our moral obligations to provide \nhumanitarian assistance. This bill provides $1.128 billion for foreign \nassistance and related programs, which is an increase of $38 million \nfrom the fiscal year 01 level. This amount includes an appropriation of \n$850 million for Public Law 480 Title II food donations, which is an \nincrease of $15 million.\n  Finally, this bill provides $1.217 billion for the Food and Drug \nAdministration, an increase of $119 million from last year's level. The \nFood and Drug Administration provides a vital service to all Americans \nin helping protect our food and blood supplies, to ensure the safety \nand availability of effective drugs and medical devices, and other \nactivities that affect American lives and health on a daily basis.\n  This overview presents only some highlights of programs included in \nthis appropriations bill. I believe we have a good bill and I want to \nagain thank my friend, and ranking member, Senator Cochran, for his \ninvaluable help in putting this bill together. I hope all Senators will \nsupport this bill.\n  I believe that we can, and we should, move quickly to pass this bill \nin the Senate. I know that in years past, controversial subjects have \ncome up when this bill has been on the floor, resulting in a number of \ndays being spent on its consideration. I hope that will not be the case \nthis year due, in part, to the recent tragic events which have occurred \nover the past six weeks, and the high state of urgency now before this \nCongress on other matters relating to a proper response to those \nevents.\n  I hope that we can follow the lead of Senator Dorgan when the \nTreasury and general government bill was on the floor earlier. Senator \nDorgan pointed out that there were certain amendments he had planned to \noffer which were of great importance to him, but due to their \ncontroversial nature, he deferred introduction of those amendments in \norder to ease the passage of that legislation. He was successful, and \nthat appropriations bill passed the Senate in one day.\n  I, too, have amendments I had considered offering on subjects \nimportant to me, the people of Wisconsin, and all Americans. However, I \nalso have chosen not to raise them at this time, and I hope all \nSenators will refrain, as Senator Dorgan and I have done on our \nrespective bills, to avoid any subjects that would result in \ncontroversial, divisive, and lengthy debate. I do not mean to suggest \nthat any Senator should not exercise any right he or she has, if the \nsentiment for that action is strong, but I do hope that consideration \nwill be given to refrain from actions that will unnecessarily delay or \nmake difficult the passage of this bill.\n\n[[Page S11062]]\n\n  Mr. President, at this time I turn to the Senator from Mississippi, \nMr. Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend from \nWisconsin in presenting this bill to the Senate today. I first want to \nthank him for his hard work and the work of his staff in helping to \ndraft the bill. It was a pleasure to work with him during the hearings \nwhen we heard from administration officials and others about the budget \nrequests of the President and the needs of the Department of \nAgriculture and the agencies that are funded in this legislation.\n  I am pleased to report that the amounts of discretionary spending \nrecommended in this bill are consistent with the subcommittee's \ndiscretionary spending allocations under the Budget Act. In way of \nsummary of some of the increases that are provided, I thought the \nSenate might be interested to know that the bill provides additional \nfunding over last year's levels to enhance food safety activities, \nquarantine inspection activities, and pest and disease control, \nincluding increased vigilance against the entry into this country of \nforeign animal diseases.\n  The amount recommended for the Agricultural Research Service, for \nexample, will provide enhanced funding for a number of priority \nresearch needs including emerging plant and animal diseases, genomics, \ncontrol of invasive weeds and insects, and the development of bio-based \nproducts from agricultural commodities.\n  In the case of the Cooperative State Research, Education, and \nExtension Service, funding increases are recommended for minor crop \npest management and sustainable agricultural research.\n  The Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources and Conservation \nService has total funding recommended, which includes increases for \nconservation operations. These are over and above the President's \nrequest for resource conservation and development programs and a \nwatershed rehabilitation program.\n  The Foreign Agricultural Service has an increase provided that will \nenable that agency to strengthen its market intelligence capabilities \nand to better address technical trade issues, particularly those \nrelated to food safety and biotechnology.\n  I am pleased that the bill contains an increase for the Rural \nCommunity Advancement Program, which is essential to supporting safe \ndrinking water supplies and waste disposal systems for rural Americans.\n  Let me point out also that in the case of the nutrition programs, the \ntotal appropriation recommended for the WIC Program is $204 million \nmore than the 2001 fiscal year level, and it is $110 million more than \nthe level requested by the President for this next fiscal year, 2002. \nThe increase was based on more recent data on projected program costs \nand participation levels at the time the Senate reported the bill. But \nsince then, there are indications that the WIC caseload has continued \nto increase with the steady increase in unemployment and that \nadditional funding may be required. I am committed to reexamine this \nissue in conference to ensure that WIC is adequately funded for fiscal \nyear 2002.\n  Let me also say that in the case of the Food and Drug Administration, \nthe President requested additional appropriations to cover pay \nincreases, to prevent mad cow disease, to enhance import inspections, \nto enhance adverse events reporting, and food safety activities. This \nbill recommends the full amount requested for these activities and also \nprovides increased funding for generic drugs, orphan products grants, \ndietary supplements, and gene therapy tracking.\n  Food safety continues to be a very high priority of this committee. \nThe bill provides the funds necessary to ensure that American consumers \ncontinue to have the safest food supply in the world. Not only does \nthis bill provide increased funds required for meat and poultry \ninspection activities of the Food Safety and Inspection Service, it \nincreases funding for food safety research and for FDA's food safety \nactivities.\n  So the bill accommodates increased funding to meet expected higher \nWIC participation levels, to control foreign animal diseases and pests, \nto provide rural Americans access to affordable housing and a safe \nwater supply, and to protect the safety of the Nation's food supply. It \nis essential for us to consider this expeditiously so we can get this \nbill to conference with the House and on to the President for his \nsignature.\n  I think Senators should be aware that we are continuing to assess \nsupplemental funding needs of various programs and activities included \nin this bill as a consequence of the terrorist attacks on our Nation.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, I am pleased to join my good friend from \nWisconsin in presenting for the Senate's consideration today the fiscal \nyear 2002 Agriculture, rural development, Food and Drug Administration, \nand related agencies appropriations bill.\n  This bill, as recommended to the Senate, provides fiscal year 2002 \nfunding for all programs and activities of the United States Department \nof Agriculture (with the exception of the Forest Service which is \nfunded by the Interior appropriations bill), the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  As reported, the bill recommends total new budget authority for \nfiscal year 2002 of $73.9 billion. This is $803 million more than the \nfiscal year 2001 enacted level, excluding emergency appropriations, and \n$78 million less than the President's fiscal year 2002 budget request.\n  Just over seventy-eight percent of the total $73.9 billion \nrecommended by this bill is for mandatory appropriations over which the \nAppropriations Committee has no effective control. The spending levels \nfor these programs are governed by authorizing statutes. These include \nnot only the payments to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for \nnet realized losses and fund the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, \nbut also appropriations for the Food Stamp and Child Nutrition \nPrograms.\n  Roughly 22 percent of the total appropriations recommended by the \nbill is for discretionary programs and activities. Including \ncongressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-year spending \nactions, this bill recommends total discretionary spending of $16.1 \nbillion in both budget authority and outlays for fiscal year 2002. \nThese amounts are consistent with the subcommittee's discretionary \nspending allocations under the Budget Act.\n  I would like to take a few moments to summarize the bill's major \nfunding recommendations. For the Food Safety and Inspection Service \n(FSIS), appropriations of $716 million are recommended, $21 million \nmore than the fiscal year 2001 level. This provides additional funding \nto enhance food safety activities and to cover pay and benefit cost \nincreases necessary to support the FSIS workforce, including \napproximately 7,600 meat and poultry inspectors.\n  For the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service responsible for \nagricultural quarantine inspection activities and pest and disease \ncontrol--including increased vigilance against the entry into this \ncountry of foreign animal disease, such as foot-and-mouth and ``mad \ncow'' disease--$608 million is recommended. This is an increase of $64 \nmillion from the 2001 level.\n  Appropriations for USDA headquarters operations and for other \nagriculture marketing and regulatory programs are approximately $52 \nmillion more than the fiscal year 2001 appropriations levels. Included \nin this increase is $19 million for information technology investments \nin support of the Department's Service Center Modernization Initiative; \nand additional $5 million to support the Department of Agriculture's \nbuildings and facilities and rental payments' requirements; and a $10 \nmillion increase for the costs of the Census of Agriculture.\n  For programs needed to meet the credit needs of farmers, the bill \nfunds an estimated $3.9 billion total loan level, $800 million more \nthan last year's level. The amount recommended includes $1.1 billion \nfor farm ownership loans and $2.6 billion for farm operating loans.\n  Total appropriations of $1.2 billion are recommended for salaries and \nexpenses of the Farm Service Agency. This is $121 million more than the \n2001 level and the same as the President's budget request. The \nadditional funding\n\n[[Page S11063]]\n\nwill support Farm Service Agency staffing levels essential to keep pace \nwith heavy county office workload demands due to a weakened farm \neconomy.\n  The bill provides total appropriations of $2.1 billion for \nagriculture research, education, and extension activities. Included in \nthis amount is an increase of $26 million from fiscal year 2001 for \nAgriculture Research Service (ARS) buildings and facilities; an \nincrease of $108 million of research activities of the ARS; and a $40 \nmillion increase in funding for the Cooperative State Research, \nEducation, and Extension Service.\n  The amount recommended for the Agricultural Research Service will \ncontinue support for essential ongoing research activities and provide \nenhanced funding for a number of priority research needs, including \nthose focused on emerging exotic plant and animal diseases, genomics, \ncontrol of invasive weeds and insects, and the development of biobased \nproducts from agricultural commodities.\n  The recommended funding for the Cooperative State Research, \nEducation, and Extension Service includes a $1.4 million reduction \nbelow the fiscal year 2001 level for special research grants; increases \nof $1.0 million for minor crop pest management and $3.8 million for \nsustainable agriculture research and education; and total funding of \n$137 million, a $31.2 million increase, for the National Research \nInitiative competitive grants program. Appropriations for formula \nprograms, including the Smith-Lever, Hatch Act, and McIntire-Stennis \nprograms, are maintained at the 2001 funding levels.\n  For conservation programs administered by USDA's Natural Resources \nConservation Service, total funding of $980 million is provided, $73 \nmillion more than the 2001 level and $52 million more than the \nPresident's request. Included in this amount is $802 million for \nconservation operations, $48 million for the resource conservation and \ndevelopment program, $10 million for a new watershed rehabilitation \nprogram, and $7.8 million for the Forestry Incentives Program.\n  USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service is funded at a program level of \n$126 million, $6 million more than the fiscal year 2001 level and the \nsame as the budget request. The increase provided will enable the \nagency to strengthen its market intelligence capabilities overseas and \nto better address technical trade issues, particularly those related to \nfood safety and biotechnology.\n  In addition, total appropriations of $1 billion are recommended for \nthe Public Law 480 program, $31 million more than the fiscal year 2001 \nand budget request levels. This includes $159.3 million for Title I \ncredit sales, and $850 million for donations of humanitarian food \nassistance overseas under Title II of the program.\n  The bill also provides total appropriations of $2.8 billion for rural \neconomic and community development programs, along with a total loan \nauthorization level of $10 billion. Included in this amount is $1 \nbillion for the Rural Community Advancement Program essential to \nsupporting safe drinking water supplies and waste disposal systems for \nrural Americans; $47 million for the Rural Business-Cooperative \nService; first-time funding for rural broadband telecommunications and \ntelevision loans; and $42 million to support a total $4.6 billion \nprogram level for rural electric and telecommunications loans.\n\n  In addition, the bill devotes additional resources to those programs \nwhich provide affordable, save, and decent housing for low-income \nindividuals and families living in rural America. Estimated rural \nhousing loan authorizations funded by this bill total $4.5 billion, a \nnet increase of $32 million from the fiscal year 2001 level. Included \nin this amount is $4.2 billion for section 502 low-income housing \ndirect and guaranteed loans and $114 million for section 515 rental \nhousing loans. In addition, $709 million is included for the rental \nassistance program. This is $15 million more than the budget request to \nprovide sufficient funds to meet contract renewal requirements, and $30 \nmillion more than the 2001 appropriations level.\n  Appropriations totaling $35.8 billion, just over 48 percent of the \ntotal $73.9 billion recommended by the bill, will support our nation's \nnutrition assistance programs. This includes $10.1 billion for child \nnutrition programs, including the school lunch and breakfast programs; \n$4.2 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, \nInfants, and Children (WIC); $140 million for the commodity assistance \nprogram; $151 million for the needy family and elderly feeding food \ndonations programs; and $21.1 billion for the food stamp program.\n  The total appropriation recommended for the WIC program is $204 \nmillion more than the 2001 level and $110 million more than the level \nrequested by the President for fiscal year 2002. The increase \nrecommended was based on more recent data on projected program costs \nand participation levels at the time the Senate reported the bill. \nHowever, since then, there are indications that WIC caseload has \ncontinued to increase with the steady rise in unemployment and that \nadditional funding may be required. I am committed to reexamine this \nissue in conference to ensure that WIC is adequately funded for fiscal \nyear 2002.\n  For those independent agencies funded by the bill, the committee \nprovides total appropriations of $1.3 billion, $122 million more than \nthe 2001 level. Included in this amount is $70.4 million for the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission and $1.2 billion for the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA). The bill also establishes a limitation of \n$36.7 million on administrative expenses of the Farm Credit \nAdministration.\n  For salaries and expenses of the FDA, the bill recommends a total \nincrease of $129 million from the 2001 appropriations level. The \nPresident requested additional appropriations to cover pay cost \nincreases; to prevent bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or ``mad \ncow'' disease); to enhance import coverage and inspections; to increase \nthe protection of human subjects in clinical trials; to cover \nrelocation costs and begin the acquisition of a new financial \ninformation system; and to enhance adverse events reporting and food \nsafety activities. The bill recommends the full amount requested for \nthese activities, and also provides increased funding for generic \ndrugs, orphan product grants, dietary supplements, and gene therapy \ntracking.\n  Food safety continues to be a high priority of this committee. This \nbill, as recommended to the Senate, provides the funds necessary to \nensure that American consumers continue to have the safest food supply \nin the world. Not only does this bill provide increased funds required \nfor meat and poultry inspection activities of the Food Safety and \nInspection Service, it increases funding for food safety research and \nfor FDA's food safety activities.\n  Mr. President, again, only 22 percent of the total \nfunding recommended by this bill is for discretionary programs subject \nto annual control through the appropriations process. As I indicated \nearlier, this bill accommodates increased funding to meet expected \nhigher WIC participation levels, to control foreign animal diseases and \npests, to provide rural Americans access to affordable housing and a \nsafe water supply. To protect the safety of the Nation's food supply, \nand many other pressing program needs.\n\n  Mr. President, this bill was passed by the House of Representatives \non July 11, 2001. It was reported to the Senate by the Committee on \nAppropriations on July 18, 2001. Appropriations for programs and \nactivities covered by the bill are now being provided through a \ncontinuing resolution. It is essential that the Senate complete its \nconsideration of this bill so that we can conference it with the House \nand get a bill to the President.\n  At the same time we work to complete action on the regular \nappropriations bill, Senators should be aware that we are continuing to \nassess the supplemental funding needs of various programs and \nactivities included in this bill as a consequence of the terrorist \nattacks on our Nation.\n  Let me close by thanking my staff members who have been identified by \nSenator Kohl. I also thank his staff. We worked together in a spirit of \nbipartisanship, to be sure that the needs and interests of all Senators \nthat have been brought to our attention are taken under serious \nconsideration. I hope we have been able to meet the needs that have \nbeen pointed out to the committee during our work on this bill. We are \nprepared to defend this bill.\n\n[[Page S11064]]\n\n  There are some suggested amendments about which we have heard. As a \nmatter of fact, we have a list about two pages long. Most of these are \nacceptable, I am happy to say, but there are a few that are not. I hope \nSenators who do have amendments that we have indicated we will not be \nable to support will refrain from offering them so we can get on to \nfinal passage of the bill and move this legislation along to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Kohl and Senator Cochran \nfor their extraordinary cooperation and leadership on this Agriculture \nappropriations bill which funds the commodity and income support \nprograms for farmers. It funds conservation programs, crop insurance, \nregulatory programs ensuring market competitiveness, rural development \ninitiatives, value-added projects, agricultural research and security \npriorities, trade promotion initiatives, food safety, drug and medical \nservices, and nutritional programs administered by the Department of \nAgriculture and the Food and Drug Administration. This bill contains \n$74.121 billion for these imperative programs which benefit all \nAmericans.\n  There is a lot of focus obviously here on farmers and ranchers, \nunderstandably so. Over half of the funding for these programs, in \nfact, goes for nutritional programs which benefit particularly low-\nincome people as well as students all over America.\n  This important appropriations legislation, of course, is separate \nfrom the farm bill debate which we hope to have on the floor of the \nSenate this year. The current farm bill expires next year. It is our \nhope to have a new farm bill in place--perhaps this year but certainly \nearly on next year if this year it is not possible. It will be \ncritically important that the Congress capitalize upon the resources \nthat are provided in this appropriations bill and in the budget \nresolution to ensure farmers, ranchers, and rural communities that \nthey, in fact, have an opportunity to prosper and to compete in the \nyears ahead.\n  I am proud to serve on the Agriculture Subcommittee which crafted \nthis product which has come to us in such an excellent bipartisan \nfashion. This Agriculture appropriations bill provides very timely \nfunding for the Department of Agriculture's guaranteed and direct loan \nprograms for farmers and ranchers, as well as beginning operators.\n  It provides almost $4 million for State mediation grants. This is an \narea that has been of particular concern to me because of multiple \nyears of income stress in farm country.\n  We have needed less litigation and more coming together to try to \ndevise ways for family farmers and ranchers to have an opportunity to \nstay on the farm and to pay their debts but to do so outside of long, \nprotracted legal proceedings. The mediation grants program has been a \nproven success. It has now been reauthorized through the year 2005 \nbecause of legislation I authored last year allowing agricultural \nproducers to sort through their disputes with creditors and with USDA \nagencies without costly litigation.\n  Additionally, this legislation provides funding for our ongoing \nconservation efforts and programs that compensate farmers while \npreventing soil erosion and providing valuable habitat for wildlife. \nThis Senate bill provides about $985 million for discretionary \nconservation programs administered by the Department of Agriculture--\nnearly $30 million more than is contained in our counterpart in the \nother body, the House of Representatives.\n  Agricultural research extension and education is another winner in \nthis bill. Those programs are central to a strong production in the \nagricultural industry in my home State of South Dakota and across the \nNation.\n  The Senate bill contains $2.3 billion for four USDA agencies to \nsupport these activities. Moreover, our bill includes over $1 billion \nfor the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, \nwhich is $32 million more than the House bill. Many new value-added and \nbioenergy research projects that benefit farmers, and which will \nbenefit our Nation ultimately, are funded through these programs \ncarried out by our land grant universities all over the United States, \nincluding specifically South Dakota State University.\n  Protecting our Nation's crops, livestock, and overall food and fiber \nsystem from pests, diseases, and new bioterrorist threats is, again, \none of the issues that is addressed in this key legislation.\n  Given the recent and very real bioterrorist attacks on the people of \nthe United States, including in this very Capitol complex, I am also \nconcerned that our Nation's food and fiber systems may be vulnerable to \nbioterrorism. A host of factors make our crop, livestock, and food \nsupplies potentially susceptible to the introduction of a bioterror \nthreat, such as livestock disease, crop fungus, or foodborne illness. \nOur research facilities and land grant colleges are in great need of \nemergency funding to boost security and accelerate research to protect \nour agricultural industry and to protect our Nation as a whole. This \nbill provides appropriate funding levels for these facilities given the \ntiming of committee action, but we may need to consider additional \nemergency funding to boost security and research in these important \nlabs.\n  Second, our border inspections need to be dramatically increased, and \ngreater security needs to be placed on imports of commodities, \nlivestock, carcasses, food ingredients, and ready-to-eat food items. \nLess than 1 percent of imported food currently undergoes inspection by \nFederal officials. Given the new set of circumstances that we face \nregarding anthrax and bioterror, this must change, and it needs to \nchange with great urgency.\n  Additionally, many of the major livestock feeding and processing \nareas are concentrated in certain regions of our Nation. The \nintroduction of a biosecurity threat such as foot and mouth disease \ncould, in fact, spread rapidly in these areas and would create \nhorrendous problems for the livestock health and economic viability.\n  Finally, and perhaps most disturbing, Federal agencies, including \nUSDA, APHIS, FSIS, Customs, HHS, and the Food and Drug Administration, \nresponsible for protecting our food and fiber system do not adequately \ncoordinate their efforts, nor do they effectively communicate among \neach other or with the agricultural industry or the public. Therefore, \nI believe it is going to be imperative that we establish a crisis \ncommunications and education strategy with respect to bioterrorist \nthreats to our food supply.\n  My good friend and colleague, Senator Hagel from Nebraska, and I are \nworking on legislation which we believe complements and coordinates the \nefforts I have referred to here. And the funding made available through \nthis legislation, in fact, will be an important part of that overall \nstrategy.\n  I believe this bill takes significant steps to boost current efforts \nto begin new initiatives to protect American agriculture from harm. I \nthank the chairman and the ranking member in particular for that \neffort.\n  Now more than ever, ensuring economic security in rural America means \nthat emphasis has to be placed upon initiatives that serve to enhance \nthe well-being of rural communities throughout our Nation. Rural \ndevelopment programs within USDA target financial loan and grant \nresources to value-added agricultural projects, telecommunications, and \nbroadband services, telemedicine, distance learning, rule housing, and \nrural electric systems.\n  The Senate bill devotes almost $2.8 billion to rural development. It \nis a great amount of investment to these important programs. Again, \nthese are programs that will make the difference literally between \ncommunities that prosper and communities that die away and that wither \naway in our rural development programs. This legislation provides $300 \nmillion more for this array of rural development initiatives than is \nfound in the legislation of our counterpart, the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  So in area after area, I believe the Ag Appropriations Subcommittee \nand the\n\n[[Page S11065]]\n\nAppropriations Committee as a whole have done very well for our Nation, \nfor our farmers and ranchers, for our consumers, for the economic \nvitality of the entire fabric of our country. I applaud the \nbipartisanship and the thoughtful work that went into the production of \nthis appropriations bill.\n  It is my hope that we will reach an opportunity for final passage on \nthis bill still today. It is an excellent piece of legislation. I \napplaud all who participated and worked so hard to create this quality \npiece of appropriations legislation.\n  I yield back, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1970 Through 1975, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, at this time I have a series of amendments \nwhich I send to the desk that are technical in nature and have the \napproval of the ranking member. These amendments are offered on behalf \nof the managers of the bill. They are: An amendment regarding \nconditions for transfers of funds; an amendment regarding extraneous \nlanguage in the 1994 Endowment Fund account; an amendment regarding \nempowerment zones and enterprise communities; an amendment regarding \nrural utilities programs; an amendment regarding distance learning and \ntelemedicine; and an amendment regarding administration of rural \nutility programs.\n  I offer this series of amendments en bloc, and I urge their adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for himself and Mr. \n     Cochran, proposes amendments numbered 1970 through 1975, en \n     bloc.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of all of our \ncolleagues that this, hopefully, is the last bill we will consider this \nweek, and when we finish this bill we could look forward to being out \nfor the balance of the week. So when that occurs depends upon my \ncolleagues and their willingness to come to this Chamber to bring any \namendments to our attention they may have.\n  At this time, I am aware of one amendment that I know is going to \ncome to the floor. I am not aware of what other amendments may come to \nthe floor, but whatever they are, it is clearly in our common interest \nto get those amendments over here at this time so we can consider them.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield to Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my two friends, the managers of the bill, Senator \nDaschle has announced that if we finish this bill tonight, we will not \nbe in tomorrow. If we do not finish the bill tonight, we will be in \ntomorrow with votes.\n  We do not have the ability to communicate the way we normally do by \nrunning hotlines because some people cannot be in their office to \nreceive them. So this is the notice that everyone will get: People have \nto come over and present their amendments or the managers will have no \nalternative but to move forward on the bill.\n  We want to be as agreeable, as considerate to everyone as we can, but \nthere is an effort to complete this bill as soon as we can.\n  So, I repeat, this is everyone's notice that if you have an \namendment, this is the time to offer it. If you cannot come over \nphysically, you have to call the cloakroom and tell them you have an \namendment and give the subject matter of the amendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I see my colleagues on the floor are ready to proceed. \nI defer to my senior colleague, Senator Levin, from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1978\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senators Murray, Cantwell, Stabenow, Schumer, Leahy, \nSnowe, Collins, Clinton, Kerry, Jeffords, and Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Schumer, \n     Mr. Leahy, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Jeffords, and Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 1978.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide market loss assistance for apple producers)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. MARKET LOSS ASSISTANCE FOR APPLE PRODUCERS.\n\n       (a) Assistance Available.--The Secretary of Agriculture \n     shall use the funds, facilities, and authorities of the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation, in an amount not to exceed \n     $150,000,000, to make payments, as soon as practicable after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, to apple producers to \n     provide relief for the loss of markets during the 2000 crop \n     year.\n       (b) Payment Quantity.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the payment \n     quantity of apples for which the producers on a farm are \n     eligible for payments under this section shall be equal to \n     the quantity of the 2000 crop of apples produced by the \n     producers on the farm.\n       (2) Maximum quantity.--The payment quantity of apples for \n     which the producers on a farm are eligible for payments under \n     this section shall not exceed 5,000,000 pounds of apples \n     produced on the farm.\n       (c) Limitations.--Subject to subsection (b)(2), the \n     Secretary shall not establish a payment limitation, or gross \n     income eligibility limitation, with respect to payments made \n     under this section.\n\n[[Page S11066]]\n\n       (d) Applicability.--This section applies only with respect \n     to the 2000 crops of apples and producers of that crop.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment will assist apple farmers \nwho have suffered terrible losses in our Nation from fire blight and \nother weather-related and economic damage. It has broad bipartisan \ncosponsorship. In our State alone, apple farmers have suffered huge \ncrop losses and damage due to several hailstorms which caused thousands \nand thousands of acres of apple trees to be affected by fire blight. \nFire blight is a bacterium that has destroyed fruit trees across \nMichigan and across the country. Experts at Michigan State University \nanticipate that a quarter of our apple farmers have trees that are \nafflicted by fire blight and that then makes them susceptible to \nweather-related disasters. Many of our best apple producers have had \ndisastrously reduced production and decreased revenues for a number of \nyears. This amendment would provide vital assistance, not just in our \nState of Michigan but for apple producers who suffered losses due to \nfire blight or other weather-related disasters.\n  Much of the loss to apple growers is done to weather-related \ndisasters, but unfair trade practices have also played an important \nrole in this decline of the apple industry in this country. The \nDepartment of Commerce ruled in 1999 that China had dumped apple juice \nconcentrate in the United States and that dumping is still causing the \nsuffering of farmers and apple growers because of those unfair trade \npractices.\n  The unfair trade practices could not have come at a worse time for \nour Nation's apple growers who, according to the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, have lost about $1.5 billion over the past 5 years, \nincluding $500 million last year alone, due to a variety of factors \nincluding diseases such as fire blight.\n  In addition to the large number of colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who have cosponsored this amendment, the United States Apple \nAssociation and the American Farm Bureau Federation recognize the dire \nsituation facing our apple growers, and both of these organizations \nhave written to a number of Senators, voicing their support for this \nmuch-needed relief.\n  I ask unanimous consent these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins and Senator Levin: The American Farm \n     Bureau Federation supports your efforts to add $150 million \n     for market loss assistance for apple producers to the FY02 \n     agriculture spending bill.\n       This is the third consecutive year that apple growers have \n     had to survive low prices caused by a flood of imports. \n     Without assistance, American producers will continue to go \n     out of business, the jobs the industry supports will be lost, \n     and the safe and reliable domestic supply of fruit will \n     disappear.\n       Many in Congress already understand and support the need \n     for assistance. The Senate Agriculture Committee passed an \n     agriculture emergency package that contained $150 million for \n     apple producers earlier this summer. Unfortunately, apple \n     producers were left out of the final package that was signed \n     into law.\n       The FY 02 spending bill passed by the House contains $150 \n     million in emergency assistance for apple producers. Farm \n     Bureau believes that apple assistance should also be included \n     in the Senate bill. Inclusion in both bills will assure that \n     the assistance will reach producers quickly.\n       Thank you for your work on behalf of our nation's apple \n     producers. Farm Bureau stands ready to assist you in your \n     effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       U.S. Apple Association,\n\n                                      McLean, VA, October 1, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: The U.S. Apple Association (US Apple) \n     strongly supports your efforts to garner $150 million in \n     much-needed emergency market loss assistance for America's \n     apple growers.\n       Our nation's apple growers are experiencing the worst \n     economic losses in more than 70 years, having lost $1.5 \n     billion since 1996 and $500 million last year. Unfairly \n     priced imports of apple juice concentrate, excessive \n     regulatory costs, stagnant domestic consumption, food retail \n     consolidation, subsidized foreign competition, diminished \n     exports and global overproduction have all contributed to the \n     devastating economic conditions confronting apple producers.\n       Apple growers have invested heavily in efforts to reverse \n     their economic plight, and are not seeking establishment of a \n     permanent direct assistance program. As losses continue to \n     mount, however, as many as 30 percent of America's apple \n     growers will lose their farms without this much needed ad-hoc \n     assistance.\n       As you know, the House-approved agricultural appropriations \n     bill for fiscal 2002 includes $150 million in market loss \n     assistance for apple growers.

Jackson)\n\n       Options for apple growers whose farms were devastated by \n     fire blight last year are not good, experts agree. For all \n     growers, prices continue to be disastrous.\n       ``Prices are considerably below the cost of production,'' \n     said Tom Butler, manager of Michigan Processing Apple \n     Growers. ``Last year was the third year in a row they've been \n     through tough economic times.''\n       Hard times are expected to continue, he said, because apple \n     juice concentrate imports from Argentina, China and Chile \n     continue at below $5 per gallon. Also, there's domestic \n     competition to worry about.\n       ``Washington state continues to be a real competitor in \n     selling fresh applies at low prices, and they're using big \n     promotions,'' he said. ``That makes it difficult to get our \n     apples, particularly red delicious, into the marketplace.''\n       The general state of depression in the apple industry is \n     worse in southwestern Michigan, where fire blight led to a \n     federal disaster aid program, a market loss assistance \n     program and a tree replacement program. But farmers are still \n     waiting for money from those promises, said Mark Longstroth, \n     Michigan State University (MSU) District Extension \n     horticultural and marketing agent in the Van Buren County \n     office.\n       ``That aid was supposed to come in January, but it's stuck \n     in Washington (D.C.),'' he said. ``Complaining to your local \n     FSA (Farm Service Agency) office won't help. Complain to your \n     legislators.''\n       While farmers wait for disaster aid, Longstroth said he's \n     been telling growers who uprooted significant chunks of apple \n     tree acreage to plant alfalfa this year.\n       ``Don't be in such a big hurry to replant apples,'' he \n     said. ``Lease the ground for soybeans or corn, or plant \n     alfalfa to help amend the soil. That might give a grower the \n     best opportunity to look at what apple varieties might be \n     best if he wants to replant trees in a year or two.''\n\n[[Page S11067]]\n\n       Rumors that many apple farmers are considering vegetable \n     crops on the vacant ground concerns vegetable growers in the \n     area who already face tight margins.\n       ``I have no problem with them growing vegetables if they're \n     already growing them,'' said Ron Goldy, MSU Extension \n     district vegetable agent for southwestern Michigan. ``They \n     already have established relationships in the market chain. \n     They'll talk to their brokers to decide if they can produce \n     five to 10 more acres,'' he said. ``But if they don't have \n     those relationships and they try to get into vegetables, \n     there's potentially no place to send their crops. I'd say \n     that they're better off renting the ground and maybe getting \n     $50 an acre for corn or soybeans. Or, there's nothing wrong \n     with the ground being vacant for awhile.''\n       Other potential solutions for southwestern Michigan apple \n     growers seem to have dried up. Rumors that Lawton's Welches' \n     plant and parent company National Grape Cooperative was \n     seeking more grape growers aren't true.\n       ``We were looking for more grape ground, but the board of \n     directors cancelled that call,'' said John Jasper, the co-\n     op's area manager for Michigan. ``We did pick up some apple \n     acreage over the last few years, so our needs are filled \n     right now.''\n       For apple growers who hope to survive last year's fire \n     blight problems this year, the recommendation from MSU is to \n     refrain from nitrogen fertilizer, prune oozing cankers and \n     pray for cool spring weather.\n       The waiting game might be a good one to play as well, \n     Longstroth said. Nurseries are having trouble meeting demand \n     for replacement trees, and a wait might help growers know \n     what they should or should not plant in a year or two.\n       Tart cherries the tart cherry industry is not great, but \n     there is light at the end of the tunnel, said Phil Korson, \n     with the Cherry Marketing Institute in DeWitt.\n       ``We feel that a great opportunity for us is in cherry \n     juice. It's a huge market to capture, it uses a lot of \n     cherries and it gives consumers the cherry's anti-\n     inflammatory properties in the most natural way,'' he said.\n       Value-added products like that have been emphasized by the \n     Institute for a number of years, Korson said.\n       ``We've worked on things from brandy to beers, to dried \n     cherries and nutraceuticals,'' he said. ``That's a real \n     opportunity for the future, and we have ongoing projects at \n     MSU and in Texas. Amway Corp., (A Michigan-based company) \n     plans to go to clinical trials this year to extract anti-\n     inflammatory properties from cherries. The work originally \n     done at MSU was to identify compounds that have anti-\n     inflammatory properties. The second part is the technology \n     used to extract those properties. Those were licensed by \n     Amway, and this year they bought balaton cherries (a variety \n     new to the state) to extract those properties, and they'll \n     take that to clinical trials within the next year.''\n       Promotion of cherries as a beneficial food has been part of \n     what brought the tart cherry industry out of its near \n     disastrous overproduction just a few years ago. And while the \n     2000 crop was up--and prices down--a promotion program in \n     Europe, along with health promotions to boost domestic sales \n     and more than 50 million pounds in sales to the school lunch \n     program is bringing back strong optimism.\n       ``I think there's a lot of optimism in the cherry market \n     today,'' Korson said. ``We've invested heavily in research in \n     Mexico, Japan and Europe, and we look in the future to expand \n     that network to Korea, Taiwan, Turkey and Poland, to name a \n     few. There will be years when we'll have too much fruit, but \n     there are ways to offset that. Among them are expansion of \n     value-added products for the cherry industry, and marketing \n     the health benefits of cherries globally.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the New York Times, New York, NY, June 23, 2001]\n\n                Where Apples Don't Pay, Developers Will\n\n                         (By Lisa W. Foderaro)\n\n       MILTON, N.Y.--In their sun-drenched orchard here in Ulster \n     County, where the McIntosh and Red Delicious apples are still \n     the size of cherries, father and son should be a whirlwind of \n     activity this time of year: spraying and thinning the trees \n     at Hudson Valley Farms, lining up labor for harvest.\n       Instead, they will let the fruit fall to the ground this \n     fall. And they are spending their days indoors, in dry \n     contract negotiations with housing developers for the sale of \n     all 650 acres of their orchards--preparing the obituary, in \n     essence, of a family business that stretches back to the \n     1920's.\n       ``This is the first time in my life that I have not had a \n     crop to tend to,'' said Bill Palladino, 58, who owns Hudson \n     Valley Farms with his son, Jeff, 31. ``It's definitely a \n     naked feeling. You get emotionally attached to your trees, \n     your orchards, your way of life. You miss that.''\n       That is becoming a familiar refrain in Ulster County, the \n     second largest apple-producing county in a state that is \n     second only to Washington in apple production. Decisions like \n     the Palladinos' reflect enormous changes here and for \n     struggling apple growers around the country.\n       After several years of losing money in a depressed market \n     that has devastated apple farmers nationwide, the Palladinos \n     and at least five other growers in the county are selling \n     out. They are taking advantage of the wave of suburban sprawl \n     lapping at the edges of this county 75 miles north of \n     Manhattan.\n       In the process, a county where bosky ridges and clear \n     creeks always seemed a safe distance from the city, a place \n     where understated hamlets have captivated permanent residents \n     and weekenders alike, is wondering what the shriveling of the \n     apple industry will bring.\n       ``It's a big concern--that all this green space will be \n     turned into development,'' said Suzanne Hauspurg, who, with \n     her husband, Dan, owns the Inn at Stone Ridge. Trying to \n     protect their corner of Eden, the two recently bought a 110-\n     acre apple orchard behind their inn that a builder had been \n     considering.\n       The apple growers here are not cashing in so much as they \n     are staving off financial ruin. They say that money that \n     arrived last week from the federal government, part of \n     nationwide program to compensate growers for market losses \n     with a maximum payment of $28,295, represents a tiny bandage \n     when what they need is a tourniquet. Some are equally \n     unimpressed with a state program that helps counties buy \n     development rights from farmers but that has yet to produce \n     any final agreements that would keep Ulster land in \n     agriculture.\n       Since the early 1990's, farmers across the country have \n     suffered as production costs have risen and apple prices have \n     fallen: the result of a worldwide glut of apples, imports \n     of cheap apple-juice concentrate from China, and a \n     continuing consolidation among retailers that reduces \n     farmers' bargaining power. In addition, countries like \n     South Africa, Chile and New Zealand have emerged as major \n     exporters of fresh apples to the United States.\n       Last year, the United States International Trade Commission \n     voted unanimously to put punitive antidumping duties on apple \n     juice concentrate from China. But some growers say Chinese \n     concentrate is still cheaper than American, even with the \n     imposition of the 52 percent duty.\n       ``Not since the Great Depression have apple growers \n     sustained such losses,'' said Kraig Naasz, president and \n     chief executive officer of the United States Apple \n     Association in McLean, Va. He said that nationwide, apple \n     farmers have lost $1.5 billion in the past five years. ``This \n     coming harvest may mark the last for as many as 30 percent of \n     the nation's apple growers,'' he said.\n       In the Hudson Valley, insult was added to the national \n     economic conditions by catastrophic hail storms that wiped \n     out a third of the apple crop last year. The year before, a \n     damaging hurricane punctuated a summer of drought in which \n     farmers spent copiously to irrigate their orchards.\n       The for-sale signs popping up across Ulster County's \n     orchards are not new, but they mark a startling acceleration \n     of a trend that began more than a decade ago. In 1985, 104 \n     farms covered 11,629 acres in Ulster County. By the end of \n     1996, the most recent year for which statistics are \n     available, the number of farms had fallen to 63 on 8,632 \n     acres.\n       Apple farming has continued to dwindle since then, with \n     production ending on more than 1,500 acres in the last year \n     alone.\n       ``You could probably call most growers, and they've got \n     pieces of land up for sale,'' said Michael J. Fargione, an \n     educator with Cornell Cooperative Extension, a program of \n     Cornell University that provides research information and \n     educational programs to farmers. ``I'm not sure people are \n     aware of the critical point we're at in terms of the \n     potential for the loss of farms.''\n       Most of the remaining orchards are particularly attractive \n     to developers because they lie in towns like Lloyd, \n     Marlborough and Plattekill on the county's eastern edge, \n     closer to the train lines across the Hudson River that lead \n     to New York City. In recent years, as Orange County to the \n     south and Dutchess County to the east have seen a surge in \n     home construction, Ulster has drawn professionals in search \n     of lower prices and open space.\n       ``Ten or twenty years ago, people would say: `I have a 40-\n     minute commute. Isn't that long?' '' said Seth McKee, \n     associate land preservation director of Scenic Hudson, an \n     environmental organization in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., that is \n     assisting Ulster County in its effort to buy development \n     rights from farmers. ``Now they say: `I have an hour commute. \n     Isn't that great?' The development pressures in Ulster are \n     not quite what they are in southern Dutchess, but that \n     doesn't mean it's not going to become that way.''\n       That is just fine with Dennis and Diane Chaissan, apple \n     farmers who are now subdividing their 350 acres of orchards. \n     They shut down their apple operation in 1999. He got his \n     real estate license; she went back to school for a \n     master's degree in education administration.\n       ``We didn't see a future in it,'' Mr. Chaissan said of the \n     apple business begun by his grandfather in 1910. ``Over the \n     last 10 years or so, prices have been stagnant or going down. \n     I didn't see a return on the money, and I didn't want to \n     continue. Looking back, I think it was the best decision we \n     ever made.''\n       Mr. Chaissan, a trim 46-year-old with a salt-and-pepper \n     mustache, chose a profession that neatly positioned him to \n     take advantage of his top asset: land. Apple orchards are \n     selling for between $3,000 to $10,000 an acre, depending on \n     the location and factors like slope and drainage. But with \n     zoning approvals in place for housing, the land becomes much \n     more valuable.\n       The Chaissans hope to sell four two-and-a-half-acre \n     building lots in the hamlet of Clintondale for $25,000 to \n     $100,000 each. The\n\n[[Page S11068]]\n\n     lots, still covered with trees bearing young Empire and \n     Cortland apples, have magnificent views of the Shawangunk \n     Mountains to the west.\n       Like other growers, Mr. Chaissan, who works for Colucci \n     Shand Realty in Gardiner, N.Y., could not make the economics \n     of apples work. According to the New York State Apple \n     Association, a bushel of apples that sold for $14 in the mid \n     1990's now sells for $9. Mr. Chaissan figures that each \n     bushel would cost him about $11 to produce. ``Right now \n     growers are pounding their heads against a wall,'' he said. \n     ``They can't make money, and they see no way out.''\n       His career switch was shrewd in another way, too. Mr. \n     Chaissan represents a few of his fellow apple farmers now \n     selling some or all of their orchards. One potential client \n     is Jeffrey D. Crist, a fourth-generation apple grower who \n     owns 500 acres of orchards, half in Ulster County and half in \n     Orange County.\n       Mr. Crist is weighing a $2.3 million offer from a developer \n     for 227 acres of orchards in the town of Hamptonburgh in \n     Orange County. ``At this point, we're not planning to get out \n     of the business, but we can grow apples just as easily on \n     less valuable land farther away from New York City,'' Mr. \n     Crist said.\n       Still, Mr. Crist said his first priority was to pay back \n     his creditors. ``I've got loan payments from last year's \n     growing season that are unpaid,'' he said, adding that \n     revenues were down a half previous year. ``We wouldn't invest \n     in other land if it looked like we were going to lose money. \n     The industry picture would have to improve.''\n       Ulster County is now trying to buy development rights from \n     farmers under a state program that would ensure that the land \n     is reserved for agricultural use even if it is sold. But the \n     process is slow. Two years ago, 17 farmers in the county \n     applied, and the state, which contributes 75 percent of the \n     purchase cost, chose two. But those two farmers, both apple \n     growers in Clintondale, have yet to sell.\n       ``It's possible I won't go through with it,'' said Phil \n     Hurd, an owner of M.G. Hurd & Sons, a 250-acre apple and pear \n     operation dating to the 1890's. ``My land is owned by several \n     family members, and it makes it difficult to come to \n     agreement. The program restricts you to farming, which you \n     can't make a profit on, so it's a double-edged sword.''\n       Mr. McKee of Scenic Hudson says conservation programs like \n     these do not happen overnight. ``It's time-consuming to have \n     the farmers think about all the possibilities and put it into \n     an agreement that is perpetual,'' he said. ``They rely on \n     this land for their livelihood.''\n       But as a resident of Ulster, Mr. McKee also knows that time \n     is a luxury neither the county nor the apple industry has. \n     ``It's very painful to watch the impact of suburban sprawl \n     heading north, but that's all the more reason why these \n     programs are vital,'' he said. ``For weekenders and local \n     folks who have been here for generations, it's the loss of a \n     sense of place. For the farm families, it's hard to watch \n     what used to be a vast expanse being nibbled away.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Loudoun Times, Leesburg, VA, Aug. 15, 2001]\n\n                Va. Apple Producers Face Many Pressures\n\n       Market worries, hail and oversupply are causing tough times \n     for apple growers in Virginia and other apple-growing states.\n       Producers in both the fresh fruit and processing sectors \n     are suffering greatly, according to Giles County orchardist \n     Bill Freeman.\n       ``There's pressure from all sides. Things have gone \n     downhill for several years, but it's really become a struggle \n     to stay ahead. We're going to have to find different ways to \n     market our product and keep it moving despite complications \n     and competition,'' Freeman said.\n       ``Apple production is quickly becoming a nonprofit \n     industry,'' said Richard Marini, a Virginia Cooperative \n     Extension horticulture specialist at Virginia Tech. ``There's \n     really a worldwide overproduction, and apples have become a \n     global market.''\n       Virginia is the nation's sixth largest apple producer, \n     generating cash receipts of about $40 million in 1999. There \n     are fewer than 300 commercial growers in the Old Dominion. \n     Most are located in Frederick County, other parts of the \n     Shenandoah Valley and Virginia Piedmont, and in Southwest \n     Virginia.\n       Estimated losses in national apple production between 1995 \n     and 1998 are $760 million, according to the U.S. Apple \n     Association, and the average price received by growers in \n     January dropped to its second lowest level in more than 10 \n     years.\n       ``Washington (state) has really increased production in the \n     past several years with the thought that they could export \n     them. But larger production and exports from China and much \n     of Asia has prevented that,'' Marini said.\n       In an effort to aid struggling producers, the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture began sign-ups March 1 for its \n     Apple Market Loss Assistance Program. Payments were made on a \n     grower's first 1.6 million pounds of production in either \n     1998 or 1999.\n       ``The program is similar to other programs for other \n     commodities, but it's the first of its kind for apple \n     producers. Many producers have realized that it's going to be \n     necessary for their survival at this point, explained Spencer \n     Neale, senior assistant director of the Virginia Farm Bureau \n     Federation Commodity/Marketing Department. ``If a producer \n     has never relied on assistance before, it's a path they may \n     tend to be reluctant to go down now.''\n       Freeman said this year's assistance ``has kept us going for \n     another year, but I'm not sure that it's not just prolonging \n     the agony.''\n       The government is currently working on another program for \n     apple producers that could provide $150 million in \n     assistance. ``Despite the assistance that's provided to help \n     producers, it all comes down to supply and product price,'' \n     Neale said.\n       In addition to market concerns, Virginia apple producers \n     have suffered problems from numerous hailstorms in recent \n     months, agriculture officials said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Sun Journal, Lewiston, ME, Aug. 8, 2001]\n\n                      Apple Growers' Aid Dropping\n\n                            (By Glen Bolduc)\n\n\n   since 1996 the nation's apple growers have suffered over $1.5b in \n                             market losses.\n\n       TURNER--Apple trees used to grow on 850 acres of his farm. \n     Now there's only 500 acres of the fruit.\n       ``We're getting smaller fast,'' said Harry Ricker, owner of \n     Ricker Hills Orchards.\n       The only thing growing seems to be the bills.\n       ``The wholesale apple business has not been profitable for \n     years now,'' Ricker said. ``Our industry has gotten to the \n     point where we need to worry about ourselves.''\n       Since 1996 the nation's apple growers have suffered over \n     $1.5 billion in market losses. This past growing year alone \n     has cost them nearly $500 million.\n       ``The apple industry is suffering the worst economic \n     conditions in 70 years,'' said Kraig Naasz, president of the \n     U.S. Apple Association in McLean, Va.\n       Not since the Great Depression have apple growers suffered \n     such monetary loss, and Naasz estimates that 30 percent of \n     the nation's apple growers will retire their industry this \n     year if help isn't provided in some form.\n       ``We're in trouble,'' Ricker said, ``and we need some \n     government help.''\n\n\n                             government aid\n\n       Last week the U.S. Senate caved in to President Bush's veto \n     threat and approved a $5.5 billion agriculture assistance \n     bill that was $2 billion less than the House version. \n     Republican Susan Collins of Maine was one of the senators who \n     voted in favor of the trim; Olympia Snowe voted in favor of \n     the House version.\n       About $50 million of the $2 billion cut from the original \n     draft would have been used to supplement the market loss of \n     apple growers. But the approved version still provides $169 \n     million to states for various needs.\n       ``The funds would have been well utilized,'' said Ned \n     Porter, deputy commissioner of the Maine Department of \n     Agriculture. ``However, we're not out of the fight yet.''\n       The House has currently approved another farm aid bill that \n     will provide about $150 million--an estimated $900,000 for \n     Maine--in market loss assistance.\n       Although the bill still has to wait for Senate and White \n     House approval next month, Naasz said he expects it to pass. \n     ``It looks very promising,'' he said.\n       But Don Ricker, father of Harry Ricker, said that a lot of \n     times the funding never comes.\n       ``Typically the Congress passes all these bills, and they \n     get a lot of press, but then it just dies,'' he said. ``You'd \n     think that I was living high with all these handouts.''\n       Ricker's orchard was awarded farm assistance in a 1998 \n     bill, but the check didn't come until June 2000.\n\n\n                           why the hard times\n\n       The cause of the economic stress is all in the politics of \n     sale and trade, Naasz said. ``The reasons are many and mostly \n     beyond the control of apple growers.''\n       In the last 10 years, the nation's price for apples has not \n     risen.\n       ``I can't go on,'' Dimock said. ``We're simply not getting \n     for our crop what it takes to produce it.''\n       Rising costs in fuel, chemicals, and labor are not being \n     met adequately, and the cost for apples in the United States \n     is dropping even further because of foreign imports.\n       China produces four times the amount of the United States, \n     and recent years have seen prices for American apples drop \n     from eight cents a pound to 1 cent a pound as the overseas \n     product floods the American market.\n       ``This stuff goes in cycles,'' Ricker said. But once the \n     American market is profitable again for apple growers, \n     ``we're not going to be here to do that.''\n       Besides government assistance, Naasz said, other remedies \n     will have to include raising apple prices, placing limits on \n     imports and increasing marketing campaigns.\n       ``It's encouraging consumers to eat that apple a day for \n     health,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our growers have invested heavily in their \nefforts to reverse their economic plight. They are not seeking the \nestablishment of a permanent direct assistance program. However, unless \nwe take some interim action here, as many as 30 percent of American \napple growers are going to lose their farms. So this ad hoc assistance \nwhich we are struggling to achieve is essential if we are going to \navoid that calamity.\n  The fiscal year 2001 agricultural supplemental appropriations bill \nthat\n\n[[Page S11069]]\n\nemerged from the committee included funding of $150 million for our \nNation's apple growers. That provision, which came out of the \ncommittee, had to be dropped at the last minute if we were going to get \na bill passed at all. So the Senate version of the bill had to be \ndropped, which included that assistance. Instead, the House bill was \nadopted which at that time did not include the assistance.\n  What has happened subsequently is the following. The House bill now \nhas $150 million for our Nation's apple growers, and it will go to \nconference whether we adopt this amendment or not. We have had \ndiscussions among ourselves, the sponsors of this amendment, as to what \nwould be the best approach to take.\n  I will yield the floor at this time, but I simply want to say this--\nand I want to speak to my good friend from Wisconsin in a moment. Our \ngoal is to achieve this assistance one way or the other--either on this \nfloor or in conference--by our giving the House provision the final say \nin this matter.\n  I am going to have a colloquy in a few moments with our friend from \nWisconsin.\n  At this time there are a number of other cosponsors of this amendment \nin the Chamber who I hope can now be recognized before that colloquy \ntakes place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment by \nthe Senator from Michigan. This is an extremely important measure. The \nSenator from Michigan aptly described what has happened to our apple \nfarmers across the country. In my home State of Washington, it has been \na tremendous disaster with the economic loss for the young families who \nare working diligently to try to make ends meet in this industry for \nthe last several years. It has been heartbreaking to watch.\n  The Senator from Michigan talked about the dumping of apple juice \nconcentrate by China, which contributed to the decline in our apple \ngrowing communities. Severe weather conditions this year have caused \nhorrendous problems for these orchardists who have been struggling for \nthe last few years anyway. The loss of markets in Asia, because of the \nPacific Rim crisis, precipitated this dramatic loss for many farmers in \nthe State of Washington.\n  The Senator from Michigan described the process that we have been \ngoing through. Senator Cantwell from my home State and I worked hard \nwith the Senators from Michigan, New York, Maine, Vermont, and \nMassachusetts on the emergency supplemental bill to provide $150 \nmillion for the apple industry in this country. That support was not \nincluded in the Agriculture Appropriations bill when it came out of \ncommittee because we fully expected the Administration and the House to \nsupport this as an emergency supplemental measure. Unfortunately, they \ndid not. As a result, in August Congress recessed without the money in \nthe emergency agricultural supplemental. This bill is now coming to the \nfloor, and it is absolutely essential for our farmers.\n  Senator Cantwell and I have traveled around our State. We have seen \nthe tremendous pain and loss among our farmers, and we have seen the \nhardships they are experiencing today.\n  My grandfather, back in the early 1900s, lived in central Washington \nand was part of the apple industry. I can tell you, when I was growing \nup I remember driving across central Washington and seeing our \ntremendous, beautiful orchards. I was so proud to be from Washington \nState. Today, as a Senator traveling around the world, I am proud to be \nable to talk about bringing our apples into markets worldwide--both for \nour economy and for establishing great relationships with countries \neverywhere. The apple is the symbol of the State of Washington.\n  It is upsetting for me to visit central Washington today and see so \nmany abandoned orchards. Many of the orchards have been bulldozed \nbecause farmers can't sell their apples for a fair price.\n  Add to that the weather conditions of this year with the drought that \nhas occurred in the State of Washington and the severe hailstorms we \nhave seen. That means we will not have these orchards in the future if \nwe don't provide assistance this year in the Agriculture appropriations \nbill. I am committed to providing it, along with my colleague from \nWashington State, and the Senators from Michigan, New York, \nMassachusetts, Vermont, and Maine. All of us have worked hard together \nwith our chairman, who has been a great advocate and supporter.\n  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. He understands the plight of our \nfarmers. He is committed to working with us to ensure this assistance \nis there for our farmers. It is essential for a way of life in \nWashington State and across this country. It is essential for a product \nthat is important to my home State and to many others. I believe it is \nessential for the future of this industry that we have this help and \nassistance from this Congress this year in this appropriations bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for offering this amendment. I \nthank our Chair, Senator Kohl, for his support and his assistance. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to be sure we don't lose \nthese important farmers and this important resource for our country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise also to support this very \nimportant effort and very important amendment.\n  I, first, thank my senior colleague and friend from Michigan for his \nongoing leadership in this effort to support our apple growers in \nMichigan and across the country, and my colleagues who are joining us \nin the Chamber certainly have been at the forefront of this battle.\n  We really have had two strategies. One is to focus on research for \napple fire blight. I thank the chairman of the subcommittee and the \nranking member for their ongoing efforts. There are dollars in this \nbill for apple fire blight research. That continues to be a priority. I \nthank him for his vision and his support because in the long run we are \nhoping the research will allow us to be able to find ways for our \nfarmers to eradicate this terrible disease that is so afflicting the \napple growers across the country.\n  In the meantime, we know that in the last 5 years apple growers \nacross our country have lost $1.5 billion. Last year alone, $500 \nmillion was lost as a result of this effort.\n  We are talking about a serious disease affecting a very important \nMichigan industry and national industry.\n  I am very hopeful that we can come together and support the $150 \nmillion effort. I am very pleased that the House has finally recognized \nthis and is supporting this effort in the House bill.\n  Let me stress one more time that originally we had this supplemental \nfunding in the emergency supplemental that we passed. As a member of \nthe Agriculture Committee, we worked very hard with colleagues to get \nthat money in the Senate bill. I appreciate everyone's efforts at that \ntime. Unfortunately, we were not able to pass the Senate bill. We were \nnot able to address it earlier, which we had hoped would happen.\n  Now we find ourselves in a situation where we are seriously in need \nof addressing this as quickly as possible. This amendment is absolutely \ncritical. I hope we will have the support of colleagues.\n  While I have the floor, I also want to say one more time a thank you \nto our leader, the chairman of the subcommittee, and the ranking member \nfor a number of different issues in this bill that are important to \nMichigan--the focus on the eradication of bovine disease and specialty \ncrop research in other areas are very important. I very much appreciate \nthe fact they are willing to undertake this issue and support our apple \ngrowers. It is absolutely critical to our economy and to the economy of \nmany, many States.\n  I yield the floor. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak, along with my \ncolleagues from Michigan and Washington who have eloquently talked \nabout the important need of helping the apple industry--not just those \nStates mentioned but all across the Nation. We\n\n[[Page S11070]]\n\nare trying to move forward on an Agriculture appropriations bill. We \nhave the opportunity in that process to express the failure of last \nAugust when we actually had the means by which to help legitimate apple \ngrowers across the country in the emergency supplemental.\n  I very much appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Wisconsin to \nhelp us bring attention to this issue. The current House version of \nthis bill includes $150 million in apple assistance. We need to match \nthat assistance.\n  As my colleagues have stated, this industry, particularly this year \nfor us in the State of Washington, has just been devastating, largely \ndue to the fact we have had the second worst drought on record in our \nState. Not only have farmers been without all the resources they need, \nbut the high cost of energy in those areas where farmers have been able \nto irrigate has made this a very difficult year.\n  We have already seen how important the apple industry is in our \nState. Over 183,000 people are employed in that industry. But every one \nof these family farms are on the brink, and they need help now.\n  Current prices are 40 percent below the cost of production. Between \n1995 and 1998, apple growers lost approximately $760 million due to \nquestionable import practices involving such countries as China and \nKorea--in addition to stiff export tariffs.\n  They also face increases in the price of diesel fuel. Prices are up \n20 to 30 percent over last year. The cost of running electricity pumps \nthat these farmers use is expected to rise as much as 150 percent.\n  Our farmers have been facing all of these things, and some are very \nclose to bankruptcy.\n  So I very much appreciate the Senator from Wisconsin in his efforts \nto make sure this issue gets addressed as we move through the process, \nand I very much appreciate his efforts earlier this year in making sure \nthe Senate version of the supplemental included this support.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the previous \nspeakers on this issue.\n  I would like to declare that I will fight for them in conference. The \nHouse of Representatives has the money in their bill, and that fact \nwill give us the opportunity to meet this need of apple growers. The \nSenators from the States of Michigan, Washington, New York, Maine, \nMassachusetts, and Vermont have been very persuasive, most effective, \nand, frankly, relentless in this cause on behalf of their apple \ngrowers.\n  This bill was voted out of the Appropriations Committee in July, and \nwe fully expected the White House and the House of Representatives to \nfund this urgent need for apple growers in the agricultural \nsupplemental. In fact, the Senate had done that. That is why it isn't \nin this bill. And the budget allocation precludes me from putting it in \nnow. That is why I am declaring I will fight for it in conference \ninstead. I very much appreciate the advocacy of the Senators from those \nStates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nEdwards be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the good Senator from Wisconsin has really \nworked with us on so many issues. I appreciate very much what he has \njust said. With that assurance, I am satisfied, and I intend to \nwithdraw this amendment. I think, however, there may be another speaker \non this amendment. I will not withdraw it if there is another speaker. \nI will withhold that at this time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Michigan, \nI am very supportive of his amendment, but I was going to speak to \nanother one and would love to be added as a cosponsor to this \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We welcome that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Oregon \nbe added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1978 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I withdraw this amendment at this time, \nwith thanks to Senator Kohl and also Senator Cochran. I have had a \nchance to speak with Senator Cochran, who has been so helpful on a \nwhole host of issues in the agricultural area. While we had a minor \ndisagreement in the area of missile defense, in so many other areas we \nhave worked together on issues. I hope we can work together on this \nissue as it proceeds to conference.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to withdraw the \namendment. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Wisconsin in \nthanking the Senator from Michigan for his action. I know it is a \nserious problem, and it has been well identified. The Senator from \nOregon has an interest in it as well.\n  There are other agricultural activities that are similarly situated. \nWe have heard from the Senator from Wyoming, for example, on the plight \nof the livestock industry; there are problems in some other specific \nareas of the country because of drought--all of which are in need of \nspecial assistance and special economic assistance in this time of \nhardship.\n  So all of these interests are going to be considered. They should be \nconsidered by the Congress as we work to reach an agreement in \nconference on this bill.\n  I am happy to join with the Senator from Wisconsin in assuring those \nwho talked about the apple industry and the problems they have that \ntheir interests will be carefully considered. I hope we can work out a \nprovision in this bill in conference that will be satisfactory with \nthem.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1981\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today, again, to raise my \nvoice on behalf of the farmers of Klamath Falls, OR, and the Klamath \nFalls Basin that includes northern California in equal numbers.\n  I first thank my colleagues of the Senate and of the entire Congress \nfor the $20 million that was allocated on an emergency basis to help \nthese farmers to stave off foreclosure.\n  My colleague, Senator Wyden, and I pointed out at the time that it \nwas probably a tenth of what was actually needed, and that is proving \nto be the case, because the wolves of foreclosure are at the doors of \nmany farms right now. The reason is simply that they were denied a \nseason of farming. You can imagine what it would mean if the Federal \nGovernment took away the means by which any of us makes a living for a \nyear and how we might survive. The truth is, we cannot. No one saves \nthat money. The way farms operate, they do not have those kinds of \nmargins.\n  So what I am doing today is seeking an additional appropriation to \nhelp them; it comes in two requests: One, it is to provide these 1,400 \nfarm families with an additional $38 million in direct assistance; in \naddition to that, $9 million for activities to improve water storage \nand water quality in the Upper Klamath River Basin.\n  I have searched for offsets. I found one. I am willing to work with \nthe Congress on making these dots connect, but I am identifying it as \nan offset: the sale of Pershing Hall in Paris, France. It is along the \nChamps Elysees. It is owned by the Department of Veterans Affairs. It \nis empty. We are paying taxes on it. It is exceedingly valuable real \nestate. It is run down. It is vacant.\n  I am asking that we sell this building and that we use this money to \nhelp these farmers. It will generate at least this amount of money, and \nmore. I am simply saying that, in very real terms, this money is needed \nnow while it is being wasted in Paris.\n  The people of Oregon generally have the highest rates of unemployment \nin America, but certainly the pain is felt more acutely in Klamath \nFalls than any place of which I can think.\n  So I ask for consideration of my amendment. I look forward to working \nwith the chairman and the ranking\n\n[[Page S11071]]\n\nmember, both of whom have expressed support for my cause on this issue. \nAnd I thank them for that. I also thank my colleague, Senator Wyden, \nfor his equal partnership in the effort to try to salvage 1,400 great \nfamily farms.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and thank you for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I come to this Chamber today to join my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Smith. One can debate whether we have \nfound precisely the right offset. Senator Smith and I have scoured the \nbudget and intend to work closely with the chairman of the subcommittee \nand the chairman of the full committee and, of course, the ranking \nminority members as well, so as to ensure that this is addressed at the \nproper time in the proper way.\n  But as Senator Smith has correctly said, what I think is not \ndebatable is the fact that there is a world of hurt, a world of pain in \nthe Klamath Basin in the State we represent. We have scores and scores \nof farmers in that part of the State who are on the ropes as we speak.\n  These are people who have worked hard all their lives. That have \nplayed by the rules. They have done nothing wrong. But clearly, now, as \na result of policies that ensure we can find water for all the uses \nabout which people of Oregon and people of this country feel strongly--\nagriculture, environment, conservation--there is a tremendous crunch in \nour part of the country.\n  Senator Smith and I have spent many hours in recent weeks working to \nforge a coalition between agricultural interests, environmental \ninterests, the rural communities--all of the stakeholders--the tribes, \nand all of the parties who feel so strongly about this.\n  The reason we come to the floor today is that we want to work with \nthe Appropriations Committee--particularly the chairman, Senator Kohl, \nand Senator Cochran, who have been very gracious to us in working on \nKlamath issues in the past--so we can get this urgently needed \nassistance.\n  It is our understanding that there are some questions about exactly \nfrom which account this should come. Senator Smith has been very clear, \nin making our initial remarks, that we intend to work with both the \nsubcommittee and the full committee to ensure this offset does come \nfrom the appropriate account.\n  What is not debatable is how grave the need is. We have farmers who \nare not going to survive. They are not going to be there a few months \ndown the road, if we can't get the assistance through this amendment \nthe two Oregon Senators offer today.\n  I thank Chairman Kohl and Senator Cochran. We are going to be working \nclosely with them and with the chairman of the full committee and the \nranking minority member, Senator Stevens, so that we can find the funds \nneeded so urgently in the Klamath Basin and we can give a little bit of \nhope at this critical time to those families who are suffering today \nand are worried about whether they are going to be able to farm \ntomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask for adoption of the \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I couldn't understand the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not yet been proposed.\n  Mr. REID. What did the Senator from Oregon say?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am asking for consideration of our amendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I object. I would like to make a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. We do not have a copy of the amendment. However, we do \nunderstand that the offset of which they speak falls in the \njurisdiction of another subcommittee. We need to confer with that \nsubcommittee and the Congressional Budget Office. We did provide $20 \nmillion to the Klamath Basin in the spring supplemental. No other \ndisaster assistance has been provided by this committee. If we accept \nthis amendment, then others will seek additional assistance which our \nallocation cannot provide.\n  This is a very difficult amendment for this committee to support. In \nfact, we will not support it.\n  In addition, I am fairly certain that the offset they are discussing \ndoes not fall within this committee's jurisdiction. I humbly and \nrespectfully suggest that they pursue a different avenue than \nrequesting a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask for the amendment's \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith], for himself and Mr. \n     Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 1981.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide assistance for farmers and ranchers in the Klamath \n                     Basin, Oregon and California)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       ``In addition to amounts otherwise available, $38,000,000 \n     from amounts pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 713a-4, for the Secretary \n     of Agriculture to make available financial assistance to \n     eligible producers in the Klamath Basin, as determined by the \n     Secretary.\n       ``$6,600,000 will be available for the acquisition of \n     lands, interests in lands or easements in the Upper Klamath \n     River Basin from willing sellers for the purposes of \n     enhancing water storage or improving water quality in the \n     Upper Basin.\n       ``$2,500,000 will be available through the rural utilities \n     account to fund the drilling of wells for landowners \n     currently diverting surface water upstream of Upper Klamath \n     Lake, Oregon.\n       ``Funding for this program will come from the sale of \n     Pershing Hall, a Department of Veterans' Affairs building in \n     Paris, France.''\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I would like to work with the \nchairman and the ranking member to find the offset that works and that \nwould win the support of the chairman and ranking member. I thank them \nboth.\n  Mr. KOHL. We would be happy to accommodate the Senator with respect \nto his last comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1981 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw the amendment that is now pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while we are waiting for amendments to be \noffered, I wanted to make a couple of comments about this subcommittee \nbill and talk about the work done by Senator Kohl and Senator Cochran \non this bill.\n  As always, as I have indicated before, a lot of difficult work goes \ninto putting together the Agriculture appropriations bill. Senators \nKohl and Cochran work very well together. I, for one, appreciate their \ncooperation and their assistance. I think they have put together a good \npiece of legislation.\n  There are two issues that I have on previous occasions brought to the \nfloor during the consideration of this legislation. One issue we \ndiscussed last year on this bill, among other things, is the \nreimportation of prescription drugs. This issue deals with drug prices, \nand what we can do to lower those prices.\n  As I understand it, in the House of Representatives in their \nAgriculture appropriations bill, there is a provision dealing with the \nreimportation of drugs that will come to conference this year. It is my \nintention not to offer an amendment in the Senate on this matter this \nyear--not because it is not important because it is very much so, but \nas we all know too well, a number of things have happened at this point \nto change our focus. Other events have happened in this country that \nhave caused us to focus on other serious issues dealing with terrorism \nand so on. I think this is not the point at which we ought to go off \ninto the medicine importation debate. Therefore, I\n\n[[Page S11072]]\n\nwill not offer an amendment dealing with the reimportation of \nprescription drugs.\n  However, let me say this issue will not go away. It is still \ncritically important. The issue will be alive in conference because \nthere is a provision in the bill sent to us by the House of \nRepresentatives. One of the reasons we--myself, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Stabenow, Senator Snowe, Senator Wellstone, and a number of \nothers of us--have worked on the issue of prescription drug prices and \nreimportation is that prescription drugs are priced higher in the \nUnited States than anywhere else in the world. You see a prescription \ndrug sold across the counter in this country to the American consumer \nat the highest price in the world. That is not fair.\n  I have told colleagues of my experience in taking a group of senior \ncitizens from North Dakota up to Emerson, Canada, just 5 miles across \nthe North Dakota-Canadian border. In a little one-room pharmacy in \nCanada, you can buy the same prescription drugs sold in Pembina, ND. \nThe only difference is price--same drug, same pill, put in the same \nbottle, manufactured by the same company. You can buy it for 50-percent \nor 70-percent less across the border in Canada than you can in the \nUnited States. That is not fair to the American consumer, and it is not \nfair pricing.\n  We all know spending on prescription drugs is increasing \ndramatically--15, 16, 18 percent a year, year after year. The American \npeople--particularly senior citizens--are very concerned about this. \nOne of the proposals we had offered previously was to say: If this is a \nglobal economy, why can that not work for everybody, why not for all \nAmericans? Why can't an American citizen or, yes, an American \npharmacist, or a distributor get access to cheaper drugs in Winnipeg, \nCanada, and bring them back and pass the savings along to the American \nconsumer?\n  Let me give a couple of examples. Cipro, a drug most of us now know \nabout, is used to treat infections. In recent days, we have seen that \nit has been given to thousands of people who have been exposed to \nanthrax. The average wholesale price in the United States is $399 a \nbottle. You can buy Cipro in Canada at $171 a bottle. Let me say that \nagain. A bottle of Cipro--same strength, same number of tablets--in \nCanada costs $171, but when you buy it in the United States, it is \n$399. Why more than twice as expensive in the United States? Why does \nthe American consumer pay more than twice as much for the same drug, \nput in the same bottle, made in an FDA-approved plant? Does that make \nsense?\n  Or take the example of Zocor. A football coach tells us on television \nin an advertisement that I suppose I have seen 500 times that Zocor \nwould be great to lower your cholesterol. The average wholesale price \nin the United States is $3.82 for one 20-milligram tablet. In Canada, \nit is $1.82. Fair? I don't think so.\n  Zoloft is used to treat depression. In the United States, it is $2.34 \nper 50 milligram tablet. In Canada, the exact same tablet costs $1.28. \nFair? I don't think so.\n  For every dollar we spend for the same prescription drugs in this \ncountry, the Canadians spend 64 cents; the Swedes pay 68 cents; in \nGreat Britain it costs 65 cents; and in Italy, 51 cents. That is what \nis angering the American people and propelling a number of us to say if \nthis global economy is to work, why can't it work for all Americans? \nWhy can't a pharmacist from Grand Forks, ND, access the same \nprescription drug produced in an FDA-approved plant and bring it back \nand pay half the price and pass the savings along to the consumer in \nthis country. I offered an amendment of this type last year. We went to \nconference. We actually succeeded in getting this agreed to in \nconference. And both the Clinton administration and the Bush \nadministration Secretaries of Health and Human Services said they would \nnot implement this legislation because they said it would not, among \nother things, save money. Let me ask if there is anybody who has gone \npast the third grade who doesn't understand that, if you buy Cipro in \nthe United States and pay $399 a bottle and are only required to pay \n$171 a bottle in Canada, that you can't save money by buying the bottle \nfrom Canada.\n\n  I guess the only people who think that are the two successive \nSecretaries of Health and Human Services. I don't know what kind of \nmath they taught in their schools, but I went to a school with 40 \nstudents in all 4 high school grades. There were 9 in my senior class. \nI studied the highest math they offered, and I can understand that this \nsaves money, and there is no Secretary of any Agency in the Federal \nGovernment who can convince us otherwise.\n  Nonetheless, neither administration will implement it. The result is \na law that was passed last year is not yet implemented. For reasons I \ndiscussed before, we will not offer the amendment on this piece of \nlegislation. But this will be a conferenceable issue because a \nprovision is coming from the House on the Agriculture appropriations \nbill, and we will resolve this then. It is, I think, an unusual time in \nour country's history, as we wage a fight against terrorism and deal \nwith a range of issues, so that perhaps this is not the right time to \nhave a full-scale debate about this issue. But there will probably \nnever be a right time, and there will be a time when we must force this \nagain on behalf of the American consumer, to ask how do you justify \nthis? How do you justify drug companies charging the highest prices to \nthe American consumers out of any consumers in the world? How do you \njustify doubling and tripling the price? How do you justify to a woman \nwho has breast cancer that she ought to pay 10 times more money for \nTamoxifen purchased in the United States than in Canada. How do you \njustify that to somebody fighting cancer, who has to fight a pricing \npolicy for prescription drugs that is wrong?\n  The answer is that you cannot justify it. That is why this Congress, \nsooner or later--and I hope sooner--will deal with that subject.\n  Now, Mr. President, there is one other issue on which I have \ntraditionally offered an amendment on this subcommittee. Again, I will \nnot because I understand we are not able to do it this year for a \nnumber of reasons. Each year, in recent years, we have had to offer \namendments to the Agriculture appropriations bill on the floor of the \nSenate trying to provide some weather disaster and economic relief. \nWhy? Because the Freedom to Farm bill was miserable, a miserable \nfailure. It was a disaster, in my judgment. So each year, because it \nwas not countercyclical, it didn't provide help when farmers needed \nit--or enough help--as we saw commodity prices collapse. We had to try \nto put some sort of disaster relief in the bill, both weather and \neconomic. We normally described it as emergency spending. We went to \nconference and boosted it.\n  I would say the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from \nMississippi were instrumental in making all of that assistance \navailable to family farmers in this country. I commend them for that. \nWe will likely, in some areas of the country, again this year, need \nsome weather disaster assistance. I understand that in Montana, Idaho, \nWyoming--and some other areas that colleagues have talked about--there \nhas been drought. And in some other areas, too much rain has fallen. I \nexpect there won't be a weather disaster amendment this year to this \nappropriations bill because I don't think the money exists or the \nemergency category exists to accommodate that. But there will be an \neconomic stimulus package that will be discussed and considered, and it \nseems to me that one of the things that might be considered would be a \nlivestock and crop loss assistance for disaster aid to those who \nsuffered disasters.\n  In fact, it is stimulative because that money gets in the hands of \nproducers who then are able to use that immediately to deal with the \ndebts they have and put that money on the main street of our small \ntowns and cities across the country.\n  So as we move along, even though this subcommittee will not carry \nthese two amendments in its markup this year, it is my hope both of \nthem will continue to be considered, one in conference because it will \ncome from the House, and the second, I hope, perhaps in the stimulus \npackage when we have an opportunity to consider that in the Senate.\n  Finally, there are a lot of provisions of this Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee bill that are critically important dealing \nwith research and\n\n[[Page S11073]]\n\nother matters relating to American agriculture. Our agriculture in this \ncountry ought to be a source of enormous pride to all of us. In my \njudgment, family farmers in America are America's economic all-stars. \nYet they have had an awfully tough time year after year as commodity \nprices have collapsed. One part of trying to help them is not only \ntrying to write a new farm bill, which we should do and we ought to do \nsoon. In fact, we ought to bring a farm bill to this Chamber within a \nmatter of weeks. But, one part of assistance in addition to that farm \nbill is to provide the kind of research help that will allow family \nfarmers the ability to have access to new seeds--disease-resistant \nstrains of seeds--to make them more effective and reduce risks. That is \nwhat much of this bill is about, investment and research.\n  I again say thanks to the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl, and \nSenator Cochran from Mississippi. It is always a pleasure to work with \nthem. They do a good job, and I am proud of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have had a number of inquiries in both \ncloakrooms about how this bill is moving along, and it is moving along \nfine. The two managers are working on what amendments can be accepted, \nwhich ones cannot be accepted. That list should be completed relatively \nsoon, within the next half hour, hopefully.\n  The only amendment outstanding, other than what the managers are \nworking on, it is believed, is the Harkin amendment. He is working with \nSenator Nelson of Nebraska to see if they can work out language on that \namendment. If not, Senator Harkin would offer that amendment. As I \nunderstand it, Senator Nelson of Nebraska would move to second degree \nthat amendment.\n  As I said, they are trying to work out that amendment. So Senators \nshould be advised, we hope, within the next hour or so, and with a \nlittle bit of luck, we can complete this legislation. If someone has an \namendment and they have not been able to work with the managers, have \nnot had the opportunity to offer the amendment, they should come over \nbecause we are going to wrap up this bill totally as soon as we \ncomplete what the managers are working on, and the Harkin amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been waiting here while a couple of \nour colleagues are trying to resolve some differences in the Cloakroom \non an amendment. It is taking them a while so it gives me an \nopportunity to say a bit about an amendment that I have offered to this \nbill the last 2 years and which the Senate has accepted both time. I \nhave not offered it this year and will not this evening. I wanted to \nexplain why.\n  That amendment deals with the shipment of food and medicine to Cuba \nand the ability of American farmers to sell food to Cuba. In the last 2 \nyears I offered amendments to this appropriations bill that would have \neliminated the embargo that now prevents American farmers from selling \nfood to Cuba.\n  As you know, the American embargo of Cuba has been a failure for 40 \nyears. That embargo has included restrictions on the shipment of food \nand medicine to Cuba. I have said for several years it is morally \nwrong, in my judgment, for us to use food and medicine as a weapon. It \nis not right for us to use food and medicine as part of an embargo. It \ndoesn't injure Fidel Castro. He has never missed a meal because we \ndon't ship food to Cuba.\n  Our allies, the Canadians and Europeans and others, of course, are \nable to sell food and other goods to Cuba. It is just the American \nfarmer who is prevented from accessing that markets.\n  Twice I have offered amendments to fix the problem. The first year my \namendment got hijacked because the conference got abandoned and the \nleaders would not allow it to resume because they knew I had the votes \nin conference to end the embargo on food and medicine shipments to \nCuba. The second year the House of Representatives changed the language \nand boasted they had solved the problem, but of course they did not. \nWhat they provided was that food could be shipped to Cuba, except the \nsales could not be financed even with private financing. So we still, \nin fact, have an embargo on food shipments to Cuba. There are no food \nshipments happening between this country and Cuba. So the U.S. \ngovernment still tells our farmers: You pay the cost of this embargo. \nYou cannot be part of the Cuban market for food. You can't be a part of \nit, the Canadians can, the Europeans can, but you can't because we have \nan embargo of which you are going to pay the cost.\n  This is unfair to farmers. And I don't think it is a moral policy for \nour country to use food as a weapon.\n  Let me say, finally, the provision that was completed last year \nstarted the right way in the Senate with my amendment. We did the right \nthing. It got watered down and then perverted in the conference, and \nthose who did it that boasted that this really solved the problem. A \nyear later we know it did not.\n  I would say by this time next year, when I certainly will again offer \nthis amendment in the Senate, it will be quite evident that what they \nboasted of last year never materialized at all. Farmers were still \npaying the price for this embargo.\n  We have had plenty of experience with embargoes on food. It ought not \nbe a lesson we need to learn two or three times. Shooting ourselves in \nthe foot doesn't really solve much of the problem. As I indicated, \nFidel Castro has never missed a meal because of the embargo. He does \njust fine. It is our family farmers who suffer.\n  If necessary, I will offer an amendment to fix this problem again \nnext year. I would like to do so now. However, I think this is not the \ntime. It is late in the year. We should have passed this appropriations \nbill weeks ago. If I offered this amendment this evening, we would be \noff into a debate that would last many hours. But I would like to \nremind my colleagues that I have offered it for the last 2 years. I \nwill offer it again, and some of my colleagues on this appropriations \nsubcommittee will join me the next time we go around.\n  In deference to the work that we need to do and the times we are in, \nI think it is important for all of us to work together to try to find a \nway for us to avoid the kind of controversy that divides us hour after \nhour after hour. We have been through all of that.\n  I wanted to explain why I am not going to offer that amendment this \nevening. But be sure to keep tuned because it will be offered again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to discuss for a few moments \nthe fundamental problem with this appropriations bill and then talk a \nlittle bit about the pork that is again prevalent and on the increase \nin this appropriations bill.\n  First of all, I want to talk about Federal subsidies, where they go, \nwho should be receiving them, the largess of the Federal Government \ntaxpayers' money under the present setup, how we are going to work \nsubsidies, and how the money is distributed.\n  Earlier this year, the General Accounting Office released a report \nthat details some very critical information on the disturbing trends of \nfederal farm assistance. The GAO reports that over 80 percent of farm \npayments have been made to large- and medium-sized farms, while small \nfarms have received less than 20 percent of the payments.\n  In 1999, large farms, which represent about 7 percent of all farms \nnationwide with gross agricultural sales of $250,000, received about 45 \npercent of federal payments. These payments average about $64,737.\n  Seventeen percent of farms that are medium-sized with gross sales \nbetween $50,000 and $250,000, received 45 percent of all payments. \nPayments average $21,943.\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n[[Page S11074]]\n\n  Seven percent of all the farms are now getting 45 percent of all the \npayments. Seventeen percent of farms that are medium sized and with \ngross sales between $50,000 and $250,000 receive 45 percent of all \npayments. Payments average $21,943.\n  What does this mean? Generally, small farms--with gross sales under \n$50,000--received only 14 percent of the payments, despite the fact \nthat small farms make up about 76 percent of the farms nationwide. Most \nof these payments average about $4,141. That is about 6 percent of the \ntotal amount made available to large farms.\n  There is something wrong here. Seventy-six percent of all the farms \nget 14 percent of the payments. Seven percent of the farms receive 45 \npercent of the payments.\n  Where is the rhetoric about the small and family farmer?\n  The GAO also concluded that:\n\n       The percentage of payments received by the large, very \n     large, and nonfamily farm types increased from 1993 and \n     decreased for other farm types. These farms also experienced \n     substantial increases in the average payment that they \n     received in 1999.\n       Large and very large farms received about 22 percent of the \n     payments in 1999, with average payments ranging from $51,000 \n     to $85,000.\n\n  If we take a look at what has happened with the Freedom to Farm bill \nand with the substantial amount of emergency and supplemental payments \nCongress has delivered since 1998, the trend seems to indicate that \nsmall farmers are receiving less and less federal assistance. In 1995, \nsmall farms received 29 percent of payments. By 1999, small farms \nreceived 14 percent.\n  Thus far, between 1999 and 2001 alone, Congress has designated more \nthan $30 billion in emergency or supplemental spending for farm relief. \nWhile the 1996 farm bill was intended to reduce reliance on the Federal \nGovernment, payments to farmers have increased by 400 percent, from $7 \nbillion in 1996 to $32 billion in 2001. I think we should all be \nconcerned about where this money is really being spent.\n  By some reports, even the likes of Ted Turner and pro basketball \nstar, Scottie Pippen, have been recipients of Federal subsidies. At \nleast 20 Fortune 500 companies and more than 1,200 universities and \nGovernment farms, including State prisons, received Government checks. \nSuch corporate giants as Riceland Foods, Inc., based in Stuttgart, \nArkansas, took in a mammoth $32 million in Federal subsidies and a \nlarge conglomerate farm, Missouri Delta Farms received $7 million.\n  Who pays the tab for these payments? The American taxpayers.\n  I don't know how you justify a $32 million subsidy to one \norganization, one corporation, and call it assistance to the farmer. \nLet's call it assistance to major corporations. Let's call it for what \nit is.\n  What I think we ought to do is support the hard-hit family farm \noperations. Any entity that earned more than $1 million in annual \nrevenues does not justify the expenditure of taxpayer dollars.\n  I remind my colleagues the American public is very much aware of the \nactions we are taking when asking the taxpayers to subsidize farmers. \nMany others among the American public have expressed similar concerns.\n  Let me point out a few statements:\n  Representative Ron Kind, Wisconsin in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, \nJuly 2001:\n\n       Why are we throwing these billions of dollars at these few \n     farmers, which is only leading to an increase in production, \n     and an oversupply, and commodity prices plummeting? 90% of \n     the current farm funding is going to less than one-third of \n     the producers in this country, who are located in 15 states. \n     You can imagine that those 15 states are represented on the \n     Agriculture Committees, where there is a prevailing attitude \n     to keep the status quo.\n\n  Mark Edelman, Iowa State University Extension to Communities, October \n1999:\n\n       While targeting federal assistance to medium and small \n     farmers and those that are financially vulnerable is often \n     discussed during the outbreak of a farm crisis, the bulk of \n     the emergency payments are not distributed according to those \n     criteria. Up to this point, Congress and farm interests have \n     not been willing to target the bulk of the farm program \n     payments in ways that exclude or penalize larger farmers, or \n     that arbitrarily reward medium, small or financially \n     vulnerable farmers.\n\n  Elizabeth Becker, New York Times, May 2001:\n\n       Supporters of farm subsidies, which were enacted in the \n     Depression, argue that they needed to save the family farm. \n     But government documents indicate that the prime \n     beneficiaries hardly fit the image of small, hardscrabble \n     farmers. Because eligibility is based on acreage planted with \n     subsidized crops in the past, the farmers who have the \n     biggest spreads benefit the most.\n\n  Chuck Hassebrook, Center for Rural Affairs, Nebraska, July 2001:\n\n       The single most effective step Congress could take to \n     strengthen family farms would be to stop subsidizing large \n     farms to drive their neighbors out of business.\n\n  In a recent Wall Street Journal article (October 3, 2001), called \n``Nuts to You,'' a story outlines the federal government's continuing \nlove affair with federal subsidies.\n\n       In short, at a time when voters want Congress to be \n     serious, we're seeing Washington at its worst. Once upon a \n     time, it was possible to argue that farm supports kept small-\n     time growers on the land. But nowadays they are little more \n     than huge wealth transfers from average taxpayers to well-to-\n     do farmers, many of whom work the land only part-time.\n       Based on the amount of a crop produced, these subsidies go \n     to big landholders who collect the cash and then buy up the \n     land around them to collect still more. According to one \n     recent study, only 10 percent of all farmers get 61 percent \n     of all of the federal subsidies. Florida's Fanjul family has \n     made a killing in sugar, another crop vital to the war \n     effort.\n\n  Even my colleague and distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, criticized current farm policies \nfor sending a greater share of Government subsidies to large farms \ninstead of the more vulnerable smaller farms and for making it more \ndifficult for young people to go into farming by driving up land \nvalues.\n  In reviewing the General Accounting Office report, Senator Harkin was \nquoted in the Des Moines Register, July 2001, as saying that the GAO \nreport ``proves that we can and should be doing more to ensure that \nthese payments are distributed fairly.'' And Senator Harkin further was \nquoted as saying, ``[T]he bottom line is we must have a fairer system \nfor providing support to farmers in the next farm bill.''\n  More recently, the administration stepped into the debate to urge the \nCongress to curb its appetite for Federal subsidies and extend more \nbenefits to smaller farming entities. The administration's report makes \nseveral important points to the Congress, including this particular \ncomment:\n\n       Even the most carefully designed government intervention \n     distorts markets and resource allocation, produces unintended \n     consequences, and spreads benefits unevenly. We cannot afford \n     to keep relearning the lessons of the past.\n\n  However, we are not reauthorizing the farm bill today. The Senate \nwill consider legislation to reauthorize the Freedom to Farm bill in \nthe coming year. However, what we are considering today is equally \nimportant, the approval of annual spending for USDA to support farming \nentities.\n  When considering any spending measure, we are obligated to ensure the \nfair and appropriate spending of billions of taxpayer dollars. If we do \nnothing to ensure equity today in this agriculture appropriations bill, \nthe ultimate outcome is that half of this money will go to the large \nand very large farming operations, many of them agribusinesses, with \nlittle left for small to medium farmers that might demonstrate a \ngreater need. It is time to change this alarming trend.\n  Mr. President, I am, once again, greatly disappointed to report the \namount of flagrant porkbarrel spending in this bill. This year's \nAgriculture spending bill includes $372 million in questionable \nearmarks, exceeding last year's level by $136 million. Unfortunately, \nit appears that the porkbarrel ``business as usual'' attitude reigns \nonce again.\n  Few of the annual appropriations bills are more loaded with \nunrequested, low-priority earmarks than this one. Despite the urging \nfrom the administration to eliminate the excessive special interest \nearmarks in the Agriculture appropriations bill, the appropriators \ntacked on 395 of the usual garden-variety, special interest earmarks.\n  I, obviously, will not go through all 395, but let's take a look at \nthe top 10 porkbarrel projects in this year's Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  My colleagues will note that all of these earmarks are specifically \ndesignated to a specific State or a specific entity:\n\n[[Page S11075]]\n\n  No. 10, $150,000 for potato breeding research at Aberdeen, ID;\n  No. 9, $250,000 for a beaver control program in Louisiana;\n  No. 8, $50,000 specifically for the Oregon Garden;\n  No. 7, $300,000 to the Tick Research Unit at Kerrville, TX;\n  No. 6, $500,000 for the Honey Bee Laboratory in Baton Rouge, LA;\n  No. 5, $300,000 for a coyote control program in West Virginia. That \none particularly interests me since in my home State we have a lot of \ncoyotes. I do not see any money in there for the control of coyotes in \nthe great State of Arizona or in any place else in the Southwest, but \nperhaps, as in most cases, with a lot of appropriations bills, there is \na unique problem in the State of West Virginia.\n  No. 4, $750,000 to Western Kentucky University to examine the use of \nchicken litter as a fertilizer or nutrient source. I hope there is a \ncareful division between those two choices. It could have serious \nconsequences. But I am sure the folks at Western Kentucky University \nare well equipped to make sure there is no overlap between using \nchicken litter as a fertilizer or as a nutrient source.\n  No. 3, $435,000 for weed control in North Dakota. They must have a \nterrific problem out there in North Dakota because year after year we \nfind this weed control money going to the great State of North Dakota. \nI hope they get it under control soon. Of course, no other States, \nobviously, in the view of the appropriators, have a weed problem--\nexcept in the great State of North Dakota.\n  No. 2, $90,000 to study the use of acoustics in aquaculture research \nat the National Center for Physical Acoustics; and then,\n  No. 1, $500,000 for the Montana Sheep Institute--$500,000 for that \ninstitute of higher learning in Montana, which obviously is very badly \nneeded up there.\n  Even the reliable earmarks for the National Center for Peanut \nCompetitiveness and shrimp aquaculture are included. I believe that the \nNational Center for Peanut Competitiveness is doing very well because \nwe continue, every year, to make sure that peanut competitiveness is \none of our highest priority projects. I will supply for the Record the \nmany hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars that have been \ndevoted to peanut competitiveness.\n  Funding has never been requested for the National Center for Peanut \nCompetitiveness, yet it has been funded by the appropriators for 5 \nyears. And shrimp aquaculture in Arizona and other States has been a \nconsistent beneficiary of taxpayer dollars for 9 years. Unfortunately, \nthere is little explanation included to justify why targeted Federal \ndollars for earmarked projects are more important than other programs \nto protect food safety or more directly support farm programs in the \nbill.\n\n  This is a spending spree. So far this year more than $8.5 billion of \npork has been included in 10 appropriations bills, including this \nAgriculture spending bill.\n  We are at war. We must do better and heed the words of the Office of \nManagement and Budget Director Mitch Daniels, who said:\n\n       Everything ought to be held up to scrutiny. . . . \n     Situations like this can have clarifying benefit. People who \n     could not identify a low priority or lousy program before may \n     now see the need.\n\n  Apparently, we are not heeding Mr. Daniel's words. And I do not \nbelieve that anyone can say there are no low-priority items in this \nbill before us.\n  I urge my colleagues to work harder to curb our habit of funneling \nresources to provincial ventures. Serving the public good should \ncontinue to be our mandate, and we can only live up to that charge by \nkeeping the process free of unfair and unnecessary spending that unduly \nburdens the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am constrained to say a few words in \ndefense of the committee's decisions with regard to the total overall \nspending in this bill. It is below the President's budget request. \nTwenty-two percent of the funds in this bill are discretionary; 78 \npercent of the funds in the bill are mandatory--mandatory, meaning \nthere is legislation directing the spending be made to those that are \ndefined as eligible for the benefits under the law, under statutes that \nhave been passed by Congress and are now the law of the land.\n  So the subcommittee, in working to identify the appropriate levels of \nfunding, has to look at the law, provide the funds that the Department \nof Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the other \nagencies funded in this bill say will be due and owing by the \nGovernment under statutes that require the money to be paid.\n  Here is an example of one of the programs. It is the Women, Infants, \nand Children Nutrition Program. The participation in that program is \ndefined by law. The eligibility for participation is defined by law. If \nsomeone is eligible and presents themselves to a facility where the \nprogram is administered, they are entitled to the benefits. They are \nentitled to medical care. They are entitled to food supplements. And \nthe funding for that has to be appropriated. So this bill contains \nfunding for the WIC Program.\n  I mentioned, in earlier comments, that we may have to appropriate \nmore money in a supplemental later on for the WIC Program because \nparticipation is outstripping the predictions. So far this year, in \nthis new fiscal year that started October 1, we can see the trend is \nsuch that we may not have appropriated enough money for that program.\n  The Senate will approve that request if it comes from the Department, \nif it comes from the President, for a supplemental for that program.\n  Food Stamps is another program. Because of higher rates of \nunemployment than we had last year, the Food Stamp Program \nparticipation has begun to increase. So there are increases for those \nprogram activities.\n  There are farm programs, as the Senator correctly described, that \nrequire the payment of dollars to those who are eligible for support in \nagricultural production. That also is defined by law.\n  We don't decide how much each person gets in this appropriations \nbill. That has already been decided when we passed the farm bill. This \nbill provides the funds to the Department to make the program dollar \npayments that are required by law to the eligible beneficiaries.\n  On the discretionary funding side, the 22 percent of the funds in \nthis bill over which we did have total control, we came in under the \nPresident's budget request. That is the point I wanted to make on that. \nOn the part of the budget the Congress controls and on which this \nAppropriations Committee is making decisions with respect to dollar \namounts, we are under the President's budget request.\n  So to accuse the committee of throwing money around that is not \nneeded, funding programs that are not justified, doesn't hold up when \nwe look at the exact spending levels compared with the budget request, \ncompared with the economic conditions, compared with the statutes that \nrequire funding for specific purposes under the law.\n  The committee has done a good job, in my opinion. That is why the \nSenator from Wisconsin and I are proud to present this bill to the \nSenate today, and we hope the Senate will support it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11075-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11075-S11076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ANTHRAX ATTACK ON CAPITOL HILL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use this time for just a couple of \nminutes to provide a brief update on our circumstances involving the \nbuildings here in the Capitol complex and the situation involving the \nanthrax experience we have all been attempting to work through.\n  I had hoped before the end of the week to give our colleagues a \nbriefing. There have been meetings ongoing as late as this afternoon. \nBut I believed it was important for those who couldn't come to the \nmeetings to share at least some of the information we have available to \nus.\n\n[[Page S11076]]\n\n  It has been 10 days now since the letter containing anthrax was \nopened in my office in the Hart Building. We now have the final results \non all the nasal swabs collected by the attending physician's office. \nOf the more than 6,000 swabs, 28 were positive for exposure. All 28 of \nthe people whose nasal swabs were positive were on the fifth and sixth \nfloors of the Hart Building's southeast quadrant last Monday. All are \nbeing treated with antibiotics. I am happy to say that all currently \nare healthy.\n  In all, more than 400 people who worked in or passed through the \nfifth or sixth floor of the Hart Building's southeast quadrant last \nMonday are being treated with a full 60-day course of antibiotics.\n  I know I speak for all of us on Capitol Hill when I say how deeply \nsaddened we are by the deaths this week of the two postal workers from \nthe Brentwood mail facility. We are also concerned about the two other \nemployees from the Brentwood facility who are currently hospitalized \nand fighting anthrax infections.\n  On behalf of the entire Senate, I say that our thoughts and prayers \nare with them, their families, and all of the men and women of the U.S. \nPostal Service. They are dedicated public servants and they, like the \nCapitol Police and Senate employees exposed to anthrax, are innocent \nvictims.\n  As for the buildings, the Capitol itself has been open all week for \nofficial business. After virtually around-the-clock environmental \ntesting, a number of other buildings in the Capitol complex have begun \nreopening.\n  The Russell Senate Office Building reopened yesterday. The Rayburn \nand Cannon House Office Buildings reopened today. Also open today are \nthe Senate day care center, Webster Hall, the Senate page dorm, and the \nPostal Square where Senate offices have been given temporary work \nspaces. The mailroom in the Dirksen Senate Office Building where a \ntrace of anthrax was discovered last week is being remediated today. \nPending the results of environmental tests, it is my expectation that \nthe Dirksen Office Building will be reopened tomorrow.\n  We have also learned that evidence of anthrax was found on the air-\nconditioning filter on the ninth floor of the Hart Building and the \nstairwell leading from the eighth to the ninth floor. The experts say \nthis is neither a surprise nor a concern. Environmental testing and \nnasal swabs of this section of the Hart Building show no further \nexposure beyond what we already know.\n  In addition, late last night we learned that the environmental tests \nin the freight elevator in the southwest quadrant of the Hart Senate \nOffice Building tested positive. Based on this finding, the attending \nphysician now recommends that anyone who rode in that freight elevator \non October 11, the probable date the letter was delivered to my office, \nor later, be treated with a 60-day course of antibiotics. Anyone who \nrode on the southwest Hart freight elevator should see the attending \nphysician.\n\n  The Hart Building will reopen as it is completely safe. The reopening \nhas been the subject of a good deal of discussion with all of our teams \nof consultants in and out of the Government. We are looking at the most \nappropriate way with which to remediate the Hart Building. Some have \nsuggested we remediate the area before any of it is open. If that is \npossible, that will be our plan.\n  If it is determined that it is not possible to remediate it in the \nnot-too-distant future, within the next several days, we may have to \nremediate it in stages and open up the Hart Building in stages.\n  First, though, before any part of the building reopens, environmental \nspecialists will examine the nine floors in the southeast quadrant and \nthe area near the southwest freight elevator where anthrax was \ndetected. The exact footprint of the southwest quadrant to be examined \nis still being determined by both scientific and medical specialists.\n  This anthrax assault has forced a number of temporary changes in the \nway we work on Capitol Hill. On Monday and Tuesday, all 100 Senators \nworked out of the Capitol Building. It may be the first time Senators \nshared such close quarters since the Russell Office Building opened in \n1909. While the accommodations were a little cramped, the spirit of \ndetermination and cooperation in the Capitol this week has certainly \nbeen admirable.\n  This incident has also forced another temporary change on the Hill. \nEvery week more than 250,000 pieces of mail are sent to the U.S. Senate \nalone. The mail Senators receive is an important lifeline. It is how \nour constituents tell us what is on their minds and how they \ncommunicate when they need help.\n  Since last Monday, when the U.S. Postal Service halted delivery to \nthe Capitol, mail for Senators has been piling up in a regional postal \nfacility. It will continue to be held there until we are absolutely \ncertain it poses no risk to anybody, and it will be remediated as well. \nThe postal workers who handle it and the staffers who open it will all \nbe protected.\n  The Senate Sergeant at Arms is working closely with the Postal \nService and with medical and environmental experts to establish \nprocedures for safe mail handling and delivery.\n  This has been a difficult week--not only for my staff and others here \non Capitol Hill but for our Nation's postal workers and for many \nAmericans. My staff and I are grateful for the outpouring of concern \nand support we continue to receive from all over the country.\n  I thank the many experts who continue to work virtually around the \nclock--the Federal Government, the military, the District of Columbia \nand, of course, our colleagues and staff here in the Senate. The \nchallenge facing these people, in particular, is unprecedented in \nAmerican history. To a person, they have responded admirably and \nenabled the Senate to move ahead with the legislative business of our \nNation. I am grateful to each one of them, and I thank them for their \neffort.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1984:\n       On page 78, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 7  . PATHOGEN REDUCTION PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.\n\n       (a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to label, mark, stamp, or tag as ``inspected and \n     passed'' meat, meat food products, poultry, or poultry \n     products under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 \n     et seq.) or the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. \n     451 et seq.) produced in establishments that do not meet \n     pathogen reduction performance standards (including \n     regulations), as determined by the Secretary in accordance \n     with applicable rules of practice.\n       (b) Rulemaking.--Not later than May 31, 2002 the Secretary \n     shall initiate public rulemaking to ensure the scientific \n     basis for any such pathogen reduction performance standard.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment, I believe, comes at a very \ncritical time in our Nation for concerns about our safety, about food \nsafety, about what the Secretary of Health and Human Services has told \nus--that less than 1 percent of our imported food is being inspected. \nThere is great concern.\n  Quite frankly, I have been involved in agricultural matters now for \n27 years. For many of those 27 years, I was involved, in both the House \nand the Senate, in changing the inspection procedures at the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture dealing with meat, poultry, meat products, \nand poultry products to ensure that the people of our\n\n[[Page S11077]]\n\ncountry would have the highest assurance that the meat products and \npoultry products they were purchasing in the store would be safe, that \nthey would have reduced pathogens, and that people could buy them with \nthe absolute assurance that every possible step was taken to ensure \nthey would not get sick.\n  We have had cases in the recent past. We know about the Jack In The \nBox and E. Coli 015787. People died. We know from some of the lunch \nmeat packaged in a plant in Michigan where people got sick. Some died \nthere as well. There isn't a week that goes by that we don't hear \nreports of some illness someplace because of food, food products. It is \nnot always meat, it may be other things.\n  So during these years, we changed the processes to ensure we would \nhave meat and meat products that would be as free from pathogens as \npossible. We called that the HACCP. That is what everybody calls it. It \nstands for the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point rule. We adopted \nthat in 1996. It was a landmark revision of the meat and poultry \ninspection system. This rule implemented sweeping changes to accomplish \none primary goal: To ensure safer meat and poultry products, to reduce \nthe level of pathogens on meat and poultry products. That is why we did \nit. It took us years to get to that point.\n  It was a significant departure from previous meat and poultry \ninspection efforts--the old poke and sniff system. That is what it was. \nYou looked at it, you poked it and sniffed it, and if it seemed OK, it \nwent through. It did absolutely nothing to ensure the reduction of \npathogens.\n  So for the first time, USDA was not only focused on ensuring good \nsanitation in plants, which we had always done, going clear back to the \nWholesome Meat Act, but also on reducing pathogens--the things that \nreally were making people sick. You might have had a plant that wasn't \nthe cleanest in the world, but it may not have had pathogens. Maybe the \nplant looked clean on the outside--clean and sparkling--but at some \npoint in that processing plant, or packing plant, pathogens could be \nentering the meat or meat products.\n  The pathogen reduction rule that accompanied the HACCP rule \nestablished a modern inspection system based on two fundamental \nprinciples:\n  First, the meat and poultry industry has the primary responsibility \nto ensure the safety of our products by designing and implementing food \nsafety plants. Again, this is something the industry wanted. All these \nyears, the industry kept coming to us saying: We can do it ourselves. \nWe can set up systems to control the safety of our food and our meat \nand our meat products. So we said: OK, fine, you can have that \nauthority. We will give that to you, along with the responsibility. So \nthat was the first fundamental principle--that the industry was now \ngoing to be responsible.\n  The second fundamental principle was that the public health is best \nserved by reducing the level of pathogens on meat and poultry products \nnationwide. You might say, well, if you buy something with pathogens on \nit, if you cook it well enough, you don't have to worry. Fine. But a \nlot of people don't. A lot of people don't. So we said the public \nhealth of America is best served by reducing the pathogens on meat and \npoultry products.\n  To accomplish these two principles, USDA developed pathogen reduction \nstandards using salmonella as the indicator bacteria.\n  These standards set targets that plants have to meet for reducing \nmicrobial pathogen levels. If a plant repeatedly fails to meet these \ntargets, USDA may refuse to inspect the plant's products, effectively \nshutting the plant down until that plant implements a corrective action \nplan to meet the pathogen reduction standard. Recognize, I say ``may.'' \nThe USDA may refuse to inspect the plant's products. It does not say \n``shall.'' It says, ``may.'' So there is broad authority for the \nSecretary of Agriculture to work with a plant. If it has a problem, if \nthere are pathogens that have showed up in the meat or poultry \nproducts, the Secretary can work with the plant.\n  How did the pathogens get there? From where did they come? How do you \ncontrol it? How do you keep it from happening in the future? That has \nbeen the process by which USDA has operated under this rule.\n  Quite frankly, we have had some pretty amazing results. I use this \nfirst chart again to repeat for the sake of emphasis what I said. To \nensure safe food we needed two things: We needed the HACCP plan. Plus, \nwe needed the pathogen reduction standards.\n  If you take away one or the other, it does not work. So you need \nboth. So what has happened since 1996 when we first changed this and \nstarted implementing it? From 1998 to 2000, 2 years, salmonella, which \nmakes you pretty sick--I know because I had it once--the class of the \nproduct, using the present performance standard, the one we now have, \nboilers have gone from 20 percent to 11.4 percent, almost cut in half. \nAs I understand, we are making even further progress there.\n  Ground beef went from 7.5 percent to 4.4 percent, again almost a 50-\npercent reduction. Ground chicken, where we had some baseline studies, \nwe went from 44.6 percent incidents in ground chicken of salmonella to \n16.2 percent.\n  Are our people safer today? You bet they are safer. By a long shot, \nthey are safer in eating meat, meat products, poultry and poultry \nproducts. So it is working.\n  So what is this amendment all about that I just offered? What \nhappened was there was a plant in Texas called Supreme Beef. Basically, \nSupreme Beef had been warned three times by the Department of \nAgriculture that they had too high a level of pathogen, salmonella, on \ntheir ground beef. This was a ground beef plant. They warned them one \ntime.\n  Did they shut the plant down? No, they did not shut the plant down. \nThey said: You have too much salmonella in your ground beef. We found \nit. Do something about it. Work with us.\n  Sometime later, I think about a year later, if I am not mistaken, \nUSDA inspected the plant again, took some samples, and found out there \nwas still a high level of salmonella in the ground beef. The USDA said \nto Supreme Beef, you have to clean up your act. You have to find out \nwhere these are coming from and stop it.\n  Again, some time went by. USDA went back, inspected them the third \ntime and found that same high level of salmonella in their ground beef. \nThis time they told them to shut down.\n  During the entire time USDA was working with Supreme Beef to get them \nto clean up their act, we continued to buy ground beef from that same \nplant for the school lunch program, even though it had high levels of \nsalmonella, putting our kids in school at risk. Yet the Department of \nAgriculture worked with Supreme Beef to get them to find out where was \nthe salmonella coming from and to stop it--three times. Yet Supreme \nBeef just thumbed their nose at the USDA.\n  Then what happened? After USDA shut them down, lawyers for Supreme \nBeef went to court. They went to court arguing the Secretary of \nAgriculture did not have the authority to shut down Supreme Beef based \nupon these salmonella standards. The case was argued in Federal \nDistrict Court in Texas. Supreme Beef lawyers went to court challenging \nthe authority of the Secretary to take that action. It was argued at \nlength.\n  On May 25 of 2000, 1\\1/2\\ years ago, the Federal District Court for \nthe Northern District of Texas held the United States Department of \nAgriculture does not have the statutory authority to enforce its \nsalmonella pathogen reduction standard for ground beef.\n  That case is now on appeal to the appeals court. We do not know when \na decision is going to be made.\n  Quite frankly, the Texas case is a frontal assault on microbiological \nstandards, the very thing the people of our country are highly \nconcerned about right now. The decision undermines the only objective \nstandard we have right now to ensure that meat and poultry plants are \nreducing the level of pathogens on its products. It threatens the very \ncore of the pathogen reduction rule itself.\n  Let me be very clear. I think the district court got it wrong. I \nbelieve the existing meat and poultry inspection acts do give USDA that \nauthority to issue and enforce pathogen reduction standards. I think it \nis intolerable to have the very core of this rule trampled by a handful \nof industry lawyers\n\n[[Page S11078]]\n\nbent on ensuring there are no enforceable pathogen standards--none. \nThat is what they want. That is why I have offered this amendment.\n  This amendment has broad support among public health groups, consumer \ngroups, farmers, labor unions, senior citizens, even the meat and \npoultry industry itself. The American Farm Bureau Federation supports \nthis amendment, AARP, the American Food Safety Institute, American \nPublic Health Association, the Consumer Federation of America, the \nNational Farmers Union, the National Parent Teachers Association, the \nRanchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund, the Iowa Meat Processors \nAssociation from my own State, the Iowa Pork Producers Association, and \nthe Iowa Farm Bureau Federation, the Consumers Union.\n  I ask unanimous consent the list of all these groups that support my \namendment and the letters from these groups in support of my amendment \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Supporters of the Harkin Amendment\n\n       AARP.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Food Safety Institute.\n       American Public Health Association.\n       Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n       Consumer Federation of America.\n       Consumer Union.\n       Government Accountability Project.\n       National Consumers League.\n       National Farmers Union.\n       National Parent Teachers Association.\n       Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund United Stock Growers \n     of America.\n       Iowa Meat Processors Association.\n       Iowa Pork Producers Association.\n       Iowa Farm Bureau Federation.\n       Safe Tables Our Priority.\n       United Food and Commercial Workers Union.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 National PTA,\n\n                                  Chicago, IL, September 26, 2001.\n     Senate Appropriations Committee,\n     Agriculture Subcommittee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to urge your support for the \n     amendment to the agriculture appropriations bill that will be \n     introduced by Senator Harkin to clarify USDA's legal \n     authority to enforce standards for reducing pathogens in meat \n     and poultry products.\n       As president of the National PTA, I represent over 6.4 \n     million parents, teachers, students, and other advocates \n     committed to the health and safety of our nation's children. \n     National PTA supports legislation to sustain, improve, and \n     expand federal child nutrition programs, including school \n     meals and antihunger efforts. Such advocacy efforts fall \n     short, however, if the meals fed our children are tainted by \n     foodborne pathogens, to which children are even more \n     susceptible than are adults.\n       The HACCP/Pathogen Reduction rule adopted by the USDA in \n     1996 included standards to reduce these pathogens. Last year, \n     however, a federal court barred USDA from enforcing these \n     standards. Senator Harkin's amendment is needed to clarify \n     that USDA does indeed have the authority under the Federal \n     Meat and Poultry Inspection Acts to enforce pathogen \n     reduction standards in meat and poultry products.\n       To improve the safety of our children's meals, I urge you \n     to support Senator Harkin's amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Shirley Igo,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of AARP, I am writing in \n     support of your amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations \n     Bill that would help ensure a safer meat supply. Food safety \n     is of particular concern to older Americans who, along with \n     young children and those with immune deficiencies, are at \n     particular risk from foodborne illness.\n       The amendment is long overdue. We are pleased that it would \n     clarify the authority of the U.S. Department of Agriculture \n     (USDA) to set standards to control pathogens in meat. \n     Unfortunately, this authority has come into question as a \n     result of a court case in Texas, in which a meat company \n     successfully sued the Department to prevent it from enforcing \n     its performance standard for Salmonella, a standard that the \n     company had failed to satisfy on three separate occasions.\n       We agree that it is imperative to reaffirm USDA's authority \n     to adopt and enforce performance standards; otherwise, the \n     effectiveness of the comprehensive Hazards Analysis Critical \n     Control Points (HACCP)-based meat inspection system will be \n     seriously jeopardized.\n       We strongly support your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William D. Novelli,\n     Executive Director and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 16, 2001.\n     Ms. Carol Tucker Foreman,\n     The Food Policy Institute, Consumer Federation of America, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Carol: Thank you for your October 15, 2001, letter to \n     Secretary Veneman about performance standards.\n       The Department of Agriculture (USDA) believes that we must \n     have performance standards for pathogens. We recognize that \n     some groups have questioned what the appropriate pathogen \n     performance standards should be and whether the present \n     performance standards are scientifically based. We believe \n     that the results of two studies now underway by the National \n     Academy of Sciences and the National Advisory Committee on \n     Microbiological Criteria for Foods will provide important \n     scientific information. In the meantime, USDA remains \n     committed to enforcing the current performance standards at \n     every meat and poultry establishment in the country to which \n     they apply.\n       Certain groups also have raised questions about the \n     application of the pathogen reduction performance standards. \n     USDA supports the retention of the Secretary's discretion in \n     determining the appropriate application of the standards.\n       Because of pending litigation filed in 2000, the \n     Department's policy is to refrain from commenting on any \n     matter that relates directly to the Supreme Beef Processors, \n     Inc., case. For this reason, we cannot comment on legislative \n     amendments sponsored by Senator Harkin or by the industry.\n       We appreciate hearing from you. I'm looking forward to \n     working with you and our other stakeholders to ensure a safe \n     food supply for all Americans.\n           Warm regards,\n                                                   Elsa A. Murano,\n     Under Secretary, Food Safety.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                          CFA,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: Consumer Federation of America urges \n     you to vote FOR the Harkin amendment to H.R. 2330, the \n     agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal year 2002. The \n     amendment specifically states that the Secretary of \n     Agriculture has authority to impose and enforce limits on \n     disease causing organisms in meat and poultry products. This \n     element of the USDA's new inspection system has been \n     challenged in court. Opponents charge that laws passed in \n     1906 and 1967 did not contemplate a science-based inspection \n     system and assumed inspection would include only visible \n     examination by federal inspectors.\n       But federal inspectors cannot see the pathogenic bacteria \n     that cause food-borne illness. This is one reason that food \n     poisoning has become a serious public health problem in the \n     United States. The Centers for Disease Control reports that \n     each year contaminated food causes 76 million illnesses, \n     325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths. Contaminated meat \n     and poultry products are often implicated in food poisoning \n     cases.\n       To help reduce the terrible toll of food-borne illness, \n     USDA introduced a new science-based inspection program, the \n     Pathogen Reduction and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point \n     (PR/HACCP) inspection system. The new program sets limits on \n     the levels of Salmonella that can be present in raw meat and \n     poultry products.\n       Since USDA began setting and enforcing Salmonella \n     standards, the amount of Salmonella in meat and poultry \n     products has dropped substantially. For some products, it has \n     dropped by half. While USDA inspectors remain in the plants, \n     the performance standards are the only objective measure of \n     whether a plant's HACCP program actually produces food that \n     is cleaner, safer and less likely to cause food-borne illness \n     than the old inspection system.\n       If the pathogen standards are eliminated, each company will \n     be free to decide how much pathogen contamination is \n     acceptable. A meat or poultry company could produce filthy \n     products with thousands of Salmonella bacteria. Those \n     products would be stamped, ``USDA Inspected and Approved'' \n     and sold to unsuspecting consumers.\n       Consumer Federation of America has strongly supported \n     Pathogen Reduction/HACCP. It is an important step forward in \n     meat and poultry inspection. But our support has always been \n     conditioned on USDA setting and enforcing pathogen controls. \n     If this objective measure of adequate performance is dropped, \n     we will withdraw our support and inform our members that the \n     USDA inspection seal is largely meaningless.\n       The pathogen reduction requirements do not unnecessarily \n     burden industry. Frankly, the performance standards are not \n     as stringent as they should be. Plants have only a .8 percent \n     chance of failing three times in a row. Hundreds of plants \n     have been tested. Only four have failed the test three times. \n     Further, USDA makes every effort to help plants comply. If a \n     plant fails once, USDA works with management to adjust the \n     company's processes so they can meet the standard. The plant \n     is tested again and it it still fails, USDA continues to work \n     with them. Then they are tested yet again. This process may \n     go on for almost a year. During all that time the company's \n     products continue to be approved and sold.\n       In this system, everyone benefits. Companies know what the \n     standard is. Companies that fail get help from USDA so they \n     can pass subsequent tests. Consumers benefit\n\n[[Page S11079]]\n\n     from the reduction in disease causing organisms. The Harkin \n     amendment will assure that the pathogen controls remain in \n     effect.\n       With threats of terrorist attacks on our food supply \n     possible, it would be shocking if Congress failed to protect \n     these standards. It would surely increase the risk of food-\n     borne disease and further diminish public confidence in our \n     food supply.\n       We urge your support for the Harkin amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Howard Metzenbaum,\n                                                         Chairman.\n     Carol Tucker Foreman,\n     Director, Food Policy Institute.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Safe Food Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2001.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned members of the Safe Food \n     Coalition urge you to support an amendment by Senator Harkin \n     to H.R. 2330, the Agriculture Appropriations Bill for FY \n     2002. The amendment clarifies USDA's authority to set \n     standards to control the presence of pathogens in meat and \n     poultry products. It is needed for the following reasons:\n       USDA's Rule Limiting The Presence Of Disease Causing \n     Bacteria In Meat And Poultry Is Threatened. A meat company in \n     Texas has sued USDA to prevent the Department from enforcing \n     its Salmonella performance standard. The Texas company, a \n     major supplier of meat to the school lunch program, failed \n     the Salmonella standard three times. USDA sought to close the \n     plant. A federal district court allowed the company to \n     continue selling meat, despite the company's apparent \n     inability to meet this basic food safety test.\n       The decision is under review by the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the 5th Circuit. If that court rules against the USDA, \n     the department will be unable to enforce limits on Salmonella \n     in ground beef in any of the states comprising the 5th \n     Circuit. Further, the meat industry continues to pressure \n     USDA to drop Salmonella testing all across the country.\n       The Salmonella standard is reasonable and it is effective. \n     Since it went into effect over three years ago, Salmonella \n     contamination has dropped in all tested products--dropped by \n     50 percent in some. USDA applies this test in thousands of \n     slaughter and grinding facilities. Fewer than a half-dozen \n     plants have failed the test three times. There are two \n     reasons for the high pass rate. First, the performance \n     standard is not hard to meet. In practice it falls below the \n     industry median for each product. To pass, a plant need not \n     even be as good as the least effective plant in the top half \n     of all plants. In 2000, 91 percent of the ground beef plants \n     tested by USDA under the rule met the standard on each round \n     of tests and 92 percent of the 344 small ground beef plants \n     tested met the standard on each round.\n       Second, USDA helps plants meet the standard. If a plant \n     fails once, USDA staff works with the plant to help it \n     resolve the problem. If it fails a second time, the USDA \n     again seeks to help the plant correct the deficiencies in its \n     HACCP plan. It is only when a plant, after getting help from \n     USDA and being given multiple opportunities to pass, fails a \n     third time to meet the Salmonella standard, that it becomes \n     subject to sanctions. In the case of Supreme Beef, almost a \n     year passed between the time Supreme failed the first test \n     and the point at which USDA finally tried to close the plant. \n     Consumers might well ask why USDA allows any plant that fails \n     to meet the Salmonella contamination limit to continue \n     operating for such extended periods.\n       Limits on Salmonella in meat and poultry are basic to the \n     USDA's new inspection system, officially named the Pathogen \n     Reduction and HACCP System. In 1996, USDA began to shift from \n     its old inspection program to a new one, the so-called HACCP \n     system. Under the new system, plants are responsible for \n     producing clean, safe products. The Salmonella standard, \n     Salmonella testing, and enforcement of the standard are the \n     means by which the government works to assure that a plant's \n     HACCP program does what it promises, providing an acceptable \n     level of public health protection. Consumer and public health \n     organizations initially opposed the HACCP program. We gave \n     our support only after HACCP was coupled with pathogen \n     reduction to help protect public health. The Salmonella \n     performance standard, Salmonella testing, and enforcement are \n     basic to our continued support for the program. Salmonella \n     test results are our objective proof that a HACCP plan works \n     to limit the presence of these disease causing organisms.\n       Meat and poultry are the only products that come to the \n     consumer with a Government warranty. Enclosed with this \n     letter are copies of the USDA seal of inspection. Every \n     package of meat and poultry sold to consumers is stamped, \n     ``Inspected and Approved, USDA'' or ``Inspected for \n     Wholesomeness, USDA.''\n       No other product, not cars, nor tires, nor airplanes--not \n     even other food carries an assurance that the U.S. government \n     has examined it and attests that it meets a standard for \n     wholesomeness. Americans have a right to assume that products \n     carrying the USDA seal will be reasonably safe and clean, not \n     loaded with disease causing organisms. It is not unreasonable \n     to ask the companies whose products carry a U.S. government \n     seal of approval to demonstrate that those products are clean \n     and safe and relatively free of disease causing organisms.\n       Food-borne illness is a serious public health problem in \n     the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control \n     contaminated food cause 76 million illnesses, 325,000 \n     hospitalization and 5,000 deaths each year. Government \n     standards must limit the organisms that cause these \n     illnesses. The Harkin amendment will ensure that whatever \n     decision is reached by the Court of Appeals, beef shipped \n     within the US will continue to meet strict safety standards \n     for Salmonella.\n       Please do not turn the clock back on food safety. Do not \n     break faith with consumers who assume that the USDA seal of \n     inspection has some integrity. Do not allow companies who \n     fail to limit pathogens in their products to continue to sell \n     their meat and poultry as ``USDA Inspected and Approved.'' \n     Maintaining the pathogen standard will help preserve public \n     health. it will also protect legitimate businesses from those \n     companies that are unable or unwilling to meet a decent \n     standard.\n       Again, we ask you to support the Harkin amendment.\n                                             Carol Tucker Foreman,\n     Coordinator, SFC, Director, Food Policy Institute, Consumer \n     Federation of America, Assistant Secretary, USDA, 1977-81, on \n     Behalf of the following organizations:\n\n       American Public Health Association.\n       Consumers Union (Consumers Union is not a member of the \n     Safe Food Coalition but endorses this position statement).\n       Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n       Government Accountability Project.\n       Consumer Federation of America.\n       National Consumers League.\n       Safe Tables--Our Priority (S.T.O.P.)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is a broad coalition, from farm groups to labor unions \nto consumer groups to parent teachers. It covers the entire spectrum of \nthe food safety chain from farm to table.\n  Now, some may be surprised there is meat and poultry industry support \nfor my amendment. Do not be surprised. My staff and I have spent hours \nand hours in meetings trying to arrive at a compromise with industry \nopponents of these microbiological performance standards.\n  My door has been open to all. There is no one who can say I would not \nmeet with them to discuss how we reach some agreement. The reason we \nhave this support from many meat and poultry groups is because the \npathogen reduction standard is simply the right thing to do for food \nsafety.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield to my friend from Illinois who \nhas led the charge for a single food agency in this country. He is on \nthe right course. I hope he gets it done soon.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to be an ally on this cause, as well. I \nrecollect a few months ago there was a release on the Web site of the \nUSDA suggesting they were going to relax, if not remove, the salmonella \nstandard for school lunch programs. Many people saw it and started to \nrespond.\n  If I am not mistaken, the very next morning, Ari Fleischer at the \nWhite House, in the opening briefing said: This is not true; it is not \nwhere the USDA stands; we are for the strictest standard when it comes \nto the presence of salmonella in ground beef for school lunch programs.\n  What the Senator from Iowa is arguing for, if I am not mistaken, is \nthe position of the USDA, and the position President Bush has taken, is \nthat they will establish the standards--the district court case in \nTexas notwithstanding.\n  The Senator from Iowa, a Democratic Senator, is offering a \nreaffirmation of the position taken by both Democratic and Republican \nDepartments of Agriculture. Does the Senator from Iowa recall this?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate my friend from Illinois bringing that up. I \nhave it later in my speech someplace. You beat me to the gun.\n  It is true, there was this indication that someone in the Department, \nprobably at the behest of the industry lawyers, maybe the same one who \nbrought the Supreme Beef case, I don't know, decided they would relax \nthe salmonella standards on the very meat our kids eat in school.\n  As the Senator said, the hue and cry was incredible. The \nadministration came to its senses and said the next morning: It said \nabsolutely not. The administration said it will enforce those standards \nand it wanted the toughest standards. All we are doing is giving the \nSecretary of Agriculture the statutory authority to do just that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So those who oppose this amendment not only oppose a \nstandard created by the Clinton administration and the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture, but a standard that has been reaffirmed by the Bush \nadministration in its current Department of Agriculture.\n\n[[Page S11080]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I believe that is entirely true.\n  As I said, the reason we have such broad support is because the \npathogen reduction standards is the right thing to do for food safety. \nThe vast majority of our packers and our processers in this country are \nconscientious and want to do the right thing. They work with the \nDepartment of Agriculture. As my chart shows, they have been \nenergetically reducing the number of pathogens that enter our foods. \nBut, as anything else, there are always some out there who believe they \ncan shave a little bit, skim a little bit, make an extra buck here or \nthere. And after all, they can cite the Supreme Beef case in Texas, and \nsay: You don't have the authority to enforce this standard.\n  Those who have refused to compromise at all have resorted to a \ncampaign against this amendment based on untruths and misstatements. I \nwant to set the record straight on some of these most egregious \nexamples.\n  First, industry opponents have said that the current administration \ndoes not support having enforceable pathogen standards. As my friend \nfrom Illinois pointed out, just read what Ari Fleischer said at that \npress conference that morning, they want the toughest standards.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nUnder Secretary for Food Safety, Dr. Murano.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 16, 2001.\n     Ms. Carol Tucker Foreman,\n     The Food Policy Institute, Consumer Federation of America, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Carol: Thank you for your October 15, 2001, letter to \n     Secretary Veneman about performance standards.\n       The Department of Agriculture (USDA) believes that we must \n     have performance standards for pathogens. We recognize that \n     some groups have questioned what the appropriate pathogen \n     performance standards should be and whether the present \n     performance standards are scientifically based. We believe \n     that the results of two studies now underway by the National \n     Academy of Sciences and the National Advisory Committee on \n     Microbiological Criteria for Foods will provide important \n     scientific information. In the meantime, USDA remains \n     committed to enforcing the current performance standards at \n     every meat and poultry establishment in the country to which \n     they apply.\n       Certain groups also have raised questions about the \n     application of the pathogen reduction performance standards. \n     USDA supports the retention of the Secretary's discretion in \n     determining the appropriate application of the standards.\n       Because of pending litigation filed in 2000, the \n     Department's policy is to refrain from commenting on any \n     matter that relates directly to the Supreme Beef Processors, \n     Inc., case. For this reason, we cannot comment on legislative \n     amendments sponsored by Senator Harkin or by the industry.\n       We appreciate hearing from you. I'm looking forward to \n     working with you and our other stakeholders to ensure a safe \n     food supply for all Americans.\n           Warm regards,\n                                                   Elsa A. Murano,\n                                     Under Secretary, Food Safety.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Department of Agriculture believes we must have \nperformance standards with pathogens.\n  Second, the industry opponents have said my amendment will codify the \nsalmonella performance standard. This is patently untrue. We only \nclarify that the Secretary has a generic authority. We do not set any \nstandard. I leave that to the scientists.\n  Industry opponents claim my amendment would limit the Secretary's \ndiscretion to determine when a plant has failed to meet the performance \nstandard. This is demonstrably untrue. We worked with Secretary Veneman \nto ensure my amendment preserves the Secretary's existing flexibility \nto work with plants in danger of failing the standard. We both want to \navoid withdrawing inspections where plants are genuinely working to \ncome into compliance with the standard and there is no immediate threat \nto public health. Obviously, if there is an immediate threat to public \nhealth, like E. coli, or something like that which will kill you, \nobviously, the Secretary should have the authority to shut that plant \ndown.\n  There are a number of other arguments they have made which are \npatently untrue, but I will not get into them here. In deciding whether \nto support my amendment, my colleagues should consider the following \nquestion: How do you explain to America's families why a plant shipping \nground beef with salmonella levels more than five times the national \naverage, ground beef that is going into the School Lunch Program, how \ndo you explain to our families that plant shouldn't even be asked to \nclean up its act? These are the facts of the case in Texas. The plant \nhad the worst record on pathogen levels in the country and one of its \nbiggest customers was the School Lunch Program. It failed three rounds \nof salmonella testing. No one said, we are shutting you down. They \nasked them to submit a plan for corrective action. The owner refused. I \nthink when the health of our kids is at stake and our families are at \nstake, this is common sense.\n  Last, in trying to reach an agreement with those who are opposed to \nthis amendment, I added a section. I will be very clear so people \nunderstand this added section. I will read it:\n\n       Not later than May 31, 2002, the Secretary shall initiate \n     public rulemaking to ensure the scientific basis for any such \n     pathogen reduction standard.\n\n  Now, the first part of my amendment basically says that between now \nand then the Secretary has the statutory authority to enforce the \nexisting pathogen reduction standards based upon the salmonella \nbacteria indicator.\n  That is all it says. So those who are opposed to my amendment are \nsaying they want to leave a gap that between now and some indefinite \ntime in the future the Secretary will not have that authority, will not \nhave that authority to enforce a pathogen reduction standard.\n  People ought to take a look around and see what is happening in this \ncountry. The people of this country are demanding we reduce the \npathogens in our food and in our food supply. We have been doing it \nunder the existing standard, but because of one district court case in \nTexas that said we did not give the Secretary the statutory authority, \nthat is now in question.\n  All my amendment does is give the Secretary the statutory authority \nto enforce the standards. We don't set the standards. And then it says \nfurther, by May 31 of next year the Secretary has to initiate public \nrulemaking to ensure that a pathogen reduction standard is based on \ngood science.\n  How can anyone argue with that?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1987 to Amendment No. 1984\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I send a second-degree \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Nelson], for himself and Mr. \n     Miller, proposes an amendment numbered 1987 to amendment No. \n     1984.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike all after the word ``sec'' and insert the following:\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act shall be used by the Secretary of Agriculture \n     shall be available for application of the mark of inspection \n     to any meat or poultry product that is shown to be \n     adulterated: Provided further, That the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall prepare a report, which is to be submitted \n     by May 15, 2002, to the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives, regarding the role \n     of microbiological monitoring and standards relating to \n     indicator organisms and pathogens in determining the \n     effectiveness and adequacy of Food Safety and Inspection \n     Service Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) \n     meat and poultry safety programs, including relevant points \n     of general scientific agreement regarding such monitoring, \n     and analysis of the microbiological data accumulated by the \n     Secretary to identify opportunities to further enhance food \n     safety, as well as any modification of regulations or \n     statutory enforcement authority that may advance food safety; \n     Provided further, That not later than August 1, 2002, the \n     Secretary shall initiate public rulemaking to improve the \n     effectiveness and adequacy of the Hazard Analysis and \n     Critical Control Point (HAACP) System established under part \n     417 of title 9, Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise in support of this \nsecond-\n\n[[Page S11081]]\n\ndegree amendment and believe it requires some degree of explanation as \nto how it may differ from the amendment which has been offered.\n  It has been characterized that this is an issue about food safety. \nBut truly the difference between his amendment and mine is not about \nfood safety, it is about whether or not we are going to enforce a \nflawed standard before we have studies completed that this body \nmandated last year. That is what this issue is all about, not whether \nor not we are going to have food safety.\n  My amendment doesn't move to table Senator Harkin's amendment, but it \nseeks to improve it. I believe in fact it does.\n  We worked very diligently to find a way to have a solution. But the \nsolution would have required authorizing and empowering the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, by statute, by his amendment, to enforce a \nstandard about which a court in Texas, a Federal district court in \nTexas, has said, among other things:\n\n       The performance standard may not be enforced because it \n     doesn't measure food safety.\n\n  I am for food safety. But I am not for a standard that doesn't \nmeasure food safety. Nor am I in favor of empowering specifically \neliminating any question about the authority of an agency to enforce a \nstandard that does not measure food safety.\n  I am most definitely interested in making certain that we have food \nsafety. That is why I worked very closely with my colleague to work out \nsome language which he has included in his amendment. I commend him for \ndoing that because that language says that, by May 31 of next year, the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture must initiate rulemaking and a standard \nbased on these studies which are expected to be completed by that time.\n  I think it would be unwise for this body to now empower the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to enforce standards that do not measure food \nsafety after, last year, authorizing and requiring studies that will, \nin fact, establish a standard that will be aimed at measuring food \nsafety and empowering the agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nto be able to use those standards in order to impose an appropriate \nsalmonella standard for all food. That is what the question is really \nall about: Do we enforce and authorize and require the enforcement of a \nstandard that doesn't rise to that level versus authorizing the agency \nand requiring the agency to, by a certain time--a timeframe certain--to \nhave the rulemaking in place in order to impose an appropriate standard \nbased on sound science.\n  That is what this issue is about: Whether or not we are going to have \na standard based on sound science or one that the court says doesn't \nmeasure food safety.\n  There are some other things the amendment does that I think are \nimportant. It specifies that food that is unsafe or labeled \ninaccurately or is otherwise adulterated cannot bear the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture mark of inspection.\n  It further goes on to make sure that the agency, the Secretary of \nAgriculture, comes forward with the report that specifies the general \npoints of scientific agreement regarding microbiological testing and \nstandards.\n  This will require a standard that we can be sure is based on sound \nscience. Until these reports are done, we can't be sure the current \nstandard is strict enough. It is not a question of whether it is too \nlax. We don't know.\n  I am unlikely to support the requirement of that standard until, in \nfact, we have the studies done to know if it is strict enough. The \nsuggestion might be that it is not strict enough. But I suggest we do \nnot know and we will not know until and unless these studies that were \nauthorized by this body last year have been completed and a rule \nadopted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  I yield to my colleague from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I think it is so important for us to \nmake sure we understand what we are talking about tonight and what some \nof our colleagues have expressed. We do not oppose a standard which was \nmentioned earlier by the Senator from Illinois. What we do want is a \ngood standard.\n  This body requested studies this time last year as we debated this \nwhole issue. Since then, through hearings, everyone has agreed--even \nUSDA agreed, as they testified to that as they effect--that the \nstandard, the current standard, is flawed. Basically what we have been \ntrying to say is that enforcing a flawed standard is, in effect, \ncodifying a bad standard. We do not want to do that.\n  This issue was debated last year. We worked with Senator Harkin then \nat the time, saying the issue was not whether there should be \nenforceable microbial testing standard for meat and poultry plants, the \nquestion was what standard should be used and what should be the \nscientific basis for that standard.\n  We directed those studies, both from the National Research Council \nand the USDA Scientific Advisory Committee, to make recommendations \nregarding microbial testing in plants. These committees were directed \nto review the appropriateness of the existing salmonella performance \nstandard and to recommend a microbial testing program that will measure \nfood safety performance in meat and poultry plants. We want a good \nstandard. We want a standard based on science, which is exactly what \nthe Senator from Nebraska is asking.\n  Some would claim that food safety would be compromised while we await \nUSDA's recommendation. That is simply not the case. USDA is still \nconducting salmonella performance tests at every meat and poultry plant \nin the Nation. USDA still has a wide variety of enforcement tools \navailable, including withdrawal of inspection if meat or poultry plants \nproduce adulterated products or operate in unsanitary conditions.\n  Food safety must continue to be a top national priority. I don't \nthink that is the argument here. We want to see the best standards. But \nour food standards must be practical, they must be enforceable, and \nthey must be based on scientific evidence, which is exactly what we \nasked for last year.\n  What we want to see happen is that we use these studies, we use this \nscientific evidence, that we have worked so hard to get, as it comes \nout this spring and put it into practice across this country.\n  We don't want to base it on sound bytes or newspaper headlines. I \nthink Senator Nelson's amendment will allow us to achieve that goal. \nThat is why I urge our colleagues to vote for and support his amendment \nso we can base good standards on scientific findings.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there is a fundamental difference here. \nQuite frankly, the standard in place now is, in fact, based upon the \nbest science that was available during the time when they promulgated \nthat standard. As I pointed out in my amendment on May 31, the \nSecretary has to start rulemaking based upon the best science \navailable. I agree with that.\n  Let us not be mistaken. This amendment says if you want to have \nuncertainty out there as to whether or not the Secretary can enforce a \npatent and pathogen reduction standard, this is the amendment for you \nbecause that is what we have. We have uncertainty right now because of \nthe Supreme Beef case in Texas.\n  This amendment by my good friend from Nebraska basically says that is \nwhat we are going to have. We are going to have this vast uncertainty \nout there.\n  I don't want my kids and I don't want your kids and grandkids, or the \npeople of this country having that cloud of uncertainty.\n  That is why I believe this amendment should be defeated--because it \nleaves the uncertainty there. It would allow for plants such as Supreme \nBeef to continue to snub their noses at the Secretary of Agriculture \nand at reducing the pathogen standard.\n  That is why I move to table the second-degree amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. REID. Could the Chair check that again?\n\n[[Page S11082]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion \nto table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Their now appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), \nthe Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), the Senator from Montana (Mr. \nBurns), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), and the Senator \nfrom Alaska (Mr. Stevens), are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nKentucky (Mr. Bunning) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 314 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Campbell\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Domenici\n     Hutchison\n     Stevens\n  The motion was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1984, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, what was the request? The \nSenator asked unanimous consent for something, but I could not \nunderstand it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I asked unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Reserving the right to object, he asked unanimous \nconsent to withdraw his amendment. The amendment has been amended by \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Nebraska. I hope the Senator \nfrom Nebraska will suggest what his intentions are.\n  I don't want to object if the Senator from Nebraska is not going to \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not yet been agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Iowa?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, we are simply waiting \nnow for a managers' amendment that should be available shortly. As soon \nas it is available, we will deal with that. As I understand it, that is \nthe last amendment remaining. We will then go to final passage.\n  For the information of all Senators, assuming we are able to go to \nfinal passage tonight, there will be no session tomorrow. We will be in \npro forma session on Monday. It would be my expectation, in \nconsultation with Senator Lott, to go to the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill Tuesday morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman and ranking \nmember working with me to find funding for a crucial Agricultural \nResearch Service (ARS) Station project. This project will further the \nresearch and commercial adaptation of swine waste management. It will \nbe an offset facility located in North Carolina, but is associated with \nthe Florence, SC, ARS Station. In order to fund the start-up costs and \nequipment rental associated with this project, the full cost to ARS is \nestimated to be $1 million. The nature of this project is urgent. I \nhope ARS will fund this program with available fiscal year 2002 funds.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am grateful to my friend from South Carolina, Senator \nThurmond, for his determination to pursue this project which will be \nlocated in North Carolina. I believe ARS should make this project a \npriority. I appreciate the managers of the bill acknowledging its \nimportance.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the Senator from South Carolina bringing this \nimportant issue to my attention. I am confident we can work together to \nencourage ARS to fund this project in fiscal year 2002.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I understand why this project is important to my \ncolleagues. I will work with them to find a way to help ARS move \nforward in funding this project.\n\n\n                 NATIONAL RURAL DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first I would like to thank Chairman Kohl \nand Senator Cochran for the hard work they have put into the fiscal \nyear 2001 Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill. It is a challenging process, and they have done an \nexcellent job balancing competing interests within the confines of a \nbalanced budget.\n  I wish to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee regarding the appropriation for the Department of \nAgriculture's Rural Development Programs. The committee has encouraged \nthe Department to continue to support the National Rural Development \nPartnership (NRDP) and its associated State Rural Development Councils \nwithin existing funds. It is my understanding that an allocation of \n$5.5 million would provide Federal funding to 40 State Rural \nDevelopment Councils (SRDCs) at the level they received in fiscal year \n2001 and that it would cover other necessary program support for the \nNRDP/SRDCs. I would ask that this need be considered when this bill \ngoes to conference.\n  The National Rural Development Partnership is a nonpartisan \ninteragency working group whose mission is to contribute to the \nvitality of the Nation by strengthening the ability of rural Americans \nto fully participate in determining their futures. Although the \nPartnership has existed for 10 years, it has never been formally \nauthorized by Congress.\n  Thirty seven members of the Senate have joined on legislation to \nformally establish the NRDP and SRDCs, S. 1111, the National Rural \nDevelopment Partnership Act. This legislation authorizes or formally \nrecognizes the existence and operations of the Partnership, the \nNational Rural Development Council, and SRDCs. In addition, the \nlegislation gives specific responsibilities to each component of the \npartnership and authorizes it to receive Congressional appropriations.\n  It is essential that the current network of SRDCs remain viable while \nwe work to pass this legislation. The core components of S. 1111 have \nbeen included in the House version of the farm hill and we are working \nto have S. 1111 included in the Senate version of the farm bill. In \naddition, a task force, which includes significant representation \nexternal to the NRDP, is currently considering questions related to the \nmission, structure, and operations of the NRDP and SRDCs. Fiscal year \n2002 is a transitional year during which fundamental issues related to \nthe NRDP and SRDCs will be addressed. During fiscal year 2002, unique \nrole of helping to coordinate rural development policies and programs \nmust be preserved.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Idaho for his remarks, and I look \nforward to working with him to resolve this issue in conference. It is \nmy understanding that contributions provided to the NRDP from other \nFederal agencies could be used to diminish the amount of funding that \nwould come from USDA. The NRDP and SRDCs provide rural citizens and \nagencies, nonprofit organizations, and corporations that serve rural \nareas with a forum for analyzing challenges and developing holistic and \ncost-effect solutions. There has never been a greater need for the type \nof work done by the partnership and SRDCs.\n\n\n                            Exotic diseases\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to thank Chairman Kohl and\n\n[[Page S11083]]\n\nRanking Member Cochran for recognizing the increasing threat posed by \nemerging and exotic diseases to animals and crops through out the \nUnited States and providing the Agricultural Research Service an \nincrease of $6,782,000 for fiscal year 2002. I also want to confirm \nthat the Committee intends for at least $500,000 of these funds to be \nused to meet the higher operating costs presented by the new state-of-\nthe-art ARS U.S. Vegetable Lab in Charleston, South Carolina.\n  Mr. KOHL. The Senator from South Carolina is correct. I understand \nthere has been significant progress on its construction and the new \nfacility is scheduled to open in February 2002. I agree that the \nnecessary funds must be provided for its operations.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Such progress would not have been possible without the \nsupport I have received over the years from both sides of the aisle on \nthis project. The new laboratory will play an important role in the ARS \nmission of conducting research to solve regional and national problems \nin the production and protection of vegetable crops. This research is \ncritical to the continued production of crops in a sustainable \nagricultural economy.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Certainly the research conducted by the lab is a key \ncomponent in ensuring that an affordable, safe and dependable supply of \nnutritious vegetable crops is available to U.S. consumers. I, too, want \nto assure the Senator from South Carolina that it is my understanding \nthese funds will be used to meet the higher operating costs of the \nCharleston Vegetable Lab.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member \nof the subcommittee for their attention to this matter and, again, \nappreciate the assistance they have provided on this project over the \nyears.\n\n\n                       Sudden Oak Death Syndrome\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to address an emerging \necological crisis in California that quite literally threatens to \nchange the face of my State, and perhaps others.\n  California's beloved oak trees are in grave peril. Thousands of black \noak, coastal live oak, tan, and Shreve's oak trees--among the most \nfamiliar and best loved features of California's landscape--are dying \nfrom a newly discovered disease known as Sudden Oak Death Syndrome.\n  The loss of trees is fast approaching epidemic proportions, with tens \nof thousands of dead trees appearing across the Californian landscape. \nAs the trees die, enormous expanses of forest face substantially \nincreased fire risk because the dead trees are highly flammable. These \ndead trees are also more likely to blow over in high winds, posing a \ngrowing risk to people and property.\n  Unfortunately, this terrible disease has also been found in at least \n10 other plant species, including rhododendron in commercial nurseries. \nOther commercially important plants such as blueberries and cranberries \nare also believed vulnerable.\n  Most disturbing is the fact that Sudden Oak Death Syndrome is \nspreading rapidly. It was recently discovered in Oregon. Fear that it \nwill spread further has already provoked Canada and South Korea to ban \nthe importation of California oak products. Scientists believe it may \nonly be a matter of time before this disease reaches oaks and other \nspecies in the Midwest, Northeast, and around the country.\n  It is vital that we invest now in efforts to stop the spread of this \ndisease before it becomes uncontrollable. Although the Senate bill does \nnot include funding to address this issue, the House has provided \n$500,000 for these purposes. Last year, the Agriculture Committee \nprovided over $2 million in funding to address this disease. Am I \ncorrect in understanding that the chairman will assist in conference to \nensure that the final bill includes funding to address Sudden Oak Death \nSyndrome?\n  Mr. KOHL. Yes. I recognize that Sudden Oak Death Syndrome is a \ngrowing problem that threatens oak trees and other species in my State \nand around the Nation. I assure my colleague that I will do my best in \nconference to push for an increase in funding to $1,000,000 when the \nagriculture bill is considered in conference.\n\n\n                       national organic standards\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am very concerned over the National \nOrganic Standards Board's recent recommendation to USDA that wild \nseafood not be eligible for organic labeling. This decision ignored the \nplain evidence on the record that most wild seafood, and wild Alaska \nsalmon in particular, are the most organic, natural fish available on \nthe market today.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the Senate bringing this to our attention. \nWe will look into it.\n  Mr. KOHL. I also appreciate being advised of this matter.\n\n\n                  south plains range research station\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee has \nprovided $1.5 million for the Southern Plains Range Research Station in \nWoodward, OK. However, it has come to my attention that there is an \nurgent need for a conference center at the facility to house \nagricultural conferences and agricultural training programs as well as \ncommunity activities. Because this center is to be available to the \ncommunity, the city of Woodward has committed to provide $3,000,000 for \nthe construction of the conference center. The study for this facility \nis estimated to cost $400,000 to determine if this facility would be a \ngood use of Federal tax dollars. I hope the agency will complete this \nstudy within available funds.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for bringing this \nimportant project to the committee's attention and also hope the agency \ncan find a way to do the feasibility study on this project.\n\n\n                     agricultural research service\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to thank the chairman and the \nranking member for supporting my request to expand research on cereal \ncrops and sunflowers at the Agricultural Research Service Northern \nCrops Research Laboratory at Fargo, ND. This bill recommends an \nincrease of $900,000 for expanded research on small grains and \nsunflowers.\n  The economic viability of small grains industries remains a concern \nas a result of production and marketing problems faced by producers in \nrecent years. The barley industry has been particularly hard hit due to \nweather related problems. We have seen production of this crop decline \nby 40 percent during the past ten years due to weather related \nproblems. In North Dakota, the decline in production has been even more \ndramatic with production falling off by 53 percent during the same time \nperiod.\n  I think we need to use a portion of the increased funding over the \nlast year's level to develop new barley varieties that are high \nyielding and have good feed quality attributes. No such program \ncurrently exists and I think increased research in this area would help \nthe barley industry gain a competitive edge.\n  Mr. KOHL. I understand the need for increased research in this area \nand I will do my best to hold the increases for cereal crops research \ncontained in the Senate bill.\n\n\n                         Animal Waste Research\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am grateful to the distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee, Mr. Kohl, and the \nranking member, Mr. Cochran, for their willingness to acknowledge the \nexciting animal waste research taking place in North Carolina.\n  Senator Edwards and I are deeply impressed with the initiative being \nshown by the poultry and swine industry, which is actively seeking \nsolutions to the problems associated with animal waste material. We \nhave been particularly interested in proposals that will convert a \nvariety of animal waste products into a usable energy resource.\n  Several innovative North Carolina constituents are moving forward \nwith the development of this technology, and I want to make sure that \nthe Federal Government is both aware of and supportive of these \nefforts. I appreciate the willingness of the managers of the bill to \nshow an interest in this work, and I will be grateful for their \ncontinued attention to this research.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Edwards, my fellow members of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee, and the appropriators to make sure \nthat the U.S. Department of Agriculture has the authorization and \nresources needed to support innovative use of animal waste.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, Senator Helms and I are excited about the \nalternative uses of animal waste products, and I appreciate the \nattention\n\n[[Page S11084]]\n\nthis issue is receiving from the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee. There has been a great deal of attention paid to the \nproblems associated with animal waste, but very little has been said \nabout the work taking place in the private sector and our research \neducational institutions to try and deal with this problem.\n  I agree that there is reason to be optimistic that technological \nadvances will yield innovative solutions that will benefit poultry and \nswine producers, the environment, and ultimately, energy consumers. We \nwill look forward to continuing to support additional research into \nalternative animal waste uses, and I appreciate the interest of the \nmanagers.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the Senators from North Carolina letting us \nknow of the interesting work taking place in North Carolina in regard \nto animal waste research. We will continue to work with Senator Helms \nand Senator Edwards to explore the potential of alternative energy \nsources.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I also look forward to working with the Senators from \nNorth Carolina as this technology develops.\n\n\n                        rural facilities program\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee.\n  The Village of DeTour in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is living \nwith an unfortunate safety hazard. Currently, the Village of DeTour is \nusing a World War II era fire engine to fight fires within its \njurisdiction. This antiquated fire engine is so old that safety \npersonnel can no longer drive it to emergency situations. Instead, \nfirefighters must tow the fire engine to any dangerous area. This \nrepresents a tremendous safety hazard for the hard working people of \nthis unique Upper Peninsula town.\n  The Rural Facilities Program at USDA provides funding for rural \ncommunities like DeTour to improve their public facilities, including \nproviding money for new fire equipment.\n  Therefore, I would ask the distinguished chairman if he would agree \nto include the Village of DeTour in the statement of managers \naccompanying the conference report to this appropriations bill, and \nlist the purchase of a new fire truck as a high priority project that \ndeserves funding in fiscal year 2002?\n  Mr. KOHL. I will do everything I can to include the Village of DeTour \nin the statement of managers as a high priority project worthy of \nfunding in fiscal year 2002.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished \nsubcommittee chairman.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their \nstrong support. This community needs only $80,000 next year to purchase \nthis new vehicle. Since the village has already raised the required \nmatching funds necessary, once it receives this $80,000 it will be able \nto move forward immediately on the project. Will the chairman and \nranking member continue their strong support for this project until the \nVillage receives this necessary funding?\n  Mr. KOHL. I reiterate my strong support for this project and will \nwork in conference and will work with the USDA to make sure this \ncommunity receives this $80,000 in fiscal year 2002.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished \nsubcommittee chairman.\n\n\n                        audubon sugar institute\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for a \nproject close to the heart of the Louisiana State University AgCenter \nas well as many of my consitutents--the Audubon Sugar Institute. I want \ntake this opportunity to bring to the attention of the chairman of the \nSenate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee the importance of \nrelocating the Audubon Sugar Institute from LSU main campus to St. \nGabriel Sugar Research Station as well as the need to encourage USDA \nRural Development to give priority consideration to this very \nworthwhile project.\n  Sugarcane is the largest economic crop in Louisiana with a gross farm \nincome in 2000 of just under $363 million. Sugar and sugarcane research \nand extension education at the LSU AgCenter are conducted at the St. \nGabriel Sugar Research Station, approximately 7 miles south of the LSU \nmain campus and the Audubon Sugar Institute in the heart of the main \ncampus. The Audubon Sugar Institute has a long history and a proud \ntradition of educating some of the finest sugar technologies and sugar \nengineers in the country. In the past, it drew many people to \nLouisiana, and earmarked the LSU AgCenter as a center for excellence in \nthe sugar industry. However, the need to improve and upgrade the \nAudubon Sugar Institute is critical to furthering the Louisiana Sugar \nIndustry.\n  The first step in accomplishing the goals mentioned above is to move \nthe Audubon Sugar Institute from the heart of the main LSU campus to \nthe St. Gabriel Sugar Research Station. The LSU AgCenter is requesting \nassistance from the USDA Office of Rural Development.\n  The equipment and laboratories at Audubon Sugar Institute are in dire \nneed of upgrading and the building itself is in serious arrears and \ndoes not conform to safety regulations. It appears that it is no longer \nan option to run the factory continuously because of the environmental \nimplications of running a sugar factory in the middle of a busy \nuniversity campus. Relocating the Institute has the advantage of \nmeeting the main campus at the same time providing the option of \nupdating the Audubon Sugar Institute archaic design and providing a \nmodern facility capable of handling billeted cane. It also places \nAudubon adjacent to the variety development and production research \ngoing on at the St. Gabriel Sugar Station. Building a new facility and \nmoving the sugar mill to St. Gabriel would allow the Institute to \nfunction as a training ground and undertake manageable plant scale \nexperiments. Having a fully functional small mill operation at Aubudon \nSugar Institute would provide a facility unsurpassed in the world and \nimmensely assist the sugarcane industry in Louisiana.\n  I thank the chairman and his staff for their consideration and \nreiterate that it is my hope that the USDA Rural Development can be \nencouraged to give priority consideration to this very worthwhile \nproject.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Louisiana and \nwill make every effort to accommodate her request during the conference \nof this bill.\n\n\n                           idaho oust problem\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first I would like to thank Chairman Kohl \nand Senator Cochran for the hard work they have put into the fiscal \nyear 2002 Agriculture and Related Agencies Appropriations bill. It is a \nchallenging process, and they have done an excellent job balancing \ncompeting interests within the confines of a balanced budget.\n  I wish to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the subcommittee regarding a situation that has \narisen in Idaho. The Idaho delegation is concerned over the growing \nimpact a product called OUST has had on crops in fields near the Bureau \nof Land Management's rangeland treatment areas.\n  The BLM has been using OUST as part of their rehabilitation program \nto eliminate cheatgrass and stop the fire cycle. The program is two-\nfold. First spray, then plant native and perineal vegetation which is \nbetter feed for cattle and fire suppression. From October 23 to \nNovember 3, 2000, in order to control the spread of cheatgrass on their \nburned land, the Bureau of Land Management sprayed the herbicide, OUST, \nfrom a helicopter onto approximately 17,000 acres of their land.\n  This spring, we began to receive reports from farmers that OUST may \nhave spread beyond its intended use area and may be impacting crops in \nfields adjacent to or near the BLM's treated areas. Sugar beet growers \nnoticed strange growth developments in their crops. As the crop \ndeveloped, it was determined the lack of growth could be related to the \nOUST spray. What our farmers project happened is the OUST, which is \nactivated and broken down by water, was sprayed on top of the ashes \nfrom the fire. With the lack of snowfall and spring rains, the OUST was \nblown with the ashes to as far as 10 miles from the sprayed ground. \nWhen the farmers turned on their irrigation systems this spring, it \nactivated the OUST and it is now damaging the crops. The most \nsignificant\n\n[[Page S11085]]\n\ndamage reported is in the Burley/Paul area and the American Falls/\nAberdeen area in Southern Idaho. Because of all of the uncertainty, BLM \nhas agreed to stop the use of OUST until this issue is resolved.\n  Since the damage was first noticed, testing by the Department of \nAgriculture in Idaho has indicated the presence of OUST in crops at \nleast 5 miles beyond the BLM's treated areas. Those tests are ongoing \nand results continue to show the presence of OUST in damaged crops. \nAccording to the information we have seen, in some cases the damage to \ncrops in these areas approaches a 100 percent loss. In other cases, \ncrops are only partially impacted, but may still be damaged in terms of \ntheir value. In either case, farmers are facing over $100 million in \nreduced income. The whole extent of the problem will not be known until \nlater because some crop types will not show damage until further in the \nseason. Unfortunately, the projected losses these producers may incur \nas a result of OUST are only compounded by the ongoing drought, high \nenergy costs, and low crop prices.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I join Senator Craig in acknowledging Chairman Kohl's and \nSenator Cochran's hard work on this bill and in expressing my deep \nconcerns for the farmers of southern Idaho.\n  Senator Craig has provided a good background on the issue and the \nproblem. I will only add that while the final impact of the OUST \ncontamination is unknown, we do know many Idaho producers will be \naffected. With the difficulties agriculture is already facing, high \ninput costs, low product prices, and a shortage of water, the losses \ndue to this contamination could be devastating.\n  Credible scientific data is being established to measure the extent \nof the damage. I look forward to working with the administration and my \ncolleagues to address the needs of southern Idaho farmers.\n  Mr. KOHL. I commend the Senators for their interest in this program. \nI want to assure the gentlemen that it is the committee's belief that \nthe Secretary of Interior should continue to work closely with the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Idaho Department of Agriculture, Idaho's \nagriculture producers, and the Idaho delegation to facilitate the \ntimely flow of information and a coordinated response to this problem.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank my colleagues from Idaho for bringing this issue \nto the subcommittee's attention. I look forward to working with them \nand the chairman on this issue.\n\n\n                                 csrees\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank Chairman Kohl and Senator Johnson for helping me \nsecure $700,000 through CSREES in this bill for South Dakota State \nUniversity to continue the planning and development of a bio-based \nenergy and product initiative that will be of major significance to the \nnation's ability to efficiently produce renewable fuels, as well as to \nthe future viability of rural America and the agriculture community. \nSenator Johnson and I have been working with SDSU to develop a concept \ncalled the ``Sun Grant Initiative,'' which would become a national \nnetwork of land grant universities in partnership with USDA and DOE, \ndedicated not only to the development of cost-effective biobased energy \nand nonfood product production, but also to the disbursement of new \ntechnology, and integration in rural communities on a scale that \nfosters economic independence and growth. The $700,000 dedicated for \nfeedstock conversion in this bill will allow us to move forward with \nthis important project.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I also thank Chairman Kohl for his help with this \nproject. Agriculture has much to contribute to the nation's energy \nsecurity, and can make significant contributions to markets for nonfood \nproducers as well. This biobased shift would reduce our reliance on \npetroleum-based products and provide significant economic opportunities \nfor independent farm families and rural communities. These funds will \nhelp make this a reality, and I am hopeful that USDA will release the \nfunds as quickly as possible after enactment of this legislation so the \nplanning of this exciting initiative can continue in a timely manner.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senators and look forward to seeing this \nproject develop.\n\n\n                              potato study\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, first I thank Chairman Kohl and Senator \nCochran for the hard work they have put into the fiscal year 2001 \nAgriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nbill. It is a challenging process, and they have done an excellent job \nbalancing competing interests within the confines of a balanced budget.\n  I wish to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee regarding the appropriation for the Department of \nAgriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service. The committee \nhas provided a $13.3 million increase in the budget for NASS. I would \nlike to clarify with the chairman and ranking member that the increase \nprovides $125,000 to conduct a potato objective yield, size and grade \nsurvey.\n  NASS has developed a plan to conduct a potato size and grade survey \nfor the seven major potato producing States. The intent of the survey \nis to provide all market participants with comprehensive potato size \nand grade data. These data are crucial information to both potato \ngrowers and buyers in estimating the current potato crop's quality. All \ninvolved market parties will use this unbiased information when \nnegotiating sale or purchase contracts of processing potatoes. The \nNational Potato Council, which represents all segments of the potato \nindustry, has identified that these data are imperative to the orderly \nmarketing of the annual potato crop. These data also ensure that no one \ngroup uses their market position to distort the true picture of annual \ncrop quality. The size and grade data will complement the annual \nproduction data already provided by NASS and supply the necessary \ninformation for the orderly marketing of the potato crop.\n  Mr. KOHL. The Senator has correctly stated the intent of the \ncommittee. The size and grade survey will be conducted in the seven \nmajor producing States in conjunction with the current potato objective \nyield survey. The seven states are Idaho, Wisconsin, Maine, Minnesota, \nNorth Dakota, Oregon, and Washington. These funds are needed to obtain \nstatistically defensible potato size and grade date, and the sample \nsize. This amount includes equipment, supplies, training, and personnel \nneeds to conduct, analysis, and publish the survey data and add the \nadditional objective yield samples required.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the chairman for his support on this issue.\n\n\n    FDA FUNDING FOR NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY'S PHYSICAL SCIENCE \n                               LABORATORY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Kohl, for all his fine work on this bill. I know his task has \nnot been an easy one, and he and his staff are to be complimented for \nthe very thoughtful and fair way they have worked to complete this \nlegislation.\n  I also thank the chairman for including in the bill second-year \nfunding for the Food and Drug Administration to continue its contract \nwith New Mexico State University's Physical Science Laboratory to \ndevelop and evaluate rapid screening methods, instruments, and analyses \nthat will facilitate FDA's regulation of imported food products. As I \nrequested, the committee's bill continues funding for PSL's Agriculture \nProducts Food Safety Laboratory at the fiscal year 2001 level of $1.5 \nmillion.\n  I understand FDA and PSL have completed all the necessary agreements \nand work is already underway. Equipment has been ordered and lab staff \nis being hired. One of the first tasks will be an independent \nevaluation of biosensors for microbial contamination to ensure the \nequipment is accurate and dependable. If the reliability of the new \nbiosensors can be verified they could replace the much slower testing \nprotocols FDA currently uses.\n  Does the chairman agree that PSL's Agriculture Products Food Safety \nLaboratory is supporting FDA's efforts to develop quick and safe food \ninspection systems that can detect filth, microbial contamination, and \npesticides on fresh fruits and vegetables and the FDA should continue \nthis work at PSL is fiscal year 2001?\n\n[[Page S11086]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Yes, I agree that PSL is helping support FDA's food safety \nprogram, and I was pleased to include second-year funding for PSL from \nthe total sum appropriated to FDA for food safety and other \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I also call Chairman Kohl's attention to the potential \nto broaden PSL's efforts, within the existing funding and framework, to \ninclude evaluations of technologies and methods for testing \nagricultural products for microbial contamination as well as \ncontamination from pesticides, chemical and biological agents, evidence \nof tampering, or possible acts of bioterrorism. In addition to fruits \nand vegetables, the expanded scope of testing technologies might \ninclude other food products as well as illicit or counterfeit products \nand pharmaceuticals that could present hazards to public health and \nsafety.\n  I understand FDA is responsible for wide variety of product safety \ninitiatives, including bioterrorism, counterfeit pharmaceuticals, and \nso forth. I do believe the availability of a testing and verification \nlaboratory, such as PSL's Agriculture Products Food Safety Laboratory, \ncould be of great value in FDA's continuing effort to combat illicit \nproducts and health hazards.\n  Is the chairman aware of these additional capabilities at PSL that \ncould be used by FDA to evaluate a wider variety of testing \ntechnologies and does he agree that it would be appropriate for FDA to \nconsider this broader scope of effort at PSL within the funding level \nalready provided in the bill?\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for bringing these \nadditional capabilities at PSL to my attention. I agree that the \nCommissioner should consider broadening the scope of the effort beyond \nmicrobial analyses of imported fruits and vegetables to include other \nproducts and contaminants under FDA's purview.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN, Mr. President, I thank Chairman Kohl for his support of \ncontinued funding for PSL's Agriculture Products Food Safety Laboratory \nand for considering broadening the scope of the laboratory. The House \nbill does not include second-year funding for the food safely \nlaboratory at New Mexico State, and I look forward to working with the \nchairman to ensure the Senate's funding level is included in the \nconference report.\n\n\n             tropical and subtropical agricultural research\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Will the chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, \nFood and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee yield?\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield to the senior Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the chairman for yielding. As the chairman knows, \nthe Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee has a long history of \nsupport for tropical and subtropical agricultural research due to the \nlimited transferability of agricultural research from the temperate \nzones of the United States. This reasoning has been most evident in \ncongressional support for the establishment of the Pacific Basin \nAgricultural Research Center.\n  The Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center is a welcome addition \nto the tropical and subtropical agricultural research community in \nHawaii and the American Pacific. The increased scientific and technical \ncapacity offered by this center is a significant and vital complement \nto other institutions in the region. The center's mission of \ncontributing to the region's scientific knowledge base on tropical and \nsubtropical organisms strengthens the foundation for a competitive, \ndiversified agricultural industry in the region.\n  In addition to construction funds for this center, the success of the \ncenter is also contingent upon its ability to recruit and deploy \nscientists and technicians at a rate consistent with completion of \nconstruction, and its ability to work in concert with the agricultural \nresearch and technology transfer infrastructure at the University of \nHawaii at Hilo and the University of Hawaii at Manoa. For these \npurposes, $900,000 is needed. Of this total, $600,000 has been provided \nand I recommend that the additional $300,000 be derived from an \ninternal reallocation of funds provided to the University of Hawaii for \ntwo other USDA-ARS projects, Non-toxic Control of Tephritid and Other \nInsects and Environmental Effects of Tephritid Fruit Fly Control and \nEradication. This does not deny the importance of these two latter \nprojects but rather the higher priority of providing operating support \nto assure the success of the center. With this internal shifting of \nresources, a total of $900,000 would be available for the United States \nPacific Basin Agricultural Research Center, of which $300,000 would be \navailable for the University of Hawaii at Hilo and $300,000 for the \nUniversity of Hawaii at Manoa for activities complementing the research \nof the center.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Hawaii for his insight and \nrecommendation. I fully concur with his recommendation, because other \nfunds are internally available to ARS to minimize the impact of the \nrecommended internal reallocation of funds.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I also with to support the \nrecommendations from the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the chairman and my colleague from Mississippi \nfor their support of my recommendation.\n\n\n                              Sugar Beets\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise to engage my neighbor and colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment and Related Agencies, and join my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Minnesota, in a colloquy on an issue that is vitally \nimportant to sugar beet growers in our state.\n  Last fall, five hundred fifty producers in the Southern Minnesota \nBeet Sugar Cooperative of Renville, Minnesota, (SMBSC) experienced a \nfreeze of sugar beets. Over the next three months, it became \nincreasingly evident that a large share of the beets would have to be \ndiscarded. The result is a catastrophic loss of revenue that has forced \nthese farmers into near bankruptcy.\n  Tragically, the private insurers of those losses have refused to \ncover them, and the USDA has refused to provide sufficient funds for \nrelief. We are desperately trying to remedy these two travesties to \nforestall the cooperative's complete collapse.\n  Now we are appealing to you and your colleagues on the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee as our last possible remedy. We ask that \nyou give these farmers your favorable consideration as you negotiate \nthis bill in conference.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I agree with the statement of my colleague from \nMinnesota and would like to join him in underscoring the urgency of \nthis funding for the sugar beet growers in Minnesota. As my colleague \nhas recognized the five hundred fifty producer members of the Southern \nMinnesota Beet Sugar Cooperative in Renville, Minnesota experienced a \nfreeze of sugar beets while still in the ground during the early stage \nof their annual harvest. The cooperative continued with their harvest, \nwith the goal of extracting as much of the crop's value from the \nmarket, while knowing that federally subsidized crop insurance would \nlikely cover losses that which were not harvested.\n  Unfortunately these growers are now having difficulty claiming due \ncompensation under the Quality Loss Program authorized in last year's \nAgriculture Appropriations bill. While USDA has offered to settle \ndisaster assistance claims, their offer falls dangerously short, \njeopardizing hundreds of family farmers and the local economy. The \ngrowers have presented USDA with information to justify a disaster \npayment of $31 million, but USDA has rejected this argument.\n  It is now clear that additional assistance from Congress is needed to \nsecure the continued operation of hundreds of family farms in and \naround Renville, Minnesota. I ask the Chairman, Senator Kohl, if he \nagrees that additional assistance is necessary, in this Agriculture \nAppropriations Bill, to ensure the continued viability of the Southern \nMinnesota Beet Sugar Cooperative and its five hundred fifty member \ngrowers?\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Dayton and \nSenator Wellstone. Both of you are strong advocates for farmers, and in \nparticular the sugar beet growers in Minnesota. I am committed to \nsecure a level of assistance that can ensure the survival of the \nSouthern Minnesota Beet Sugar Coop, for another year.\n\n[[Page S11087]]\n\n               GRAND FORKS AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the expansion efforts of \nthe Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center in Grand Forks, ND. \nThis facility, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \nAgricultural Research Service (ARS), has been a national and \ninternational leader in mineral nutrition research for more than 30 \nyears. In 1995, legislative authority was granted to the center to \npurchase four city lots to expand its operation. Since then, three lots \nhave been acquired and are being used by the facility. The ARS was not \nable to purchase the fourth lot at the same time because the owner of \nan adjacent lot was not prepared to sell.\n  Recently, the owner of the fourth lot decided to sell his property. \nThis is timely, because the Grand Forks Human Nutrition Center recently \nacquired a mobile research laboratory with funds this bill provided \nlast year to conduct nutritional studies of underserved populations \nsuch as Native Americans and the rural elderly. This vehicle needs to \nbe stored in a secure, climate-controlled garage. There is currently no \nstorage facility in Grand Forks appropriate to store this mobile lab, \nbut one could be erected on this adjacent property.\n  It would take no appropriation of additional funds for the Grand \nForks Human Nutrition Center to purchase this lot. The facility merely \nneeds a reprogramming of funds, and as a member of the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I support this request. It is my \nunderstanding that the ARS Area Director, as well as ARS headquarters, \nsupport allowing the Grand Forks Human Nutrition Center to spend its \nfunds to purchase this lot. In conference, it is my hope that we can \nprovide direction in the statement of managers allowing this \nreprogramming to move forward. I would like to solicit the support of \nthe leaders of the subcommittee for this purpose.\n  Mr. KOHL. I understand the reasons why the Grand Forks Human \nNutrition Center wants to purchase this land, and I will work to \nsatisfy the request from the Senator from North Dakota to include a \nstatement of managers in the conference report to allow the \nreprogramming of funds for this purpose.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for S. 1191, the Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The Senate bill provides $16.137 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $11.863 billion. \nWhen outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the Senate bill total $16.107 billion in \n2002. The Senate bill is within its section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and outlays. In addition, the committee once again has \nmet its target without the use of any emergency designations.\n  I again commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens, as well as \nSenators Kohl and Cochran, for their bipartisan effort in moving this \nand other appropriations bills quickly to make up for the late start in \nthis year's appropriations process. The tragic events of September 11 \ndemand that this bipartisanship continue and that the Congress \nexpeditiously complete work on the 13 regular appropriations bills for \n2002.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of this bill be inserted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n S. 1191, AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION,\n  AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002, SPENDING COMPARISON--\n                          SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n  Budget Authority...............       16,137       43,112       59,249\n  Outlays........................       16,107       33,847       49,954\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............       16,137       43,112       59,249\n  Outlays........................       16,107       33,847       49,954\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............       15,668       43,112       58,780\n  Outlays........................       16,044       33,847       49,891\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............       15,399       43,112       58,511\n  Outlays........................       15,789       33,847       49,636\n \nSENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............            0            0            0\n  Outlays........................            0            0            0\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............          469            0          469\n  Outlays........................           63            0           63\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............          738            0          738\n  Outlays........................          318            0          318\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For enforcement purposes, the budget committee compares the Senate-\n  reported bill to the Senate 302(b) allocation.\n \nNotes.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted\n  for consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, recent events have demonstrated that we \nmust reexamine our ability to respond to terrorism--including \nbiological and chemical attacks. One area we must safeguard against \nsuch an attack is our food supply, which is woefully underprotected. \nFor instance FDA is so short of inspectors that it currently inspects \nless than 1 percent of imports. That is why this spring, even before \nthe recent attacks, the Senate passed an amendment that I offered to \nincrease the fiscal year 2002 budget allocation to expand the number of \nfood safety inspectors.\n  While the House stripped this provision out in conference, the need \nfor such an increase has only become more urgent, not less. That is why \nI filed this amendment, to add $100 million for food safety inspection.\n  FDA presently has only about 700 to 800 inspectors to oversee food \nimports and investigate the 57,000 sites within its jurisdiction across \nthe country. They are so understaffed that they currently are only able \nto inspect commercial food sites about once every decade on average.\n  An increase of $100 million for food inspection activities at FDA, \nfactored into the baseline over 5 years, would allow FDA to increase \nimport inspections from less than 1 percent to roughly 20 percent.\n  I understand that this needed increase in FDA inspection resources is \nbeing resolved in other contexts, in the bioterrorism package that is \nbeing worked out, or even in the debate about resources available in \nthe stimulus package.\n  On that understanding, I withdraw my amendment today seeking to add \n$100 million to FDA's food inspection authorities, and look forward to \nconfirming food safety inspection resources in those other contexts.\n  Terrorists aim to strike terror among civilians, in their homes, in \ntheir everyday lives, and that is why we must protect the security of \nour dinner tables and our families through increased inspection and \ngreater vigilance.\n  And since this is the Agriculture appropriations bill, I just want to \nonce again remind my colleagues that agriculture is the number one \nindustry in New York--and we plan to keep it that way.\n  Our farmers--like so many others around the country--are some of the \nmost dedicated, most decent, most hard-working people in this country. \nOur farmers are an integral part of our heritage. And they are out \nthere every day, working to put fresh, healthy, and safe food on our \ntables.\n  Our farmers are also some of the finest stewards of our natural \nresources. They help to preserve open space, and they work to properly \nmanage and protect our land and our water.\n  And our farmers are some of our most innovative, resourceful small \nbusiness people.\n  But our farmers need our help--at least I know they do in New York. \nAs I travel around New York, I meet so many farmers who are struggling \njust to get by, just to make ends meet.\n  And that is why I want to thank Chairman Kohl, Senator Levin, Senator \nSnowe, and my other colleagues for working to help provide much needed \nassistance for our apple growers. I was pleased to hear Chairman Kohl's \nwords earlier today about working this out in conference.\n  And I hope that I can continue to work with my colleagues to increase \nassistance for specialty crops and for conservation programs like the \nFarmland Protection Program.\n  These conservation programs are important programs not just for our \nenvironment, but for our farmers--particularly for those farmers that \nare under-served by the more traditional payment programs. And these \nconservation programs are all over-subscribed, meaning there are more \nfarmers that want to participate in these programs than there are \nresources available to accommodate.\n\n[[Page S11088]]\n\n  And, or course, we want to assist our dairy farmers by reinstituting \nthe dairy compact.\n  So, I want to again express my strong support for our Nation's \nfarmers, and reiterate my commitment to ensuring that New York's \nfarmers have the support they need and deserves.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the pending \nAgriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2002.\n  I thank the distinguished Subcommittee Chairman, Senator Kohl, and my \ngood friend and distinguished ranking member, Senator Cochran, for \nincluding $750,000 in the bill to allow the National Center for Genome \nResources in Santa Fe, NM, to proceed to establish a Bioinformatics \nInstitute for Model Plant Species. This program was authorized through \nan amendment that I sponsored to the Agriculture Risk Protection Act, \nPublic Law 106-224. The final language in Section 227 of that Act \nauthorizes the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the \nAgricultural Research Service, to enter into a cooperative agreement \nwith the National Center for Genome Resources in Santa Fe, NM, and \nuniversity partners to establish and operate the Bioinformatics \nInstitute for Model Plant Species. An amount of $3 million was \nspecifically authorized to establish the Institute, and such sums as \nmay be necessary is authorized for each subsequent fiscal year to carry \nout the cooperative agreement. The Center is pleased to work with both \nNew Mexico State University and Iowa State University in this \nbioinformatics initiative.\n  I strongly urge the Senate conferees to retain this funding in \nconference with the House. The initial appropriation of $750,000 in the \nSenate bill will allow the National Center for Genome Resources to \nbuild upon its existing programs to create and develop software tools \nto transfer information and conduct comparative analyses among model \nplant and crop species. The Center, in establishing the Institute, will \ndevelop a bioinformatics infrastructure to improve the accessibility \nand facilitate the transfer of information on structural and functional \ngenome information from model plants to crop species. The Institute \nwill work with university partners at New Mexico State University and \nIowa State University to expand and link existing genomic and genome \ndatabase research from the Agricultural Research Service allowing \nresearchers to discover, characterize, and manipulate agronomically \nimportant genes of major crops, including soybeans, alfalfa, maize, and \ncotton. As a non-profit entity, the National Center for Genome \nResources provides its research to the public domain to improve the \nproductivity and nutritional value of agricultural crops grown in the \nUnited States.\n  I am pleased to work with the Appropriations Committee to advance a \nproject that holds the promise of improving agricultural crop quality, \nnutrition, and production.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Kohl, chairman of the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator Cochran, ranking \nmember, for presenting to the Senate the fiscal year 2002 \nappropriations bill for Agriculture, Rural Development, the Food and \nDrug Administration, and Related Agencies.\n  This bill provides $73.9 billion in new budget authority for both \nmandatory and discretionary programs under the subcommittee's \njurisdiction and is within the 302(b) allocation. This is a good bill \nand deserves the support of all Senators.\n  This bill includes programs important to the farming community and to \nall Americans. This bill supports agriculture research and conservation \nprograms that protect our soil, water, and air resources. This bill \nalso supports rural communities through economic development programs \nand assistance for basic needs such as housing, electricity, safe \ndrinking water and waste disposal systems.\n  This bill also provides funding for the Food and Drug Administration \nwhich helps protect the safety of our food supply and helps make lower \ncost medications available to Americans as quickly as possible. In \naddition, funding in this bill supports many nutrition and public \nhealth related programs. These include the Food Stamp, School Lunch, \nand other nutrition assistance programs such as the Women, Infants, and \nChildren Program--WIC.\n  This bill provides $2.794 billion for rural development programs. \nThis is an increase of $318 million from the fiscal year 2001 level. Of \nthis amount, slightly more than $1 billion is for the Rural Community \nAdvancement Program, which includes the rural water and waste water \nloan and grants program, and is an increase of $243 million from last \nyear's level.\n  This bill also provides funding to support activities that promote \nanimal welfare. At my request, the bill includes increased funding to \ndeal with the problem of animal cruelty. The bill includes $13,767,000 \nfor animal welfare inspectors, an increase of $1,627,000 above last \nyear's level. This bill also includes $8,101,000 for regulatory and \nenforcement activities in connection with animal welfare \ninvestigations, which is an increase of $1,852,000 above last year's \nlevel. This increased funding builds on my $3 million initiative that I \nincluded in the FY 2001 supplemental to improve the enforcement of the \nAnimal Welfare Act and the enforcement of humane slaughter practices.\n  Together, these programs, and others in this bill, will work to help \nmeet the expectation of the American people that animals, whether as an \nintegral element of our nation's livestock industry, or in other \naspects, will be treated properly and humanely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, in anticipation of getting this bill done \nshortly, I want to thank the Senate for cooperating and moving this \nbill so quickly and efficiently. I especially want to thank Senator \nCochran. His knowledge of this bill, and its many complicated issues, \nis unsurpassed. His evenhanded, bipartisan approach to legislating are \nthe key reasons we have such a good product in the Senate Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  I also want to thank his fine and dedicated staff--Rebecca Davies, \nMartha Scott Poindexter, and Rachelle Schroder. All of our staff have \nhad to operate in very difficult conditions these last few weeks, but \nyou wouldn't know it from the fine quality of their work. Senators talk \noften about keeping the work of the Nation going here in the Senate, \nbut it is these dedicated staff people who do the work that makes us \nlook good--even if it means operating out of cardboard boxes and back \nbasement rooms, without computers, telephones, or even windows.\n  I also want to thank the members of my staff who have worked on this \nbill: Ben Miller, my agriculture LA, who handles issue as diverse as \nsatellites and sugar beets with the same skill and good humor. Paul \nBock, my chief of staff, who is an essential part of anything that goes \nwell in our office. Les Spivey, Jessica Arden, and Dan Daggert, who \nhave labored all year to bring this bill to the floor.\n  And last, but certainly not least, Galen Fountain, the Agriculture \nAppropriations clerk. His knowledge and skill are exemplary, even \nlegendary in the Senate. He has done everything in getting this bill \ntogether, from working out countless amendments to writing up my \ncomprehensive opening statement. I firmly believe that, without him, we \nwould have no Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I again thank the Senate for its help in moving this \nbill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the only \namendment in order prior to third reading be the managers' amendment. \nThe managers' amendment will have to be cleared by both managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia, Mr. Miller, is recognized.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I'd like to add my voice to those in \nCongress who think that we should take action on a farm bill this year.\n\n[[Page S11089]]\n\n  We need to act now for several reasons. First, the House took action \non the farm bill in expeditious fashion and passed it faster than most \nfolks expected. I know many Senators--including this one--were \nsurprised and impressed by Chairman Combest's pace in completing his \nbill.\n  This quick action led many in the industry to believe that we would \nhave a new farm bill this year that they could plan around. The result \nin Georgia has been industry reactions detrimental to growers. Georgia \npeanut shellers, in anticipation of a new program, have make market \ndecisions which could result in record area pool losses, which by law \nthe growers themselves have to cover. A new farm bill could avert this \nproblem.\n  Our Nation's newly discovered economic woes have been on the farm for \nsome time now. Rural America always feels these pressures much sooner \nand longer than other segments of society. Commodity prices have not \nimproved, input costs are still sky high and morale among farmers is \nthe lowest I have seen it in my career in public service. Fewer and \nfewer young people want to take over the family farm and continue this \nhonorable way of life. We all want to stimulate the economy, I have a \ngreat place for us to start--on our farms. The stimulus coming from a \nnew farm bill would not only be only felt in tractor, chemical and \nirrigation sales. It would filter into the local banks, car \ndealerships, restaurants and department stores. This is why I hope the \nAdministration will get behind the effort to write a farm bill before \nwe adjourn for the year.\n  Also, I want to act this year because of the budget ramifications. We \nfought hard during consideration of our current budget resolution to \nobtain nearly $74 billion extra which is necessary to meet our long \nterm obligations to American farmers. It would also prevent us from \nhaving to pass emergency relief bills, as has been the case over the \nlast few years. I am concerned that this money may not be there for us \nnext year. If OMB's reaction to the House bill is any indicator, we \nhave every reason to be worried.\n  From all indications, we have only a few weeks left in this session \nand many pressing issues such as appropriations matters and the war on \nterrorism. But I want to send a clear message to my colleagues--put me \nin the camp that says let's act now on the farm bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1988 through 2016, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent the managers' amendment be \nconsidered and agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, the bill be read the third time, and the Senate vote on passage \nof the bill, and, upon passage, the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequesting a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the \ntwo Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the \npart of the Senate, with no intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, reserving the right to object, has the \namendment been sent to the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is at the desk.\n  Mr. BYRD. Has the amendment been read?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. BYRD. Could the clerk state the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for himself and Mr. \n     Cochran, proposes amendments numbered 1988 through 2016, en \n     bloc.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 1988\n\n       On page 78, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, the catfish industry in the United States \nis being victimized by a fish product from Vietnam that is labeled as \nfarm-raised catfish. Since 1997, the volume of Vietnamese frozen fish \nfilets has increased from 500,000 pounds to over 7 million pounds per \nyear.\n  U.S. Catfish farm production, which is located primarily in \nMississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana, accounts for 50 percent \nof the total value of all U.S. aquaculture production. Catfish farmers \nin the Mississippi Delta region have spent $50 million to establish a \nmarket for North American Catfish.\n  The Vietnamese fish industry is penetrating the United States fish \nmarket by labeling fish products to create the impression they are \nfarm-raised catfish. The Vietnamese ``Basa'' fish that are being \nimported from Vietnam are grown in cages along the Mekong River Delta. \nUnlike other imported fish, Basa fish are imported as an intended \nsubstitute for U.S. farm-raised catfish, and in some instances, their \nproduct packaging imitates U.S brands and logos. this false labeling of \nVietnamese Basa fish is misleading American consumers at supermarkets \nand restaurants.\n  According to a taxonomy analysis from the National Warmwater \nAquaculture Center, the Vietnamese Basa fish is not even of the same \nfamily or species as the North American Channel Catfish.\n  This amendment will prevent the Food and Drug Administration from \nallowing admission of fish or fish products not taxonomically in the \nsame family as North American farm-raised catfish. U.S. catfish farmers \nhave invested millions of dollars to develop a market for the North \nAmerican catfish. This amendment will help ensure that fish products \nare properly identified so that consumers are not deceived by the \nimproper labeling.\n\n[[Page S11092]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to support an amendment to \nthe fiscal 2002 Agriculture Appropriations bill to address the \nemergency needs of the Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural \nResearch Center (BARC) and ensure that the critical work done at this \nworld-renowned facility can carry on without delay.\n  In the early evening of September 24, BARC, the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture's flagship research center, was severely \nimpacted by a tornado which had just ripped through the University of \nMaryland College Park, killing two students and contributing to the \ndeath of a volunteer firefighter. While thankfully none of the 500 \nemployees working on BARC's stricken western campus were injured, the \nfacility itself sustained significant damage.\n  All 90 of BARC's greenhouses, housing innovative and important \nresearch were damaged, with 40,000 square feet of greenhouse space \nbeing totally destroyed and another 90,000 square feet receiving severe \nto moderate damage. Each of the 15 major buildings on BARC's West-\ncampus suffered roof damage and many of these lost their windows, \nleading to rain damage in laboratories and offices. In addition, \nscientists lost over $3 million in equipment and reagents. In fact, in \none newly renovated building, hazardous chemical spills precluded \nsecurity windows against the rain or the use of emergency generators to \nrun freezers, exacerbating the loss of experimental materials. As a \nresult, critical research projects were set back from six months to as \nmuch as three years.\n  On Monday, I toured the facility with BARC Director Dr. Phyllis \nJohnson to see the tornado's damage firsthand. Nearly a month after \nthis disaster, the impact of the storm is still terribly evident.\n  My amendment directs the Secretary of Agriculture, within 30 days \nafter the date of enactment of this Act, to submit a reprogramming \nrequest to address the $21.7 million in damages at BARC. The majority \nof this funding, $12,250,000, will be used for greenhouse replacement \nand repair. The remaining funds will contribute to a variety of \ninfrastructure needs, including roof repair, electrical and mechanical \nsystems repair, and replacement of critical lab equipment and reagents. \nThis funding is essential to allowing the scientists and researchers at \nBARC to continue to carry on BARC's mission of conducting research to \ndevelop and transfer solutions to agricultural problems of high \nnational priority, including ensuring high-quality, safe food, \nsustaining a competitive agricultural economy, and providing economic \nopportunities for rural citizens, communities, and society as a whole. \nIn my view, it is critical that the staff at BARC have the tools and \nfacilities to be able to continue this vital mission, one that benefits \nall Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2013\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues' support for \nthe amendment that Senator Hatch and I are offering today.\n  The Harkin-Hatch amendment provides $1 million to Center for Food \nServices and Applied Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration to \nenhance enforcement of requirements under the Dietary Supplement Health \nand Education Act related to the accuracy of product labeling and the \ntruthfulness and substantiation of claims.\n  This is an area of extreme importance to American consumers, \nliterally millions of whom regularly take dietary supplements to \nmaintain their health.\n  I was extremely proud to author the Dietary Supplement Health and \nEducation Act with Senator Hatch back in 1994. I think this law has \nhelped consumers reap the tremendous benefits of safe dietary \nsupplements that are doing to much so improve public health.\n  When we passed DSHEA unanimously, we noted that improving the health \nstatus of American citizens ranked at the top of the government's \nnational priorities. Never was that statement more true.\n  Over the past decade, the importance of nutrition and the benefits of \ndietary supplements to health promotion and disease prevention have \nbeen documented increasingly in scientific studies.\n  And, we should not forget that healthy lifestyles, including proper \nnutrition, can mitigate the need for expensive medical procedures.\n  Almost daily, we are seeing exciting new reports about the health \nbenefits that dietary supplements offer our citizens.\n  For example, a recent study showed that the specific combination of \nvitamins C, E, and beta-carotene, and the minerals zinc and copper, can \nslow age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease that afflicts \nsome eight million Americans and is a leading cause of visual \nimpairment, blindness, and loss of independence in those over age 65.\n  According to the Alliance for Aging Research, the U.S. currently \nspends more than $26 billion annually in additional health care costs \nfor people over age 65 who lose their ability to live independently. \nObviously, slowing this loss of independence due to blindness for even \none year not only dramatically improves quality of life for the aging \npopulation, but it can save the Federal government potentially billions \nof dollars.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment as well, \nand just wanted to follow up with a few comments on what Senator Harkin \nhas just said.\n  Seven years ago, my colleague from Iowa and I joined with then-\nRepresentative Bill Richardson to enact this law, the Dietary \nSupplement Health and Education Act, that set up a rational, consumer-\nfriendly framework for the regulation of dietary supplements. Our \ncolleague from Nevada, Senator Reid, joined us in this effort as the \noriginal cosponsor of our bill.\n  Since that time, dietary supplements are being integrated more and \nmore into mainstream medicine, a fact of which I am proud.\n  By any measure, a majority of Americans regularly rely on dietary \nsupplements to enhance and maintain their healthy lifestyles. A study \nby Prevention Magazine last year found that approximately 151 million \nconsumers currently take dietary supplement products. A study this year \nfound that the most common reason consumers use these vitamins, \nminerals, herbs and amino acids is for overall health and general well-\nbeing.\n  I am aware that an April, 2001, study from the Journal of Clinical \nEndocrinology and Metabolism demonstrated that vitamin D and calcium \nsupplementation plays an important role in reducing systolic blood \npressure and maintaining thyroid hormone levels.\n  In addition, a January, 2001 Lancet article showed that patients with \nknee osteo-arthritis who took glucosamine supplements reduced painful \nand often disabling symptoms.\n  Not only are dietary supplements an essential component of a healthy \nlifestyle, I believe, but they represent a vital industry in our \ncountry as well. In my home state of Utah, the dietary supplement \nindustry has grown to an estimated $2 billion in annual sales; and one \nestimate I have seen places the national level at $12 billion.\n  I thank the Senator for allowing me to add those compelling facts.\n  We have become increasingly alarmed over reports that unsafe or \nmislabeled dietary supplement products are being marketed.\n  We have also been concerned about the increasing use of so-called \n``performance-enhancing products'' by our youth. Many of these products \nare being marketed as dietary supplements, although it is not clear \nthey fall within the legal definition of dietary supplement.\n  I think the Aging Committee, under the very capable leadership of \nSenators John Breaux and Larry Craig, did us all a great service in \npointing up some of the areas where we need improvement.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There is no question that there are some problems here, \nbut I believe the majority of dietary supplements are upstanding \nproducts that are safe and accurately labeled. What we hope to convince \nour colleagues, though, is that problems in the marketplace are largely \na failure of enforcement, and not of the law.\n  I want to make clear to our colleagues that the bill we passed \nunanimously in both houses--seven years ago--and I might add that the \nSenate passed it unanimously, not once, but twice contains all the \ntools the government needs to address these concerns, as we will \noutline.\n\n[[Page S11093]]\n\n  But just don't take my word for it. The Commissioner of Food and \nDrugs in the Clinton Administration--Jane Henney, a physician who we \nall respect a great deal--has assured the Congress on more than one \noccasion that she believed the law provided her with adequate authority \nto act against unsafe or mislabeled products. Commissioner Henney \nassured me both publicly and privately that she was confident the law \nis sufficient to allow the FDA to act against any bad actors in the \ndietary supplement marketplace. It might be beneficial for us to review \nsome of the authorities that the FDA has.\n  First, the law allows the Food and Drug Administration to deem any \ndietary supplement product adulterated if the label fails to list any \nof the ingredients contained within and the quantities of those \ningredients. This provision is contained within section 403(s)(1) and \n(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n  If a product is adulterated, it cannot be legally sold. So, a \nmislabeled dietary supplement product is, quite simply, illegal.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me add one point. Many of us were disturbed over \nreports that Olympic athletes or prospective Olympic athletes became \ndisqualified after they took ``banned substances\" which were alleged to \nhave been dietary supplements that contained substances not listed on \nthe bottle.\n\n  I have no way of verifying those reports. What I can say is this. The \nInternational Olympic Committee sets the rules for what products may be \ntaken by athletes. This is not a matter of U.S. law. If the IOC wanted \nto ban orange juice, it is perfectly within its rights.\n  But, obviously, athletes--as with all consumers--should be able to \nrest assured that they know what they are ingesting.\n  I was dismayed to read last week that the I.O.C. warned athletes to \navoid dietary supplements because of what it called ``lax quality \ncontrol and labeling.'' This is a situation that should not be \noccurring, and our amendment today will help rectify that situation.\n  The law is not inadequate in this area. It provides consumers with \nthe assurance that they will know what they are buying. As the Senator \nfrom Iowa just said, amendments to U.S. law made by DSHEA make explicit \nthat dietary supplement containers must be labeled accurately as to \ntheir contents.\n  The principal way that the FDA enforces this provision is through its \nGood Manufacturing Practice standards, or ``GMPs,'' which FDA \ninspectors use to make certain that manufacturing plants adhere to \nrigid guidelines for safe and sanitary processing of foods, including \ndietary supplements.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Let me follow up on that. The second tool DSHEA provided \nto FDA is the authority to promulgate new GMPs specifically for dietary \nsupplements. Those regulations have been in development for the past \nseveral years, a source of great frustration to me and the Senator from \nUtah as well.\n  We have written, called, and implored the Office of Management and \nBudget and the Department of Health and Human Services to release these \nregulations, which we understand have been ready in near-final form for \nalmost a year.\n  It is past time those regulations were issued.\n  Mr. HATCH. I want to add my strong concern about this as well. I \ndon't know what else we can do to free up these regulations. They are \nan essential consumer protection of the law and they should be allowed \nto go into effect.\n  Another concern we have heard is that there are products on the \nmarket that are making false or misleading claims. That could be true \nfor any product regulated by the FDA, be it a drug, a cosmetic, a food, \nor a medical device.\n  In fact, I recall vividly the 1993 hearing that the Labor and Human \nResources Committee held on dietary supplements. Then-Commissioner \nDavid Kessler came up and testified for the FDA. He spread out a table-\nfull of products he believed made non-truthful claims. The reason I \nremember this so well was that I was so angry the Commissioner had \nbrought this ``show and tell'' display to the Congress rather than take \naction against the products.\n  The question I asked him then remains operative today. If the FDA \nthinks there are products on the market that are inaccurately labeled, \nthen why doesn't it remove them from the market?\n  Mr. HARKIN. So that there was absolutely no question about the FDA's \nauthority in this area, during the debate on DSHEA we made clear that \nthe FDA maintained its ability to act against false and misleading \nclaims under section 343(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic \nAct. This is the third important tool FDA maintains to assure consumers \nthat they are taking safe and accurately labeled dietary supplement \nproducts.\n  I worked very hard to make certain that we provided the FDA with \nadequate authority in this area, but that we did not open up the \nopportunity for the agency to twist and torture the law as they had \ndone in years past.\n  Mr. HATCH. Another concern related to the accuracy of claims is that \nof the manufacturer's ability to substantiate the claims made. Health \nclaims made with respect to a product's ability to treat, mitigate or \ncure disease must be pre-approved by the FDA under a ``significant \nscientific agreement'' standard mandated by the Nutrition Labeling and \nEducation Act (NLEA).\n  Claims not subject to this preapproval, that is, claims which \ndescribe the product's effect on the structure or function of the body, \nmust be substantiated under the fourth tool we provided the FDA in \nDSHEA. Under section 343(r)(6)(B) of the FFD, manufacturers must be \nable to substantiate the accuracy of their claims made. That is an \nimportant consumer protection.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is amazing to me, and a complete indication of how \nlittle-enforced DSHEA is, that the FDA has apparently never invoked \nthis section of the law. We hope to correct that deficiency with our \namendment today.\n  Mr. HATCH. I mention another important consumer protection included \nin the law. Questions have also been raised about the safety of \nsupplements in the marketplace. In DSHEA, we added a fifth tool to \nFDA's arsenal--section 402(f)(1)(A), which deems that a dietary \nsupplement is adulterated if it presents a significant or unreasonable \nrisk of illness or injury under the conditions of use recommended or \nsuggested in labeling. If no conditions of use are suggested or \nrecommended in the labeling, then the FDA could act against a \nsupplement that presented a significant or unreasonable risk of illness \nor injury under ordinary conditions or use.\n  This safety standard was carefully developed in close consultation \nwith Senator Kennedy and Congressmen John Dingell and Henry Waxman, all \nof whom worked with us to assure we had the strongest possible measure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If I could just amplify on that. To address any lingering \nconcerns our colleagues might have that the FDA did not have adequate \nauthority to act against an unsafe supplement, we provided an \nadditional sixth tool to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. We \ngave the Secretary emergency authority to act against any supplement he \nbelieves poses an ``imminent hazard'' to public health.\n  Mr. HATCH. Indeed. That authority, contained within section \n402(f)(1)(C) of the FFD, allows the Secretary to act immediately, no \nquestions asked, to remove a product from the market if he believes \nthere is a safety problem. Similar emergency authority is contained \nwithin the drug law.\n  I must take this opportunity to reject the many press accounts, which \nhave so irresponsibly and inaccurately alleged that the Dietary \nSupplement Health and Education Act ``deregulated'' dietary \nsupplements, or falsely stated that ``FDA's hands were tied'' by our \nAct. Nothing is further from the truth, as we have just explained in \noutlining all the authorities provided to FDA to make certain dietary \nsupplements are safe and accurately labeled.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am in complete agreement. It astounds me that we could \nadd so many new authorities to the law and have it called \n``deregulation.'' I am affronted by any suggestion that the majority of \nboth bodies of Congress could have endangered the public health in a \nway these news reports have falsely claimed. That simply was not the \ncase, and I hope whomever is planting all these inaccuracies will stop.\n\n[[Page S11094]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. So, with all of these tools in FDA's arsenal, legitimate \nquestions have been raised about why unsafe or mislabeled products are \nbeing sold. Indeed, many of us are asking, ``What is the problem? Why \nare these products still on the market?''\n  Mr. HARKIN. Implementation of this Act has not been a top priority of \nthe Food and Drug Administration.\n  Mr. HATCH. I did a little research on this, and I found some \ninformation which may be of interest to my colleague, since he is the \nvery capable chair of the Labor-HHS Subcommittee.\n  It might interest my colleagues to learn that the FDA, the \ngovernment's most important consumer protection agency since it \nregulates over one-quarter of each dollar in goods sold, is severely at \na disadvantage when its funding is compared to its sister public health \nagencies.\n  For the past three fiscal years, the FDA's appropriation has grown an \naverage of 6.9 percent.\n  By comparison, the Centers for Disease Control's appropriation has \ngrown an average of 12.5 percent; in fact, it grew 15.5 percent between \nfiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2001.\n  The National Institutes of Health's budget has grown an average of \n14.5 percent.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am aware of this, and this is a situation we must work \nto rectify. Despite the best efforts of those of us who serve on the \nAppropriations Committee, the FDA is not getting the budget it \ndeserves.\n  In fact, Senator Hatch and I had hoped to use our amendment as a \nvehicle for adding funds to the FDA's budget, but we were reluctant to \ndivert funds from the many agriculture programs funded within this \nbill.\n  For that reason, we are offering this amendment today, in the hopes \nthat it will focus FDA's efforts on better enforcement of the law.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is our hope that the House-Senate conferees may be able \nto work to add funds for dietary supplement enforcement, so that other \nprograms of the FDA are not penalized through addition of our language.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. President, so what our amendment does today is help the FDA make \nenforcement of DSHEA a top priority.\n  I want to emphasize as Senator Hatch did that the vast majority of \ndietary supplements are marketed safely and legally, by manufacturers \nwho care deeply about the public and its health. However, for the few \nbad actors who are giving industry a bad name, who are taking advantage \nof a trusting public, I say ``it is time to get tough.''\n  In so doing, we admonish the agency not to wield the heavy hand it \ndid for over three decades, the over-bearing attitude which led \nCongress to pass DSHEA so overwhelmingly in the first place.\n  Mr. HATCH. There is a reason that over two-thirds of both the House \nand Senate cosponsored our legislation, and that reason is quite \nsimple:\n  Many of us recall FDA's efforts to classify vitamins as over-the-\ncounter drugs if they exceeded 150 percent of the Recommended Daily \nAllowance, an effort which would have rendered 200 milligrams of \nvitamin C a drug. Congress rejected that with the Proxmire amendment in \n1976.\n  More recently, many of us recall FDA's efforts to ban the supplement \nblack currant oil by saying it was an unsafe food additive. The FDA's \nlogic was that the black current oil was added to a food--the gelatin \ncapsule in which it was contained. The Seventh Circuit rejected this \nlogic, terming the FDA's scheme ``Alice in Wonderland.'' The First \nCircuit also described FDA's approach as ``nonsensical.''\n  It was nonsensical, and we are all grateful that wiser heads have \nprevailed since.\n  So, let me make clear that the intent of our amendment is not to \nforearm the FDA so it can embark on another of these fairy-tale \njourneys, but rather to help it take enforcement actions against those \nwho are clearly violative of three aspects of the law: whether products \nare accurately labeled; whether claims are truthful and non-misleading; \nand whether claims are substantiated.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is our hope that the funding provided in our amendment \nwill allow the FDA to devote additional staff to this effort. In so \ndoing, we will be making great strides toward assuring Americans--be \nthey farmers in Iowa, athletes in Utah, stay-at-home moms throughout \nthe U.S., or even members of Congress--that the dietary supplement \nproducts they take are safe and accurately labeled.\n  Mr. HATCH. The FDA simply has to get serious about enforcing this \nlaw. We cannot allow the very few products of poor quality to cast a \nnegative shadow over the rest of the industry, which is so law-abiding.\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to recognize the great efforts of my \npartner in this endeavor--Senator Harkin. I am appreciative of his hard \nwork here, and the fact that we can count on him for non-partisan \nleadership on behalf of both his constituents and the American \nconsumers.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am appreciative of the Senator from Utah's efforts as \nwell. It is no secret here that he is the world's number one proponent \nof dietary supplements. He has done an effective job of helping promote \nthe public health through safe dietary supplements and I am pleased we \nhave joined together today in this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, earlier I introduced the American Travel \nIndustry Stabilization Act on behalf of myself, Senator Conrad, Senator \nReid, Senator Inouye, and Senator Specter. I wish to simply explain the \npurpose for this. As we proceed to think through the economic stimulus \npackage that we will put together to try to provide lift to this \neconomy, we need to consider what has happened to the travel and \ntourism industry in this country. I had a hearing on this subject in \nthe commerce subcommittee that I chair. We know we have provided some \nloan guarantees to the airlines, and they were very much needed loan \nguarantees, and I supported them.\n  But, there are a range of other travel and tourism businesses and \nindustries in this country that are in desperate trouble. We propose \nsome loan guarantees to try to be helpful to them during these \ndifficult times. Their businesses are directly tied to the airline \nindustry. When this country shut down the airline industry, we, of \ncourse, had a significant impact on the ancillary businesses attached \nto that industry as well.\n  I want to call attention to this bill today in the hope that my \ncolleagues who are interested in this subject--and I know there are \nmany of them--may consider cosponsoring this legislation. I know my \ncolleague, Senator Reid, who is in the Chamber may well wish to say a \nfew words as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I applaud and commend the Senator from North \nDakota for his leadership on this issue. The travel industry needs \nhelp. This bill will give the travel industry the shot in the arm it \nneeds. Whether it is travel agents, whether it is rental car agencies, \nor the myriad of other people who support the tourism industry, we must \nstart someplace. This is certainly a start.\n  In 30 States, the No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3 economic driving force in \nthose States is tourism and we have kind of ignored tourism since \nSeptember 11. We can no longer afford to do that.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues who are sponsors of this \nlegislation and the rest of the Senate. This is essential legislation \nand I hope we can move it very quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11095-5", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11095-S11096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AVIATION SECURITY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is Thursday of almost the fifth or sixth \nweek since September 11. We still have not passed aviation security in \nthe U.S. Congress. I cannot impress upon my colleagues enough how much \nI hear from aviation personnel, from law enforcement personnel, and \nfrom people throughout our country, how we are beginning to press the \nline of irresponsibility in our not having moved on this.\n  There is a reason our economy is still hurting. There are many \nreasons. None of them are going to be solved by any one single \ncomponent. We understand that. We began September with a huge overhang \nin the telecommunications industry. All of us knew the stocks in the \nmarketplace were significantly overvalued. There was almost a decline \ntaking place prior to September 11. But we have a responsibility to do \neverything in our power to begin to turn the economy around and to \nprotect a lot of our citizens who are beginning to feel a lot of \neconomic pain.\n  One of the principal ways we can do that is in the stimulus package \nitself, as well as in passing aviation security.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle in \nthe\n\n[[Page S11096]]\n\nHouse suggest publicly that one of the reasons they don't want to pass \nthe aviation federalization is because some of these folks may be in a \nunion; they may join a union. Are we really so far away already from \nthe events of September 11 that people around here have forgotten that \nthe firemen and the police officers and a lot of the medical \ntechnicians and other folks who lost their lives on September 11 were \nmembers of a union?\n  We do an extraordinary insult to that event and to what has happened \nsince by having ideology and politics suddenly come back to prevent us \nfrom doing something that almost every person in the industry accepts \nis the best way to provide the highest level of security to the \nAmerican people.\n  I respectfully suggest the best way we can provide a stimulus to this \ncountry is not by turning around and putting $1.4 billion into the \ncoffers of IBM and billions more dollars into the coffers of a whole \nhost of energy companies and other large corporations--not because they \nare bad, not because we think they don't deserve help in some way or \nanother, they have received a lot of it, but because a stimulus package \nis supposed to do the most you can not to reward past investments or \nmake up for past mistakes but put money, cash, into the hands of \nAmericans now, to create jobs now in order to turn the economy around.\n  What we have staring us in the face is a whole set of requirements to \nmake our post offices more secure, to make our trains more secure, to \nmake our airlines more secure, to make countless of numbers of \ncomponents of our health system more capable of responding to the \npotential of disease. When all of these security needs are staring us \nin our face, there ought to be a stimulus package that is security-\noriented, that has some spending in it that puts people to work now at \nthose tasks we know we have to embrace.\n  To see this package that came out of the House of Representatives \nwith its extraordinary amount of giveaway, I find it an insult to the \npurpose of the Congress, to the weight of this moment of history, and \nto the obligation that we all have to bring security to our country and \njobs to our citizens.\n  I hope we are going to do a better job in the course of the next \nweeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11096-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11096-S11097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             U.S.-CHINA COOPERATION IN THE WAR ON TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, following the terrorist attacks in New York \nand Washington, Chinese officials pledged to join the global effort \nagainst terrorism. But comments made by Chinese officials following the \nattacks indicate that they may try to exact policy concessions from the \nUnited States in exchange for support for anti-terrorism efforts. For \nexample, according to a Reuters article on September 18, China's \nForeign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao stated, ``The United States has \nasked China to provide assistance in the fight against terrorism. \nChina, by the same token, has reasons to ask the United States to give \nits support and understanding in the fight against terrorism and \nseparatists.'' He went on to discuss the importance of combating \nTaiwan's independence activists. And more recently--at the Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation summit in Shanghai--press reports have indicated \nthat China's support is lukewarm at best.\n  It is my hope that the Chinese government will ultimately choose to \noffer support in our war effort; however, it is important that as we \nseek China's assistance, we not lose sight of the myriad concerns that \nremain regarding the communist regime's failure to abide by \ninternationally recognized norms of behavior--including Beijing's \nproliferation of technology used to make ballistic missiles and weapons \nof mass destruction, and military buildup aimed at our long-standing, \ndemocratic ally, Taiwan.\n  The Chinese government's continuing sale of arms and other assistance \nto many of the countries on the State Department's list of state \nsponsors of terrorism is of particular concern. Beijing has sold \nballistic missile technology to Iran, North Korea, Syria, Libya, and \nPakistan. It has sold nuclear technology to Iran and Pakistan. It has \nsold Iran advanced cruise missiles and aided that country's chemical \nweapons program. And it has provided technological assistance to Iraq.\n  We should also keep a close eye on the Chinese military's continued \nmodernization and buildup--the immediate focus of which is to build a \nmilitary force capable of subduing Taiwan, and capable of defeating it \nswiftly enough to prevent American intervention. According to the \nDepartment of Defense's Annual Report on the Military Power of the \nPeople's Republic of China, released in June 2000, ``A cross-strait \nconflict between China and Taiwan involving the United States has \nemerged as the dominant scenario guiding [the Chinese Army's] force \nplanning, military training, and war preparation.''\n  Amidst China's alarming behavior, on October 17, the Washington Post \nreported that the Administration was considering a waiver on the \nsanctions placed on China following the Tiananmen Square crackdown that \nwould have allowed the U.S. sale to China of spare parts for Blackhawk \nhelicopters. Richard Fisher, editor of the China Brief newsletter at \nthe Jamestown Foundation, addressed that possibility in an op-ed \npublished in the Washington Times on October 21. He stated.\n\n       . . . it is not time to end Tiananmen massacre sanctions on \n     arms sales to China, such as allowing the sale of spare parts \n     for U.S.-made Blackhawk helicopters. The Administration is \n     considering this move to reward China and to allow it to \n     rescue U.S. pilots that may be downed over Afghanistan. China \n     has plenty of good Russian helicopters to do the job, and it \n     makes no sense to revive military-technology sales to China \n     as it still prepares for war against Taiwan.\n\n  The Washington Post later reported that the administration is not \nplanning to waive sanctions that would allow the sale of the helicopter \nparts. And it is my hope that the United States--in our effort to gain \nChina's support for our war on terrorism--will not consider such a move \nas long as China fails to live up to its international commitments. As \nRichard Fisher also stated in his op-ed, ``...to qualify as a U.S. ally \nin the war on terrorism, China must stop lying about its nuclear and \nmissile technology proliferation and prevent states like Pakistan and \nIran from fielding nuclear missiles. Also, China must end its economic \nand military commerce with regimes that assist terrorists, like the \nTaliban and Iraq. In addition, China must halt its preparations for war \nagainst Taiwan, a war that will likely involve U.S. forces.''\n  The past month has seen longtime foes, at least for now, espouse a \ncommon goal in America's efforts against terrorism. Scores of nations \nhave taken the side of America in a battle to eradicate terrorists of \nglobal reach--but the most populous nation on the globe must truly back \nits words with actions. Until it does so, Beijing should not be \nrewarded by any relaxation of U.S. restrictions aimed at curbing the \ncommunist regime's unacceptable behavior.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of that op-\ned be included in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 21, 2001]\n\n                     Looking to a Non-ally in China\n\n                          (By Richard Fisher)\n\n       While the United States is correct to seek Chin's \n     assistance in what will be a long war against terrorism, it \n     should harbor no illusions that China will share all of the \n     same goals in this fight, or that China will cease being a \n     longer term adversary.\n       Yes, Chinese President Jiang Zemin was swift to condemn the \n     Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, and China \n     has shared some counterterrorism intelligence. And it would \n     be welcome to have Beijing's full cooperation for the many \n     battles ahead. But as he meets Jiang Zemin in Shanghai, \n     President Bush should be mindful that any future Chinese \n     assistance in the war on terror can only be effective if \n     China reverses the aid that it has given to a number of rogue \n     states. For example, should Osama bin Laden or his allies \n     obtain a nuclear weapon in the future, it is likely that many \n     of its components will come via Pakistan or Iran, and could \n     very well carry the stamp ``Made in China.'' China's \n     assistance to Pakistan's nuclear weapons program dates back \n     to the mid-1970s and includes the training of engineers, \n     provision of nuclear-fuel-reprocessing components, and \n     perhaps even the plans to make nuclear weapons. China has \n     sold Pakistan more than 30 of the 180-mile range M-11 \n     ballistic missiles. China has also sold Pakistan the means to \n     build solid-fuel 450-mile-range Shaheen-1 and 1,200-mile-\n     range Shaheen-II missiles.\n\n[[Page S11097]]\n\n       China has sold Iran nuclear-reactor and nuclear-fuel-\n     reprocessing components and cruise missiles that could \n     conceivably carry a small nuclear device.\n       For more than a decade the United States has been \n     ``engaging'' Chinese officials in a repetitive pattern of \n     U.S. complaints, Chinese denials and promises not to \n     proliferate, occasional U.S. slap-on-the-wrist sanctions, but \n     with no definitive cessation of Chinese proliferation. So \n     far, Beijing is correct to question U.S. resolve. It took the \n     Bush administration until August this year to impose some \n     sanctions on Chines companies selling Shaheen missile parts \n     to Pakistan, a program that likely began early in the Clinton \n     administration, which produced no Shaheen-related sanctions \n     during its two terms.\n       This failure to stop Chinese proliferation helped fuel the \n     nuclear missile race between India and Pakistan. And as the \n     later weakens under pressure from radical pro-Taliban forces, \n     the danger increases that nuclear weapon technology could \n     fall into the hands of terrorist groups like bin Laden's. But \n     rather than isolate radical Islamic regimes that harbor or \n     aid terrorists, Beijing engages them, too. In recent months, \n     China has been caught red handed helping Saddam Hussein to \n     build new fiber-optic communications networks that will \n     enable his missiles to better shoot down U.S. aircraft. \n     Beginning in late 1998, according to some reports, after they \n     gave Beijing some unexploded U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles, \n     the Taliban began receiving economic and military aid from \n     China.\n       The more important subtext is that China engages these \n     regimes because it shares their goal of cutting down U.S. \n     power. And, incredibly, China may be attracted to using their \n     methods as well. Bin Laden himself has a fan club in some \n     quarters of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA). In their \n     1999 book ``Unrestricted Warfare,'' two PLA political \n     commissars offer praise for the tactics of bin Laden. They \n     note that bin Laden's tactics are legitimate as the tactics \n     that Gen. Norman Schwartzkopf used in the Persian Gulf war. \n     Of bin Laden, they state that the ``American military is \n     inadequately prepared to deal with this type of enemy.''\n       While some U.S. analysts downplay ``Unrestricted Warfare'' \n     as written by officers with no operational authority, it is \n     well known that the PLA is preparing to wage unconventional \n     warfare, especially cyber warfare. Should China attack \n     Taiwan, the PLA would want to shut down the U.S. air \n     transport system.\n       The PLA now knows this can be done with four groups of \n     terrorists, or perhaps by computer hackers that can enter the \n     U.S. air traffic control system and cause four major airline \n     collisions.\n       So to qualify as a U.S. ally in the war on terrorism, China \n     must stop lying about its nuclear and missile technology \n     proliferation and prevent states like Pakistan and Iran from \n     fielding nuclear missiles. Also, China must end its economic \n     and military commerce with regimes that assist terrorists, \n     like the Taliban and Iraq. In addition, China must halt its \n     preparations for a war against Taiwan, a war that will very \n     likely involve U.S. forces.\n       In this regard, it is not time to end Tiananmen massacre \n     sanctions on arms sales to China, such as allowing the sale \n     of spare parts for U.S.-made Blackhawk helicopters. The \n     administration is considering this move to reward China and \n     to allow it to rescue U.S. pilots that may be downed over \n     Afghanistan. China has plenty of good Russian helicopters to \n     do that job, it makes no sense to revive military technology \n     sales to China as it still prepares for war against Taiwan.\n       In his Sept. 20 speech, Mr. Bush correctly declared that \n     ``any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism \n     will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.'' \n     China's aid to the Taliban and its continued nuclear \n     proliferation are not friendly actions. The United States \n     should press China to undo all it has done to strengthen the \n     sources of terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11097-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n\n                            lytton rancheria\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, the ranking member is correct. In Sec. 128, \nthe Committee recognizes the exceptional and unique circumstances \nsurrounding the enactment of Sec. 819 of P.L. 106-568. The \ncircumstances do not, however, diminish the requirement that the tribe \nfully comply with the provisions of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \nand in particular, with respect to class III gaming, the compact \nprovisions of Sec. 2710(d) or any relevant Class III gaming procedures. \nThe Committee further recognized that nothing in Sec. 819 of P.L. 106-\n568 be construed as permitting off-reservation gaming except in strict \ncompliance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n\n\n                      clean coal power initiative\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in the Statement of the Managers \naccompanying the Interior and Related Agencies Conference Report, there \nis language on page 117 that sets certain limitations on the types of \nprojects eligible to compete for Clean Coal Power Initiative funds. \nSpecifically, the language states; ``Further, all co-production \nprojects must provide at least half of their output in the form of \nelectricity.'' This language could have the effect of precluding \ncertain innovative co-production projects from competing for the funds \nappropriated. Can the Chairman explain the intent of this language?\n  Mr. BYRD. This language was included based on information provided to \nthe Committees that these limitations were consistent with the fiscal \nyear 2001 solicitation.

Mr. President, yesterday, during consideration of the \nfiscal year 2002 foreign operations, export financing, and related \nprograms appropriations bill, a colloquy between myself and Senator \nMcConnell concerning American companies doing business in Colombia was \nprinted in the Record. That colloquy was incomplete, and should not \nhave been included in the Record in that form. Among other things, it \nomitted a copy of an amendment that Senator McConnell and I had \nconsidered offering to the foreign operation bill. Therefore, I ask \nunanimous consent that our complete colloquy, a well as our proposed \namendment, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                            amendment no. --\n\n       On page 144, line 3, after the colon insert the following: \n     ``Provided further, That of the funds appropriated under this \n     heading for Colombia, $10,000,000 shall not be obligated or \n     expended until the Government of Colombia resolves \n     outstanding international arbitration decisions which favor \n     United States corporations more than 50 percent owned and \n     controlled by United States citizens:''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we often hear from American companies whose \ninvestments in developing countries have gone sour. That is the risk of \ndoing business, and nobody disputes that. But international arbitration \nwas\n\n[[Page S11098]]\n\ncreated in order to mitigate the risks of overseas investments and to \navoid depending on shaky legal institutions in those countries. \nArbitration has been one of the principal building blocks to the \nextraordinary growth in international trade. It has brought investments \nto countries which would have otherwise been considered too risky \nbecause it gives investors and sovereign nations an agreed-upon \nmechanism to resolve disputes. Key to its success is the agreement by \nall parties that arbitration can only work if it is binding.\n  It recently came to my and Senator McConnell's attention that at \nleast two American companies, Sithe Energies, Inc., and Nortel \nNetworks, have participated in binding arbitration to resolve disputes \nwith the Colombian Government. According to information we have \nreceived, Sithe and Nortel, and, we are told, companies from Mexico and \nGermany, have won clear, unambiguous rulings through binding \narbitration, only to have the Colombian Government renege on its \ncommitment to honor the arbitration decision.\n  We have not had an opportunity to discuss these matters with the \nColombian Government, but if our information is correct, that American \ncompanies have agreed to binding arbitration and prevailed, only to \nhave the Colombian Government refuse to pay, that is unacceptable. We \nwant to help Colombia's economy develop in an environment where the \nrule of law is respected. This is crucial to Colombia's future. If \nColombia flaunts the rules of the private market, it is will have \nincreasing difficulty attracting private investment because it cannot \nbe trusted.\n  Representatives of these companies have urged us to withhold a \nportion of U.S. assistance to Colombia until the Colombian Government \nfulfills its legal obligations to these companies. We considered \noffering such an amendment, because of the importance we give to the \nfair treatment of American companies, respect for the rule of law, and \nthe international arbitration process. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of our proposed amendment be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  We decided no to offer the amendment, because of the precedent it \ncould set. But we want to emphasize that respecting binding, \ninternationally sanctioned arbitration is essential to the investment \nthat will ultimately be the engine for Colombia's economic development. \nNo amount of foreign assistance can do that. The pattern of Colombia's \napparent abuse of the international arbitration process is very \ndisturbing, and by conveying our concern about it we mean to strongly \nencourage the Colombian Government to act expeditiously to resolve \nthese matters.\n  Finally, I would note that the Andean Trade Preferences Act addresses \nthis issue directly. Section 203 of that act makes clear that the \nPresident shall not designate any country a beneficiary under the ATPA, \nif the country fails to act in good faith in recognizing as binding or \nin enforcing arbitral awards in favor of U.S. citizens or a company \nwhich is 50 percent or more beneficially owned by U.S. citizens. The \nATPA is up for extension or expansion, and Senator McConnell and I will \nbe following this issue closely, as well as discussing it with \nColombian Ambassador Moreno and U.S. Ambassador Patterson, both of whom \nI have the utmost respect for.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me just add a word or two to Senator Leahy's \ncomments. Few would disagree that Colombia's long term political and \neconomic development resides in its ability to forge a lasting peace, \nestablish the rule of law, and attract foreign investment. No service \nis done to the nation or the people of Colombia when the Colombian \ngovernment refuses to recognize the legitimacy of an arbitration award \nto international businesses. The leadership in Bogota should understand \nthat such action further erodes confidence in the overall investment \nclimate in Colombia within the international business community--and in \nforeign capitals. It is my hope that the Colombian government takes \nnote of the amendment Senator Leahy and I contemplated offering and \ninitiates corrective action in the very near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11098-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FREEDOM SUPPORT ACT\n\n\n                                armenia\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to take a brief moment to share \nwith my colleagues the tremendous effort to craft an agreement which \npreserves section 907 of the FREEDOM Support Act while permitting \nAzerbaijan to assist with America's war on terrorism. In the closing \nminutes of the Senate's debate on the FY 2002 Foreign Operations bill \nyesterday, Senators Sarbanes, Brownback, and I reached agreement on my \namendment which strikes a balance between our counter terrorism needs \nand vital ongoing efforts to negotiate a peace between Armenia and \nAzerbaijan with respect to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their constructive input into my \namendment. In addition, the Administration deserves our gratitude for \ntheir willingness to work with Congress on finding a compromise which \naddressed the concerns of all sides of this complicated issue. It is no \nsecret in the halls of Congress that there was serious consideration of \na certification under section 907 as a means of securing the legal \nauthority to provide counter terrorism assistance to Azerbaijan. Such a \ncertification would have permanently eliminated section 907 as a means \nto support the sensitive ongoing negotiations between Armenia and \nAzerbaijan. Despite some carveouts over the years, this was the most \nserious challenge to section 907 since its inception. Senator Sarbanes \nand I, in particular, strongly believe that section 907 is vital to \nongoing peace efforts and that such a certification was an unacceptable \noption.\n  I also want to recognize the invaluable input and encouragement of \npatriotic Armenian-Americans who understand the importance of \nsupporting America's efforts to fight terrorism on every front. But, \ncooperating with Azerbaijan should not mean that the negotiations on \nNagorno-Karabakh should be disrupted. Here again, the amendment \nprovides protection. Counter terrorism assistance to Azerbaijan will \nnot be forthcoming unless the President determines and certifies to \nCongress that the assistance ``will not undermine or hamper ongoing \nefforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement between Armenia and \nAzerbaijan or be used for offensive purposes against Armenia.'' The \nAdministration has assured us that they support peaceful negotiations \nand that none of our counter-terrorism efforts will disrupt these \ntalks.\n  In addition to the amendment preserving section 907, I sponsored an \namendment to provide assistance to Armenia under the Foreign Military \nFinancing and the International Military Education and Training \nprograms. This historic amendment will for the first time provide \nArmenia with valuable military assistance. The IMET funding will allow \nthe U.S. to work with and train with the Armenian military thereby \nimproving America's ability to work with Armenia on a host of security \nissues. This will ensure that Armenia remains a strong ally and \ncoalition partner in the war against terrorism.\n  We will have an opportunity to revisit issues relating to Armenian \nand Azeri relations on the FY 2003 Foreign Operations bill, and I want \nto make clear to my colleagues and the Administration that I will be \nclosely following developments in Azerbaijan and Turkey to lift the \nblockades against Armenia. I encourage these countries to fully \nunderstand the importance and necessity of lifting their blockades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11098-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11098-S11099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the horrific terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, and America's response to those attacks have shifted our \nsense of priorities about what's important for our Nation. But, as we \nmove forward with the challenging task of eliminating terrorism and \nsecuring the safety of our citizens, we must not lose sight of other \nvalues that make our Nation great.\n  Some are using the shock and fear caused by the September 11 attacks \nto call for renewed focus on our energy security, and more particularly \nto renew their calls to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to \nexploration and\n\n[[Page S11099]]\n\ndrilling. While I agree that it is high time we developed a strategy to \nreduce our dependence on imported oil and secure the Nation's energy \nresources and infrastructure, we should all know by now that developing \nANWR will not achieve this goal.\n  I have followed the Arctic debate closely for many, many years. I've \nspoken to this body on a number of occasions about this subject. The \nfacts and best evidence on the main points at issue persuade me, as \nthey have in the past, that drilling in the Arctic is both unnecessary \nand unwise.\n  First, there is no oil bonanza in the Arctic that will impact or \nenhance the Nation's energy security, and neither the Senate nor the \nNation should be rushed to an ill-fated judgement based on wildly \ninflated claims to the contrary.\n  At peak production, many years down the road, the arctic coastal \nplain might at best replace about 5-9 percent of the foreign oil \nimported by the U.S. Oil from the arctic refuge will not have any \nmeaningful impact on either the price of gasoline or on our demand for \nimported oil. It would do nothing to secure energy independence for our \nNation.\n  Arctic oil is also expensive to produce and transport to the lower \n48. Which is why, until Congress banned oil exports, the oil companies \nshipped a lot of that oil to foreign markets. If those exports bans are \never lifted, we'll likely see any oil from the refuge shipped overseas. \nThere's a reason America imports so much OPEC oil, it's cheap.\n  In short, our energy security lies in reducing our dependence on oil, \nperiod. The more efficiently our Nation uses oil, gas and other energy \nresources, the more we depend upon alternative energy resources and \nrenewable resources, the less vulnerable our country will be to oil \nsupply disruptions and price spikes.\n  Moreover, the arctic refuge's coastal plain is the last 5 percent of \nthe entire Alaskan coastal plain that is not already open to oil \ndrilling. The remaining 95 percent of the Alaskan coastal plain is not \nonly open to drilling, but vast tracts of it have yet to be explored \nfor their potential oil reserves.\n  What's so special about this last 5 percent, preserved since the \nEisenhower Administration? It's the heart of all the wildlife diversity \nin the entire Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. That 5 percent is the \ncentral calving ground for the porcupine caribou herd, the exact same \nlandscape that would be scarred with oil wells, drill pads, roads and \npipelines if drilling is allowed. That 5 percent is essential migratory \nhabitat for 135 species of birds and waterfowl. That 5 percent is home \nto polar bears, musk oxen, grizzly bears, wolves, 36 species of fish, \nand more than 100 other species of wildlife. In fact, ANWR is the most \nimportant polar bear denning area in Alaska.\n\n  That 5 percent is also a desert compared to the rest of the arctic \ncoastal plain. I have yet to hear a satisfactory explanation from the \noil companies about how they will deal with the fact that there is not \nenough water to build ice roads in ANWR. If you can't build ice roads \nthat ``disappear'' in the spring, you have to build gravel roads. Given \nwhat we have been told about the dispersed nature of recoverable oil in \nthe refuge, the oil companies will need to build a lot of roads, roads \nthat will crisscross the refuge, disrupting the natural flow of water \nduring the spring, marring the wild character of the refuge and \ninterfering with wildlife migration patterns.\n  In Montana, we know we must have working landscapes where we \nencourage oil and gas development, promote timber harvest and grow our \nNation's food and fiber. We know such landscapes, if carefully managed, \ncan also produce abundant wildlife populations and much recreational \nopportunity. Balancing appropriate development with the need to protect \nspecial places, for ourselves and for our children, is a dance \nMontanans know well.\n  So too the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We have far too many \nother options open to us right now to secure our energy future than any \nthat may or may not materialize from drilling in ANWR. Americans aren't \nready to drill, and America doesn't need to. I hold that the Arctic \nrefuge is too wild to waste.\n  I would also like to address briefly some concerns I have with some \nof the energy proposals made by our colleagues in the House. I am \nparticularly concerned with provisions that affect oil and gas leasing \nprocedures on public lands.\n  The House suggests that we replace the current public process \nsurrounding oil and gas leasing on public lands with a centralized \nfederal mandate that would remove any meaningful public involvement \nfrom oil and gas leasing decisions on national forest lands.\n  In the 1980's, many Montanans traveled to Washington, DC to urge \npassage of legislation to bring the public into oil and gas leasing \ndecisions on national forest and public lands. Their efforts and those \nof many others resulted in the passage of the 1987 Federal Onshore Oil \nand Gas Leasing Reform Act.\n  Under current law, the forest supervisor analyzes likely impacts, \nconsiders surface resources and consults with the public before \ndetermining (1) where Federal oil and gas leasing is authorized and, \n(2) under what circumstances it should occur. Even if a lease is \noffered, it often contains provisions to protect wildlife and the \nenvironment through stipulations that limit roads and other industrial \ndevelopments.\n  Legislation endorsed by our colleagues in the House would eliminate \nthe existing public involvement process.\n  That legislation would strip national forest supervisors of existing \nauthority to make decisions regarding oil and gas leasing. The local \nsupervisor's authority would be transferred and centralized under the \nSecretary of Agriculture who is directed to ``ensure that unwarranted \ndenials and stays of lease issuance and unwarranted restrictions'' on \nall oil and gas exploration or development operations ``are \neliminated'' from oil and gas operations ``on Federal land.'' This \nseems out of character with the often repeated pledge from the \nAdministration and others, that local communities should have a greater \nvoice in the public lands decisions that directly affect them.\n  Other language would direct the Secretaries of Agriculture and \nInterior to order a rewrite of oil and gas leasing plans to remove \nlimits or restraints on oil and gas exploration and development. This \nwould include local Montana decisions that limit oil and gas \ndevelopment designed to protect native trout streams.\n  Still more language would give the oil and gas industry the power to \nforce a review of previous decisions to limit oil and gas development \non national forest and BLM lands, including written explanations \nshowing ``whether the reasons underlying the previous decision are \nstill persuasive.''\n  In Montana, such decisions authorized millions of acres for leasing \nwhile protecting municipal drinking water sources for Helena, Red \nLodge, and East Helena, popular hunting areas, key habitat and wild \nlands in the Elkhorns Wildlife Management Area, Line Creek Plateau and \nalong Montana's Rocky Mountain Front. Montanans invested years in each \nof these decisions. They have been well debated, they have withstood \nlegal challenge. They do not need to be reopened by Congress.\n  In short, I want to express my opposition to any similar provisions \nthat may arise in the Senate. As I have outlined above, what may seem \nlike obscure language to other members of this body is vitally \nimportant to Montanans, and could have an enormous impact on my state, \nand the landscapes Montanans have declared too precious to develop.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11099-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11099-S11100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred June 15, 2000 \nin Denver, CO. First-degree murder charges were filed against Samuel \nGrauman, 21, who was accused of killing, Daniel O'Brien, 36, because \nO'Brien was gay. Grauman and another man were believed to have \nbefriended gay men they thought would be easy robbery targets.\n\n[[Page S11100]]\n\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11100-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FIFTY CALIBER--WEAPON OF CHOICE FOR CRIMINALS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor S. 505, a bill introduced \nby Senator Feinstein to strengthen the regulation of long-range fifty \ncaliber sniper weapons. These weapons are among the most powerful, and \nleast regulated, firearms legally available. Information provided by \nthe Violence Policy Center demonstrates why Senator Feinstein's \nlegislation is so important.\n  According to the VPC's analysis, the ease with which fifty caliber \nweapons are purchased has made them popular with criminals and fringe \ngroups. For example, in February of 1992, a Wells Fargo armored \ndelivery truck was attacked in a ``military style operation'' in \nChamblee, Georgia, by several men using a smoke grenade and a fifty \ncaliber sniper rifle. Two employees were wounded. And according to the \nGeneral Accounting Office, fifty caliber sniper rifles have been found \nin the armories of drug dealers in California, Missouri, and Indiana.\n  In March of 1998, in my home State of Michigan, Federal law \nenforcement officers arrested three members of a radical group known as \nthe North American Militia. The men were charged with plotting to bomb \nFederal office buildings, destroy highways, utilities and public roads, \nand assassinate a number of Federal officials. A fifty caliber sniper \nrifle was among the weapons found in their possession.\n  Fifty caliber weapons are too powerful and too accessible to be \nignored any longer. Tighter regulations are needed. I urge my \ncolleagues to support Senator Feinstein's bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11100-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL JAKE SHUFORD\n\n Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Rear \nAdmiral (Select) Jake Shuford, United States Navy, for the outstanding \nperformance, dedication, and leadership he has exhibited over the last \ntwo years as the Director of Senate Liaison for the Navy. Admiral \nShuford is a sailor's sailor.\n  Since receiving his commission as a Naval officer over 27 years ago, \nJake Shuford has distinguished himself through his tactical acumen, \nseamanship, and ``can-do'' attitude. He commanded the hydrofoil USS \nAries, PHM 5, the guided missile frigate USS Rodney M. Davis, FFG 60, \nand the guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, CG 64. During Admiral \nShuford's command of the Gettysburg, the ship won the prestigious \nBattle ``E'' Efficiency award while successfully firing 69 Tomahawk \nmissiles during strike operations in Iraq and Kosovo.\n  Admiral Shuford took the conn of the Navy's Senate Liaison Office in \nSeptember 1999, earning the admiration of Senators who have worked with \nhim. Admiral Shuford epitomizes what is best in our Navy and in \nAmerica, and the Senate, the Navy, and the American people are indebted \nto him for his many years of distinguished service. He will soon leave \nthe Senate for his first flag officer assignment in charge of duty \nassignments for all 375,000 officers and enlisted personnel in the \nNavy. As he departs Washington, D.C. and the Senate, I know that my \ncolleagues wish the very best for Jake, his wife, Cathy; their \ndaughter, Campbell; and their sons, Bennett and John.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11100-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11100-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11100-5", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REPORT ON A DRAFT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION TO IMPLEMENT THE \nINTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST BOMBINGS AND \n THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THE FINANCING OF \n              TERRORISM--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 51\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Enclosed for the consideration of the Congress is a legislative \nproposal to implement the International Convention for the Suppression \nof Terrorist Bombings and the International Convention for the \nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism. Also enclosed is a detailed \nexplanation of the bill's provisions.\n  Title I of the bill is entitled the ``Terrorist Bombings Convention \nImplementation Act of 2001.'' It would implement the International \nConvention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, which was signed \nby the United States on January 12, 1998, and which was transmitted to \nthe Senate for its advice and consent to ratification on September 8, \n1999. In essence, the Convention imposes binding legal obligations upon \nState Parties either to submit for prosecution or to extradite any \nperson within their jurisdiction who unlawfully and intentionally \ndelivers, places, discharges, or detonates an explosive or other lethal \ndevice in, into, or against a place of public use, a State or \ngovernment facility, a public transportation system, or an \ninfrastructure facility. A State Party is subject to these obligations \nwithout regard to the place where the alleged act covered by the \nConvention took place. Twenty-eight States are currently party to the \nConvention, which entered into force internationally on May 23, 2001.\n  Title II of the bill is entitled the ``Suppression of the Financing \nof Terrorism Convention Implementation Act of 2001.'' It would \nimplement the International Convention for the Suppression of the \nFinancing of Terrorism, which was signed by the United States on \nJanuary 10, 2000, and which was transmitted to the Senate for its \nadvice and consent to ratification on October 12, 2000. The Convention \nimposes binding legal obligations upon State Parties either to submit \nfor prosecution or to extradite any person within their jurisdiction \nwho unlawfully and wilfully provides or collects funds with the \nintention that they should be used to carry out various terrorist \nactivities. A State Party is subject to these obligations without \nregard to the place where the alleged act covered by the Convention \ntook place. The Convention is not yet in force internationally, but \nwill enter into force on the thirtieth day following the date of the \ndeposit of the twenty-second instrument of ratification, acceptance, \napproval, or accession with the Secretary General of the United \nNations.\n  I urge the prompt and favorable consideration of this proposal.\n                                                      George W.

I am also pleased to transmit my written approval, \nauthorization, and determination concerning the Protocol, and an \nunclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) \nconcerning the Protocol. (In accordance with section 123 of the Act, as \namended by title XII of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring \nAct of 1998 (Public Law 105-277), a classified Annex to the NPAS, \nprepared by the Secretary of State in consultation with the Director of \nCentral Intelligence, summarizing relevant classified information, will \nbe submitted to the Congress separately.) The joint memorandum \nsubmitted to me by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy \nand a letter from the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nstating the views of the Commission are also enclosed.\n  I am informed that the proposed Protocol has been negotiated to be in \naccordance with the Act and other applicable law, to meet all statutory \nrequirements, and to advance the nonproliferation and other foreign \npolicy interests of the United States.\n  The Protocol amends the Agreement for Cooperation Between the \nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of the \nKingdom of Morocco Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy in two \nrespects:\n  1. It extends the Agreement, which expired by its terms on May 16, \n2001, for an additional period of 20 years, with a provision for \nautomatic extensions thereafter in increments of 5 years each unless \neither Party gives timely notice to terminate the Agreement; and\n  2. It updates certain provisions of the Agreement relating to the \nphysical protection of nuclear material subject to the Agreement.\n  As amended by the proposed Protocol, I am informed that the Agreement \nwill continue to meet all requirements of U.S. law.\n  Morocco is in the early stages of developing a nuclear research \nprogram, with support from the United States and the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The United States firm, General Atomics, \nis currently building the country's first reactor, a small (2 megawatt) \nTRIGA Mark II research reactor that will use low-enriched uranium fuel. \nGeneral Atomics' completion of the project cannot occur without an \nAgreement for Cooperation in force.\n  Morocco is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \nWeapons (NPT) and has an agreement with the IAEA for the application of \nfull-scope safeguards to its nuclear program. Morocco is a signatory to \n(but has not yet ratified) the Convention on the Physical Protection of \nNuclear Material, which establishes international standards of physical \nprotection for the storage and transport of nuclear material.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed protocol and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe protocol and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes for both \nsections 123b. and 123d. of the Atomic Energy Act. My Administration is \nprepared to begin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee and House International Relations Committee as \nprovided in section 123b. Upon completion of the 30-day continuous \nsession period provided for in section 123b., the 60-day continuous \nsession period provided for in section 123d. shall commence.\n                                                         George Bush.  \nThe White House, October 24, 2001.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11101-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to authorize the provision of educational and health \ncare assistance to the women and children of Afghanistan; read the \nfirst time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, no one in America can have read a \nnewspaper or seen a television report about the plight of women in \nAfghanistan, and children, without being horrified. All 13 women of the \nSenate, led by myself and Senator Mikulski, are introducing a bill \ntoday that would authorize the President to give education, health care \nbenefits, and other help to the women and children of Afghanistan, and \nto those in refugee camps, at the first opportunity we possibly can.\n  Women are not able to be educated under the Taliban. Women are not \nable to get health care under the Taliban. They are not able to work.\n  I am going to talk about some of the things that have happened. But \nmy colleague from Maryland and my colleague from the State of \nWashington have other commitments, and I want to yield to my colleague \nfrom Maryland who is a cosponsor of this bill. Every woman in the \nSenate is sponsoring this bill: Senator Boxer, Senator Collins, Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Feinstein, Senator Stabenow, Senator Clinton, Senator \nCantwell, Senator Snowe, Senator Murray, Senator Lincoln, Senator \nCarnahan, and of course my key cosponsor, Senator mikulski from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President I rise to be a proud original cosponsor \nwith Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison in introducing the Afghan Women and \nChildren Relief Act. This act will provide education and assistance and \nhealth care to the women and children of Afghanistan.\n  I have stood with the Senator from Texas on other issues related to \nthe employment of women. We worked on economic security, pension \nsecurity, health care opportunity, and educational opportunity for \nwomen and children as we worked on other issues related to the economic \nissues of our own States. Today I join with her, speaking on behalf of \nall of the women of the Senate--and I know all of the men of the Senate \nwho will join with us--to see this crisis in Afghanistan is an \nopportunity to lift up the women and children from what has happened \nunder the Taliban regime.\n  The Taliban regime represents repression of all people and \nparticularly is most brutal to women and children. Taliban restrictions \non women's participation in society make it nearly impossible for women \nto exercise their basic human rights. Restrictions on Afghan freedom of \nexpression, association, and movement deny women full participation in \ntheir society. They don't even have access to the basic ability to \nwork, go to school, and have health care.\n  The facts speak for themselves. Afghanistan has one of the highest \ninfant mortality rates in the world. Only 5 percent of the rural people \nhave access to safe drinking water. It is estimated hat 42 percent of \nall deaths in Afghanistan, up until this terrible situation was because \nof contaminated food and water. Over one-third of the Afghan children \nunder 5 suffer from malnutrition.\n  I could go on with the data from the World Health Organization and \nothers. This is not about statistics, this is about the people of \nAfghanistan, particularly the women. Because their human rights have \nbeen denied, we need to work with our own Government and the NGOs to \nmake sure, as we work to create a new world order in Afghanistan, that \nwomen and children will have access to education and health care.\n  Often people have said the women face these repressions under the \nguise of traditional customs. Let me say this: I don't believe that. In \nan article in the New York Times by scholars Jane Goodwin and Jessica \nNeuwirth entitled ``The Rifle and the Veil,'' they point out that the \nvery visible repression against women is not about religion, ``it is a \npolitical tool for achieving and consolidating power.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that that op-ed be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. MIKULSKI. They point out that under the guise of religion, using \na distorted view of the Koran, women are forced into subjugation. Women \nin Afghanistan can't work in their own professions. Women and girls \ncan't go to school. Women who are capable of teaching in school are \nforbidden to do so. Widows, who are deprived of their ability to earn a \nliving, have been beaten when they have resorted to begging to feed \nthemselves and their children.\n\n[[Page S11106]]\n\n  Afghan women and children have fled to escape this repression, but \ntheir plight as refugees is not much better. At the camps, either in \nPakistan or other countries or in no-man's land, they depend on \ninternational assistance for survival, but their future is bleak. \nSecretary Albright went to those Afghan camps. I spoke to her about it. \nShe talked about those dire circumstances. And she led the effort to \nhelp the Afghan people.\n  We now have an opportunity to create a new world order. This is what \nthis legislation is all about. America will demonstrate our solidarity \nand our support to these women and children. As America leads the \ninternational coalition against al-Qaida and the Taliban regime, let's \nuse this as the opportunity to help the women and children there.\n  Let me conclude by saying this. As our Govenment--and I salute \nPresident Bush on what he is doing--works to create a new government in \nAfghanistan, if we are having a new government, let us insist that \nthere not be the old rules, the old repression. We respect religion, we \nrespect the traditions of the Muslim Community, but I do not believe \nthat includes denying health care and education to the women.\n  If we are going to have a new world order, let's start with making \nsure we help the women and children. I thank Senator Hutchison for \ntaking the lead on this legislation.\n  On a personal note, I particularly want to thank Senator Hutchison at \nthis time, when I have been displaced from my own office, for the \nwonderful courtesy she has extended to my staff to be able to work in \nsome of her rooms at the Russell Building. I say to you, Senator \nHutchison, not only has the space meant a lot to us, but so did your \ngraciousness in making it available.\n  See, Mr. President, this is what the terrorists don't understand. \nThey can't stop us. We are the red, white, and blue party. If you look \nat Hutchison, Mikulski, and the other 11 women of the Senate, the \nTaliban can't stop us from helping the women of the world. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 19, 2001]\n\n                         The Rifle and the Veil\n\n                 (By Jan Goodwin and Jessica Neuwirth)\n\n       Anyone who has paid attention to the situation of women in \n     Afghanistan should not have been surprised to learn that the \n     Taliban are complicit in terrorism. When radical Muslim \n     movements are on the rise, women are the canaries in the \n     mines. The very visible repression of forced veiling and loss \n     of hard-won freedoms coexists naturally with a general \n     disrespect for human rights. This repression of women is not \n     about religion; it is a political tool for achieving and \n     consolidating power.\n       Sher Abbas Stanakzai, then the Taliban regime's deputy \n     foreign minister, admitted as much in a 1997 interview. ``Our \n     current restrictions of women are necessary in order to bring \n     the Afghan people under control,'' he said. ``We need these \n     restrictions until people learn to obey the Taliban.''\n       In the same way that many Islamic extremist crusades use \n     the oppression of women to help them gain control over wider \n     populations, the Taliban and Osama bin Laden are now \n     employing the tactics of terrorism to gain control.\n       The Taliban did not start the oppression of Afghan women, \n     nor have they been its only practitioners.\n       In 1989, Arab militants working with the Afghan resistance \n     to the Soviet Union based in Peshawar, Pakistan--and helping \n     to finance the resistance fighters--issued a fatwa, or \n     religious ruling stating that Afghan women would be killed if \n     they worked for humanitarian organizations. At that time, a \n     third of the Afghan population of 15 million were displaced \n     from their homes, and many were heavily dependent on \n     humanitarian groups for food and other necessities. Among the \n     3.5 million of these refugees who were then living in \n     Pakistan, many were war widows supporting their families by \n     working for the aid groups. After the fatwa, Afghan women \n     going to work were shot at and several were murdered. Some \n     international aid groups promptly stopped employing Afghan \n     women, and though many women were infuriated, most complied \n     after being intimidated by the violent attacks. Soon \n     afterward, another edict in Peshawar forbade Afghan women to \n     ``walk with pride'' or walk in the middle of the street and \n     said they must wear the hijab, the Arab black head and body \n     covering and half-face veil. Again, most women felt they had \n     no choice but to comply.\n       In 1990, a fatwa from Afghan leaders in Peshawar decreed \n     that women should not attend schools or become educated, and \n     that if they did, the Islamic movement would meet with \n     failure. The document measured 2 feet by 3 feet to \n     accommodate the signatures of about 200 mullahs and political \n     leaders representing the majority of the seven main \n     mujahedeen parties of Afghanistan. The leading school for \n     Afghan girls in Peshawar, where many Afghan refugees still \n     lived, was sprayed with Kalashnikov gunfire. It closed for \n     months, and its principal was forced into hiding.\n       When an alliance of mujahedeen groups took over in Kabul in \n     1992, it forced women out of news broadcasting and government \n     ministry jobs and required them to wear veils. But it was the \n     Taliban who institutionalized the total oppression of women \n     after Kabul fell to them four years later, and who required \n     the total coverage of the now familiar burqa.\n       Now, as Afghans, Pakistanis and Americans look to the \n     future of Afghanistan, most plans call for a broad based new \n     government giving representation to all of Afghanistan's \n     ethnic groups and major political parties, including the \n     Taliban. No one, however, has called for the participation of \n     women, even though women, after many years of war, now almost \n     certainly make up the majority in the adult Afghan \n     population.\n       Afghan women gradually gained rights in the first decades \n     of 20th century. Women helped write their country's \n     Constitution in 1964. They served in parliament and the \n     cabinet and were diplomats, academics, professionals, judges \n     and even army generals. All of this happened well before the \n     Soviets arrived in 1979, with their much-touted claim of \n     liberating Afghan women.\n       Many of the forces now opposing the Taliban include \n     signatories of the later fatwas that deprived Afghan women of \n     their rights. History is repeating itself.\n       Any political process that moves forward without the \n     representation and participation of women will undermine any \n     chances that the principles of democracy and human rights \n     will take hold in Afghanistan. It will be the first clue that \n     little has changed.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for \nher kind remarks. We are all in this, and one of the things we are \ntrying to do is help our colleagues who still are out of their offices, \nwho have not received mail for over a week, who do not have the places. \nWe are happy to do that and especially because my colleague from \nMaryland has had two postal workers who have died at the Brentwood \nStation. At a time of huge crisis in her State, she is left without an \noffice. We all want to back her and help her and help her constituents \nin every possible way.\n  I will take a few moments, because I deferred to the Senator from \nMaryland, to talk about some of the statistics in Afghanistan that have \ncaused us to highlight this issue. We have seen repression of women in \nother countries, but we have never seen the repression that is \nhappening in Afghanistan today. The pictures of women being beaten on \nthe streets because their burqa was opened a little bit by the wind, or \nbeaten on the streets because the religion police heard a clicking of \nheels of shoes on the sidewalk and believed the woman must be wearing \nhigh-heeled shoes--this is unbelievable.\n  In one account I read in a journal, a widow who did not have a male \nrelative to escort her to the hospital watched her small son die of \ndehydration. She tried to make the journey to the hospital by herself \nbut was beaten by the religion police as she left her home.\n  This is not a country that should be allowed, with the Taliban, to do \nthis to its own people. That is why we are standing here today to say \nwe want to come in and make sure the women and children of this country \nhave opportunities for health care, for education. We are not trying to \nput our religion on other people. We are not trying to say you have to \ndo it our way. But there are some basic human rights that everyone \naccepts, and they are that a woman is equal to a man, that a woman \nshould be able to have basic health care, she should be able to take \nher children to see a physician, she herself should be able to go to a \nphysician. That is not the case today in Afghanistan. She can't see a \nphysician because she is not allowed to see a male physician and the \nwoman physicians are gone because the Taliban will not allow women to \nwork.\n  Afghanistan today has a 16-percent infant mortality rate and a 25-\npercent children mortality rate.\n  We cannot allow that to stand. That is why the women of the Senate \nare standing together to say when the aid comes in that we want to make \nsure the women get the aid in health care, that they are allowed to be \neducated, and that they will be allowed to support themselves and their \nchildren in a respectful way, and not be required to beg on the streets \nand sell themselves into prostitution, which is happening today.\n\n[[Page S11107]]\n\n  That is why we feel so strongly abut this and why we are standing \ntogether and hoping that we can pass this bill with the help of the \nForeign Relations Committee very quickly--so the women and children in \nthe refugee camps in Afghanistan know that when America helps, it will \nbe help for them too because they are also equal people.\n  I yield up to 3 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, \nis recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to, first, thank my colleague, Senator Hutchison, for her \nleadership and for the eloquent words of Senator Mikulski who spoke \nearlier.\n  This is a wonderful example for working together. We are in the \nChamber today not as Democrats or Republicans but as the women of the \nSenate speaking because we believe it is our responsibility to speak up \non behalf of the women and children of Afghanistan who are being \nterrorized by their own government, the Taliban.\n  Senator Hutchison spoke very eloquently about the statistics and \nabout what is happening. I am honored to represent in Michigan a very \nlarge Muslim-American population. They assure me this is not Islam. It \nis not the words of the Koran. This is an extremist, perverted group of \npeople who have twisted the words. They hide behind the religion, which \nis a very perverse and twisted view of the world that is \ndisenfranchising half of their population.\n  We come together to indicate that, as they move to a new coalition \ngovernment, we expect and we will demand on behalf of the women and the \nchildren of the world that the women and children of Afghanistan are \nnot left out of this new government; that the women who are physicians \nin Afghanistan will be allowed to treat their patients; that the \ncountry will benefit from the women who have been educated and who have \nthe skills to help rebuild that country; and, that we empower the next \ngeneration of girls by making sure they are educated and will have the \nskills and knowledge they need to help rebuild the country of \nAfghanistan.\n  We know that once the Taliban has been defeated there will be much \nwork to be done. If they continue to exclude half of their population, \nthey are not only committing a travesty against them but they are \nplacing their own country in jeopardy by not using the talents and the \nabilities that are there.\n  I, once again, thank all of my colleagues. It is wonderful to see \neveryone in the Chamber and to see a unified effort. I know we will \ncontinue to stay focused until we make sure the outrageous violence and \natrocities that have been committed are stopped, and that the women and \nchildren of Afghanistan have the opportunity to live and be healthy and \nsuccessful in their country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, is \nrecognized for 2 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Texas and my colleague \nfrom Maryland for their extraordinary leadership in shining the \nspotlight on a very dark, dark part of the Earth.\n  We, the women of the Senate, represent different States, different \nideologies, and are from different backgrounds, but we are united in \nour determination to expose the horrendous treatment of the women and \nchildren of Afghanistan. We are determined to help them in every way \npossible.\n  It was our colleague from Louisiana, Mary Landrieu, who first brought \nto my attention an excellent CNN documentary called ``Women Behind the \nVeil,'' which demonstrated the appalling treatment by the Taliban of \nthe women of Afghanistan. Women are not allowed to be educated.\n  That, to me, says it all because by denying women an education, you \nare denying them knowledge, awareness, and opportunity.\n  I am happy to join with the Senator from Texas, my colleague, Mrs. \nHutchison, and the Senator from Maryland, my colleague, Ms. Mikulski, \nin this excellent initiative. I hope all of our colleagues will join in \nsupporting this legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for her \nremarks, and the Senator from Michigan.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, \nis recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Let me add my thanks to Senators Hutchison and Mikulski for their \nleadership on this important piece of legislation. Let me pledge to my \nfriend from Texas and my friend from Maryland, and all the women in the \nSenate who are behind this, as the only woman on the Foreign Relations \ncommittee, that I will work with them to ensure we move this forward to \nmarkup.\n  The committee has a very good record when it comes to dealing with \nthis issue. In 1999, Senator Brownback and I coauthorized a resolution \ncondemning the practices of the Taliban. It went through the Senate \nvery fast. We pointed out some of the issues that my colleagues have \npointed out today about the treatment of women. It said the United \nStates should never recognize the Taliban if they continue this type of \ntreatment of women.\n  Yesterday, in the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, Senator \nBrownback and I were able to pass two amendments: one that called for \nwomen to be part of a new postwar Afghanistan government; and, second, \na training program.\n  We actually funded that for women leaders in Afghanistan. But unless \nwe pass this bill ensuring the health of the women in Afghanistan who \nhave been denied health care--there is a law under the Taliban that \nsays a woman may not go to a male doctor. She may not go to a male \ndoctor. Yet they have said to the women doctors that they can no longer \npractice and they can no longer learn medicine.\n  What kind of situation is this? Women are forced to wear the burqas. \nYou see them more and more on television. I put one on to get the sense \nof how it feels. I say to my friend from Texas that it feels as if you \nare nonexistent. It feels as if you are a nobody. You are no one.\n  In closing, let me say that this important piece of legislation must \nbe heard soon by the Foreign Relations Committee. We must act on it. We \nmust ensure that women who have been mistreated and who have been made, \nin essence, invisible must get the health care they deserve as well as \ntheir children. To carry that out, the Boxer-Brownback amendment which \nwe agreed to yesterday must be part of an emerging new government.\n  My thanks to my friend from Texas. This a very strong bill. It has \nbipartisan support. I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California \nfor her efforts, along with Senator Brownback, to bring the plight of \nAfghan women to the forefront. The bill that we have before us I hope \ncan be moved expeditiously. I want any dollars that go to Afghanistan \nor to the refugees who are Afghans in camps outside the country to help \nthese women who have been so abused.\n  I am stunned at some of the statistics. Forty-two percent of all \ndeaths in Afghanistan are due to diarrheal diseases caused by \ncontaminated food and water. This is 2001. Contaminated food and water \nis the most preventable kind of affliction that we could ever imagine. \nWe have clean food and water. Forty-two percent of the people who die \nfrom something so preventable is just stunning.\n  As we have said, before the Taliban came, women could be educated. \nSchools were coeducational. Women accounted for 7 percent of the \nteaching force. Women represented 50 percent of government workers, and \n40 percent of the physicians were women. But today, the Taliban \nprohibits women from working in any occupation.\n  Clearly, the Afghan people, before the Taliban, had basic human \nrights. The women and children were treated at least with respect. But \nwhen the Taliban came in and prevented women\n\n[[Page S11108]]\n\nfrom being educated, prevented women from working, and prevented them \nfrom having health care, you wonder what kind of beasts are these? What \nkind of beasts would do this to other human beings? What kind of beast \nwould let a little child die because the mother had no one to escort \nthem to the hospital?\n  We cannot conceive of this kind of terrorism to the people who are \ntheir own people, much less what they have harbored against America.\n  So, Mr. President, I am proud the women of the Senate are coming \ntogether to speak for the women of Afghanistan, to say that our dollars \nare going to come and help rebuild Afghanistan.\n  We have no problem with the people of Afghanistan. We feel sorry for \nthe people of Afghanistan living under this regime of the Taliban. That \nis why we are trying to root the Taliban out because they have harbored \nterrorists who have killed innocent Americans and innocent people from \naround the world. But when we do, we are going to make sure that women \nand children have the basic respect and the basic human rights that \neveryone in the world should have, and American dollars coming in will \nbe dollars that will help bring a quality of life that is the basic \ndecency that we all expect in our lives.\n  I know the bill will stay at the desk. I hope to work with the \nmembers of the Foreign Relations Committee to have an expedited \nprocedure.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today with the other 13 women \nSenators and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas to introduce a bill \nthat will authorize the use of existing funds in the foreign operations \nbill for the education and health care services of Afghan women.\n  There is no doubt that the Taliban regime has been particularly \nheinous to the women of Afghanistan. Women are not allowed in public, \ngirls are not sent to school, and the basic human rights that are \nafforded to women across the world, especially women here in America, \nare denied.\n  The record is clear, women and girls in Afghanistan are abused \nregularly by the Afghan Government. It is my hope that the monies made \navailable by this bill will help ameliorate the lives of the Afghan \nwomen by bettering their educational opportunities and increasing their \naccess to necessary and vital health care services.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise this morning alongside my \ncolleagues Senators Hutchison and Mikulski to voice my support for the \nAfghan Women and Children's Relief Act of 2001, which I am proud to \ncosponsor.\n  This bill authorizes the President to provide educational and health \ncare assistance to the women and children living in Afghanistan and as \nrefugees in neighboring countries. This is an important new front in \nour war against terrorism--and for the people of Afghanistan--and a \nmuch overdue one at that.\n  For over twenty years Afghanistan has known little but violence, \nbloodshed, and civil war. It has seen mass killings, disappearances, \nland mines, child soldiers, and one of the world's largest refugee \noutflows and internally displaced populations in history.\n  And, since the Taliban takeover in 1996, Afghanistan has also been \nwitness to a horrifying war against women.\n  Until the accession of the Taliban women in Afghanistan were involved \nin public life, had access to education, were able to travel freely \nwithin their own country, and had access to jobs. Indeed, many were \nprofessionals--doctors, nurses, and teachers.\n  But under the Taliban women have been systematically denied access to \neducation and health care. They have been denied access to employment. \nThey have been forced to wear burkas, an all-encompassing garment, if \nthey go out in public--something they can only do if accompanied by a \nmale relative. Indeed, without a male relative to accompany them, many \nare even denied access to humanitarian aid and food assistance.\n  In short, under the Taliban Afghan women have been systematically \ndenied their basic and fundamental human rights.\n  At the same time Afghanistan has witnessed a burgeoning humanitarian \ncrisis. Two decades of war have destroyed or degraded much of the \nhousing stock in Afghanistan's major cities. Afghan war-widows have \nbeen forced to become the primary bread-winners for their families and \nchildren, but, under Taliban law, are often prevented from working. As \na result, tens of thousands of Afghan children are undernourished or \nmalnourished. Most Afghans do not have access to safe drinking water. \nIt has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world. Millions \nof Afghans have fled to neighboring countries, and millions more are \ninternally displaced within their own country.\n  I first became concerned about the plight of Afghan women five years \nago, during the 105th Congress, when, shortly after the Taliban \ntakeover of Kabul, I first started to hear the horror stories of what \nwas transpiring in a country which at that time rarely made the news \nsection of American newspapers.\n\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee I held a public \nhearing on women's rights in Afghanistan to learn more about what was \nhappening, and I introduced legislation which condemned the Taliban, \ncalled on the United States to provide additional humanitarian \nassistance to the people of Afghanistan, and stated that the U.S. \ngovernment should not recognize any government of Afghanistan which \nsystematically maltreated women.\n  Alongside a handful of my colleagues--Senators Boxer and Brownback \nforemost among them--I have continued to try to bring attention to this \nissue in the years since, addressing it in letters to the President, \naddressing it every year in statements on International Woman's Day, \ncosponsoring further legislation in the Senate, and, earlier this year, \nurging the Administration to consider additional emergency assistance \nfor the people of Afghanistan, with an emphasis on the special needs of \nwomen and children.\n  For too many years, however, all too few people listened.\n  But I would argue that how a regime treats its women and children can \nbe seen as an early warning indicator that can alert us to larger \nsystemic problems that demand our attention.\n  Indeed, as I stated before the Foreign Relations Committee in \naddressing this issue in 1998, ``The conditions of near-anarchy that \nhave resulted from the sectional fighting and civil war have created in \nAfghanistan an environment well-suited for the training of terrorists \nand the production and shipment of drugs. It is no coincidence that \nOsama bin Laden has chosen Afghanistan as a base of operations . . . \n.''\n  Today, tragically, we have all become experts on Afghanistan and its \ntumultuous recent history.\n  The ``Afghan Women and Children's Relief Act of 2001'' is an \nimportant statement of the United States commitment to the future of \nAfghanistan and its people. A commitment to make sure that \nAfghanistan's women and children, who have borne the brunt of the \nTaliban's brutality for the past half-decade, will receive the \nassistance they need, and have the opportunity for a future.\n  As we continue to push forward in our effort to combat international \nterrorism I can think of few tasks more valuable than making sure that \nAfghanistan will never again face conditions which have made it an \nideal base for terrorist operations, and that the people of Afghanistan \nwill never again face the human suffering that they have been subject \nto for the past two decades.\n  I urge my colleague to join with Senators Hutchison and Mikulski in \nsupport of this important piece of legislation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this very \nimportant piece of legislation. I would like to commend my colleagues, \nSenators Hutchison, Mikulski, and Boxer, for their leadership not only \non this bill, but also in these issues generally. Women and children \nmake up 80 percent of refugees worldwide. In Afghanistan, twenty years \nof civil war, political turmoil, continuing human rights violations and \nrecent drought have already displaced more than five million of the \nAfghani population. Some four million refugees are displaced in \nneighboring countries and across the world, while another one million \npeople are internally displaced within Afghanistan. Before September \n11, severe drought had brought the country to the verge of famine and \nexisting Taliban\n\n[[Page S11109]]\n\nrestrictions on relief agencies had severely hampered the delivery of \nassistance and civilian access to basic services. Approximately 1 \nmillion people, the majority of them women and children, will die of \nstarvation if aid is not given to them before the winter arrives.\n  In addition to being denied physical needs, the women and children of \nAfghanistan have long been denied the freedom and respect that are also \nnecessary to sustain human life. The oppressive rule of the Taliban \nremoves from their lives the very freedoms we embrace, education, free \nspeech, and the opportunity to make a living. The Taliban restrictions \nare so severe that they make it nearly impossible for women to exercise \nthese and other basic human rights. Under this rule, the very lives of \nwomen are in danger. There are hundreds of stories of women being \nexecuted, raped, or beaten. Just recently, RAWA reported that at least \nfour women in the last six months were burned alive by their husbands \nfor their alleged infringements of Taliban law. They received no trial \nfor these offenses and their husbands were praised, not punished for \nthese horrible acts.\n  The women members of the Senate and many of our colleagues have \ncalled on the U.S. to act to bring an end to these violations of basic \nhuman rights. Over the past several years, Senator Boxer, myself and \nothers have called on the Foreign Relations Committee to take immediate \naction to ratify the Convention to End Discrimination Against Women, a \ntreaty designed to stamp out this type of behavior worldwide. Over the \nlast two months, Americans have been reminded of the importance of \ntheir freedoms. Many are prepared to die to protect them for all \nAmericans. Yet if we are to be the true and lasting democracy that we \nhope to be, democracy and freedom cannot end at our borders. We must \nwork to ensure that men, women and children everywhere know what it is \nlike to be truly free.\n  This bill recognizes that the war to preserve freedom must be fought \non two fronts. First, through military action designed to bring an end \nto oppressive rule. Secondly, through targeted humanitarian aid \ndesigned to provide education, health care, food and support to the \ncitizens so that they may one day form the base of a new and free \nsociety. In providing this type of support to the women and children of \nAfghanistan, the United States is protecting the principles upon which \nthis country was founded, that each and every individual in this world \nis ``endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that \namong these are, life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n  Again, I am proud to join Senators Hutchison and Mikulski in support \nof this important legislation and I urge that we pass it into law as \nsoon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11109-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11109-S11115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AFGHANISTAN WOMEN AND CHILDREN RELIEF ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues today \nto again raise the plight of women, girls and children in Afghanistan. \nI commend Senator Hutchison and Senator Mikulski for taking the \ninitiative to introduce the Afghan Women and Children Relief Act of \n2001.\n  Many of us have been working since the Taliban seized control in \nAfghanistan to give voice to women who have been silenced, beaten, \nharassed and even executed.\n  Afghanistan has been in a cycle of war and conflict for more than \ntwenty years. These two decades have been hard on the Afghani people \nbut especially difficult for women, young girls and children. When the \nTaliban seized control in Afghanistan, the plight of women, girls and \nchildren went from a crisis existence to a catastrophic one.\n  As noted in our bill and mentioned by my colleagues, women in Kabul, \nAfghanistan represented 70 percent of the teachers when the Taliban \ncame to power. Women in Kabul represented 50 percent of the public \nemployees and more than 40 percent of the medical professionals \nincluding doctors. Women students made up 50 percent of the student \nbody at Kabul universities.\n  Throughout Afghan society women served their country, their culture \nand their families as scientists and professors, as members of \nparliament, as leaders of their communities. The Taliban changed all of \nthat quickly and cruelly with little consideration for the rights of \nwomen or the many roles played in Afghan society by women.\n  The Taliban now bans women from working as teachers, doctors or for \nthat matter, in any profession.\n  The Taliban closed schools to women. Not just the teachers. But to \nall young girls. It is against the law for a young girl to attend a \nschool in Afghanistan. To attend school, women and young girls in \nAfghanistan risk floggings, death by stoning, or single shot execution.\n  Women cannot leave their homes without the heavy veil style clothing. \nThey must be accompanied by a male. Women must not laugh or make noise \nin public. The punishment for violating Taliban law as we have now seen \nin several informative documentary pieces can be deadly. Many of my \nconstituents have contacted me shocked and outraged at the video clip \nof the woman ushered into a soccer stadium to the jeers of a crowd. \nShe's forced onto the playing field on her knees where she is quickly \nexecuted by a single shot from a rifle.\n  Women in Afghanistan, every generation now living, is suffering under \nthe Taliban rule. Some have been forced from meaningful lives to \nabsolute poverty. Others now see no future in Afghanistan for \nthemselves and their children. Still others, war widows and elderly \nwomen, are forced into prostitution or forced to sell all of their \npossessions to feed themselves.\n  Yesterday, we passed the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill. I \nserved on this subcommittee for a long time and its many programs offer \nhope to women in Afghanistan. The Afghan Women and Children's Relief \nAct notes many of these programs.\n  We provide assistance to help educate and immunize young girls in the \nworld. We provide assistance in the form of maternal health care and \nfamily planning in the most needy areas of the world. We support \nmicrocredit lending, particularly to women led households, in many \nimpoverished areas of the world.\n  We support international organizations from UNICEF and other UN \nentities to non-governmental organizations based here in the United \nStates and throughout the world. Our bill would include Afghani women \nand girls in these vital programs.\n  As we look to aid women, young girls and children in Afghanistan, we \nmust not assume that simply ending the Taliban rule will cure the \nproblem. We walked away from Afghanistan when the Cold War ended, we \ncannot do that again when the Taliban goes. We must ensure that women \nand children are fully protected in the Afghan government which will \neventually follow the Taliban. Women in Afghanistan must be brought \nback--fully brought back--into Afghani society. All of Afghanistan will \nbe better when women are allowed again to teach, to serve publicly, and \nto treat illness.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for raising this issue. I join \nthem as an original cosponsor of this legislation and I urge its prompt \npassage. Further, I call on all of our colleagues to support the \nappropriate funding levels which will ultimately make a great \ndifference in the lives of Afghani women, young girls and children.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a bill sponsored \nby Senators Hutchison and Mikulski that would authorize the use of \nFederal resources to increase the education, health and living \nstandards for women and children in living in Afghanistan, and as \nrefugees in neighboring countries. Importantly, it also specifies that \nthis assistance is provided in a way that protects and promotes the \nhuman rights of all people in Afghanistan.\n  Allow me to begin by praising the work and leadership of my colleague \nfrom Texas, Senator Hutchison, on behalf of women both at home and \nabroad. This legislation is entirely consistent with her strong beliefs \nand leadership to extend opportunities to women throughout the world, \nand I am proud to join her in support of this effort.\n  It is simply unconscionable that we should even have to consider such \na measure in this day and age. But there should be no mistake, the \nfacts show that Congressional support for women in Afghanistan is \nnothing short of a moral imperative.\n\n[[Page S11110]]\n\n  This issue is not simply a matter of cultural differences, of \nimposing a particular viewpoint on another country or people. This is a \ncore human rights issue, and to ignore the plight of Afghan women is to \nturn our backs on a terrible wrong that we have the power and I would \nsay the obligation as fellow human beings to help right.\n  This is a matter of basic justice, and it's basic justice denied \nunder the current Taliban regime.\n  Prior to the Taliban's assent to power, Afghani women enjoyed both \nstature and freedom. In fact, many Americans may be unaware that \nAfghani women were not only well educated, they constituted 70 percent \nof the nation's school teachers, half of the government's civilian \nworkers, and 40 percent of the doctors in its capital.\n  But that all changed, or, more accurately, came to a crashing and \ntragic halt, with the seizure of the Afghanistan capital in September \nof 1996, when the Taliban began a regime of gender-based apartheid. \nIt's a regime, I'm sad to say, that's been enforced with the most \nextreme brutality.\n  Talk about going backwards, what's happened in Afghanistan hasn't \njust turned back the clock, it's turned back the centuries. While the \ncalendars tell us it's a new millennium, you'd never know it from the \ngraphic and disturbing footage we see from the Taliban-occupied regions \nof Afghanistan, which paint a very different picture of Afghanistan \nthan even five years ago.\n  Today, women have been banished from the work force, flat out not \nallowed to work . . . to earn a living . . . or to support themselves \nor their family. And let's not forget that, according to an October 23 \narticle in the Chicago Tribune, and I quote, ``Tens of thousands of \nwomen were said to be widowed by Afghanistan's long-running battle \nagainst Soviet occupation in the 1980's. Many have had to turn to \nbegging and prostitution.''\n  Under the Taliban, girls aren't allowed to go to school. And women \nhave been expelled from the universities. In fact, incredibly, women \nare prohibited from leaving their homes at all unless accompanied by a \nclose male relative, even in the event of a medical emergency for \nthemselves or their children. These women are under house arrest, they \nare prisoners of their own homes.\n  And if that's not bad enough, they are prisoners within themselves, \nwith the Taliban going to great and inhumane lengths to strip Afghani \nwomen's sense of self and personhood. As the world has seen over and \nover again in the past five years and even more so since the start of \nthe military campaign on October 7th, Afghani women are forced to wear \na burqa, leaving only a mesh hole from which they can view the world in \nwhich they cannot participate.\n  And heaven help those who dare to tread upon or flout these laws. \nPenalties for violations of Taliban laws range from beatings to public \nfloggings to killings, all state sanctioned. While these tragedies are \nnot new, with the world's focus on the plight of the Afghani women, it \nis time for us to stand up and be counted.\n  For myself, I have continually supported efforts to improve the lot \nof women in Afghanistan, cosponsoring a resolution in the last Congress \nto condemn the systemic human rights abuses that are being committed \nagainst women and girls in Afghanistan, and supported a similar \nresolution this year that passed unanimously.\n  We've been a leader in assisting the people of Afghanistan, in fact, \nthe U.S. is the largest single provider of assistance to the Afghan \npeople, and we should continue our leadership, now more than ever, as \nthe Taliban has brought even greater woe upon the Afghan people.\n  It is imperative that we distinguish between the Afghan people and \nthe oppressive ruling Taliban that harbors terrorists within their \nborders. This bill highlights the ongoing plight of the Afghani women.\n  By authorizing the President to provide educational and health care \nassistance to women and children living in Afghanistan, and as refugees \nin neighboring countries, we recognize that women must have a future in \nAfghanistan. This potential for prosperity can only be realized if, as \nin the United States, both men and women have an opportunity to \nparticipate and contribute. That's what this bill is all about, and I \nhope that my colleagues will join us in supporting it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1574. A bill to ensure that hospitals that participate in the \nmedicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act are able \nto appropriately recognize and respond to epidemics resulting from \nnatural causes and bioterrorism; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I do not have to tell my colleagues \nhere in the Senate that bioterrorism has become a reality. Here, and \nthroughout the Nation, we are frightened and frustrated by the lack of \nclear information on what the threats are, and how we are to find the \nresources to protect ourselves. With this need in mind, I proudly offer \nthe ``Public Health Emergency Planning and Information Act of 2001,'' a \nbill which would provide grants to hospitals to prepare for public \nhealth emergencies, and that would fund programs to provide the public \nand medical providers with accurate information about potential \nbiological attacks.\n  As we have seen in the past few weeks, the first line of defense \nagainst the threat of bioterrorism relies upon swift action by local \nhealth care providers and public health officials. The quick response \nof doctors in Florida to that first case of anthrax on October 4th gave \nthe medical community and the public a warning of what was to come. \nDespite this recognition, and despite a small number of additional \nactual anthrax cases, we are currently struggling with how to respond, \nwho to treat, what to expect next, and what information we can trust. \nWe cannot simply wait to see what happens next, we must face this new \nand terrifying threat immediately.\n  Epidemics, whether natural or the result of deliberate attacks, \nunfold in communities, and may happen without warning. Our hospitals, \nand our physicians and nurses, must be prepared to detect outbreaks, \ndiagnose diseases, treat patients, and activate state and federal \nresponse systems. They must be able to care for the public without \nbecoming ill themselves.\n  These tasks will be made more challenging by the sadly diminished \npublic health care infrastructure. The legacy of this chronic \nunderfunding of state and local health departments has become all too \nobvious in the past few days. Last year, Congress passed legislation \nauthored by my colleagues, Senators Kennedy and Frist, to begin \nsupplying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and our State \nand local health departments with the funding that they so desperately \nneed. I applaud this goal, and trust that we can continue to build on \nthose efforts.\n  I remain concerned, however, about the resources available to local \nhospitals. Under pressures to contain the costs of health care, \nproviders have shifted emphasis from hospital-based care to outpatient \ntreatment over the last decade. This change, accompanied by ever \nshrinking staffing levels, has eroded our ability to care for a large \nnumber of patients at once. Annual epidemics of influenza already \noverwhelm the capacity of local health care systems, and now hospitals \nstruggle to care for the ill while preparing for the unthinkable. \nProviders in small communities, particularly, have been less involved \nin Federal disaster training, and are most likely to lack the resources \nto accommodate a surge of patients during a deliberate or natural \nepidemic. Many caregivers from my own State of West Virginia have \ncontacted me in recent weeks, desperate for resources to aid their \npreparations.\n  Current standards established by accrediting organizations and the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention outline basic steps in \nemergency preparedness that should, or must, for accreditation \npurposes, be undertaken by all hospitals and health care facilities. \nHowever, almost all Federal funding for medical disasters has been \nreleased in response to emergencies, rather than to prepare for them. \nHospitals have seen little financial incentive for purchasing equipment \nor supplies that might never be used, especially in the climate of \nmanaged care.\n  The legislation that I introduce today would provide funding to aid \nthese hospitals in preparing for emergencies, and to equip and train \nmedical\n\n[[Page S11111]]\n\nprofessionals to protect themselves and their patients during a public \nhealth crisis. My bill allows the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to award grants directly to Medicare-eligible hospitals to \nmeet emergency preparedness standards. These funds could be used to \ntrain personnel, increase communications between hospitals and local \nemergency response systems, and purchase necessary supplies or \nequipment. This bill would also protect hospitals that meet the \npublic's need in a designated disaster area by covering the costs of \nreplacing safety equipment and caring for the uninsured, so hospitals \nare not bankrupted by supporting public health.\n  In addition to preparing our medical professionals for the \npossibility of an epidemic, we must prepare ourselves. The past week \nhas revealed a glaring flaw in our public health response: the failure \nto provide essential facts about the symptoms and best responses to \nsuspected bioterrorist attacks. Even here, in the United States Senate, \nstaff who might have been exposed to a biological threat have wrestled \nwith a lack of information and with misinformation. Poor information \nabout basic personal safety, and about symptoms and risk, has made a \nbad situation worse, and the panic has spread from the Capitol \nthroughout the Nation.\n  During a public health crisis, such as a deliberate act of \nbioterrorism or a natural epidemic, qualified professionals should be \nable to deliver accurate and timely information to the public. We \ncannot ask individuals to make good decisions about protecting \nthemselves and their families without helping them to understand the \nrisks and the realities of potential outbreaks. We must act to ensure \nthat American citizens can turn to a reliable, understandable source of \ninformation on agents such as anthrax.\n  My legislation would provide funding for public health crisis \neducation and information, and would require publication of educational \nmaterials for use by medical professionals and the general public. \nThese materials would be designed to prepare the public for the most \nlikely foreseeable events in order to avert panic, and to promote good \npublic health.\n  These programs will help hospitals and the public prepare not only \nfor the threat of bioterrorism, but for the equally demanding tasks of \ncontrolling now-familiar epidemics of influenza and food-borne \nillnesses. We have been forced to confront our vulnerability to attacks \nthat were until recently unthinkable, and to seek new ways to prepare \nand to protect ourselves, not only for the anthrax attack unfolding \nbefore us, but for the possible threats of the future. We must act now \nto prepare for whatever challenges lie ahead, as well as react to the \nfear at hand. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, so that \nwe may begin the steps necessary to protect the health of our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1575.

A bill to amend section 1710 of title 38, United States \nCode, to extend the eligibility for health care of veterans who served \nin Southwest Asia during the Persian Gulf War; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce \nlegislation that would ensure that Gulf War\n\n[[Page S11112]]\n\nveterans suffering from unexplained illnesses continue to get the care \nthat they need. If we do not act quickly, these veterans will soon lose \ntheir priority eligibility for health care through the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, despite the sad fact that we still do not understand \nthe causes of their symptoms.\n  As many of my colleagues know, servicemembers returning from the Gulf \nWar in 1991 began to report a range of unexplained illnesses that many \nbelieved might have resulted from their service. Investigations by \nCongress, the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, and the \nInstitute of Medicine showed that the men and women who served in \nOperation Desert Storm might have been exposed to many battlefield \nhazards, including smoke from oil-well fires, pesticides, organic \nsolvents, the drug pyridostigmine bromide, numerous vaccinations, and \nsarin nerve gas.\n  Unfortunately, our efforts to determine whether any or all of these \nhazards might be linked to specific symptoms have been limited by poor \ndata, a lack of research into the long-term effects of low-dose \nexposures, and incomplete military recordkeeping. In response to \nconcerns about the health of Gulf War veterans, Congress passed Public \nLaw 102-585, authorizing health examinations, tasking the National \nAcademy of Sciences to evaluate scientific evidence regarding potential \nGulf War exposures, and establishing the Gulf War Veterans Health \nRegistry, and Public Law 102-310, authorizing VA to provide health care \nservices on a priority basis to Gulf War veterans through December 31, \n2001.\n  Now, more than a decade after the war, scientific research has \ndetermined neither the causes of veterans' symptoms, nor the long-term \nhealth consequences of Gulf War-era exposures. In addition, the \nDepartment of Defense recently released new estimates of the number and \nlocations of service personnel exposed to nerve agents. To meet the \nmedical needs of these Gulf War veterans, now and as they continue to \nunfold, we must extend this period for providing health care services \non a priority basis. The legislation that I have introduced would \nextend this period for 10 more years.\n  I ask my colleagues in joining me to extend this critical service for \nthe men and women who served this Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 1577.

A bill to preserve the continued viability of the United \nStates travel industry; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the ``Freedom to Travel'' is a basic \nfreedom. And since September 11 we have given a great deal of focus, \nand rightfully so, to the airline industry. But I rise today to direct \nmy colleague's attention to the rest of the travel industry which has \nalso been deeply affected by the events of September 11.\n  In the part of the country I come from, we're familiar with \ndisasters. We know what it's like when, through no fault of your own, \nthe world falls out from under you as a result of natural disaster. \nThere was nothing natural about the cowardly and deadly acts of \nSeptember 11, but they were certainly unpredictable, unexpected and \nclearly beyond the control of anyone who was affected by them.\n  Just as America has generously responded to natural disasters, we \nmust now respond to this new disaster and help our fellow countrymen \nand women rebuild their lives and livelihood. In the aftermath of the \ntragedy we acted quickly, and responsibly, to stabilize the airlines \nwith a financial package of grants and loan guarantees. And we were \nright to pass the aviation security bill to dramatically increase the \nnumber of sky marshals, strengthen cockpit doors and federalize the \nscreening of passengers and luggage at our airports because we need to \nmake sure people feel it is safe to fly.\n  While I supported both of those measures, we now must address the \ndevastating impact September 11 has had on the U.S. travel and tourism \nindustry. The network of hotels, travel agents, car rental companies, \nrestaurants, and attractions that make up the tourism industry, has \nalso been hard hit, and needs our support. A huge segment of our \neconomy, the travel and tourism industry is the third largest retail \nindustry. It generates more than $582 billion in revenue each year, and \ndirectly and indirectly employed more than 19 million people.\n  North Dakota is a long way from Ground Zero in New York City, from \nthe Pentagon in Virginia, and from that lonely farm field in \nPennsylvania. But the violence that took place at each of those \nlocations continues to be felt half a continent away in my home State, \nin our hearts and yes, in our State's tourism industry.\n  Let me share just two reports from North Dakota.\n  Randy Hatzenbuhler, executive director of the Theodore Roosevelt \nMedora Foundation, writes me to say this: his ``organization has great \nconcerns about our 2002 season. We are preparing our business plans to \nanticipate significant decreases in visitation--10-25 percent.''\n\n  Katherine Satrom, of Satrom Travel and Tour in Bismarck, ND tells the \nstory even more starkley. She writes that ``The week of September 11 \nand the week of September 17, our company's revenue was about 25 \npercent of normal at best. Following weeks have been about 50 percent \nof average revenue for the period.'' ``On September 26,'' she \ncontinues, ``our company cut all employee salaries by 10 percent and \nmanagement salaries 20 percent in an effort to avoid a reduction in \nworkforce.'' ``We have been a viable business for 23 years, providing \njobs and contributing to the economy,'' she concludes. ``We now need \nsome assistance to bridge this disaster-related downturn and regroup \nfor the future.''\n  That's a measure of just how far-reaching, broad and deep the \neconomic disaster now ripping through the tourism industry has grown. \nIt reaches every State. And while what's going on in my State is \nserious and grave, what is happening closer to the scene of the attacks \nis much, much worse. So today, along with Senators Specter, Conrad, \nInouye, and Reid, I introduce the American Tourism Stabilization Act. \nOur bill follows through on a suggestion that came out of a hearing \nthat we held in the Commerce Committee on how the travel industry is \ndealing with the impact of September 11. What we learned was not good. \nAlmost uniformly we heard from rental car companies, hoteliers, travel \nagencies, who are struggling to stay in business as they try to cope \nwith the sudden drop-off in business since September 11. We also heard \nfrom individual hotel workers from across the country that are part of \nthe \\1/3\\d of the hospitality industry that is now struggling to pay \ntheir bills since being laid-off after September 11.\n  Out of that hearing came the suggestion, that as we did with the \nairline industry, we provide loan guarantees to help the U.S. tourism \nindustry function until business returns.\n  So, the American Tourism Stabilization Act would provide $5 billion \nworth of loan guarantees for eligible travel-related businesses. \nBuilding on the airline stabilization bill the American Tourism \nStabilization Act would simply have the already created, Air \nTransportation Stabilization Board, process loan guarantees for \neligible travel-related businesses that have been adversely affected by \nthe government shutdown of the airline industry. Specifically the bill \nis intended to make loans available to travel agencies, rental car \ncompanies, airport concessionaires, and others with contractual \nrelationships with the airlines that have been directly affected by the \ntragedies of September 11.\n  The purpose of the bill is to provide liquidity to businesses that \nhave been hurt because of their direct ties to an air carrier such as \ntravel agencies, and airline vendors or an airport concessionaires. It \nwould do so by making loan guarantees available, based on the ability \nto repay, to help tide these businesses over until air traffic and \npleasure travel returns to normal. I urge my colleagues to support our \neffort to help the 19 million people who work in the travel industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI:\n  S. 1579. A bill to expand the applicability of daylight saving time; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Halloween \nSafety Act of 2001. The purpose of this act is to extend the end date \nof Daylight Saving Time from the last Sunday in October to the first \nSunday in November to include the night of Halloween.\n  The idea of extending Daylight Saving Time was introduced to me by \nSharon Rasmussen, a second grade teacher from Sheridan, WY, and her \nstudents. Ten years ago Mrs. Rasmussen's class began writing to \nWyoming's representatives expressing their wish to have an extra hour \nof daylight on Halloween to increase the safety of small children. Each \nyear I receive a packet of letters from Mrs. Rasmussen's class \nencouraging support for this reasonable proposal. Halloween is a time \nof great importance and excitement for youngsters throughout the United \nStates and many celebrate by trick-or-treating door to door.\n  Legislation has been introduced in the past to extend Daylight Saving \nTime. Although many of the bills sought to change both the starting \ndate and the ending date, the legislation I introduced today would \nsimply extend it for one week.\n  The need to protect our children is apparent. According to the \nInsurance Institute for Highway Safety, nearly five thousand \npedestrians died in 1999, that is an average of 13 deaths per day. \nFatal pedestrian-motor vehicle collisions occur most often between 6 \nand 9 pm. Unfortunately, these general trends are highly magnified on \nHalloween given the considerable increase in pedestrians, most of whom \nare children. A study by the National Center for Injury Prevention and \nControl concluded that the occurrence of pedestrian deaths for children \nages 5 to 14 is four times higher on Halloween than any other night of \nthe year. School and communities encourage children and parents to use \nsafety measures when children venture out on Halloween and the \nHalloween Safety Act can further help protect our Nation's youth.\n  When students take an interest in improving our Nation's laws, \nespecially when it would serve to protect other children, I believe it \nis our duty to pay close attention. If children are concerned about \ntheir own safety and create a reasonable approach to make their world a \nlittle bit safer, I believe that accommodating their request is not too \nmuch to ask. The fact that second and third grade students in Sheridan, \nWY, have been working on this legislation shows that protecting the \nchildren of our country is a primary concern of these students, and it \nshould be for all of us as lawmakers. If one life can be saved or one \naccident averted by extending Daylight Saving Time, it would be \nworthwhile. I encourage all my colleagues to support this\n\n[[Page S11114]]\n\nact for the important benefits the Halloween Safety Act of 2001 would \nhave for children and their parents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1581. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nbusiness deduction for the purchase and installation of qualifying \nsecurity enhancement property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation that \nreflects the changed societal dynamic that we have witnessed since the \nattacks of September 11. This legislation, the American Security \nEnhancement Act of 2001, will allow every business in America to \nimmediately write off the cost of security enhancements needed to keep \ntheir business operating in a safe and secure manner.\n  All one has to do is take a walk around the Capitol to see how much \nextra the Congress is spending to secure our facilities. Concrete \nbarriers, higher security visibility, closer monitoring of cars, are \njust a few of the many security enhancements that have become an \nordinary part of life on Capitol Hill now. The Postal Service will be \nspending millions to enhance the security of the mail. And the same \nwill hold true for many businesses in this country.\n  It is not just the extras that airlines will have to spend. Every \nbusiness in America knows that it can potentially confront threats of \nunknown proportions. They need to protect their employees and they need \nto protect their customers. In order to achieve greater security, \nAmerican business is going to have to spend billions in the next \nseveral years.\n  My legislation attempts to alleviate some of the financial costs \ncompanies will inevitably incur whether they purchase high tech \nelectronic monitoring equipment or low tech concrete barriers. \nCurrently, such equipment must be depreciated over periods ranging from \n5 to 15 years. Under my bill all security enhancement equipment \npurchased after September 11 can be expensed, written off immediately.\n  While investments in such equipment has become a fundamental cost of \ndoing business; such equipment does absolutely nothing to enhance a \ncompany's profitability. Quite the contrary, it represents a cost that \nwill have to be absorbed in the ultimate product or service the company \nprovides.\n  It seems to this Senator that allowing companies to write off these \ncosts when they purchase them is the fairest thing we can do to \nencourage companies to secure their employees and facilities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1581\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Security \n     Enhancement Investment Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide for review in the Court of International \nTrade of certain determinations of binational panels under the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce important legislation \ndesigned to correct a fundamental flaw within the North American Free \nTrade Agreement, NAFTA, dispute resolution mechanism, known as Chapter \n19. As many of my colleagues are aware, Chapter 19 has revealed itself \nto be unacceptable in its current form. The Integrity of the U.S. \nCourts Act, that I introduce today with my colleague Mr. Baucus, is \nnecessary to make certain bilateral dispute resolution decisions from \nthe NAFTA are made pursuant to U.S. trade laws.\n  At present, antidumping and countervailing duty determinations made\n\n[[Page S11115]]\n\nby NAFTA members are appealed to ad hoc panels of private individuals, \ninstead of impartial courts created under national constitutions. These \npanels are supposed to apply the same standard of review as a U.S. \ncourt in order to determine whether a decision is supported by \nsubstantial evidence on the agency record, and is otherwise in \naccordance with the law. This standard requires that the agency's \nfactual findings and legal interpretations be given significant \ndeference. Unfortunately, in spite of the panels' mandate, they all too \noften depart from their directive and fail to ensure that the correct \nstandard of review is applied.\n  The Integrity of the U.S. Courts Act would permit any party to a \nNAFTA dispute involving a U.S. agency decision to remove appellate \njurisdiction from the Extraordinary Challenge Committee, ECC, to the \nU.S. Court of International Trade. Doing so would resolve some of the \nconstitutional issues raised by the Chapter 19 system, expedite \nresolution of cases, and ensure conformity with U.S. law.\n  The infirmities of Chapter 19 are real, and have been problematic \nfrom the beginning. The Justice Department, the Senate Finance \nCommittee, and other authorities are on record of having expressed \nserious concern about giving private panelists, sometimes a majority of \nwhom are foreign nationals, the authority to issue decisions about U.S. \ndomestic law that have the binding force of law. These appointed \npanelists, coming from different legal and cultural disciplines and \nserving on an ad hoc basis, do not necessarily have the interest that \nunbiased U.S. courts have in maintaining the efficacy of the laws, as \nCongress wrote them.\n  One of the most egregious examples of the flaws of Chapter 19 is \nreflected in a case from early in this process, reviewing a \ncountervailing duty finding that Canadian lumber imports benefit from \nenormous subsidies. Three Canadian panelists outvoted two leading U.S. \nlegal experts to eliminate the countervailing duty based on patently \nerroneous interpretations of U.S. law--interpretations that Congress \nhad expressly rejected only two months before. Two of the Canadian \npanelists served despite undisclosed conflicts of interest. The matter \nwas then argued before a Chapter 19 appeals committee, and the two \ncommittee members outvoted the one U.S. member to once again insulate \nthe Canadian subsidies from U.S. law.\n  The U.S. committee member was Malcolm Wilkey, the former Chief Judge \nof the federal Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and one of the \nUnited States' most distinguished jurists. In his opinion, Judge Wilkey \nwrote that the lumber panel decision ``may violate more principles of \nappellate review of agency action than any opinion by a reviewing body \nwhich I have ever read.'' Judge Wilkey and former Judge Charles \nRenfrew, also a Chapter 19 appeals committee member, have since \nexpressed serious constitutional reservations about the system. While \nsome have claimed that Chapter 19 decides many cases well, its \ninability to resolve appropriately large disputes, and its \nconstitutional infirmity, demand a remedy.\n  It is clear that the time is long past due to remedy Chapter 19. From \nthe outset, the NAFTA agreement contemplated that given the sensitive \nand unusual subject matter, signatories might have to alter their \nobligations under Chapter 19. The Integrity of the U.S. Courts Act is a \nreasonable solution to a serious problem.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Baucus and Cochran and me in \nour effort to fix this problem that is unfairly harming American \nindustry, and more important, the U.S. Constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/25/senate-section/article/S11115-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11115-S11116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1969.
