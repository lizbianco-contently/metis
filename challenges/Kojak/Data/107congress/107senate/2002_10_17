Mr. President, I wish to brief my colleagues on \nDemocratic gridlock in the Senate, and the only reason I feel \ncomfortable using that word is that in 1993, I remember the headlines \nin the papers referred to ``Republican gridlock'' in the Senate when \ncertain provisions and portions of President Clinton's program were not \nbeing acted upon, at least the way the newspapers believed they should \nbe, in the Senate. It seems to me we have a similar situation now, but \nI do not see the newspapers writing about Democratic gridlock in the \nSenate.\n  I wish to address my colleagues on a few provisions on the Senate \ncalendar that are not being enacted, and these are the ones which I \nfeel some expertise in talking about because they come from the Senate \nFinance Committee and deal with the legislative tax agenda.\n  I am ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, and I am pleased to \nreport that the committee has completed action on a number of \nbipartisan tax relief measures. The items I am going to discuss happen \nto have cleared the committee unanimously, which ought to say something \nabout why they should be acted upon on the floor of the Senate, and I \nraise the question then: Why are they being held up?\n  I will refer to two of many pieces of legislation about which I could \ntalk.\n  The first is a charitable tax reform bill known by the acronym CARE. \nBy the way, this bill was introduced as a bipartisan bill. Senator \nLieberman on the Democratic side and Senator Santorum on the Republican \nside worked closely with the White House because it is very high on the \nPresident's agenda.\n  The second item I am going to refer to is one that is Enron related.\n  Starting about a year ago, until about 3 months ago, Enron was voiced \nby everybody in the Senate as reason for doing certain actions--\ncorporate governance, pension reform, 401(k) reform, et cetera. For \nsome reason, we do not hear anything about it now, particularly from \nthe other side of the aisle, because there is some legislation on the \nagenda that is Enron related that reforms the pension statute that \nwould help protect future Enron employees from losing their retirement \nnest egg.\n  Again, both of these items--the charitable tax reform bill and the \npension reform bill--were passed out of our committee unanimously. That \nis quite a reputation for a bill to have, considering how difficult it \nis to get even a majority view sometimes on the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  I wish to briefly describe the merits of this legislation. The \ncharitable tax reform act is part of the President's compassionate, \nconservative initiative. The CARE Act has been carried forward on a \nbipartisan basis under the very energetic leadership of Democratic \nSenator Lieberman and Republican Senator Santorum. Others, including \nour own leaders of the Democratic and Republican Parties, Senator \nDaschle and Senator Lott, have pledged their efforts to pass this bill. \nThe House passed this bill over a year ago, and did it on a bipartisan \nvote. Several months ago, the Senate Finance Committee reported this \nbill to the full Senate.\n  Most of the focus on the bill has been on provisions that reduce \ntaxes. For instance, those who take the standard deduction--and that is \nabout 70 percent of our taxpayers--will for the first time under this \nlegislation be encouraged to contribute more to charities, and the \nincentive for doing that is the deductibility of these small \ncontributions from their income taxes regardless of the fact that they \ntake the standard deduction.\n  As we know, people who tend to take the standard deduction are in the \nmiddle or lower income tax brackets. So the key provision of this bill \nprovides a broad-based tax benefit to lower income taxpayers.\n  This provision and others are obviously meant to, and will, enhance \nresources for charities to do their good work. This empowers people who \nare taxpayers to help charities, to empower the private sector of our \neconomy to do more in humanitarian ways, and to have the resources to \ndo what these organizations are already inclined to do.\n  Even though this is a tax reduction measure, because obviously there \nis some lost revenue when these deductions are taken, we have offsets \nin this bill so there is not a net reduction in revenue to the Federal \nTreasury. The Finance Committee, on a bipartisan basis as well, decided \nthis should be done so that it was not subject to a point of order \nrequiring 60 votes, or that we would be fiscally irresponsible in \nputting this tax benefit for charities into the individual tax law.\n  I say to my fellow Senators, unlike a lot of spending legislation, \nthe appropriations bills that have come before this body recently, this \nproposal does not add to the deficit. The Finance Committee found two \nimportant tax policy initiatives to offset this bill. All of these are \nrelated to corporate or individuals doing things to avoid taxes that \nmay, in fact, be legal but are not necessarily moral or ethical. So we \nuse these income-raising measures to offset the revenue loss in the \nCharitable Contribution Act.\n  The first offset shuts down what are called corporate expatriations, \nalso known as inversions. Let me explain to my colleagues that what we \nare talking about is corporations that over a long period of time have \npaid their taxes into the Federal Treasury exactly the way they were \nintended to be paid but there has been a recent trend of some \ncorporations setting up a shell corporation in a place such as Bermuda \nfor the sole purpose of avoiding taxes.\n  We do not have any problems with people using our tax laws the way \nthey were intended to meet international competition, but we are very \nchagrined at the act of people setting up a shell corporation for the \nsole purpose of avoiding taxes.\n  On the one hand, we have corporations that have traditionally abided \nby the laws and not tried to finesse those laws to their own benefit. \nThey basically stayed here and they paid. Then on the other hand, there \nis the whole trend of corporate tax filings to avoid paying taxes. They \nbasically have dashed from the country, and they have stashed the cash \nsomewhere else to avoid taxation. That is what is called an inversion.\n  Passing the CARE Act will use the inversions as an offset so the \nmoney that would not be paid by corporations because they dashed and \nstashed the cash will still come to the Federal Treasury and will, in \nfact, offset revenue loss through the Charitable Tax Reform Act.\n  I started talking about these inversions in January. I made my \nintention very clear then, and ever since, to shut down shell \ncorporations being set up in Bermuda for the sole purpose of avoiding \nlegitimate taxation. For me, it is critical that we act on inversions \nbefore we shut down this place this fall. Now is our chance on the CARE \nAct.\n  We have people holding up this bill. They have to understand that \nthey are responsible for holding up action on inversions. There are no \ntwo ways about it. They are not willing to shut down the immoral and \nunethical trend of corporate accounting by setting up shell \ncorporations, going overseas to avoid taxation.\n\n  We have another important offset in this CARE Act. It is also an \nimportant bipartisan Finance Committee initiative. It deals with tax \nshelters. This bipartisan proposal--and it was drafted in concert with \nthe Treasury Department--is a result of over 3 years of work. It is a \nresult of careful consultation with key professional organizations such \nas the American Bar Association, the New York State Bar Association, \nthe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Tax \nExecutive Institute. This proposal was developed methodically and puts \na premium on enhanced disclosures of tax shelter transactions. It also \nimposes tough penalties on those who undertake abusive tax shelter \ntransactions.\n  So as in the case of inversions, those who are right now blocking the \nSenate, under this Democrat gridlock, from considering the CARE Act are \nalso blocking action to shut down tax shelters.\n  I am pleased my colleagues on the Republican side are ready to \nproceed. Unfortunately, it is being blocked from\n\n[[Page S10605]]\n\nthe other side of the aisle. I am hopeful we will see cooperation from \nthe Democratic side and get a chance to debate this bill, but time is \nrunning out. If we do not act on the Charitable Reform Act, called the \nCARE Act, including shelters being shut down and including \nexpatriations from being stopped, it will be clear where responsibility \nlies. It lies with those who are blocking the bill now.\n  A second piece of tax legislation that is caught in this Democratic \ngridlock is the pension reform bill. The pension reform bill is because \nof Enron-like corporate mismanagement, corporate greed, corporate \nfraud, corporate felons doing what they should not be doing, and that \nis mismanaging the money entrusted to them by stockholders and \nbondholders.\n  What happens when there is this sort of corporate mismanagement? \nThousands of Enron employees see their 401(k)s decimated. I know Enron \nis basically a Texas corporation, but there were 150 Enron employees in \nmy State of Iowa who found that to have happened to their 401(k)s. How \ndid it happen under their 401(k)s? Because under corporate laws there \nare corporate rules that do not allow a 401(k) holder to actually \ncontrol their own account; for instance, having to be 55 years of age \nbefore someone can get rid of their stock or control their stock. \nThrough this legislation, we want to protect people from Enron-like \noccurrences in the future. We do that through the legislation we call \nthe pension reform bill, with the acronym NESTEG. That was considered \nby the Finance Committee over the spring and the summer subject to \nhundreds of hours of bipartisan staff discussion.\n\n  That is how we get bills out of the Senate Finance Committee, through \nconsensus. Every Member of the committee and even Members not on the \ncommittee with interests in this issue had input. It took several \nweeks. The discussions bore fruit. The chairman's markup with some \namendments passed out of committee without opposition. This was all as \na result of Members of this body saying Enron problems had to be \nsolved. A lot of the people on the other side of the aisle were trying \nto fault President Bush's administration. They have not succeeded in \ndoing that.\n  That is intellectual dishonesty. If you look at a lot of the \ncorporate mismanagement problems and follow the calendar back to when \nthe first decisions were being made to do some of these things, they go \nwell back into the Clinton administration.\n  Our constituents, my 150 Enron employees, do not care who is to \nblame--Clinton, Bush, or whether nobody is to blame--except the \ncorporate mismanager. The point is, they expect us to do something \nabout it. A lot of this discussion was started on the other side of the \naisle that brought us where we are now. There does not seem to be any \ninterest on the part of the Democrat majority moving the pension reform \nand 401(k) bills that are so necessary to make sure future Enron-\ndecimated 401(k)'s do not occur.\n  I described how this bill was voted out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. There was another committee, the Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Committee, known as the HELP Committee, chaired ably by \nSenator Kennedy, also working on some legislation in this direction. \nChairman Kennedy took a little different route. He decided, for \nwhatever reason, to refuse to engage Republicans on his committee, and \nthe result was a raucous markup and a party-line vote. As I have said \nso many times, contrasting the work of the Senate Finance Committee, \nwhich was very bipartisan, from the work of the HELP Committee, which \nwas more partisan, we cannot get anything done in a Senate that is \ndivided 50 Democrats, 49 Republicans, and 1 independent on a partisan \nplan. If you try to do that, the whole product is doomed. That was and \nis the fate of the HELP Committee bill on pension reform that came out \nof committee on a partisan vote.\n  I digress for a minute. We are all legislators. Our job is to \nlegislate. It is our responsibility, especially in these times, to use \nour legislative resources to actually accomplish something for the \nAmerican people. However, I am the ranking minority Member on the \nSenate Finance Committee. Republicans are in a minority in this bed. \nThe Democratic leadership runs the Senate. Like a point guard in \nbasketball or a quarterback in football, the Democratic leadership has \nthe ball. They call the plays. Unfortunately, serious legislating is \nnot a game. When the Democratic leadership puts legislating the \npeople's business ahead of partisan interests, they will get a product \nout.\n  By the way, to be fair, that applies to Republican leadership, as \nwell.\n  Two examples come to mind. One is the bipartisan tax relief \nlegislation of last year. The Republican leadership cleared the way for \nthe bipartisan Finance Committee package, cleared the floor, became law \nJune 7, 2001.\n  Another example is the Sarbanes-Oxley corporation accountability \nbill. The Democratic leadership let Senators Sarbanes and Enzi craft a \nbipartisan compromise that cleared the Senate floor and became law.\n  On the other hand, if the Democratic leadership wants to score \npolitical points and send a bill into the Senate ditch, that is their \nchoice. Do not work with the other side, do not recognize that 49 of \n100 Members of the Senate; somehow they do not exist. Do not respect \n100 Senators. Do not respect Republican input on issues at hand. Just \ntry to program your caucus poll-driven agenda down the throats of 100 \nMembers.\n  In the words of the distinguished majority leader, politicize it. The \npath is clear on pensions. The Democratic leadership is facing a fork \nin the road. The left fork is to play the partisan card. Pursuing that \npath means bringing up a bill that is designed to be controversial. It \nmeans bringing up a bill like the bill that came out of the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee on a partisan vote. Then there \nis the right fork, bring up the Finance Committee bill, perhaps even \nwith some bipartisan measures from the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee. Frankly, Senators Baucus, Gregg, Kennedy, and \nmyself made good progress. There is a bipartisan basis for proceeding. \nIf the Democratic leadership follows this fork in the road, we can get \na bill through the Senate, the very sort of thing people on the other \nside of the aisle have been clamoring for since last fall and for sure \nsince January.\n  Where are we? The Enron bankruptcy occurred about a year ago. Enron \nemployees' retirement accounts have been devastated. People across the \ncountry rightly demand action. Shortly after the new year, the \nPresident proposed a multipoint plan to reform retirement plans. I \ndon't know how many times I have heard since the President made that \nstatement last spring from the other side of the aisle that the White \nHouse needs to be engaged. The White House engaged the Congress is the \nway I look at it. I did not hear much talk about doing anything about \npension retirement plans until after the President said we ought to be \nworking on it. The House acted very quickly in April on pension reform. \nBut the full Senate has not acted. We cannot send the President a bill \nuntil the Senate acts. Choosing a partisan course means the Senate has \ndefault. That is very regrettable.\n  Let me be clear. Republicans stand ready to work on this priority, \nand as we have already done, as indicated by the bill coming out of our \ncommittee on a unanimous vote, in a bipartisan manner, and even doing \nthat in conjunction with committees that have tried to do the same \nthing in a partisan way.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a \nletter dated August 30 this year from the Finance Committee Republicans \nto Senator Daschle, on pension reform.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 30, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: We understand that you intend to bring \n     pension protection legislation to the floor soon after the \n     Senate reconvenes in September. As you know, both the Finance \n     Committee and the HELP Committee have produced differing \n     versions of pension protection legislation. Although both \n     committees have acted, only one committee has acted in a \n     bipartisan fashion and produced a bipartisan product: the \n     Finance Committee. The Finance Committee's bill, S. 1971, was \n     reported out unanimously. By\n\n[[Page S10606]]\n\n     contrast, the HELP Committee reported a partisan product, S. \n     1992 on a party-line vote of 11-10.\n       We do not believe that a partisan approach is the way to \n     proceed on such important legislation that will affect the \n     retirement savings of tens of millions of Americans.\n       In the spirit of bipartisanship, therefore, we respectfully \n     request that you call up the Finance Committee bill to serve \n     as the underlying bill for the Senate's debate on American's \n     retirement security. This good-faith gesture would expedite \n     the Senate's action. Furthermore it would solve concerns due \n     to the limited scope of S. 1992, which was due to HELP \n     Committee's restricted jurisdiction in the retirement \n     security area.\n       Using the Finance reported bill would facilitate, not \n     preclude, the full Senate's involvement in the retirement \n     security debate. It would send an important signal of \n     bipartisanship to American workers and retirees who will be \n     keenly watching this debate and would reassure them that we \n     are working together in their best interests. And, as you \n     said in your press conference with Senator Kennedy, ``this \n     isn't about political points.'' We agree with you, Senator \n     Daschle. This shouldn't be about political points. It should \n     be about good public policy and good pension policy for all \n     Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n         Chuck Grassley, Don Nickles, Craig Thomas, Orrin Hatch, \n           Jon Kyl, Fred Thompson, Frank H. Murkowski, Phil Gramm, \n           Olympia Snowe.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I implore the Democratic leadership to get in gear. The \nAmerican people deserve action on this charitable tax reform action \ncalled the CARE Act. We should not forbear on curtailing tax shelters \nand corporate expatriations, which all may be legal, but in a time \nduring the war on terrorism for a corporation to flee the country to \nBermuda and not do anything more than set up a shell corporation is \nunethical and immoral--tax shelters, where the people who write the tax \nshelters sell them on the basis of how much money you will save the \ncorporation in taxes, and where the people who write them do not even \nhave to defend them. That seems to me to be professionally unethical as \nwell. In other words, sell your product to a corporation and then let \nthem hold the bag.\n\n  We are losing a lot of revenue that can be used for charitable \npurposes under the CARE Act. Workers rightly expect a debate and action \non a bipartisan retirement security package. Let's do the right thing. \nLet's do the people's business. Let's undo the gridlock on these \nimportant bills. Let's bring up the CARE Act. Let's bring up the NESTEG \nAct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I came to talk about another subject, but I \nthink what my distinguished neighbor and colleague, the ranking member \nof the Finance Committee, said is very important and bears repeating.\n  Yesterday we passed, 92 to 2, an election reform bill. I think that \nbill proves what Senator Grassley just said. That was a bipartisan \nbill.\n  Senator Dodd, the chairman of the committee, worked very closely with \nSenator McConnell, the ranking member, and with me. We worked for about \n18 months. It was not easy. But it was always done in a bipartisan \nfashion and we got the bill done.\n  The distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee has pointed \nout other measures in the Finance Committee where they could work \ntogether. Sometimes they do--and then sometimes they bring legislation \nto the floor, report it out on a bipartisan basis, that the majority \nleader will not bring up.\n  If we had really wanted a prescription drug Medicare reform bill, we \ncould have relied on the work of the bipartisan group on the Finance \nCommittee. If we had wanted an energy bill, we should have relied on \nthe bipartisan Energy Committee, with interest and expertise in the \narea, to report out a bill. It was taken away, for political purposes, \nfrom the Energy Committee by the majority leader. As a result, we got \nnowhere.\n  As I understand it, the Banking Committee reported out a good, \nstrong, bipartisan terrorism risk reinsurance bill to provide terrorism \ninsurance, a backup by the Federal Government so buildings and \nconstruction could get the insurance they needed to obtain financing to \ncarry forward with some $16 billion of construction in this country. \nThat bipartisan bill was not the one that was brought to the floor. \nThat is the reason we have gridlock.\n  When those people tried to bring up measures purely for partisan \nadvantage, they did not get very far. That is why this Senate is known \nby everybody who watches it as the most dysfunctional Senate that \nanybody has seen in recent history. We have not even brought up a \nbudget. I have labored long and hard on the Budget Committee, and we \nfelt the product that came out on a party line, which proposed cutting \ndefense spending and raising taxes in a time where we are at war and \ncoming out of a recession, was not a good thing to do. It has not even \nbeen brought up. We could have come to a bipartisan agreement on a \nBudget Act that would have allowed us to move forward on \nappropriations.\n  We have inflicted ourselves with the wound of not being effective \nbecause, unfortunately, the majority leader has chosen to go with more \npolitical and nonbipartisan measures coming to the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10606-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10606-S10608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NURSING HOMES\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on a series of \narticles running this week in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. The series \nbegan last Sunday with the headline ``Nation's Nursing Homes are \nQuietly Killing Thousands'' and anyone with a conscience should pause \nto consider its opening sentences:\n\n       Thousands of America's elderly mothers, fathers and \n     grandparents are being killed each year in the nation's \n     homes--frail victims of premature and preventable deaths. \n     This quiet pandemic is rarely detected by government \n     inspectors, investigated by law enforcement, appraised by \n     medical examiners or prosecuted by anyone. These deaths are \n     not at the hands of crazed ``angels of death.'' Most are \n     caused by fatal neglect traced to caregivers upon whom \n     residents depend for food and liquid and for turning them in \n     their beds to prevent the formation of life-threatening \n     sores. . . .\n\n  In short, elderly nursing home residents are dying in our country \ntoday due to failures to provide the most basic and fundamental \nelements of care. The Post-Dispatch reports statistics from the \nNational Center on Health Statistics, which show that starvation, \ndehydration or bedsores were the cause of death for 4,138 nursing home \nresidents in 1999, including 138 such deaths in Missouri.\n  However, these appalling statistics may only be the tip of the \niceberg. The Post-Dispatch reported that investigators and researchers, \nwho have taken the time to take a closer look and compare patient \nmedical records with their death certificates, conclude that the number \nof preventable deaths due to malnutrition, dehydration and bedsores is \nmost likely considerably higher. Our colleague, Senator Breaux, \nbelieves that the number of avoidable deaths could number in the tens \nof thousands and research shows that anywhere between 500,000 to 5 \nmillion cases of abuse and neglect of our elders occur each year.\n  Personally, I know that Missouri has a terrible problem with some bad \napple nursing homes. I know this because plenty of good folks back home \nhave told me about their own horrific experiences with abuse and \nneglect of their loved ones. Furthermore, the General Accounting Office \nin recent years has amply documented decades of death and neglect due \nto the poor quality of care in too many of our Nation's nursing homes. \nIn 1999, the GAO estimated that residents of one in four nursing homes \nin Missouri suffered actual harm from the care they received. Hearing \nthese staggering stories and statistical figures was a wake-up call. I \nsubmit to my colleagues that no one here today can say ``not in my \nbackyard''--abuse, neglect and homicide in nursing homes in truly a \nnational problem.\n  In my opinion, neglecting an elderly, fragile individual is no \ndifferent than neglecting a child. Both are defenseless, both lack a \nvibrant voice, both are vulnerable and both suffer at the hands of \nthose who are nothing more than cowards and criminals. Abuse of the \nelderly should be treated no differently than abuse of children.\n  Many of us on the floor today have taken strong stances with regard \nto corporate accountability. However, sending corporate titans up the \nriver for cooking the books while excusing nursing home operators and \nothers with fines and a slap on the wrist just doesn't square with me. \nSurely the lives of innocent folks who are not just suffering, but \ndying due to neglect\n\n[[Page S10607]]\n\nshould be just as precious under the law as anybody's pension fund. We \nneed to send a crystal clear message that these individuals are \ncriminals who should be wearing orange jump-suits instead of pin-\nstripes. A criminal is a criminal and, unfortunately, the ``criminal'' \nactions of some nursing home operators have tarnished the reputations \nof nursing homes generally and unfairly.\n  There is much that we need to accomplish to improve the plight of \nthose elderly men and women who reside in nursing homes. The \nunnecessary human toll directly related to the failures in the nursing \nhome industry is nothing short of shameful. There will be no miracle \nfix to this problem and there is no one obstacle to overcome that will \nimprove the situation. First and foremost, we need to recognize that a \nrevolution is really the only alternative. The powers that be in this \narea, namely the Department of Health and Human Services and the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid, as well as the corporate honchos in \nthe nursing home industry need to recognize and acknowledge the need \nfor revolutionary change. We as legislators need to summon the will and \ncourage to spur that revolution.\n  Last month, I became an original co-sponsor of the Elder Justice Act \nof 2002. This bill is the first comprehensive federal effort to address \nthe issue of elder abuse. It is an attempt to combine law enforcement \nand public health to study, detect, treat, prosecute and prevent elder \nabuse, neglect and exploitation. It is a successful approach that has \nbeen applied to combat child abuse and violence against women. This \nbill creates Federal leadership and resources to assist families, \ncommunities and states in the fight against elder abuse; coordinates \nFederal, State and local elder abuse prevention efforts; establishes \nnew programs to assist victims; provides grants for education and \ntraining of law enforcement; and facilitates criminal background checks \nfor elder care employees.\n  The tragic toll of nursing home deaths in Missouri is so compelling, \nthat I have also sought new ways to approach this seemingly intractable \nproblem. I met with HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson this past summer and \ndiscussed with him new bedside technology that can easily and \naccurately record individual information about nursing home residents \nand the care they receive. We discussed the success of a program in \nMissouri called QIPMO--Quality Improvement Program for Missouri, a \npatient care monitoring system that provides reports on the quality of \ncare delivered by all Missouri nursing homes. This award-winning \nprogram is a cooperative project between the Sinclair School of Nursing \nand the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. I urged \nSecretary Thompson to consider adapting QIPMO's free on-site clinical \nconsultation and technical assistance as an integral piece of a new \nfederal technology demonstration and evaluation program. If enhanced \nwith cutting-edge technology, I believe QIPMO may be a viable platform \nto help HHS lead nursing homes and state regulators to greatly improve \non-site monitoring and clinical care. We urgently need a technogical \nrevolution in nursing home care that can save lives and spare our \nelders of unnecessary suffering. A groundbreaking technology \ndemonstration and evaluation program has the potential to erect an \nearly warning system to alert care-givers to life-threatening problems \nbefore they become widespread or have tragic consequences. I thank \nSecretary Thompson for working with me and for offering his \nenthusiastic support and commitment to ensure that the demonstration \nand evaluation program happens.\n  I think all of us realize that at some point in our lives we may have \nto take a parent, grandparent, or elderly relative, or even a good \nfriend to a nursing home. Some of us may wind up there ourselves. We \nknow from experience that there are a lot of good nursing homes and \nthere are a lot of homes in Missouri where we are very proud of the \ncare the people receive. On the other hand, there are a few tragically \nbad apples that need to be picked out so when you take a family member, \na loved one to a nursing home, you don't have to be worried that person \nwill die of starvation or dehydration or bed sores. What a horrible way \nto go.\n  The article points out the need for additional staffing. Many nursing \nhomes are short staffed. That is a problem that needs to be confronted. \nIn some instances, when they have the Medicaid reimbursements, they are \nnot adequate. If the money is not getting there--if it is going to care \nbut there is not enough of it, that is one thing. There are other \nabuses that have been pointed out in these articles, where too much \nmoney that should go to care of patients is being siphoned off to \nfamily members who run other businesses on the side.\n  This is an area where continued vigilance, first from State \nenforcement agencies, and then the Department of Health and Human \nServices, is warranted. When one reads the stories and the record of \nthe tragedy that has occurred, and it has been documented in this \nseries, I believe all my colleagues are going to want to do something \nto assure that we separate the good nursing homes from the bad; and \nproperly punish and chastise and charge those who are bad apples.\n  I ask unanimous consent additional material to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Oct. 17, 2002]\n\nSpecial Report: Neglected to Death--Preventable Deaths in Nursing Homes\n\n       Nursing home patients are dying from causes like \n     malnutrition, dehydration and bedsores--causes that could be \n     prevented with proper care.

Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \ntheir unanimous support for S. 2182, the Cyber Security Research and \nDevelopment Act. I share the concerns and worries of Senator Bond and \nSenator Grassley on many pieces of legislation and important matters \nthat have not been passed due to various obstructions and problems. \nHowever, I am here to say we actually have done something very \nconstructive which will soon be helping our country, and that is the \npassage of the Cyber Security Research and Development Act.\n  An extraordinary amount of hard work that went into this legislation. \nI thank my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, for his leadership and \ncontinued work in pushing this important measure through the \nlegislative process.\n  Our bill, S. 2182, addresses the important issue of cyber and \ncomputer security. It is a truly historic piece of legislation because, \nfor the first time, it assures and solidifies the Federal Government's \ncommitment to basic, fundamental, long-term research in computer \nsecurity as well as much needed graduate and postgraduate doctoral \nfellowships in computer security.\n  America must act now to protect our security on many fronts. As our \nreliance on technology and the Internet has grown over the past decade, \nour vulnerability to attacks on the Nation's critical infrastructure \nand network systems has also grown exponentially. The high degree of \ninterdependence between information systems exposes America's network \ninfrastructure to both benign and destructive disruptions.\n\n  Such cyber-attacks can take several forms, including the defacement \nof Web sites, denial of service, virus infection throughout the \ncomputer network, and the unauthorized intrusions and sabotage of \nsystems and networks resulting in critical infrastructure outages and \ncorruption of vital data. These are just some examples of the problems \nthat could arise and have previously arisen.\n  In fact, we have seen past attacks, such as the Code Red virus, that \nshow the types of dangers and potential disruption cyber-attacks can \nhave on our Nation's infrastructure. The cyber-threats before this \ncountry are significant and are, unfortunately, only getting more \ncomplicated and sophisticated as time goes on.\n  A survey last year by the Computer Security Institute and the FBI \nfound that 85 percent of 538 respondents experienced computer \nintrusions. Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Emergency Response \nTeam (CERT) Coordination Center, which serves as a reporting center for \nInternet security problems, received 2,437 vulnerability reports in \ncalendar year 2001, almost six times the number that were reported in \n1999, just 2 years previously. Similarly, the number of specific \nincidents reported to CERT exploded from 9,589 in 1999 to 52,658 in \n2001. Again, in 1999, about 9,500, to 52,000-plus incidents reported \njust 2 years later.\n  What is alarming is that CERT estimates that these statistics may \nrepresent only 20 percent of the incidents that have actually occurred.\n  A recent public opinion survey indicates that over 70 percent of \nAmericans are concerned about computer security and 74 percent are \nconcerned about terrorists using the Internet to launch a cyber-attack \nagainst our country's infrastructure. One survey shows that half--\nhalf--of all information technology professionals believe a major \nattack will be launched against the Federal Government in the next 12 \nmonths. Indeed, cyber-security is essential to both homeland security \nand national security. The Internet's security and reliability support \ncommerce and information transfer of vital data in our economy, they \nsupport our critical infrastructures and, obviously, systems that \nprotect our national defense. At a time when uncertainty threatens the \nconfidence of our Nation's preparedness, the Federal Government needs \nto make the information and cyber-security issue a top priority.\n  Currently, federally funded research on cyber-security is less than \n$60 million a year. Experts believe that fewer than 100 U.S. \nresearchers have the experience and expertise to conduct cutting-edge \nresearch in cyber-security. In this past academic year, there were \nfewer than 30 U.S. citizens enrolled in Ph.D. cyber-security programs. \nOur legislation will encourage the kind of research and programs that \nwill motivate students to pursue Ph.D. degrees in cyber-security \nbecause students will have the opportunity to receive research grants \nwith the National Science Foundation.\n  The Cyber Security Research and Development Act will play a major \nrole in fostering greater research in methods to prevent future cyber-\nattacks and design more secure networks. Our legislation will harness \nand link the intellectual power of the National Science Foundation, the \nNational Institute of Science and Technology, our Nation's \nuniversities, and the most creative minds in the private sector to \ndevelop new and improved computer cryptography and authentication, \nfirewalls, computer forensics, intrusion detection, wireless security, \nand systems management.\n  In addition, our bill is designed to draw more college undergraduate \nand graduate students into the field of cyber-security research.\n  It establishes programs to use internships, research opportunities, \nand better equipment to engage students in this field. America is a \nleader in the computer hardware and software development fields. To \npreserve America's technological edge, we must continue to have new \nstudents involved in computer science study and research.\n  S. 2182 highlights the role the Federal Government will play in \nhelping prepare and prevent against cyber-attacks, but only if we can \nensure the cutting edge research and technology funded in this \nlegislation is made commercially available. Clearly, there is an urgent \nneed for the private sector, academic, and individual users, as well as \nthe Federal and State governments, to deploy innovative security \nmeasures.\n  I am confident the Federal investment for long-term projects outlined \nin this legislation will yield significant results to enhance the \nsecurity and reliability of cyberspace.\n  I am glad to see the Senate, in a rare moment in these last few weeks \nand months, has come together and passed this important legislation. \nAgain, I thank my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, for his \nleadership. I have enjoyed working with him on successful passage of \nthis positive and constructive legislation that will improve the \nsecurity of Americans.\n  I am also grateful to the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who thoughtfully suggested we add an \nassurance that the grants provided in this legislation will go to \nindividuals who are in full compliance with all immigration laws.\n  I thank all my colleagues. It was a good team effort. In the future, \nour Internet and our cyber-security will be stronger for it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the following letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10609]]\n\n                                    Business Software Alliance\n\n                                                 October 17, 2002.\n     Sen.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern over the \ncurrent state of the economy. Too many working Americans are confronted \nwith difficult financial situations due to the slowdown in the economy. \nI continue to believe in economic education and financial literacy as a \nmajor part of the solution for people to improve their unique \nsituations. However, such efforts cannot truly succeed without sound \nfiscal policies to keep our economy strong. Many American families are \nhaving difficulties making ends meet. Over two million jobs have been \nlost since January 2001. The unemployment rate for September was 5.6 \npercent, an increase from the 3.9 percent unemployment rate in \nSeptember and October of 2000. Home foreclosures are occurring at the \nfastest rate in thirty years and others are falling behind on their \npayments. Health care costs have increased rapidly. As a result, many \nare paying substantially more for their insurance coverage. Rising \nprescription drug costs have made it costly to obtain necessary \nmedication, particularly for seniors.\n  I agree with the Majority Leader in his prescription for the sick \neconomy. Unemployment insurance must be extended to help those who are \nstill struggling to find work in these tough economic times. An \nestimated 1.5 million people exhausted their Federal extended \nunemployment benefits by the end of September. The total for the end of \nthe year is expected to rise to 2.2 million individuals.\n  The minimum wage needs to be increased. Since establishing the \nminimum wage requirement in 1938, we have had only 19 increases in the \nminimum wage. The latest occurred in September 1997. The earnings of \naverage Americans have grown little, and the overall distribution of \nincome has become increasingly unequal. The real value of the minimum \nwage has fallen by 11 percent since the last increase. Currently, a \nminimum wage employee working full time earns about $4,000 below the \npoverty line for a family of three. We need to increase the minimum \nwage to help those millions of Americans earning the minimum wage who \nare rapidly becoming a permanent underclass in our society.\n  The savings of Americans have been ravaged in the last few years. The \nreduction in the value of retirement accounts is particularly troubling \nbecause Americans will have a harder time achieving the goal of a \ncomfortable retirement. Over $210 billion in 401(k) and other defined \ncontribution plans was lost in 2001. Individual Retirement Accounts \nlost over $230 billion in 2001.\n  Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, and other criminally managed companies have \nshaken the markets after the accounting scandals and disclosure of \ncorporate misdeeds. We need the Securities and Exchange Commission to \nbe aggressive in its pursuit of fraud and corporate malfeasance.\n  Without trust, our markets and economy cannot effectively function. \nThe Sarbanes corporate accountability legislation that passed this \nsummer will help provide additional safeguards for investors. With the \nrecent addition of the new Securities and Exchange Commissioners, I \nlook forward to the development of the Public Company Accounting \nOversight Board. It is my hope that the organization will become a \nfriend and advocate for the investor--not the accounting industry. The \ncorporate accountability bill must be strongly enforced. In addition, \npension protection legislation needs to be enacted to empower workers \nto make it easier for them to sell company stock and to make their \ninvestments more secure.\n  It is troubling that revenues have declined when there are so many \ndomestic and defense needs. The 10-year, $1.35 trillion tax cut, which \nwas enacted in June 2001, has contributed to a rapid surge in the size \nof the Federal budget deficit. The FY 2002 budget deficit is now \nestimated to be $157 billion, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice's monthly budget review. Gone are the years of budget surpluses. \nAlthough some of this can be attributed to necessary spending for \nnational security in the wake of September 11, 2001, we cannot ignore \nthe overall impact of last year's tax cut package. We must reexamine \nthe tax cuts that have yet to take effect. The tax cuts were enacted at \na time when the economy appeared stronger, there was a Federal budget \nsurplus, and the tragic events of September 11 had not yet occurred. \nNow, fiscal responsibility requires all options to be on the table, \nsuch as postponing or canceling specific upper income tax cuts. I know \nthat some of my colleagues share my concerns, and I look forward to \nworking with them on this issue.\n  The American people will pay a large price for the tax cuts that \ngenerally are for the wealthiest Americans. When fully implemented, the \ntax cuts will give more tax breaks to the top one percent of taxpayers \nthan to the combined total of the bottom 80 percent. It will be \nextremely difficult to pay down the public debt, which at the end of FY \n2002 was estimated to be $3.6 trillion. It also will be difficult to \nprovide a meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors, \nand to adequately fund education and other vital programs and services.\n  Unfortunately, there are those who want to further compound our \nfiscal crisis by making the tax cuts permanent. Responsible fiscal \npolicy is needed, or possible adverse effects, such as increasing \ninterest rates, may further weaken the economy. Prior to the enactment \nof the tax cuts, the public debt was expected to be eliminated by 2009. \nThis is no longer true. Future generations of taxpayers will be stuck \npaying the bill for these current tax cuts, and the picture would look \neven worse if the cuts are made permanent.\n  As a former classroom teacher and principal, I would like to say \nanother word about education, which is one of the most important \nresponsibilities we have regarding our children and our nation's \nfuture. The No Child Left Behind Act became law in January of this \nyear. This sweeping reform of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct places before our schools dramatic mandates that they improve \nstudent performance or face tough consequences. The FY 2003 budget \nrequest, rather than including the funding needed to properly implement \nchanges in the Act, requested the smallest increase in education \nspending in seven years. Furthermore, the budget request\n\n[[Page S10610]]\n\nincluded education cuts of $1.76 billion, which would eliminate 40 \nprograms and cut an additional 16. I am thankful to my colleagues on \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee for restoring much of this funding. \nGoing forward, we must continue to use fiscal restraint, but we must \nbalance this with the need to invest in critical priorities.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on initiatives to \nencourage job growth, provide assistance for workers who have lost \ntheir jobs, and help alleviate the economic strain that has impacted \nmost Americans. I urge all of my colleagues to add their energies to \nthese efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I mentioned yesterday that the two most \npowerful words in the Senate are ``I object.'' They have been used \nrepeatedly in recent months, and especially in recent days, as we have \ntried toward the end of this Senate session to pass legislation that \nreally does need doing. We are discovering that we have a number of \npeople in the Senate who just don't want to move forward on some of \nthese issues.\n  I think the American people wonder, from time to time, whether this \nGovernment is very relevant in their lives. I think prior to September \n11, 2001, people wondered. Then, when the terrorist attacks occurred, I \nthink people understood that on homeland security and a range of other \nissues, they do rely on the Government to do certain things to protect \nthem.\n  We have come to a point now where there is so much unfinished \nbusiness, so much left undone, as we near the end of this session of \nthe Congress. I think the American people have a right to ask some \npretty tough questions about who is doing what and who is objecting to \nwhat. Most families sit around the supper table--or the dinner table in \nsome parts of the country--and talk about their lives. What they talk \nabout are not statistics or abstractions; they talk about the things \nthat are important in the lives of their families. They wonder, do we \nhave good jobs? Do our jobs have good security? Are we paid a fair \nwage? Do grandpa and grandma have access to good health care? Do our \nkids go to good schools? Do we live in a safe neighborhood?\n  These are the issues that people care about in our country, and \nfamilies want something done about them. One of these critical issues \nis health care. We tried to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights in this \nCongress and could not get it done. The Patients' Bill of Rights is \npretty simple, actually. It is, with the growth of the managed care \nindustry, trying to give a voice to consumers so they have a say in \ntheir own health care.\n  For example, a woman falls off a cliff in the Shenandoah Mountains \nand is taken into a hospital on a gurney, in a coma. She is very \nseriously injured, with broken bones and internal injuries. She \nultimately recovers after a long convalescence. She is told by her \nmanaged care organization that they will not cover her emergency room \ntreatment because she did not have prior approval to access the \nemergency room. Now, this woman was carried into the hospital on a \ngurney while in a coma, yet the managed care organization said she \nshould have gotten prior approval for emergency room treatment.\n  So we tried to pass a piece of legislation that gives patients a \nvoice in their own care, legislation that says patients have a right to \nknow all of their medical options for treatment, not just the cheapest; \npatients have a right to emergency care when they have an emergency; \npatients have a right to see the doctor they need for the medical help \nthey require. Pretty straightforward. We could not get it through. We \ncould not get it through a conference committee and to the President \nfor signature. Why? Because too many people in the Congress said: Let \nus stand with the insurance companies and the managed care \norganizations on this subject.\n  We also face urgent issues dealing with Medicare and Medicaid. \nYesterday, we were on the floor of the Senate talking about that. \nEverybody in this Chamber knows we have to do something to provide fair \nMedicare reimbursement for physicians, hospitals, nursing homes, and \nother providers.\n  We now come to the end of this legislative session, and we know the \nMedicaid reimbursement for our nursing homes on October 1 was cut. That \ncut is going to be accentuated with an even deeper cut in 2004, beyond \nthe fiscal year 2003. We know we have to do something to deal with that \nsituation. We know it has to be done, and yet some act as if there is \nno urgency at all, this will be just fine.\n  It is not just fine to have a cut in the quality of care of nursing \nhomes in this country. That is exactly what is going to happen. And it \nis not just fine if the Medicare reimbursement is not adequate to keep \nrural hospitals open and keep some of the hospitals in inner cities--\nthat are stretched so thin and whose reimbursement was cut so deeply \nduring the Balanced Budget Act--open. It is not just fine to say: Let \nthat go.\n  We are talking about the quality of health care delivered in \nhospitals through Medicare, delivered in nursing homes through \nMedicaid. It is not fine with me when we try to fix this at the end of \nthe session, not having received the cooperation to get it done during \nthe session, and people stand up and say: I object.\n  What is their plan? What do they propose? Just diminished health \ncare, diminished quality of care in our hospitals and nursing homes? Is \nthat something the American people believe they want? Is that something \nfamilies say: We aspire to nursing homes that provide diminished care \nbecause we would not meet our obligation under Medicaid? We aspire to \nhave hospitals close their doors because we will not own up to our \nrequirements under Medicare? I do not think that is what the American \npeople want or expect of this Congress.\n  Senators Baucus and Grassley have introduced legislation, S. 3018. It \nis bipartisan. It addresses these issues--Medicaid, Medicare, \nhospitals, nursing homes, physician reimbursements.\n  The provider reimbursement we know we have to do, and what happens? \nThe two most powerful words in the Chamber once again: ``I object,'' \nthey say. ``I object.''\n  It is the easiest act in the world to do, but we are faced with very \nsignificant challenges in health care, Medicaid, and Medicare, and \neveryone in this Chamber knows we have to fix it.\n  Here we are on a Thursday at a time when the Congress should have \nbeen adjourned, trying to finish some of these last items, and we have \npeople on\n\n[[Page S10611]]\n\nthe floor of the Senate singing the third verse of the same old tired \ntune: I object; I object.\n  I have told my colleagues often about Mark Twain who, when asked if \nhe would engage in a debate, very quickly said yes.\n  ``But we have not told you the subject.''\n  He said: ``It doesn't matter, as long as I can take the negative \nside. The negative side will require no preparation.''\n  He is right. The question is: What are we building here? What are we \ndoing here? What do we aspire for the American people to create here? A \nbetter country, a stronger country.\n  We have spent a great deal of time talking about national security in \nthis Chamber. That is deadly serious business. I would never suggest \nthat ought to be a subject on which we should not spend a great deal of \ntime. It is deadly serious business to talk about our Nation's national \nsecurity.\n  It is also important, in my judgment, to spend some time talking \nabout this country's economic security because our capability to defend \nourselves, our capability to spend the money to deal with national \nsecurity challenges and issues relates directly to this country's \neconomy, our ability to create an economic engine that produces growth \nand opportunity, that provides improvement for the lives of the \nAmerican people, produces the tax revenues that allow us to have a \nstanding army and have a military capability of dealing with national \nsecurity issues.\n\n  Yet we are in a situation these days where it is as if nobody wants \nto talk much about economic security. We cannot find the \nadministration's team. We had an economic forum last Friday. We invited \nthe Administration to participate. We said: Won't you come and sit with \nus and talk about the economy? Let's talk about what kind of challenges \nexist.\n  There is no Republican or Democratic way to go broke. There is no \nRepublican or Democratic way to lose a job. It is not partisan when one \ncomes home and says: Honey, I have worked for this company for 18 \nyears, but they told me today my job is over; it wasn't my fault; the \ncompany is cutting back because the economy is not good. There is no \nRepublican or Democratic way to filter that through to your family for \na man or a woman who has been in the workforce.\n  There is no Republican or Democratic way for us to fix this either. \nWe have to fix it by trying to get the best ideas of what both parties \nhave to offer and by sitting down and talking about the issues. We have \na fiscal policy which we put in place 18 months ago, before the \nrecession, before the war on terror, before September 11, before the \ncorporate scandals. That fiscal policy is not working.\n  Huge projected budget surpluses have turned to very large projected \nbudget deficits. More people are out of work. Confidence is down. \nPeople are worried about the future. Yet the economic team at the White \nHouse does not want to show up and talk about the economy. They will \nnot come to an economic forum to talk about what is working and what is \nnot, what is wrong and what is not, about how we fix this economy. They \nwant to have nothing to do with that.\n  I do not think we ought to be ignoring economic security issues. That \nis at the heart of what we ought to be talking about these days.\n  We are trying very hard to say to our colleagues in the Senate on the \nRepublican side: Join us; join us; forget the ``I object'' language; \nlet's join together.\n  How about saying: Include me. We would say: Absolutely. Yes, let's \ninclude everybody here. Let's get the best of what both have to offer \nthis country.\n  It appears to me the refrain now for the rest of the session is: I \nobject. I object.\n  I come from farm country, and our farmers have suffered a disastrous \ndrought, not just in the southern part of my State but in a very wide \nregion of this country.\n  One of my colleagues made a point that I think is interesting: We \nought to give droughts a name. We do not ever call them anything. At \nleast with hurricanes we name them. Then pretty soon, Hurricane Andrew \nstarts moving around and people talk about Hurricane Andrew. We need to \nstart naming droughts as well. It is a natural disaster. It is \nsomething farmers cannot help. They did not create it. They cannot \ncontrol it. Yet they plant the seeds in the spring and come out to \nharvest it, and it is a moonscape. There is nothing there. Nothing \ngrew, and they lost everything they had because they put it all in the \nground in the spring hoping they would harvest a crop in the fall, and \nthere is no crop. That is a disaster.\n  We passed a disaster bill with 79 votes in the Senate--79 votes, \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  It is October 17 and no disaster bill. Why? The White House does not \nwant one. The House of Representatives will not do one.\n\n  According to today's news clips, a House Republican source said that \nRepublican members seeking more money for drought relief, or for any \nnumber of projects, were simply told no and encouraged to be good \nRepublicans and to wait until next year. They are taking the circus \ntent down.\n  I do not know, if after 79 Senators have voted for drought relief, \nrecognizing there is a very big problem, if somehow there is a curtain \nthat prevents information from coming into the other body to tell the \nSpeaker of the House we have a big problem in this country, if he \nsomehow missed the evening news week after week, somehow missed the \nstory that there was a protracted, devastating drought in this \ncountry--I do not know how we would tell him on October 17 if there is \na problem.\n  You had better believe there is a problem. Why no disaster relief \nafter the Senate passed it on a bipartisan basis, 79 votes in favor of \nit? Why? Why no disaster relief? Because ``I object,'' they say; ``I \nobject.'' They object at the White House; they object in the U.S. \nHouse; they object.\n  There are so many issues that it is almost hard to know where to \nstart. I want to describe one other issue, if I may. There is a young \nman named Jonathan Adelstein. Jonathan Adelstein is a nominee to the \nFederal Communications Commission. The FCC has a number of Republican \nseats and a number of Democratic seats. That is the way the seats are \napportioned. This is a Democratic seat. It was vacated a year ago last \nmonth. For 13 months, this seat at the Federal Communications \nCommission has been open.\n  Senator Daschle went to the White House, described the nominee. The \nWhite House announced its intent to nominate him on February 8. They \nsent it to the Senate in July. On July 16, the Commerce Committee held \na hearing, reported out of the Commerce Committee in July. Now the FCC \nis poised to make very serious and difficult decisions on a wide range \nof issues that will have a profound impact on this country's \ntelecommunications policies, especially on rural States.\n  This seat is vacant. Know why? Because we have people that are \nsinging the same song: I object. I object to bringing his nomination to \nthe floor of the Senate, they say. There is a hold on this nomination, \nand that seat on the Federal Communications Commission that is so \ncritical to the interests of rural States in this country is now \nvacant.\n  If this Senate does not confirm this nomination before we adjourn \nsine die, then there is something fundamentally wrong with the way this \nbody works. This is not a normal case of, for example, a judgeship that \nmay or may not be controversial.\n  The Federal Communications Commission has Republican seats and \nDemocratic seats. The nominees on each side, if they are qualified--and \nMr. Adelstein is eminently qualified--ought to be confirmed by the \nSenate. It is nonsense to hold up this nominee.\n  The chairman of the FCC, Mr. Powell, and others are poised to make \nvery big decisions. I worry very much there is no one inside that \ncircle who has rural America, smaller States, rural States, family \nfarms, and small towns as their interest. These decisions will have a \nprofound impact on the future of my State and others, and yet this \nnomination is awaiting action by the Senate, held up by some unnamed \nSenator who says, in effect, in a cloakroom, behind the cloak of \nsecrecy, ``I object.''\n  So much for the Federal Communications Commission nomination. This is \nanother issue that Congress is being blocked from taking care of.\n\n[[Page S10612]]\n\n  A couple of days ago, my colleague from Nevada brought our attention \nto legislation the Senate has already passed and which is now in \nconference. He brought to the attention of the Senators the importance \nof something called concurrent receipt.\n  Concurrent receipt sounds like a two-dollar word and probably does \nnot affect anybody in this Chamber. It may not affect anybody listening \nto me at the moment. I do not know. But it is important because there \nis an obscure Federal law that says the following: If you served this \ncountry in the Armed Forces and retired, and you spent 20 years, for \nexample, in uniform serving this country of ours and you earned a \nretirement, and along the way you may have fought in a battle somewhere \nand been severely wounded and are entitled to disability payments, this \nobscure Federal law says, oh, by the way, you cannot have both the \nretirement you earned and the disability payments you deserve as a \nresult of your disability. You cannot have concurrent receipt of those \ntwo payments. One will offset the other and you will lose your \nretirement or you will lose your disability payment.\n  I put a statement in the Record the other day about some North Dakota \nNational Guardsmen. These are the kind of people who are being affected \nby this foolish provision in Federal law that we need to change, and \nwhich the Senate is on record of wanting to change.\n  Sixty years ago, on October 10, 1942, two thousand men from North \nDakota embarked for war. They were from the 164th Infantry Regiment of \nthe National Guard. They were people from small towns and family farms. \nThey came from almost every city, village, and county in our State. \nThey were ordered to the West Coast the day after Pearl Harbor, and \narrived in the South Pacific in the spring of 1942.\n\n  On the island of Guadalcanal, these North Dakota National Guardsmen \nwere called to action. The United States Marines had begun the first \noffensive action against Japan on Guadalcanal, and by autumn of that \nyear it was a precarious deadlock. At that point, these National \nGuardsmen arrived October 13. By noon, they had their first casualty \nfrom a bombing run by Japanese planes. As Japanese ground patrols \ntested the U.S. positions, the 164th Infantry advanced. They were the \nfirst unit of the U.S. Army to go on the offensive against the Japanese \nin World War II.\n  On October 24 and 25, there was an intense Japanese attack, the \nlargest battle fought on Guadalcanal. The ``Citizen Soldiers,'' as they \nwere called, were called forward to reinforce the Marines. Despite the \nblackness of night, these National Guardsmen traveled with their heavy \npacks, in the rain, over narrow trails slippery with mud, following \ntheir Marine escorts to the front line, holding on to the backpacks of \nthe man in front of them to avoid being lost.\n  Fighting side by side with the Marines, the 164th Infantry poured \nrelentless fire through the night into continuous waves of oncoming \nJapanese. At dusk of the next day, the Japanese attacked again. The \nsituation was so precarious, they said, that cooks, messengers, and \nclerks manned positions and waited for the worst. Even the musicians \nfrom the band were pressed into service as litter bearers. Every member \nof the 164th had a role in the fiercest battle of that campaign.\n  At the end of that night, by dawn, it was clear the enemy had \nsuffered a disastrous defeat. In front of the 164th Infantry were 1,700 \ndead Japanese. The North Dakota unit, meanwhile, suffered 26 killed and \n52 wounded. The commanding officer of the Marines sent them a special \nmessage for coming to the aid of the United States Marines. LTC Robert \nHall received the Navy Cross for his leadership of the battalion in \nthis action.\n  The men of that regiment won a Navy Cross, 5 Distinguished Service \nCrosses, 40 Silver Stars, more than 300 Purple Hearts, and many \nSoldier's Medals and Legions of Merit. Its boast was it would leave no \none behind, and indeed it had no men missing in action, although they \nhad lost many.\n  These survivors are now old men in North Dakota, living again in our \nvillages, small towns, and family farms. Some of them are being told \nthat, if they were wounded in this battle of Guadalcanal and they \ncontinued their service in the United States military and have a \nretirement and a disability coming, they cannot receive both. They \nmight have earned their retirement and they might have taken a \ndevastating wound in their body that took years of convalescence, but \nthey cannot receive disability and retirement. That is terribly unfair, \nin my judgment.\n  The Senate is already on record trying to correct this, and we are \nnow hearing once again that the refrain of ``I object'' exists in the \nconference on the Defense Authorization Bill that can fix the problem.\n  I hope that the conference will overcome those objections and do the \nright thing.\n  Finally, the issue of corporate responsibility. I began talking about \nthe economy and economic security. Let me talk for a moment about \ncorporate responsibility. We have a great deal of unfinished business \nwith this issue. We passed a corporate responsibility bill in the \nSenate, and it is a good bill. It falls a little short of what is \nneeded, but it is a good bill and a step in the right direction.\n  It was fascinating to me to see what happened. We pushed the bill \nunder the leadership of Senator Sarbanes. The Republicans pushed back \nand said: We do not want a bill. We do not want your bill. We do not \nwant to do it your way.\n  Finally, the President agreed, the Republicans agreed, and we passed \nthe legislation. For 3 days before we passed that bill in the Senate, I \nwas trying to offer an amendment and it was blocked by the Republicans. \nMy amendment was very simple. It said if someone is running an American \ncorporation and they are running that company into bankruptcy and are \ngetting bonus payments and incentive pay as they run that company into \nthe ground, we ought to be able to recapture that and require \ndisgorgement of that money.\n  A study was done and it shows of the 25 largest corporations that \nwent into bankruptcy in the last several years, 208 executives took \n$3.3 billion out of those corporations as they went into bankruptcy. \nLet me say that again. Of the 25 largest bankruptcies, 208 executives \ntook $3.3 billion in compensation as those companies were run into the \nground.\n  I don't need five reasons. There is not even one good reason we ought \nto allow one to keep bonus and incentive pay as they take a public \ncorporation into the ground. There is no incentive for bonus that is \njustifiable for someone presiding over bankruptcy. We should have \npassed that amendment. We will someday. I will continue to offer it as \npart of our unfinished business.\n  Another area of unfinished business is that we have a Securities and \nExchange Commission without a leader who will lead. Mr. Pitt is the \nwrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time. Senator McCain was the \nfirst to call for his resignation this summer. Larry Cudlow, Republican \ntelevision personality on the Cudlow Kramer show, has called for his \nresignation, others have followed. The fact is, at this point we don't \nneed a kinder and gentler SEC. We don't need a Securities and Exchange \nCommission that will bend in the wind of the political system to \ndetermine who should head an accounting reform board the American \npeople could look up to and trust. What we need is a Securities and \nExchange Commission chairman who does not care about the politics, who \nonly cares about being a fair, tough, aggressive regulator. We need a \nchairman who will make sure we do not have additional Enrons and Tycos, \nwho ensures that we do not have additional circumstances where the \npeople at the bottom lose their shirts, the employees lose their jobs, \nand the people at the top walk off with pockets of gold to live in \ngated communities and count their money while everyone else is left in \nthe wreckage.\n  We need a head of the SEC who can inspire confidence in the American \npeople that effective regulation will prevent accounting firms, law \nfirms, or corporations from cooking the books and enriching the people \nat the top at the same time they are costing the people at the bottom \ntheir jobs and costing investors their life savings.\n  I chaired hearings on the Enron issue in the Senate. One of my \nconstituents in North Dakota is far removed from Houston, TX, but he \nworked for Enron, for a pipeline company. He wrote a letter and said: \nMr. Senator, I had my life\n\n[[Page S10613]]\n\nsavings in my 401(k) plan invested in Enron. I am the first to admit it \nwas pretty dumb to do it, but I did it because I worked for this \ncompany for many years and believed in the company. Mr. Lay and other \nexecutives told us employees that if we invested in their company, our \nfutures would be better and brighter. They told us that it was a future \nof growth.\n  And I did. I put my 401(k) into Enron stocks. It was my life savings \nfor me and my family. I had $330,000 in my 401(k). It is now worth \n$1,700. His question for me was: What do I do to provide for my \nfamily's security and retirement?\n  Mr. REID. What were those numbers?\n  Mr. DORGAN. This man put $330,000 into a 401(k) account and invested \nin Enron stock, a move that he felt would give he and his family \nsecurity in retirement. He wrote a letter saying that 401(k) account is \nnot worth $330,000 anymore; it is $1,700.\n  It breaks your heart.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. You will recall during the Enron hearings that \nthe Senator from North Dakota chaired, one of the witnesses, a former \nEnron employee from the Orlando, FL, area, where Enron has one of its \nsubsidiaries, the Florida Gas Company. We remember the very sad story \nof that lady. Her life savings was in the pension plan of the company, \n$750,000, and because they would not let her get into that retirement \naccount to sell it--while, by the way, the corporate executives were \nselling their stock--the value of that retirement fund for that Enron \nemployee from Florida plummeted to $20,000. She lost her entire life \nsavings.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the Senator from Florida, that Enron employee \nwas locked out, as were the other employees. They could not sell, could \nnot get rid of it even as the stock value was plunging. They lost their \nfortunes, and the folks at the top had all the flexibility in the world \nto sell their own stock.\n  The board of directors called what they found inside this corporation \n``appalling''. More than anything, I am angry, really angry at the way \nthe big shots treated themselves, like hogs at the trough, and the way \nthey let everybody else dangle in the wind. The people at the bottom \nlost everything they had, including their jobs, in most cases, with the \nbig shots never expressing remorse or regret.\n  There is something fundamentally wrong about what has happened. Part \nof this we fixed in the corporate responsibility bill. However, there \nis, as of yet, much unfinished business to address.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. A constituent of yours from North Dakota started out with \n$330,000 in his retirement account and wound up with $1,700. The \nSenator spoke on the floor before about Ken Lay at Enron and others. \nHow much money did they take, separate and apart from whatever they \nmade by selling their stock, just a reward for their malfeasance in \nrunning the corporation, does the Senator know?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. Lay left with somewhere close to $300 million. All \nthe folks at the top were very generous to themselves.\n  Mr. REID. Did he get a pension of half a million a year for life, \nthat is $450,000 a year, for life?\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is pretty clear that at these corporations, Tyco or \nothers, the folks at the top took very good care of themselves. As the \nfolks at the bottom were losing their investments or jobs, the folks at \nthe top were counting their money. That is what makes me so angry about \nall of this.\n  Let me come back to where I started. I started talking about our \nagenda at the end of this session, and what we ought to have completed \nbut is not yet done. When families began talking about their lot in \nlife, they talk about simple things important to the lives of their \nfamilies. Do I have good health care? Do grandpa and grandma have \naccess to a good doctor? Do I live in a safe neighborhood? Do I have a \ndecent job? Does my job pay well? Does it have security? Those are the \nthings important in people's lives.\n  I talked about what we have tried to do in this session of Congress, \nonly to confront a mountain of objection from those who don't want to \nget it done. To so many things, ``I object,'' they say. These are \npeople who never want to do anything the first time. I talked about the \nPatients' Bill of Rights which we never got done this Congress. We had \na big debate and got it through the Senate and yet it is still not \ndone. Why? Because ``I object,'' they say. Those who stand on behalf of \nthe insurance industry and the managed care organizations are saying, \n``I object.''\n  I held a hearing in the State of Nevada with Senator Reid. I will \nnever, ever, forget that hearing, and nor will he, I expect. This is \nabout managed care and why it is desperately necessary to get a \nPatients' Bill of Rights done. A woman stood at this hearing and she \nhad brought to the hearing a color picture of her son that she had \nturned into a very large poster. Her son's name was Chris. He was 16 \nyears old. As she began to speak at this hearing, she held that picture \nof Chris above her head.\n\n  She said: My son was 16 years old when he was diagnosed with cancer. \nShe said: My son was denied the treatment he needed when he needed it \nto give him a shot at winning this battle with cancer. She said: Before \nmy son died, he looked up at me from his bed and said, ``Mom, how can \nthey do this to me? How can they do this to a kid?'' She was crying and \ncrying as she spoke about her son.\n  Her point was very simple. No 16-year-old boy in this country, ever, \nunder any circumstances, ought to have to fight cancer and their \nmanaged care organization at the same time. That, by God, is an unfair \nfight. Everybody in this country knows it. We ought to do something \nabout it.\n  Do you think this is something that happens in just one circumstance? \nIt is not. I have had hearings in New York, in Nevada, in Minnesota, in \nChicago, and at every hearing we hear exactly the same thing. Men, \nwomen, and children are told: You go ahead and fight your disease. But \nthen they must fight the managed care organization to get payment for \nthe treatment. Or maybe they must fight to get the treatment that they \nwon't get unless they win a fight with the managed care organization, a \nfight that too many people, too often, lose.\n  It is not a fair fight. It is why we have decided to simply say that \nthere are basic rights people ought to have when they deal with their \nmanaged care organizations. Every patient has a right to know all of \ntheir options for medical treatment--not just the cheapest. It is very \nsimple.\n\n  My point is that we have a lot of unfinished business. The Patients' \nBill of Rights is just one thing we haven't gotten done. I have \ndescribed four or five more things today.\n  I regret that we are here at the end of this session, talking about \nthe unfinished business. But the fact is, we have people in this \nChamber who have become professional objectors. I object, I object, \nthey say. It doesn't matter what the subject is--I object.\n  This country has a very serious problem with its economy. As I said \nearlier, it is appropriate for us to have been talking about national \nsecurity because that is a deadly serious issue. But it is also \nimperative we talk about economic security because that is an issue \nthat is important in the life of every family and every American person \nas well.\n  I would say to the President: You have had substantial cooperation \nfrom those of us in this caucus, here in this Chamber, on national \nsecurity issues. Give us a little cooperation as well on economic \nsecurity issues. Bring Air Force One back here to Washington, DC. Don't \nspend the next 3 weeks out on the road campaigning. Spend a little time \nhere with us, talking about economic security, and fixing what is wrong \nwith this economy.\n  Eighteen months ago when the President proposed his fiscal policy, we \nwere told that we were going to have budget surpluses as far as the eye \ncould see. No problem, they said, we are going to have budget surpluses \nforever.\n  Some of us felt that maybe it was our role to be a bit conservative \nthen, and ask: What if something happens? Can you really see 6 months \nout, or 12 months or 2 years or 3 years out? Can you really see that \nfar ahead and anticipate what might be? What if something happens? We \nthink it is pretty unwise to commit ourselves to a fiscal\n\n[[Page S10614]]\n\npolicy that says let's have a $1.7 trillion tax cut over 10 years, \nanticipating everything is going to be really strong and positive for \nour economy.\n  What happened is 5 months later we discovered we were in a recession. \nWe discovered that terrorists hit New York City and the Pentagon, \nhijacking four airplanes. We discovered we are at war against \nterrorism. We discovered the most outrageous set of corporate scandals \nin this country's history. All these things converged at the same \nintersection, at the same time, all undermining the confidence of the \nAmerican people in the future of this economy.\n  You can say what you want about this economy. It is not an economy \nwhere there are dials and gauges and levers in the engine room of this \nship of state, where all we have do is walk down there and adjust them \nto make the ship move right along without a problem. That is not the \nway the economy works.\n  I know there are people in the Fed, in monetary policy, and people in \nfiscal policy, who really have an inflated sense of self-importance \nabout their role in the economy. This economy is only about and all \nabout people's confidence. People are either confident about the future \nor they are not. If they are confident about the future, our economy \nexpands because they do the things that manifest that confidence: They \nbuy cars, houses, take trips, they do the things that expand the \neconomy. If they lack confidence, they do exactly the opposite and that \ncauses contraction.\n  The American people are very concerned about this economy. It would \nserve this country well, in my judgment, if the President would join \nus, all of us, and sit down and talk seriously about what we need to do \nto put this economy back on track, make this economy strong again, make \nthis economy grow again and produce jobs and expand once again, and \nturn these budget deficits into budget surpluses and invest in the \nthings that provide better lives for the American people: Health care, \neducation--the things we know work to improve life for the American \npeople. That is what we ask of this President.\n\n  Let me conclude by saying there is not a Republican or Democratic way \nto fix all of this. There is only the opportunity for people to sit \ndown and reason together and compromise and find the best of a series \nof good ideas. But you cannot do that when there is a one-lyric song or \none-chorus song here in this Chamber that says to everything, every \nproposal, every suggestion: I object, I object, I object. That does not \nserve this country's interest at this point in time.\n  This October 17, this country faces real challenges. It is time for \nall of us to take a deep breath, to ask the President to take a little \ntime off the campaign trail to join us, and to work together to see if \nthere is not a better way to deal with national security, improving the \neconomy, and addressing the concerns of people across the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his brilliant statement. I also say not only should the President \nstop his campaign travels--or, if he wants to do them, they should be \npaid for by political parties and not by taxpayers. That is the concern \nI have with these travels.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Florida be \nrecognized for up to 20 minutes. I know Senator Gramm wishes to speak. \nHis staff would now have an idea, as to when the Senator from Florida \nwill be finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10614-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10614-S10616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  NASA\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am going to speak about the \nmanagement of one of the most exciting little agencies in the Federal \nGovernment, NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has just put his finger on a number of \nproblems with regard to our national economy, a subject that I \naddressed yesterday. I compliment him for his comments, his insight \ninto the multiplicity of problems that are facing our country at this \ntime. There is much to be done.\n  I would like to focus today on a particular part of the Federal \nGovernment, of which I have some credentials to offer some suggestions. \nIf we don't pay attention to the direction the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration is headed, we are going to get off on a wrong \ntrack and there are going to be some mistakes made. They can be \nmistakes everyone in this country would regret.\n  I shared with the administrator of NASA my hope for his success. He \ncame through our Commerce Committee. We had both private and public \nmeetings. We had a lengthy hearing for his confirmation. We will \ncontinue to have hearings.\n  I have suggested to the administrator that it appears the White House \nand the Office of Management and Budget are going to be unwilling to \noffer to NASA a budget that would increase its buying power. Its \nbasically $15 billion budget in current-year spending is basically the \nsame as it was 10 years ago. This is a little agency that has achieved \nso much and its achievements are the embodiment of the hopes and dreams \nof Americans as we fulfill our role as adventurers and explorers--a \ncharacteristic of the American people that we never want to give up. If \nwe do, we will be a second-rate nation.\n  This country was founded by explorers. This country was expanded by \nexplorers and adventurers. Then the frontier was westward. Now the \nfrontier is upward. And here on Earth the frontier is inward.\n  We never want to give up that adventure because we will not fulfill \nthe destiny that is resident in the hearts of all Americans, that we \nwant to be adventurers and explorers.\n  But, in this Senator's opinion, NASA is not going to be able to \nfulfill that role and achieve that destiny if we keep starving NASA. \nNASA cannot do that in the year 2003 on a budget that was the same \nbudget in fiscal year 1991--12 years ago. So if the White House and the \nOffice of Management and Budget continue to starve NASA of its funds, \nthere has to be some kind of relief.\n  I have suggested to the administrator a $5 billion item in the \nnational budget over the next 5 years that is for the development of \ntechnologies of a follow-on to the space shuttle.\n  The space shuttle originally was going to be extending its lifetime \nto about the year 2007. Then it was extended to 2012. Now the word out \nof NASA is that the present fleet of four orbiters is going to continue \nso that we will have assured access to space for humankind through the \nyear 2020.\n  It is a reliable vehicle. We have the best space team in the world. \nWe have the finest launch team in the world at the Kennedy Space \nCenter. But we can't continue to operate safely with the continued \nstarving of NASA funds by the administration.\n  I have suggested to the Administrator that one aspect he should look \nat as a program is development of new technologies for a new kind of \nvehicle, a reusable vehicle, that would be scheduled to go after the \nyear 2020.\n  That is also an item that is of considerable interest to the \nDepartment of Defense. The DOD, being flush with money, could fund \nthat, with NASA having the management of that research, which it does \nso well and, therefore, give some relief in the NASA budget so that \nwhat was left over could be applied to what was necessary; that is, \nsafety upgrades on the space shuttle.\n  So there is no question that we are doing everything possible to have \nthat space transportation system be as safe as possible even though we \nknow it is risky business. When you defy the laws of gravity, when you \ngo at mach 25, when you circle the globe in 90 minutes, when you come \nthrough 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit of searing heat on reentry, it is \nrisky business. So we cannot afford to do anything less than upgrade \nall of the things that we have in the pipeline for the shuttle safety \nupgrades.\n  At the same time, our Nation is in the midst of building the largest \nengineering accomplishment of all time. We are building a space \nstation. It is a multinational effort. By the time it is completed, it \nwill weigh 1 million pounds, it will have an acre of solar\n\n[[Page S10615]]\n\npanels, it will measure the length of a football field, it will have a \npressurized volume equal to two jumbo jets, and it will orbit at 220 \nnautical miles above the Earth.\n  We already have an international space station in orbit. What is up \nthere already is an extraordinary accomplishment. It is the largest \ncooperative scientific program in history. It is drawing on the \nresources and the scientific expertise of our own Nation along with the \nexpertise of 15 other countries.\n  This project is an exciting gateway to the new frontiers in human \nspace exploration--meeting the deep-seated need of humans throughout \nhistory to explore the unknown, to understand their world and their \nuniverse, and to apply that knowledge to the benefit of all here on \nEarth. The International Space Station will sustain U.S. leadership in \nexploration in and the use of outer space which has inspired a \ngeneration of Americans and people throughout the world.\n  I suddenly had a flashback. I was a lieutenant in the Army. I was on \nleave at the time we were launching to go to the Moon. I was in Eastern \nEurope approaching Belgrade, Yugoslavia. I went to the U.S. Embassy \nright at the time of launch, and I asked them if they had for this Army \nlieutenant the opportunity to watch it on television. They did not. I \nsaid: What would you recommend? They said: It will be carried live by \nthe BBC on radio. Go outside of Belgrade to that series of hills and \nstick up the antenna of your shortwave radio and tune into the BBC.\n  My fellow companions--those two young Americans with me, my best \nfriends today--and I went out there. And the BBC cut into NASA Control \nat the time of launch of Apollo 11. There were three Americans in \nYugoslavia out there cheering as that rocket rose into the heavens.\n\n  That is the kind of excitement that has been generated across the \nEarth by the stunning accomplishments of America's space program. Now \nwe are on the cusp of having another stunning accomplishment of \nbreakthroughs in scientific exploration on the International Space \nStation. That station will provide a stunning opportunity to enhance \nU.S. economic competitiveness by creating new commercial enterprises \nwhile serving as a virtual classroom in space to advance scientific \neducation for teachers and students alike.\n  Most importantly, the station will be a unique world-class laboratory \nby providing an international platform for advances in science and \ntechnology. In this laboratory of the heavens, we will conduct research \nin tissue growth, looking at the causes of cancers and potential \nmedical treatments. Our Nation's biochemists will investigate new drugs \nand develop a whole new understanding of the building blocks of life.\n  Using the microgravity environment of space--that is near zero G--our \nindustries will be able to develop new advanced materials that may lead \nto stronger, lighter metals and more powerful computer chips.\n  The station will also house experiments in combustion science that \ncould lead to reduced emissions from powerplants and automobiles, \nsaving consumers billions of dollars. But that is only if we complete \nthe space station.\n  Last year, we found that the international program had real cost \noverruns and management problems. There is no question that we \nabsolutely have to complete the project because it is an investment in \nour future and the legacy we will leave to our children's children. Why \nelse are we building it, other than to make a difference in their \nlives?\n  Yet this administration chose to fund some of the station's cost \noverruns without adding more money to NASA's budget, and requiring cuts \nto many other critical programs, including the delay of the safety \nupgrades on the space shuttle which gives us the access to and from the \nInternational Space Station.\n  Instead of funding the space station sufficiently to fulfill its \npotential, this administration proposed curtailing the space station \nprogram to a skeletal configuration called ``Core Complete.'' Instead \nof maintaining a full-time crew of six or seven astronauts to be on \nboard the station at all times, Core Complete, the skeletal completion \nwould provide for only three crew members.\n  You cannot do science on the space station with just three crew \nmembers because it takes more than two crew members to tend to the care \nand the feeding of the station, and that leaves less than one person to \nconduct the research on board.\n  So I have been quite afraid that these cuts would endanger the future \nof the International Space Station. Apparently, there are other people \nwho feel that way, too, because there is a report just released and it \nconcludes this is exactly what has happened: The future of the station \nitself is now in jeopardy. That is according to that report. In March, \nthe administration charged an independent task force, made up of Nobel \nlaureates and world-class scientists and engineers, to review, assess, \nand help define NASA's biological and physical research priorities.\n  Just over a month ago, this group, known as the Research Maximization \nand Prioritization Task Force, or ReMaP, completed their review of the \nspace station's science programs. The results were not good.\n  This distinguished group concluded that the Core Complete \nconfiguration and the shuttle flight rate mandated by this \nadministration would severely restrict the station's research \nproductivity--a finding confirmed by NASA's own analyses.\n  A year and a half has now passed since this administration destroyed \nthe space station's research budget, by cutting the crew size on the \nInternational Space Station from seven to three, and eliminating the \nU.S. crew rescue vehicle and the crew's living space known as the \n``habitation module.''\n  In addition, the study, the ReMaP study, concluded that if \nenhancements beyond the Core Complete are not anticipated, then NASA \nshould ``cease to characterize the Space Station as a science-driven \nprogram.'' Listen to this conclusion: We should ``cease to characterize \nthe Space Station as a science-driven program.''\n  What happened to the world-class laboratory? Where is our \ninternational science and technology platform? What about tissue growth \nresearch, and curing cancer, and all the other innovative medical \ntreatments?\n  What about the new drugs and the building blocks of life? How are we \ngoing to develop advanced materials and more powerful computer chips? \nWhat happened to environmental research in combustion science and \nreducing our emissions and energy use?\n  With only a skeletal space station, gone are these and many other \npotential discoveries that we have been awaiting.\n  NASA has a proven track record in supporting scientific research that \nmakes a difference here on Earth. Let me give you a couple examples.\n  I want to give some other examples of where NASA has such a proven \ntrack record in supporting scientific research.\n  For example: a laminar air flow technique. It is used in NASA clean \nrooms for contamination-free assembly of space equipment. It is now \nbeing used--get this--at tollbooths on bridges and turnpikes to \ndecrease the toll collector's inhalation of exhaust fumes. Straight out \nof NASA.\n  I will give you another example: an advanced ultrasound skin damage \nassessment instrument. Using NASA ultrasound technology, it enables \nimmediate assessment of burn damage depth, improving patient treatment, \nand it may save many lives in serious burn cases.\n  I will give you another example: a remotely operated, emergency \nresponse robot. It was first developed by NASA. It reduces human injury \nlevels by performing hazardous tasks that would otherwise be handled by \nhumans.\n  Another example: a custom-made suit, derived from space suits. It \ncirculates coolant through tubes to lower a patient's body temperature, \nproducing dramatic improvement of symptoms of multiple sclerosis, \ncerebral palsy, spina bifida, and other conditions.\n  Here is another: a self-righting life raft, originally developed for \nthe Apollo program, which was to the moon, where we landed the \nastronauts back in the water. It fully inflates in 12 seconds, and it \nprotects lives during extremely adverse weather conditions with self-\nrighting and gravity compensation features.\n\n[[Page S10616]]\n\n  How about this one? A new digital imaging breast biopsy system images \nbreast tissue more clearly and more efficiently. This nonsurgical \nsystem--using technology originally developed by NASA for the Hubble \nSpace Telescope--is less traumatic and greatly reduces the pain, \nscarring, radiation exposure, time, and money associated with surgical \nbiopsies.\n  And finally, a flywheel energy storage system. It is derived from two \nNASA-sponsored energy storage studies. It is a chemical-free, \nmechanical battery that harnesses the energy of a rapidly spinning \nwheel, and it stores it as electricity with 50 times the capacity of a \nlead-acid battery. This system is especially useful in electric \nvehicles, something that we are trying to perfect to help us ween \nourselves from our dependence on foreign oil.\n  And these are just a few examples.\n  But I say again about this administration's plan for the space \nstation: The Core Complete or the skeletal structure--not fleshed out--\nsimply taunts the research community, telling them that an orbiting \nlaboratory is there but fails to provide them with real and significant \nopportunity to use it.\n  The tag line NASA uses for the International Space Station program \nsays: ``It's about life on Earth.'' That is the tag line. But is there \ngoing to be life in space?\n  This Core Complete concept of the NASA administration falls so short \nof expectations that our Nation's leading scientists refuse to call it \na science program.\n  And under the administration's plan, our ever-shrinking space station \nwill waste both time and money over the long run while failing to \nrealize the unique potential of this international research facility.\n  This administration--I am talking about OMB; I am talking about the \nWhite House, and I am talking about the administration in NASA--needs \nto stop pretending that Core Complete is a viable or a desirable goal \nfor our country or our space-faring international partners.\n  It is neither. Core Complete is the minimum configuration needed for \nthe U.S. to say it has completed a space station, but that is just it--\nit is the minimum. We can fix this by returning to the original plan. \nLet's go back to building a fully capable research laboratory. Let's go \nback to a crew size capable of maintaining the station and conducting a \nrobust research agenda. Let's realize the full potential of this \nlaboratory of the heavens. We must realize the station's full \npotential. Let's expand the crew size and broaden our research \ncapabilities on board.\n  Let's develop a crew rescue vehicle so that we don't have to rely on \nthe Soviet vehicle that can only take three, so that we can get seven \nastronauts on board to do the research, so in the case of a \ncatastrophic failure that we have a rescue vehicle, a lifeboat that can \nevacuate the seven crew members. And let's recommit to furthering \nhumankind's understanding of the building blocks of life, recommit to \ndeveloping advanced materials, reducing fuel emissions, and finding a \ncure for cancer.\n  To this administration, I respectfully say, but I very strongly say, \nwe best recommit this Nation to building a fully capable International \nSpace Station. We have delayed long enough. The Nation awaits. There is \nnot an American, there is not a school child whose eyes do not light up \nwhen told of the adventures and the successes of America's space \nprogram. We need to continue with a great vision.\n  Right now, we can continue by building out the space station so it \ncan fulfill its scientific research mission.\n  I see my colleague from Montana. I had the privilege of going in the \nsummer to Montana, and lo and behold, Tribal Industries in his State of \nMontana, built and conducted by the tribes on tribal lands, were doing \ngreat things that are direct spinoffs from America's space program. \nThey had some interest in having me out there to talk to them about \nsome of the successes of the space program. It is just another example \nof how all of these space accomplishments have spun off into \nbusinesses, this Senator, who has had such a great privilege of being a \npart of the space program, found when I went to the northern part of \nMontana, near Flat Iron Lake, near Big Fork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Florida. The \ntribe he is referring to is the Salish Kooteenai Tribe in northwestern \nMontana. That tribe, along with a couple others in Montana, is proudly \ndoing great work with defense contracts and NASA contracts. The Senator \nis exactly right. This is a program that is almost all-encompassing for \nalmost the entire country. There are so many different States. We are \nparticularly proud in Montana because of the Native Americans who work \nat it. It is good work. It is top quality work. I appreciate the \nSenator coming to Montana, visiting the Salish Kooteenai, seeing their \ngood work. I am sure it adds more meaning and context to the Senator's \nexperience in the space program and even new meaning to the Senator's \nexperience of the space program. We are happy to be able to help in \nthat regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10616-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10616-S10617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                DROUGHT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to address a natural disaster that \nis occurring in America. That is the unrelenting drought.\n  For my State of Montana and many States this year, particularly in \nColorado and other Western States, it has brought economic hardship to \nour agricultural producers and to our rural communities.\n  In 1996, before the drought began, Montana wheat producers made $847 \nmillion from their wheat sales, close to $1 billion. In 2001, 4 years \ninto the drought, Montana producers made just $317 million from wheat \nsales. That is a 62-percent decline.\n  Let me add a new context to that figure. Agriculture is more than 50 \npercent of my State's economy. It is truly the backbone of our State. I \nask those who oppose natural disaster assistance one question: How is a \nState like Montana supposed to survive a loss of that magnitude, 62 \npercent, without assistance, when half the economy is agriculture? The \nmost efficient, the most effective, the most successful businesses in \nthe world could not absorb that kind of a loss.\n  That 62-percent decline in sales for Montana wheat farmers--and I \nmight add, the same devastating effect is felt by livestock producers \nbecause of lack of pasture and feed--is through absolutely no fault of \nthose producers. These farmers haven't been cooking the books. They \nhaven't been taking exorbitant bonuses at the expense of shareholders. \nNo, our Nation's farmers and ranchers are hard working, dedicated, \ngood, honest people, trying to make a living, trying to make ends meet. \nThey need our help.\n  The drought is no longer touching only the pockets of our country. \nThe drought has become an epidemic. It has affected a majority of our \nNation. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, 1,470 \ncounties in 45 States have been designated drought disaster regions in \n2002.\n  As you can tell from this map, dated October 1 of this year, there \nisn't one State west of the Mississippi that has been receiving the \nrain they need. Just look west of the Mississippi, and clearly, by the \ndark brown and the reds, you can see the center of America is \nexperiencing deep drought.\n  Drought is affecting States up and down the east coast as well, as we \ncan see from this map. That is just part of it. That is just this year. \nIn most regions of the country, certainly in the West, we are now in \nour fourth or fifth year. It is cumulative. It adds up. This map alone \ndoesn't tell the whole story.\n\n  On October 3 of this year, President Bush provided FEMA Federal \ndisaster funds and resources for people victimized by Hurricane Lili. \nThose people, those small businesses, those rural communities have been \ndevastated by an unpredictable and uncontrollable natural phenomenon--a \nhurricane. They deserve our assistance, and we, very generously and \nproudly, support that assistance the President provided for those parts \nof the country devastated by hurricanes.\n  But where is the assistance for people suffering from drought?\n  In reality, the only real difference between a hurricane and a \ndrought is that a majority of people don't understand the impact of 4 \nconsecutive years of drought the same way they understand the impact of \na hurricane.\n\n[[Page S10617]]\n\nDrought is a silent killer. It is not on TV. It is not headlined in the \nnews. It is a silent killer that slowly builds up and accumulates. The \npictures of drought on CNN are not as immediate and terrifying as are \nthe photographs of hurricanes. But the effects can be just as serious \nfor the people in both events. They can both lose their homes and \nlivelihoods.\n  Our agricultural producers are holding their breath. They are waiting \nfor natural disaster assistance because if they don't receive our help, \nmany will not make it. In Montana, and in other States across the \ncountry, small businesses are closing their doors and families are \nlosing their futures because of the drought. It is happening. School \ndistricts no longer have enough children to conduct classes, so they \nhave to consolidate schools, forcing kids to travel hours by bus. Why \nare they losing children? Because of the effect of the drought. Parts \nof my State are just drying up.\n  Those people, small businesses, and rural communities have been \ndevastated by unpredictable and uncontrollable natural phenomenon. On \nSeptember 3 of this year, the Wall Street Journal printed this:\n\n       The U.S. may be looking at its most expensive drought in \n     its history, inflicting economic damage far beyond the farm \n     belt.\n\n  Think of that, Mr. President. A quote by the Wall Street Journal that \nthe U.S. may be looking at the most expensive drought in our Nation's \nhistory, inflicting economic damage far beyond the farm belt.\n  I will share a few stories that have been shared with me over the \nlast couple of weeks. In north-central Montana, the bread basket of my \nState, a producer and his family have been living off of their farm for \nseveral generations. After 4 years of valiant fighting against the \ndrought, they have been forced to give up. The question is, What do \nthey do now?\n  Because of the drought, they have no crop and cannot pay off their \noutstanding operating loans. Don't forget, that is how farmers do \nbusiness. They get operating loans before they get their crop. If they \nget no crop, they cannot pay off the loans. More than 3 months ago, \nthis family put their farm, their machinery, everything they have \ndedicated a lifetime to, up for sale. They have yet to receive a single \noffer in more than 90 days.\n  A producer in the same region had five hired hands just 5 years ago. \nNow he has none. Due to the cost of feed and the condition of his \npastures, he has had to cut down his herd to one-fourth of what he used \nto own. Over the last 3 years, he has lost several hundred thousand \ndollars because the drought has killed his crops and he cannot afford \ncattle feed.\n\n  He and his family rely on the income from his wife. But to make a bad \nsituation worse, his wife's job is now in jeopardy because of the \nnegative impact of the drought on her employer. She is not sure she can \nkeep her job.\n  Dale Schuler, past president of Montana Grain Growers Association, \nand a farmer in Choteau County, had this to say, and I know Dale. He is \na rock-solid man. He has been farming for years:\n\n       Nearly 2,000 square miles of crop in my area of central \n     Montana went unharvested in 2001. That is an area equal to \n     the size of the State of Rhode Island. Farmers and our \n     families haven't had the means to repay our operating loans, \n     let alone buy inputs to plant the crop for the coming here.\n       Don't forget, agriculture is 50 percent of the economy in \n     Montana. There is a decline in income over several years of \n     62 percent. Continuing his quote:\n       Choteau County is the largest farming county in Montana, \n     and yet our last farm equipment dealer had no choice but to \n     close his doors, our local co-op closed its tire shop, one \n     farm fuel supplier quit, and the fertilizer dealers and grain \n     elevators are laying off workers. I believe that we are about \n     to see a mass exodus from Montana that has not been seen \n     since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\n  That is no small statement, Mr. President.\n  Another farmer from Choteau County, Darin Arganbright, pointed out \nthat enrollment in local schools has decreased by 50 percent in the \npast few years. Young families are not able to stay in the area because \nof the lack of work and the lack of opportunity.\n  It is not only agriculture that is gone; businesses in the community \nare being devastated.\n  According to the New York Times, an article of May 3 of this year:\n\n       In eastern Montana, more than a thousand wheat farmers have \n     called it quits rather than trying to coax another crop out \n     of the ground that has received less rain over the last 12 \n     months than many deserts get in a year.\n\n  That is the fourth year of drought. That is not 1 year; that is 4. I \nremind colleagues that Federal crop insurance is perverse because, with \neach year the coverage decreases while premiums increase compared to \nthe prior year. It is a negative vicious cycle.\n  Don Wilhite, director of the National Drought Mitigation Center, \ndescribes drought in the following manner:\n\n       Drought is the Rodney Dangerfield of natural disasters. In \n     most cases, it causes the most significant losses, but it is \n     harder to convince policymakers and others to deal with it.\n\n  That is what is happening, Mr. President. The White House is turning \na deaf ear to this. They put their blinders on. The majority party in \nthe other body is doing the same thing, putting blinders on, closing \ntheir ears, not paying attention.\n  Producers pray every day that they can hang on until the U.S. \nCongress--all of us elected to represent the people--works together to \npass agricultural disaster assistance. Our producers are praying that \nwe act now so their children have the opportunity to continue what they \nand generations before them have fought so hard to sustain.\n  We cannot and must not continue to ignore the impact of drought and \nthe effect it has on our agricultural producers and our rural \ncommunities. Agricultural producers are every bit as deserving of \nassistance for their suffering from the drought as a small business \nowner from Louisiana suffering from the hurricane.\n\n  In a speech to the Cattle Industry Annual Convention and Trade Show \nin Denver in February, President Bush emphasized the need for a strong \nrural economy:\n\n       Our farm economy, our ranchers and farmers provide an \n     incredible part of the Nation's economic vitality.\n\n  That is what he said in February. The President continued by saying \nif the agricultural economy is not vital, the Nation's economy will \nsuffer. Those are the President's own words.\n  I could not agree more with the President. The Nation's economy is \ndirectly tied to our agricultural economy. Unless we take action, the \ndrought will have a permanent impact on our agricultural producers, on \nour small rural towns, and on our national economy.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House and the Senate, and the President, \nto work together to pass natural disaster assistance before it is too \nlate--and in many cases, for thousands of families who have pulled up \nstakes, it is already too late. I ask the President to live up to the \nwords he spoke in February. If the agricultural economy is vital to the \nnational economy--and it is--then it is vital that we pass agricultural \ndisaster assistance immediately.\n  Our agricultural producers have never let us down--never. They do not \nlet us down. They continue to fill our tables with safe and abundant \nsupplies of food. Now it is time for us to work together to provide \nthem with immediate assistance so they can continue to fill their own \ntables.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, and I urge my colleagues to pay \nclose attention to my remarks because we have a problem. We have to \nwork this out together. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. I thank \nthe Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, earlier today my friend and colleague, \nthe Senator from Nevada, our deputy leader, made a unanimous consent \nrequest that we consider legislation to provide a three-step process to \nincrease in the minimum wage by $1.50. The reason this request has been \nmade is because over the period of these last 2 years, those of us on \nthis side have made an extraordinary attempt to try and follow the \nregular order, the regular process, and have this legislation \nconsidered in the Senate. Effectively, we have been blocked all the \nway.\n  In the final hours of this session, it appears we probably will be \nback for a lame duck session, but we want to make sure those who are \naffected by this legislation and, importantly, those who are not but \nthose who are strong supporters of fairness and decency when it comes \nto the minimum wage, understand what is happening in the Senate. The \nbottom line is, the Republican leadership is blocking an increase in \nthe minimum wage.\n  I want to take a few moments this afternoon to review once again why \nthis request was so urgent, why it was basically an emergency request \nand what the results would be with the objection that has been made by \nthe leaders of the Republican Party.\n  First of all, if we look over the period of the years going back to \n1968, and we look at what the real value of the minimum wage would be, \nthis is the real value. This is comparing oranges and oranges in this \ncase. The real value today would be $8.14. That is what it was in 1968. \nToday it is $5.15. By the end of this year, using constant figures, it \nwill effectively be $4.70--$8.14 in 1968; $4.70 now in terms of real \npurchasing power.\n  We have seen how over the period of these years there has been a \ngradual decline, but it really was not until 1980 that we had an \nadministration that refused to consider what other administrations, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, considered, and that is a fair \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  Then we had the battles. We had two different times we had small \nincreases. In order to even get it considered, we had to reduce the \nincrease and cut out a third year for the increase in the minimum wage. \nThe last time we had to add close to $30 billion in tax breaks in order \nto effectively have an increase in the minimum wage.\n  The minimum wage has been increased some 9 times. Eight times it was \nincreased without a tax reduction, but not the last times. That was the \ncondition by which our Republican friends would agree to even consider \nan extension. Now, without any kind of extension, we are falling back \nto $4.70.\n  The petition that was presented by Senator Reid would have provided, \nover a 3-year period, an increase of $1.50. The objection today is \nunacceptable.\n  Let us look at how the minimum wage is related to the issue of \npoverty in America. Going back again to the period of 1968 and during \nthe several years during that period, the minimum wage was the poverty \nwage. What we have seen in recent years is how the minimum wage now has \nfallen so far below the poverty wage, it would have to be increased by \nabout $3.50 an hour to even get up to the poverty line, which is the \nbasic line that has been defined as the income which is necessary to \nprovide the basics of surviving in the United States of America. Yet, \nwe are expecting men and women to take these jobs, which they do, and \npay them these totally inadequate wages.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I was in the Chamber yesterday when the Senator made his \nterrific speech on this very important issue. I say to my friend from \nMassachusetts, is it not true that many people, probably people \nlistening to this debate, think the minimum wage is for kids flipping \nhamburgers at McDonald's?\n  Does the Senator know that 60 percent of the people who draw minimum \nwage are women and for 40 percent of those women that is the only money \nthey have to support their families? Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. The Senator's \nquestion anticipates one of the traditional arguments that have been \nsuggested on the other side of the aisle that these are really \nteenagers who are getting this minimum wage.\n  To the contrary, as the Senator has pointed out, actually 68 percent \nof those who receive it are adults. For half of those, the minimum wage \njob is the sole source of income for those families. A good percentage \nof those, I would say to the Senator, have two or three minimum wage \njobs. That is what we have seen.\n  We have heard opposition to this issue. We recognize, as I pointed \nout on other occasions, what this issue is really all about. We are \ntalking about men and women who clean out the great buildings across \nour Nation, who work late at night, work hard, do very tough, difficult \nand dreary work, but nonetheless they maintain their dignity and their \nspirit. These are individuals who work in child care settings as \nassistants to child care providers. We are willing to entrust our most \nsacred individuals, our children, to minimum wage workers who are \nassistant teachers working in the classroom. Our most sacred trusts are \nour children, our parents, and grandparents.\n  Those who are working with the teachers in the classroom very often \nare the minimum wage workers. Those who are working in the child care \ncenters are most likely the minimum wage workers. Those who are working \nin the nursing homes to help take care of our parents and grandparents \nwho built this country, fought in its wars, lifted the Nation out of \nthe Depression, sacrificed immensely for their children, are minimum \nwage workers. Those are the ones we are talking about. So often when we \ntalk about the minimum wage, we are talking about the graphs depicting \ncents per hour and the rest. But these are real individuals who are \nproviding important services in our country and to our people, and they \nare being shortchanged.\n  As I have said before, it is a women's issue because the great \nmajority of the minimum wage workers are women. It is a civil rights \nissue because great numbers of people who are working for the minimum \nwage are men and women of color. It is a children's issue because how \ntheir parents are being paid and compensated is going to reflect on how \nthose children are going to grow up. It is a family issue.\n  We hear so much about family issues in the Senate. This is a family \nissue. When a parent has to work one or two minimum wage jobs, the time \nthey are away from the home, the other parent often working in a \nsimilar kind of a situation, trying to make ends meet, the lack of time \nfor them to come together to give these children the kinds of values \nand upbringing that they should have works to the disadvantage of these \nchildren.\n  Beyond all that, it is a fairness issue. People understand in this \ncountry that men and women who are willing to work 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks of the year, should be treated fairly. We are talking about \npeople working hard, long, difficult hours who ought to be treated \nfairly.\n  Americans understand this issue of fairness. But our Republican \nfriends do not. They have opposed increases in the minimum wage every \nsingle time, at least during the time I have been here in the last 40 \nyears.\n  I remember one of those debates. In August of 1960, they were opposed \nto the last measure that came before this body at that time, and they \nwere opposed to the minimum wage at that time, too. This has been over \na long period of time.\n  Mr. President, I remind our friends and the viewing public, we have \ntaken the time to raise our own salaries, four different times over the \nlast 6 years, some $16,000. But we are refusing to even let this issue \nbe debated and come to a vote. That is wrong. It is unfair. It is \nunjust. The Democrats stand for those working families; for fairness \nand decency. They stand for the children of those minimum wage workers. \nThey stand with the minimum-wage workers, men and women of dignity who \nare only asking to be treated fairly. We stand with them.\n  We continue to ask why our Republican leaders in the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives and in the White House refuse the opportunity \nto even debate this issue and refuse the opportunity to consider it and \npass it. I regret that. We will continue to express this issue because \nthat is the\n\n[[Page S10619]]\n\nonly way we have ever been able to get this done in the past. We expect \nthat will be the only way to get it done in the future. We will press \nit across the countryside.\n  We ask our fellow Americans. This issue is one that concerns them. I \ndon't know a single member of our side who would not support an \nincrease in the minimum wage. I hope they will understand that when \nthey go to the polls.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10619-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE MEDICAL DEVICE USE FEE AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of the \nmembership the bill H.R. 5651, the Medical Device User Fee and \nModernization Act of 2002. It has now passed the House of \nRepresentatives. We have been working on this legislation for 10 years. \nIt has been a divisive issue, both the issue and as a public policy \nissue. We finally have virtual support from the Members in the House of \nRepresentatives, the committees of jurisdiction, and also the Members \nhere. There may be Members who have questions. We are prepared to \nanswer those.\n  I indicate this is a public health matter of enormous importance and \nconsequence. If Members are going to object, they are going to have to \ncome to the floor of the Senate and express those objections and \nreasons. We will not tolerate someone holding up this bill in hopes \nthat they can get it carried back to the House. We have worked too \nlong. We have worked too hard. This is an enormously important health \nissue. We will not tolerate it. I will not tolerate it. Those members \nof our committee will not tolerate it.\n  I want to make it very clear, if they ever expect any kind of \ncooperation on any other health matters, they had better understand the \nimportance and significance of this measure--if they ever expect any \ncooperation on any health matters down the road.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida).

Mr. President, I begin by thanking our colleague from \nMassachusetts for his impassioned advocacy of this important issue. It \nis a cause that both the Chair and I support wholeheartedly. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has been a tireless advocate of raising the \nminimum wage for many years. It is my privilege to join with him. This \nis an issue whose time has come. It needs to be done, and we need a \nsense of urgency for those on the other side of the aisle and this \nadministration. I thank my colleague once again.\n  Mr. President, let me share some thoughts about the importance of \nextending coverage for the unemployed in our country. Given the \nweakness of our economy, I think this is a critically important issue \nthat will help millions of our fellow citizens who are suffering \nunemployment through no fault of their own. It is also an important \ncomponent of a coherent economic strategy to get America working again.\n  As you and others know all too well, the economy is weak, people are \nout of work, we need leadership to get the economy moving, people back \nto employment, and to help those who have suffered unemployment, \nputting money back into people's pockets to put it back into the \neconomy to create jobs and growth. Extending unemployment benefits is \nan important part of that strategy, an idea whose time has come, a lot \nlike raising the minimum wage.\n  The economy is not doing well. Unemployment has risen. Long-term \nunemployment in September was 1.6 million working men and women. \nHousehold income for the typical family has fallen for the first time \nin a decade. Home foreclosures have reached a 30-year high. Poverty \nrates across America rose last year. Regrettably, the economy seems \nunlikely to reverse its sluggish course anytime soon. Manufacturing has \nslowed. Retail sales are weak. Capital investment has declined. Foreign \ndemand for American goods and services is stalled.\n  As a result, job creation actually declined last year. Many Americans \nare hard hit, and others are worried they will be next. Mr. President, \n1.1 million Americans had exhausted their unemployment benefits as of \nAugust. This figure is expected to double to 2.2 million hard-working \nAmericans as soon as December--regrettably, just in time for the \nChristmas season.\n  In my own home State of Indiana, we have not been unaffected. Twenty-\none thousand hard-working Hoosiers have exhausted unemployment benefits \nas of August. This figure will more than double to 45,000 by December. \nThere is no State in the Union that is unaffected by this unfortunate \nstate of affairs. These Americans need a helping hand. I want to \nemphasize that it is not only the compassionate thing to do, but it is \nthe economically sensible thing to do as well, because not only are we \nhelping individuals who are in need, we are also helping the economy \nget back on its feet and thereby helping all Americans, be they \nemployed or unemployed.\n  We need stimulus for job growth and economic expansion. These \nbenefits will be used for consumer spending. Economists have long \nrecognized that helping those who are unemployed leads directly to \nadded demand in the economy. Labor Department statistics, in fact, \nindicate that there is a significant multiplier effect. For every $1 \nthat goes into unemployment benefits, a full $2.15 is added to the \ngross domestic product. By any definition, $1 into $2.15 of increase to \nthe gross domestic product is a good investment for the American \npeople.\n  Consumers are stressed right now. They have high levels of debt. They \nhave tapped into their home equity at rates that could be \nunsustainable. The tax cut of last year has run its course. There are \nother reasons to believe consumers may be cutting back on their \npurchases. Adding about $17 billion to consumption through extending \nunemployment benefits will help the consumers maintain their course, \nallowing the economy to hang in there until capital investment comes \nback and demand from abroad picks up.\n  What is more, we can afford this at this time. It is fiscally \nsustainable and responsible. There is more than $27 billion currently \nin the unemployment trust fund, more than sufficient to cover the costs \nextending unemployment benefits, as I and others are proposing. So this \nwill not mean an increase in the annual deficit or in America's debt. \nWe can do what is right for individuals, what is right for the economy, \nand do so in a fiscally responsible way.\n  I ask that we adopt this measure. It will extend unemployment \nbenefits eligibility by 13 additional weeks for every State across the \nUnion. It will add an additional 7 weeks for those States with the \nhighest rates of unemployment and adjust the trigger mechanism to \nexpand eligibility to make sure that the reality of unemployment across \nthe Nation is reflected in the law.\n  Also, I ask for a new sense of urgency from this administration when \nit comes to promoting economic growth. The last time I was privileged \nto speak to my colleagues on the floor it was to call for support of \nthe President's initiative and resolution with regard to Iraq. We \ngenerated substantial bipartisan support for that resolution. I ask the \nadministration and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nbring that same sense of urgency and bipartisan cooperation to the \ncause of improving our domestic economy. After all, in the long run it \nis the foundation upon which our national security is built.\n\n  There is precedent for these steps. The President's own father took \nthese steps back in the early 1990s, expanding unemployment eligibility \nby the same number of weeks, including the same mechanism for \ndetermining eligibility. That proposal at that time passed by 94 to 2. \nIt was the right thing to do to get the economy moving in the early \n1990s. It is the right thing today. It received overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport at that time. It will receive, if we can get a vote, \noverwhelming bipartisan support today. It was advocated by the first \nPresident Bush. It is a cause this President Bush should also embrace \nto promote economic growth.\n  I ask we move forward with this initiative and that the President \ndemonstrate he is truly the compassionate conservative that he \ncampaigned to be.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 619, S. 3009, a bill to provide \nfor a 13-week\n\n[[Page S10620]]\n\nextension of unemployment compensation; that the bill be read three \ntimes, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think some people are playing political \ngames. I understand some people are interested in passing a unanimous \nconsent agreement on unemployment compensation. I heard the request. It \nwas to provide a 13-week extension of unemployment compensation. That \nis not what this bill does. I don't know how many times I have to say \nit on the floor. The bill provides for a 26-week extension, not a 13-\nweek, a 26-week extension. There is a big difference.\n  I believe I heard the sponsors say it changes the trigger--it does \nchange the trigger. It is not a clean extension because it changes the \ntrigger so that more States are eligible for long-term extension. This \nbill has a 26-week Federal unemployment compensation extension on top \nof the State 26 weeks, and an additional 7 weeks for those States that \nhave the highest unemployment compensation. That would be a total of 52 \nweeks--59 weeks, in some States; 52 weeks for all States, 59 weeks for \nsome States.\n  It also has a section that says we should not count people who might \nbe employed. It is a crummy bill. I have stated again my willingness to \ntry to work with colleagues to pass a clean extension which would cost \nabout $7 billion instead of $17 billion.\n  While we are here, there are a couple of bills I would like to pass. \nSo I am going to be asking unanimous consent, I tell my colleagues on \nthe Democrat side--it is my intention to propose a couple of unanimous \nconsent requests as well.\n  One will be to permanently eliminate the tax on Social Security. This \nis a tax that passed in 1993. It was part of President Clinton's tax \npackage. It passed by one vote in the Senate, and passed by one vote in \nthe House. It is still the law of the land. We still tax senior \ncitizens' Social Security benefits.\n\n  I have heard a lot of people say they wanted to eliminate it. The \nHouse passed a bill to eliminate it in 2000. Unfortunately, we have not \nbeen able to do that. Senator Tim Hutchinson from Arkansas has \nintroduced legislation this Congress to do that. It has several \ncosponsors.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to notify my friends and colleagues on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle that I intend to propound a unanimous \nconsent request so they have a chance to respond as I have been \nresponding on several requests.\n  I am going to propound a unanimous consent request to make part of \nthe tax bill we passed in 2001 dealing with marriage penalty relief \npermanent. Unfortunately, much of the tax bill that we passed in 2001 \nis temporary. That bill helped lessen the burden, since we found \nourselves in a recession and part of that was marriage penalty relief. \nThat provision sunsets. It stops in the year 2009 or 2010. We should \nmake that permanent. The House has passed legislation, H.R. 4019. They \npassed it with an overwhelming vote, by a vote of 271 to 142. They \npassed it on June 13. Unfortunately, the Senate has not found time to \ntake that legislation up. All we have to do is pass that House bill, it \ngoes straight to the President, and he will sign it so it can become \nlaw. So I am going to propound a unanimous consent request to pass that \nbill.\n  I see my friend, the assistant Democrat leader. I will now make both \nof these requests.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that H.R. 4019, a bill to \nprovide that the marriage penalty relief provisions of the Economic \nGrowth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 shall be made \npermanent, be discharged from the Senate Committee on Finance and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration, the bill be read a third \ntime, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table and any \nstatements thereupon be printed in the Record at the appropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oklahoma retains the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to immediate consideration of Calendar No. 308, H.R. 3529, that \nall after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. 237, a bill \nby Senator Hutchinson, a bill to repeal the 1993 income tax increase on \nSocial Security benefits, be printed in lieu thereof, the bill be read \na third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, any statements thereupon be printed in the Record at the \nappropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection?\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of a number of Senators, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  SEVERAL SENATORS addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend and colleague from Nevada. I told him \nthat two people can play these games. I would very much like to see the \nmarriage penalty relief package that we passed in 2001 be made \npermanent. I would also like to see us repeal that portion at least, if \nnot--I would like to see us, frankly, repeal the entire--President \nClinton's tax package of 1993, but certainly repeal the tax on Social \nSecurity benefits. We tried to do that. Objection was heard.\n\n  The Senate has over and over again found itself, unable in the last \nyear and a half, to pass permanent tax relief for American citizens, \nnot for marriage penalty relief, and not even for seniors who are \npaying high taxes on their Social Security benefits. I find that \nregrettable.\n  Maybe there will be a change in the makeup of the Senate in a couple \nof weeks and legislation such as the two I just requested consent to \npass--maybe we can pass those under regular order. I hope that will be \nthe case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was surprised to get up this morning and \nread the Washington Post and see that the Speaker of the House, Mr. \nHastert, said the House could pass drought relief legislation after the \nelection, `` . . . if there is a problem.''\n  Where has the Speaker been? If there is a problem?\n  Tell that to the farmers of North Dakota. This is a photo of what it \nlooks like in southwestern North Dakota. That is a moonscape. Nothing \nis growing. There is no question, I would say to the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives, about whether or not there is a problem. \nThere is a deep problem. This is a disastrous year.\n  Let me read just one letter from a farmer in North Dakota. He says:\n\n       Dear Senator Conrad:\n       I am a 40 year old man with a wife and 4 children. I am a \n     third generation farmer. We enjoy farming very much but it's \n     getting very hard to keep on going.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       When we have had good crops in the past there was no price. \n     Now in 2002 we have no crop, no grass, no hay, and no rain, \n     which all leads to no money.\n       I know it is hard for city people to understand the \n     difficulties of farming, but it has become very hard to keep \n     a good attitude when you are always under financial pressure. \n     Without any disaster aid this fall, a lot of good farmers \n     will be forced to sell, or will simply just quit.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       I hope and pray that you can persuade the Members of the \n     House how serious it is out here in rural North Dakota.\n\n  I do not know of anything that could tell the story more clearly than \nthis picture. This isn't just a small part of southwestern North \nDakota. This is mile upon mile of southwestern North Dakota. This is a \ndrought as bad or worse than the 1930s.\n  This has to be responded to. For the Speaker to say yesterday that \nthe House could pass drought legislation ``if there's a problem'' \nmisses the point entirely. There is a problem. It is more than a \nproblem. It is a crisis. And it is not just in North Dakota.\n  How can the Speaker of the House have missed this? In Montana, in \nSouth\n\n[[Page S10621]]\n\nDakota, in Nebraska, in Kansas, in Minnesota, in Wyoming, and other \nparts of the country as well, they have suffered different kinds of \ndisasters. My neighboring State of Minnesota has suffered the worst \nflooding in their history--and the administration has said, Well, look \nto the farm bill. Yet the administration knows there are no disaster \nprovisions in the farm bill. They prevented it. The Speaker prevented \nit. I was one of the conferees on the farm bill. When we went to \nconference with the Senate bill that included disaster assistance, the \nHouse conferees said that there were only two things they were not at \nliberty to discuss in the conference. No. 1, they said we can't talk \nabout opening trade with Cuba; and No. 2, we cannot talk about disaster \nassistance. The House conferees told us that those two issues had to go \nto the Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n  The Speaker said no. The President has said no. Always before when \nany part of the country suffered a disaster, we have moved to respond--\nalways. Whether it was earthquakes in California, mud slides in that \nsame State, hurricanes in the State of the occupant of the Chair, \nwhether it was drought in farm country, or flooding any place in the \nNation--always before we have moved to help. This year, there is no \nassistance for those suffering natural disasters. That is wrong.\n  In my State, there is a calamity. It is not just my State. It is \nState after State.\n  For the Speaker to say yesterday that disaster aid may be considered \nlater this fall ``if there's a problem'' shows that he is terribly out \nof touch with what is happening across this great Nation. These are \nnatural disasters that deserve a response and that require a response, \nand we ought to be providing help. For those who say look to the farm \nbill, there is no disaster assistance in the farm bill. In fact, there \nare savings under the farm bill to pay for the disaster assistance.\n  Some may ask, How is that? Very simply, because of these disasters, \nthere is less production. That means prices are higher. That means the \nfarm bill will cost less. The Congressional Budget Office has told me \nand has told all of our colleagues there will be about $6 billion in \nsavings in the farm bill this year because of these natural disasters. \nThat also happens to be the size of the disaster relief package. So we \nhave an opportunity here to be fiscally responsible. We are proposing \nto spend the same amount of money on disaster assistance that is being \nsaved in the farm bill because of these disasters. Because there is \nless production, prices are higher than anticipated. That means the \nfarm bill will cost less by nearly $6 billion. That is money that could \nbe available for disaster assistance and should be.\n\n  Let me conclude with this chart that shows what this is going to \nmean.\n  Net farm income is going to decline this year by 21 percent across \nthe country largely because of these natural disasters. Yet there is no \nresponse from Washington. We passed disaster assistance here in the \nU.S. Senate. We passed it as part of the farm bill. We passed it on an \namendment on the Interior appropriations bill with 79 votes--an \noverwhelming bipartisan agreement that we should provide disaster \nassistance. But the House has said no. The President has said no.\n  To have the Speaker of the House say yesterday that they may consider \naid in a lame duck session ``if there's a problem'' is incredible. \nWhere has the Speaker of the House been to say ``if there's a \nproblem''?\n  This is a disaster. This is a crisis. There ought to be a response.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, everyone knows we are attempting to \nresolve many of the unfinished pieces of legislative business that \nought to be addressed prior to the time we depart for the election day \nbreak. As everyone knows, we will be coming back. It will be my hope \nthat we can address a number of the issues involving conference \nreports. Of course, we will have to address appropriations when we come \nback.\n  One of those issues that has been the subject of a great deal of \ndebate and consideration on the Senate floor has been the issue of \nhomeland security and the creation of the new Department.\n  It is no secret that Democrats have been frustrated in the effort to \nbring the debate to a close. We have had five cloture votes. We have \nnot reached cloture on each of those five occasions because of \nRepublican opposition.\n  My original thought was perhaps that opposition was because of \nlegitimate language concerns or issues involving the creation of the \nDepartment. I now doubt whether that really is the motivation. I think \nthere are many on the Republican side who simply oppose the creation of \nthe Department of Homeland Security. The new Department was a \nDemocratic idea originally. The President and our Republican colleagues \nobjected and opposed it unanimously when we passed it out of committee \nlast summer.\n  The President finally reversed his position, and the administration's \nbill was written by four people with no consultation with Congress. \nThey sent the bill up as somewhat of a surprise to us all.\n  The bill they wrote seeks to exploit the issue of homeland security \nin order to advance a preexisting ideological agenda. It is an \nultraconservative agenda that is antiworker and obviously anti-union. \nMore importantly, it has nothing to do with homeland security.\n  This bill would return us to an era when patronage and political \ncronyism ran the Federal workforce--and that is wrong. We say to the \nPresident and our Republican colleagues, public servants are not the \nproblem. Terrorists are the problem.\n\n  The administration's position is an insult to every public servant, \nevery firefighter, and every first responder who risked their lives \nand, in many cases, gave their lives on September 11.\n  When those union firefighters rushed into the World Trade Center and \nthe Pentagon on that fateful day last September 11, nobody asked: Are \nyou a member of a union? That is why the police and firefighters oppose \nthe Republican plan. That is why the National Association of Police \nOrganizations wrote to every Senator.\n  I will quote from their letter.\n\n       On September 11, 2001, the union affiliations of law \n     enforcement officers did not\n\n[[Page S10622]]\n\n     keep them from responding to that tragic event, giving aid to \n     those in need and in many cases, giving their own lives. \n     Every New York Police Department and New York/New Jersey Port \n     Authority officer who died that day was a union member, \n     working under a collective bargaining agreement. The \n     Administration's claim that the new Department will need \n     ``management flexibility'' to perform its role properly \n     ignores the heroic efforts of those whom they now wish to \n     label as an organizational liability.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                    National Association of Police\n\n\n                                          Organizations, Inc.,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 5, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Association of \n     Police Organizations (NAPO), representing 220,000 rank-and-\n     file police officers from across the United States, I would \n     like to request your support for the collective bargaining \n     and civil service rights of employees of the proposed \n     Homeland Security Department. S. 2452, the ``National \n     Homeland Security and Combating Terrorism Act of 2002,'' \n     rightly recognizes, unlike H.R. 5005, that collective \n     bargaining rights are not a hindrance to the formation of the \n     Homeland Security Department nor to the overall protection of \n     our nation.\n       On September 11, 2001, the union affiliations of law \n     enforcement officers did not keep them from responding to \n     that tragic event, giving aid to those in need and in many \n     cases, giving their own lives. Every NYPD and NY/NJ Port \n     Authority officer who died that day was a union member, \n     working under a collective bargaining agreement. The \n     Administration's claim that the new Department will need \n     ``management flexibility'' to perform its role properly \n     ignores the heroic efforts of those whom they now wish to \n     label as an organizational liability. S. 2452 further allows \n     the Homeland Security Secretary to bring in talent outside of \n     civil service rules when truly necessary for our nation's \n     defense and provides other changes to better facilitate \n     hiring, retention and promotions.\n       Congress has long recognized the benefits of a mutual \n     working relationship between labor and management and, over \n     the years, has extended collective bargaining rights to \n     public employees including letter carriers, postal clerks, \n     public transit employees and congressional employees. When \n     the Senate considers S. 2452 this September, NAPO requests \n     that you support the Senate Homeland Security legislation, \n     specifically Section 187, as passed by the Senate \n     Governmental Affairs Committee. This bill properly recognizes \n     and protects the genuine efforts of those unionized employees \n     who might otherwise lose their deserved civil service and \n     collective bargaining rights.\n       NAPO looks forward to working with the Senate to safeguard \n     these rights and ensure their longevity. If you have any \n     questions, please feel free to contact me, or NAPO's \n     Legislative Assistant, Lucian H. Deaton, at (202) 842-4420.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J. Johnson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Since this debate began, Democrats have worked in good \nfaith for a compromise. We have compromised and compromised and \ncompromised. The bipartisan Nelson-Breaux-Chafee compromise is a long \nway from the Lieberman bill. It preserves the President's authority to \ntake away the union rights of homeland security employees as long as he \nstates there is a need, and it accedes to the President's demand that \nwe waive civil service protections for Department employees.\n  In fact, when it comes to new flexibility to hire, fire, and redeploy \nworkers, there is absolutely no difference between the Gramm amendment \nand the Nelson compromise. The difference with our approach and the \nGramm approach is simple: We require the Department to consult--to \nconsult--with employee representatives as they develop a new personnel \nsystem, and if an agreement between management and employees cannot be \nreached, then management's proposal can be imposed by a Federal panel \ncomprised entirely of the President's appointees.\n  You can't get any more reasonable than that. Yet to prevent a vote on \nthis bipartisan compromise, the Republicans, as I have noted, have \nblocked cloture not once or twice but now on five occasions--three \ntimes on the Lieberman bill and twice on their own bill.\n  They filibustered because they said they wanted an up-or-down vote on \ntheir bill. We offered them that. They filibustered again because they \nsaid the vote on the Gramm bill had to come first.\n  So today we are offering Republicans exactly what they claim they \nwant. If they object again, it will be even more clear what is really \ngoing on.\n  This is a Republican filibuster, plain and simple.\n  Democrats want to finish this bill. We support homeland security. We \nalways have. We introduced it. But the other side would rather have an \nissue. They are filibustering this bill because they want to use this \nissue against Democrats in the next 2 weeks before the elections.\n  They would rather use this as an issue to run scurrilous ads, such as \nthe one they are now running--or were running--to compare a war hero \nsuch as Max Cleland to Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. That is what \nis going on here, and, Mr. President, it is unconscionable. They would \nrather play that nasty brand of politics than pass this bill. I hope \nthey will reconsider and accept this unanimous consent request. \nTherefore, Mr. President, I will now propound it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of \nH.R. 5005, the homeland defense bill, the motion to recommit be \nwithdrawn and the Nelson amendment No. 4740 to the Gramm-Miller \namendment be withdrawn; that there be a 1-hour time limit on the Gramm \namendment, and at the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate \nvote on the Gramm-Miller amendment; that immediately upon the \ndisposition of that amendment, if it is agreed to, Senator Nelson \nof Nebraska be recognized to offer an amendment, the text of which will \nbe identical to amendment No. 4740; that it shall be in order \nnotwithstanding the fact that it is to amended text; that there be a \ntime limitation of 1 hour on his amendment, and that at the conclusion \nor yielding back of the time, the Senate vote on the Nelson amendment, \nwith the preceding all occurring without any further intervening action \nor debate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If you read this unanimous consent request, three things \nstrike you, I think.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, regular order.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to respond to our dear majority \nleader. I am coming to the end of my Senate career, and I do not want \nto end it by getting into fussing and fighting with anybody. Let me \nfirst respond by explaining what is wrong with this unanimous consent \nrequest and why it does not move the ball forward in protecting \nAmericans. I then want to propose several alternatives, any one of \nwhich would move the ball forward. Then I want to respond to some of \nthe comments the majority leader made.\n  First of all, under this unanimous consent request, we do not bring \nhomeland security back up. If you read the unanimous consent request, \nyou see that it says, ``Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nwhen the Senate resumes. . . .''\n  Well, who controls when the Senate resumes consideration of homeland \nsecurity? The majority leader. So this unanimous consent request does \nnot even bring the issue back before the Senate. Everybody knows today \nis the last day of the session.\n  Secondly, what this unanimous consent request says is, we will vote \non Gramm-Miller and, if it is successful, we will turn around and vote \non an amendment that completely reverses Gramm-Miller, and we will do \nthat within an hour. And then the debate is not over. The majority \nleader has the power to continue the debate, stop the debate, or pull \nthe bill down. We are no closer to passage of a bill after these two \nvotes occur than we are before the two votes occur.\n  This unanimous consent request has nothing to do with moving the ball \nforward on homeland security. It has everything to do with deception \nbecause, under this request, there is not even a second vote unless \nGramm-Miller passes. Then, if it passes, we turn right around, within 1 \nhour, and vote to reverse the vote, letting those who are in hotly \ncontested elections have the incredible possibility, in 1 day, within 1 \nhour, to be on three sides of a two-sided issue. It would allow people \nto\n\n[[Page S10623]]\n\nvote for Gramm-Miller and, since it is the President's compromise, with \nthe President, and then turn around, an hour later, and to completely \ngut it and to go back to where we are now with the bill that is before \nthe Senate.\n  So we don't go to it now. We have no control over when or if we ever \ngo to it in this Congress. We can vote yes and no, back to back, within \nan hour, so people can be on both sides of the issue. Senator Daschle \nreferred to Max Cleland. He could vote for Gramm-Miller and turn around \nin an hour and completely gut Gramm-Miller, and be on three sides of a \ntwo-sided issue.\n  Now, there are alternatives that would be acceptable, and I am going \nto propound several of them shortly. But let me first address some of \nthe issues the majority leader addressed.\n  First of all, there is this idea that we don't want a homeland \nsecurity bill. Everybody wants a homeland security bill. I have never \nsuggested the Democrats don't want a homeland security bill. They love \nhomeland security. Their problem is, they love public employee labor \nunions more.\n  Their problem is that this isn't like Iraq. Saddam Hussein has no \npowerful political allies in America. So we had some differences of \nopinion, but we were able to work them out. We were able to go forward \non a bipartisan basis. We can't work this out because the public \nemployee labor unions are the largest contributors to Democrat \ncandidates. And as a result, you can't be for letting the President \nhave the tools he needs on national security and be with the public \nemployee labor unions. We have to choose, and we have been unable to \nmake that choice. There have been some good-faith efforts to bridge the \ngap, but we have been unsuccessful.\n\n  In terms of what has happened, the President sent a bill up on June \n6. The House adopted a bipartisan measure on a huge, bipartisan, \nlopsided vote of 295 to 132. Democrats and Republicans voted together \nto give the President the power he asked for--which is some flexibility \nin 6 out of the 71 titles of the Civil Service Act--to allow him the \nability to put the right person in the right place at the right time.\n  This idea that this would bring back cronyism and discrimination is \ntotally invalid. The Gramm-Miller amendment and the bill adopted in the \nHouse required that the President not act in arbitrary and capricious \nways, not discriminate, and strictly limited his decisions to merit and \nperformance. So that is not really an issue as to what we are talking \nabout.\n  This is the calendar. The calendar points out that the Senate has yet \nto act. Every time we have come close to reaching a bipartisan \nagreement, we basically have run into the hurdle that there is strong \nopposition to those who would like to change the system as it relates \nto homeland security. So we have the incredible specter that we have \ncome to the end of the session. The President over and over again has \ncompromised.\n  The Gramm-Miller amendment, according to Senator Lieberman, contains \n95 percent of the changes he sought in the President's bill. If 95 \npercent is not compromise, what is compromise?\n  Finally, on the point of compromise, to stand up and suggest that the \nNelson amendment and the Gramm-Miller amendment are identical simply \ndoes not bear up under scrutiny. Under the Nelson amendment, the \nPresident would lose national security powers he had on September 11. \nHow many Americans would feel comfortable knowing that the Congress is \ntrying to weaken the President's ability to respond to terrorism in the \nname of homeland security? I think it would come as a shock to most \npeople to realize that is the case. But nobody denies it is the case.\n  In fact, when we offered the Gramm-Miller amendment, I put a little \nprovision at the end of it, sort of as bait, that said: Nothing in this \nbill shall be construed as taking power away from the President to \nprotect America that he had on September 11. So when the Nelson \namendment was offered, guess what the last provision of it was. It \nstruck that language.\n  I don't think anybody is deceived. I don't think they are going to be \ndeceived by a unanimous consent request that does not bring up homeland \nsecurity, that does not move us toward final passage, and that allows \nMembers to vote yes and no on the same day 1 hour apart.\n  There are ways we can move the ball forward. I want to address those.\n  Let me also say, the majority leader brought up Max Cleland. The \nissue here is, are you with the President on homeland security or are \nyou against him? That is what the issue is. The plain truth is, \neverybody knows we are one vote short of passing the homeland security \nbill--one vote short. If we had one more vote, we could pass this bill \nand we could start the process of protecting America. But we do not \nhave that vote.\n  Whose vote is it? Well, it is any one person who is not with the \nPresident's program as he has compromised on it. Senator Miller is with \nit. He is a sponsor of it. He is a lead sponsor of it. The plain truth \nis, we are one vote short.\n  I assure you, if I were running against anybody in America and they \nwere opposed to the President's compromise on homeland security, I \nwould consider it to be a legitimate issue. If that is not a legitimate \nissue, there is not a legitimate issue in America. The fact that we are \nadjourning this Congress instead of staying here today and tomorrow and \nfrom now until we get the job done is totally and absolutely \nirresponsible.\n\n  Having said all that, let me propose some unanimous consent requests \nmyself.\n  First, let me take the Daschle unanimous consent and change it \nslightly. Let's bring the bill up right now. Let's not leave it to the \nmajority leader as to whether it would be brought up. Let's bring it up \nand let's have a vote on the Gramm-Miller amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate resume \nconsideration of H.R. 5005, the homeland defense bill; that the motion \nto recommit be withdrawn, and the Nelson amendment No. 4740 to the \nGramm-Miller amendment be withdrawn; that there be an hour time \nlimitation on the Gramm-Miller amendment; and at the conclusion or \nyielding back of the time, the Senate vote on the Gramm-Miller \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my friend \nfrom Texas, my good friend--and I will miss him a lot next year--\nreminds me of a time when my brother, who is 10 years older than me, \ngot a job. He had this nice, white uniform with a bow tie, working for \nStandard Stations. And it was a big deal for the Reid family. He was \nplaced to work in Ash Fork, AZ, not a great metropolis, but compared to \nwhere I was raised, it was a big city. My brother asked his little \nbrother to spend a week with him in Ash Fork. I had never been \nanyplace, so I looked forward to that.\n  What I didn't know was that my brother had a girlfriend in Ash Fork. \nHe spent most of his time with the girlfriend. I spent most of my time, \nnot with my brother but with his girlfriend's brother.\n  Her brother was a year or so older than I, but we played games. I \nnever beat him in anything, the reason being, he kept changing the \nrules in the middle of the game. So no matter what I did, I couldn't \nwin.\n  That is kind of how I feel about homeland security. No matter what we \ndo, you folks won't take yes for an answer. It is always something \ndifferent. So it reminds me of my experience in Ash Fork.\n  I say to my friend, who has a Ph.D. in economics, is a college \nprofessor, and is very smart, this calendar you have given us is an \nillusion. The numbers you have there are just a fantasy. The fact is, \nwe have tried to do everything we could to pass this. I am happy to \nhear the Senator say he wants to continue working on this. But the \nunanimous consent request he has propounded gives him everything and \ngives us nothing.\n  We have said--in fact, the majority leader said--we agreed to give \nyou what you asked for. We would have a vote on your proposition first, \nvote on that first, and then we would vote on ours second. You say that \nis not good, even though I asked for it earlier. The reason I guess it \nis not good is that we might pass our amendment. And if we do, it \nknocks out a few pages of a 100-page bill.\n  With great respect for my friend from Texas, with whom I have served \nin the House and Senate and will miss next year, without reservation or \nqualification, I object.\n\n[[Page S10624]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I love my colleague from Nevada. He is such \na sweet man. His heart is so good. His views on things sometimes are \nnot so good. But as long as we have people around like him, the place \nworks pretty well.\n  Let me respond to his remarks, and I will try another unanimous \nconsent request on it.\n  What I have propounded is exactly what Senator Miller and the \nPresident and I have asked; that is, to have an up-or-down vote on our \namendment. My colleague from Nevada would like to do it so that people \ncan vote yes and no within an hour and so that people can, in essence, \nbe in a position where they might deceive the public, yet we are no \ncloser to passage than we were before we started. I just don't think \nthat makes any sense. I am not claiming that deception is the intent, \nbut I do believe that would be the result. Let me try another approach.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Nelson amendment be adopted, with \none amendment, and that amendment is that nothing in this bill shall be \nconstrued as taking away a national security power and a power to \nprotect America that the President had on September 11, and that after \nthe Nelson amendment is adopted with this provision added to it, the \nGramm-Miller amendment be in order; that it be debated for 3 hours, and \nthat there be an up-or-down vote on that amendment, and at the \nconclusion of that amendment, whether it is successful or not, we have \na vote on final passage.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that a statement by Mark Hall, a U.S. Border Patrol \nagent, be printed in the Record. It is two and a half pages.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement by Mark Hall, President, AFGE Local 2499, U.S. Border Patrol, \n                             July 31, 2002\n\n       Good Morning. My name is Mark Hall. For the past 18 years I \n     have worked as a U.S. border patrol agent, 15 of them based \n     in Detroit, Michigan. I am also President of AFGE Local 2499. \n     I have dedicated my life to defending the national security \n     of this country and do not understand how my role as union \n     leader is incompatible with my oath to protect and defend the \n     Constitution of the U.S.\n       I believe that the two hats I wear as I patrol the Northern \n     Border of the U.S. are entirely consistent. In fact, if not \n     for the fact that I am a union member, I might not be a \n     border patrol agent today. In the months after the terrorists \n     attacked the World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11 \n     of last year, I became increasingly concerned about the \n     vulnerability of our northern border and our agency's \n     inadequate response to that threat.\n       Despite public assurances from the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service and the Department of Justice that we \n     were responding to this threat, few agents were being posted \n     at our station in Detroit or any other along the Northern \n     Border that I was aware of.\n       I spoke with my local management about the problem and was \n     told, essentially, to keep quiet. Having taken an oath to \n     defend the Constitution--not the INS--I decided it was my \n     responsibility to speak out about the danger we faced along \n     our border with Canada. I, along with another agent and \n     former marine, Bob Lindemann, talked to a newspaper and \n     television program about our concerns. As a result of this \n     decision my sector chief tried to fire us immediately, and \n     failing that, settled on a 90-day suspension, one-year \n     demotion, and reassignment.\n       The Office of Special Counsel which investigated the \n     Agency's action uncovered internal emails from the sector \n     chief stating ``the President of the local union deemed it \n     necessary to independently question our readiness in a public \n     forum'', adding that managers must take a ``stance which \n     bears no tolerance for dissent and to view resistance from \n     the rank and file as insubordinate''.\n       It was only through the combined protections of my union, \n     and the whistleblower protection law that the proposed \n     disciplinary actions were indeed, I would never have spoken \n     out if I hadn't had my union behind me because \n     whistleblower protections alone would not have been \n     enough. I want to take this opportunity to thank my union \n     and the lawmakers responsible for the whistle-blower law \n     for helping me when I needed it. Without such help, I \n     would not be a border patrol agent today.\n       The President uses the words ``national security'' and \n     ``flexibility'' to describe his goals in creating this new \n     agency, but his hard line and his veto threat show it's about \n     something far more serious--politics.\n       No one imposed union representation on agents of the Border \n     Patrol--we voted for that representation democratically. And \n     now the President has decided to override our vote and \n     eliminate our only means of holding the managers and \n     political appointees who run the agency accountable to the \n     American people.\n       Our union is not just about economic issues--Congress sets \n     our pay levels so that they're in line with other law \n     enforcement officers. Our union is also about protecting the \n     chance for the employees to speak out when we see \n     mismanagement, fraud, and security breaches. Our union is \n     part of the system of checks and balances we have in our \n     democracy.\n       The other thing the President is insisting on is the right \n     to do away with fair and open competition among our citizens \n     for the privileged to work for the U.S. government. He wants \n     to take away the laws that give us a civil service system \n     that is outside politics, patronage, and cronyism. He says \n     ``trust me,'' I'll write new rules that will be just as good. \n     But if he gets his way, there'll be no union to speak out \n     when the political good ol' boy system takes the place of \n     these laws.\n       Congress just passed a corporate accountability law because \n     it turned out that when top managers have all the power to do \n     as they please they tend to abuse that power. There was no \n     accountability. Well, in the federal government, and \n     certainly in the border patrol, there is accountability when \n     the workers who lay their lives on the line every day have a \n     union contract backing them up when they question managers \n     who are misappropriating funds, or discriminating in hiring \n     or firing, or failing to put resources where the threats are \n     greatest.\n       The American people better hope that the President is true \n     to his word when he says that he can be trusted to keep \n     objective standards for qualifying for a job as a U.S. Border \n     Patrol agent. If being a union supporter or belonging to the \n     wrong political party disqualify an otherwise fit job \n     candidate, you can be sure that homeland security will \n     suffer.\n       Our union has been accused of standing in the way of \n     homeland security. The President says our contract and the \n     civil service laws tie the hands of managers who may need to \n     reassign agents for special assignments or for emergencies. \n     Nothing could be further from the truth.\n       I have been shot at twice, hit, kicked, spit-on, and bitten \n     in the course of carrying out my duties. I have spent months \n     away from my family on detail--as much a four months in a \n     year away from home. I have received dozens of commendations \n     for outstanding service to the Border Patrol. I joined the \n     union 17 years ago, and there has never been one instance \n     when my union membership caused me to compromise the security \n     of this nation. In fact, our union has helped me and my \n     fellow officers make this nation a better and safer place. I \n     thank you for the opportunity to be here today, and I will be \n     happy to answer any questions.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I could not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I said I have a statement from a Border Patrol agent. It is \na two-and-a-half page letter.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. I will read one short sentence in the letter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request of the Senator from Texas is \npending.\n  Mr. REID. It says:\n\n       The President uses the words ``national security'' and \n     ``flexibility'' to describe the goals in creating this new \n     agency, but his hard line and his veto threat show it's about \n     something far more serious--politics.\n\n  That is what this is about, changing the rules of the game.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me try one more.\n  I ask unanimous consent that H.R. 5005, the homeland defense bill, be \nbrought before the Senate; that each side have three amendments and \nthat they have an opportunity, going back and forth, to offer those \namendments; that the Gramm-Miller amendment be the pending amendment; \nthat when each side has had an opportunity to debate and vote on their \nthree amendments, that there be a vote on final passage of the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, you see, the reason my \nfriend from Texas is wrong about this unanimous consent agreement is we \ndon't need it. If we voted on the two pending amendments, the Gramm \namendment and the one we want to go forward with, the Breaux amendment \nand the Nelson amendment, of course--there is still room for other \namendments. It doesn't cut off debate.\n  If cloture were invoked, there are other germane amendments we would \nhave. This is all part of the illusion being created here. They don't \nwant a bill.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me conclude by simply saying this. What \nnormally happens under these circumstances is this: We are not going to\n\n[[Page S10625]]\n\npass a homeland security bill and Americans are going to the polls; \nthey are basically going to make a decision. They might decide that \nSenator Daschle is right, that the President doesn't care anything \nabout national security, that he is out to bust the unions, and that we \nreally don't need to change business as usual in Washington as it \nrelates to homeland security. I think that is a possibility. People \nmight reach that conclusion.\n  But I think there is an alternative possibility. I think people are \ngoing to reach a conclusion that when it came down to making a hard \ndecision that meant changing business as usual in Washington, that \nrequired us to change a system for national security reasons and the \nprotection of the life and health of our people, that meant going \nagainst the way things have been done here for 50 or 60 years, that the \nDemocrats are unwilling to make that change and the President wanted to \nmake the change.\n  I just remind my colleagues that when Senator Daschle was talking \nabout the President's efforts at union busting, we have had three major \ncommissions that have looked at our current Government system--the \ncivil service system--in areas of national security and terrorism. The \ntwo major ones are the Volcker Commission and the Rudman Commission. \nPaul Volcker was a Democrat-appointed head of the Federal Reserve Bank \nand one of the most respected people in America. Warren Rudman is one \nof our former colleagues and was one of our most respected Republican \nmembers. Both of them headed up blue ribbon commissions to look at our \nability to respond to threats to our national security, and both of \nthose commissions concluded unanimously that we needed to change the \ncurrent civil service system as it related to the ability to promote on \nmerit and the ability to put the right person in the right place at the \nright time. That is what the President has asked for.\n\n  So like so many issues in the greatest democracy in history, this is \none where you have to choose. The President cannot succeed because he \nis one vote short. I don't believe the Democrats could pass their bill \nbecause I think some of their own members would not vote for it on \nfinal passage, and none of our members are going to vote for a bill \nthat the President said he will veto.\n  So we have an impasse, and it comes down to a choice. It is not a \nchoice that Senator Reid is going to make, or one that I am going to \nmake. It is a choice the people back home are going to make. They have \nheard each side with its own focus, twist, spin, or whatever the \nconventional wisdom is. But, ultimately, it is the judgment of the \nAmerican people that we are going to stand by, and I am willing to \nstand by it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nUtah is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10625-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FAREWELL TO A FRIEND\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to honor the achievements of my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Phil Gramm.\n  After serving with him for 18 years, it is difficult to remember that \nour Texas colleague began his career as a Democrat.\n  After listening to him here today, I can see he is ending his career \nby going out with a bang. Phil Gramm is one of the most effective \nSenators who has ever sat in this body. In fact, even though he started \nout as a Democrat, he actually became one of the most effective \nconservatives in this body and a fixture on economic issues and a man \nwho deserves much of the credit for changing the attitude of Congress \nabout budget and fiscal responsibility.\n  I know I am not the only Member of this body who is deeply grateful \nfor the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-control legislation that Senator \nGramm poured his heart into creating and sustaining over so many years.\n  Another landmark bill that bears his name and is changing the course \nof the nation for good is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Services \nModernization Act of 1999.\n  He brought his classroom skills to bear on more than one occasion, \npatiently explaining basic economics to his fellow Senators, again and \nagain and again.\n  I, for one, am grateful for the opportunity to have been one of his \nstudents.\n  Senator Gramm is also one of the Senate's most honest and forthright \nmembers, never hesitant to tell you exactly what he is thinking.\n  On more than one occasion, the senior Senator from Texas has \napproached me about bills on which we disagreed and said, in his \ndistinct drawl, ``Orrin, you were one of the reasons I came to the \nSenate--to help you fight all those ridiculous liberal ideas. So I have \nto ask, what are you doing with this bill?''\n  And we all came to respect Senator Gramm when he joined the GOP \nranks.\n  The story is now legend, but compelling nonetheless.\n  He was serving in the other body when he decided he no longer felt \ncomfortable as a Democrat.\n  Instead of simply announcing he was switching parties, he resigned \nhis seat in 1983 and ran again in a special election as a Republican. \nHe has served here ever since with, I think, the respect of both sides \nof the aisle.\n  He thus eliminated any question that his decision was motivated by \nanything other than a realization that his beliefs no longer fit within \nthe Democratic Party.\n  Senator Gramm's dedication to the principles of a free society, his \nbelief that free markets and limited government allow people to realize \ntheir full potential, his reminders that good intentions are no \nsubstitute for good policy--these have shown through in ample body of \nSenate achievement he will leave behind.\n  Senator Phil Gramm's career is proof that good ideas can have a real \nimpact on our country, as long as those ideas are combined with a \nmountain of hard work.\n  Mr. President, I am sad to see my good friend leaving this body.\n  I wish we could convince my friend to stay.\n  I personally am going to miss him. I can only wish him the very best \nas he begins his new life outside of Senate. I am sure of one thing: \nwherever Phil Gramm goes or whatever he does, he is going to be a \nsuccess. Phil Gramm is one of the brightest people who ever served in \nboth Houses of Congress, and he is certainly one of the best people, as \nfar as I am concerned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10625-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10625-S10628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to change the subject because I \nthink it is important before we leave this Congress that I say a few \nwords. We have all seen the news reports suggesting our friends on the \nother side of the aisle want desperately to turn the focus of the \nnational debate back to the economy. I am glad to do so, but let it be \na full and fair debate. I hope we can talk about the recession we have \nbeen through, the recovery that is now under way, what we have already \ndone to grow the economy and, most importantly, what we Members of the \nSenate from both political parties propose to do about the economy in \nthe future.\n  Let us start by considering the shocks that have hit the economy \nsince the last year of the Clinton Presidency.\n  In the summer and fall of 2000, the dot-com bubble burst and high-\ntech spending fell precipitously, triggering a slowdown that was \nworsened by the horrendous terrorist attacks that shook our entire \neconomy last year on September 11 and afterwards.\n  Then about a year ago this week, we began discovering a few large \ncompanies have been massively deceiving their investors, deepening the \nmalaise.\n  Finally, to top off all this bad news, oil prices have hovered around \nthe danger level of $30 a barrel because of war clouds in the Middle \nEast.\n  This chart shows that how our slump began during the summer of 2000. \nWhile it would not be fair to blame all these problems entirely on the \nClinton administration, in my view, it is clear that the beginnings of \nthis slowdown--what some have called the ``Clinton hangover''--occurred \nwell before President Clinton took the oath of office.\n  This is not just a partisan position or partisan judgment.\n  As President Clinton's top economic adviser, Nobel Laureate Joe \nStiglitz, recently said:\n\n\n[[Page S10626]]\n\n\n       The economy was slipping into recession even before Bush \n     took office, and the corporate scandals that are rocking \n     America began much earlier.\n\n  That is what happened in the year 2000 right on up to our time today. \nOne can see the red mark shows it began during the Clinton \nadministration and continued for the first year of the Bush \nadministration.\n  While these problems did not begin on President Bush's watch, we are \ncommitted to working with the President to solve our economy's current \nproblems.\n  In of all the blows our economy suffered, consumer spending held up \nvery well. New car and new home sales have stayed at record levels over \nthe last year, and while times have been tough for some retailers, \noverall consumer spending has kept right on growing. Why? Because of \nlast year's tax cuts.\n  Which part of the tax cuts helped the most? Was it the rate cuts or \nrebate checks that kept spending growing steadily? Let's think about \nthat for a moment. Was it the rate cuts or was it the rebate checks? \nSome Democrats complained that last year's tax cut did not have enough \nrebates; it did not have enough immediate stimulus, they said.\n  Guess what? The numbers are in, and it turned out while rebate checks \nsure help families sleep better at night, they do not stimulate much \nspending. When the manna falls from Heaven, they do not just eat it, \nthey store as much of it as they can. So when the rebates came, people \ndid not spend most of the checks; only about a third of it. They saved \nmost of the money, or they used it to pay down their debt.\n  Those are good things to do, but I do not think we should be under \nany illusions that most of these rebate checks are spent at the local \nWal-Mart.\n  By contrast, the permanent rate cuts let people know the Government \nwas going to let them keep more of their own money, not just this year, \nbut for years to come. When people know their take-home pay is going up \nand that it is going to stay up, they feel more comfortable about \nspending today, tomorrow, and into the future.\n  The lesson is clear: Tax rebates help spending a little bit, for a \nmonth or two, but a permanent income tax cut gives people a green light \nto spend because it helps them over a long term. A permanent income tax \ncut may not be glamorous, but it does work, and if we want to speed up \nconsumer spending, the most effective way to do it is by speeding up \nthe tax cuts.\n  Even though consumer spending has held up, there are just not nearly \nenough good-paying jobs out there right now, and we all know it. I am \nseeing this in Utah where our State's economy has been hit harder than \nmost by the current downturn.\n  In fact, just today, Delta Airlines, which has a hub in Salt Lake \nCity, announced thousands of layoffs. My heart goes out to these \nfamilies impacted by these layoffs.\n  Utah has a highly educated work force, and we have more high-tech and \nmore tourism jobs than most States do. We saw Utah's unemployment rate \nrise from about 3 percent to almost 6 percent before coming back down \ntoward 5 percent, a number that is still far too high. The way to bring \nback these lost jobs is to bring back investment spending.\n  Businesses just have not been buying as much equipment as they used \nto, especially high-tech equipment. Investment spending started falling \nback in 2000, and while it has been recovering over the last few \nmonths, it is nowhere near the levels of 1999.\n\n  Early this year, Congress saw that business spending had nosedived, \nand we took action. We enacted a temporary bonus depreciation provision \ngiving companies a tax incentive to buy equipment sooner rather than \nlater. This powerful tax incentive is based on legislation that I \nchampioned.\n  Unfortunately, large corporate bureaucracies cannot turn on a dime, \nand many businesses had already worked out their spending plans before \nwe managed to pass bonus depreciation, but it will help in the future.\n  Since many companies only plan their equipment budgets once a year, \nwe can expect to see business purchases come back up early next year, \nand that will be, in part, because of this provision. With that \nrevival, the weakest pillar of spending will be strengthened.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle have proposed speeding up and \nincreasing the amount of bonus depreciation, and I think that is a \ngreat proposal. In fact, my original bonus depreciation proposal looks \nquite a lot like some of the Democratic depreciation proposals being \ndiscussed.\n  In another major economic accomplishment this year, Congress joined \nwith the President to enact two more pieces of strong pro-growth \nlegislation: trade promotion authority and corporate accountability \nlegislation.\n  I worked together with Members of both Houses and both parties on the \nconference report because, as chairman of the Trade Subcommittee of the \nFinance Committee, I served on the conference for this bill. This \nreport gave the President the much-needed authority to negotiate free \ntrade agreements.\n  As the President finalizes free trade agreements, first with Chile \nand Singapore, and then expanding across the world, we are going to \nreap real benefits from trade promotion authority. I can remember all \nof the fighting on the floor over whether we were going to do that or \nnot. We know we should have done it, and we finally did.\n  The American people will benefit from lower prices for Americans \nbuying goods, services, and machinery; wider overseas markets for farm \nproducts, high-tech equipment and services; and higher wages for \nAmerican workers, especially for workers in exporting industries.\n  The corporate accountability bill passed this year is also going to \nhelp make sure stockholders are in charge of the corporation, not \ninsiders with something to hide. It is going to make sure auditors \nserve the interests of the shareholders. But as I predicted on the \nSenate floor back in July, we now find ourselves locked in a fruitless \ndebate, indeed a dangerous debate, over who can be the toughest on the \npublic accounting profession.\n  Republicans have an agenda for economic recovery and economic \nsecurity. We know what we want. We can pass this agenda this week if we \ncan get the majority to agree.\n  I have already mentioned last year's tax rate cuts. Speeding up the \ndate the remaining tax cuts take effect and making them permanent will \nhave a powerful impact for good on the economy.\n  We also want terrorism insurance to create good-paying construction \njobs.\n  Terrorism insurance has been delayed by the trial lawyer lobby, which \ninsists on being able to sue businesses who are the victims of \nterrorism. I suspect that in the end they are probably going to win, \neven though that is a disastrous way of continuing to do business. As a \nresult, we are going to find people who are totally innocent sued for \npunitive damages in the future.\n  We want an energy bill that will reduce our dependence on foreign \noil, push gas prices down, and encourage conservation, all at the same \ntime.\n  I joined with a number of my colleagues to sponsor a landmark \nprovision, the CLEAR Act, in the energy bill that would change the \ntransportation vehicle marketplace by giving tax incentives to cleaner-\nrunning alternative fuel and hybrid electric cars and trucks.\n  Unfortunately, the energy bill is stuck in conference, partly because \nsome conferees apparently will not accept an extra 10 million acres of \npermanent Alaska wilderness in exchange for oil exploration that would \nleave a footprint no larger than Dulles International Airport. That 10 \nmillion acres would become wilderness. It is clear that they are not \nreally serious about having a good energy bill or reducing our \ndependence on Middle Eastern oil. If these decisions were motivated by \nlove for the environment rather than by ideology, we would already have \nan energy bill and Alaska would have 10 million more acres of permanent \nwilderness.\n  There are other good economic proposals that can and should be \ndiscussed in the coming months, proposals that could strengthen our \neconomy now and restore to us another decade of exceptional growth.\n  I am convinced that ending the double taxation of dividends should be \nan important part of any such plan. Our Tax Code rewards corporations \nfor loading up on debt, and it slows our Nation's rate of capital \nformation and innovation. I think this has to end.\n  I will now take a moment to address one of the most puzzling charges \nmade\n\n[[Page S10627]]\n\nagainst our President's economic policies. Some of our Democratic \ncolleagues have claimed that last year's tax cut brought back the \ndeficit and destroyed the projected 10-year surplus. Since fiscal year \n2002 is over, we now have a pretty clear explanation of why we ran a \ndeficit. The Congressional Budget Office is clear on this issue. We had \na slowdown that began during the Clinton administration, and continued \nduring the first year of the Bush administration. That hurt income tax \nrevenues, while a stock slump hurt capital gains revenues.\n  Let's look at this. How did CBO's fiscal year 2002 $313 billion \nsurplus forecast become a $157 billion deficit? It was not the tax \ncuts. Look at this particular illustration. As we can see, the \nweakening economy caused 67 percent of the problem.\n  New discretionary spending is $50 billion. That is 11 percent. The \neconomic stimulus is $51 billion. That is 11 percent. The tax relief is \n$37 billion, or only 8 percent of this total pie that has literally \neaten up the $313 billion forecast which has now become a $157 billion \ndeficit.\n  A lot of it has come from our spending in the Congress. In some \nrespects, we are spending like drunken sailors. The fact of the matter \nis that the smallest part of it, other than the ``other,'' is the tax \nrelief, which cost us $37 billion of the $313 billion.\n  Last year's recession was real, and our slow recovery is leaving \nbehind pockets of real suffering both in my home State of Utah and \nacross the Nation.\n\n  Without minimizing this suffering, let us put this in perspective by \nremembering just how bad recessions really have been in the past, as \nillustrated by this chart.\n  In January of 1980, when we had a recession, the average unemployment \nrate during and after the recession was 7.4 percent. In the next \nrecession, starting in July of 1981, it averaged 9.4 percent. In July \nof 1990, we had the beginning of another recession and unemployment \naveraged 6.8 percent. Since our most recent recession, beginning in \nMarch of 2001, unemployment has averaged 5.3 percent. It is 5.6 percent \ntoday, which is considerably less than these other recessive periods of \ntime.\n  These are 2-year averages of civilian unemployment rates beginning \nwith the first month of recession. The source of this information is \nthe National Bureau of Economic Research and the Federal Reserve Bank \nof St. Louis. It has been a lower recession unemployment rate--and when \nI used to be chairman of the Labor Committee, we saw figures that said \nif the unemployment rate is around 5 percent, there is basically full \nemployment in the country.\n  Now I am not saying 5.3 percent unemployment rate is full employment. \nIt is not good enough for me, but the fact is it is less than the other \nrecessive periods over the last 20 years, and that is a very important \nthing.\n  As my friends on the other side of the aisle like to remind us, the \nsearch for jobs is where people really feel the bite of a sluggish \neconomy. How does the old saying go? ``If your neighbor loses a job, it \nis a recession. But if you lose your job, it is a depression.''\n  So I think we should compare the unemployment rates during and after \nthe last three recessions with the unemployment rate since March of \n2001, when the most recent recession began.\n  It comes as no secret that the job market often gets worse even after \nthe economy starts growing again. Unfortunately, businesses want to be \nsure that their sector of the economy is going to keep growing before \nthey take on more workers, and I cannot blame them for that.\n  A glance at this chart makes it clear that while our unemployment \nrate has been far too high, nowhere near the lows of 4 percent that we \nsaw a few years ago, we have done better than we could have hoped.\n  I have not seen many of my colleagues making serious comparisons \nbetween this recession and previous recessions, and we can see why from \nthis particular chart. There is just no comparison.\n  During the back-to-back recessions of the early 1990s, when the \nFederal Reserve finally broke the back of inflation, unemployment rates \nhovered near 10 percent. During our last recession 10 years ago, we \nsuffered from jobless rates much higher than anything we have seen \ntoday.\n  Today's weak job market is real. It means Americans suffer through no \ncause of their own, and it is something we need to work together to \nfix. While we work to fix these problems, let us remember in our own \nlifetimes we have seen the face of deep recession.\n  While there are regions of the country that face steep hurdles and \ndevastated job markets, the Nation as a whole is seeing a recovery. For \nthat, our Nation can be grateful.\n  Our President's policies, the Federal Reserve's aggressive, \npreemptive rate cutting, combined with the flexibility of our free \nmarket system, keep unemployment rates much lower than in past \nrecessions.\n\n  By enacting more job-creating, growth-enhancing initiatives, we can \ndo even better. Accelerated tax cuts, terrorism insurance, and an \nenergy bill should all be part of our recovery agenda. We can do these \nthis year, even though this is our last real day of this session. We \nstill can get this done, since we all know we are coming back for a \npartial lame duck session.\n  We do not need another economic forum. What we need is legislative \naction. It is pretty pitiful that the Senate has not enacted one non-\ndefense appropriations bill--not one. For the first time in over 20 \nyears, we do not have a budget.\n  I will tell my colleagues the reason we do not have a budget. In the \npast, I can remember when we on this side were in the majority and had \nto come up with a budget, and it was really tough to do because we knew \nwe would be subject to all kinds of cheap criticisms from others who \nwanted to score political points. But we always came up with that \nbudget, and we endured the cheap political criticisms.\n  I have to say I think part of the reason we do not have a budget \ntoday is that the other side is afraid we might use the same type of \ncheap criticisms on them that were used on us for all of these years. I \nhope we will not do that. I hope what we will do is work together in \nthe best interest of our country.\n  I am sure there are good ideas on both sides, and I hope we can work \ntogether to bring in all the good ideas we can find. The strength of \nour democracy, as the strength of our businesses and our families, \ncomes from our willingness to listen to each other. After we listen and \nnegotiate a compromise, we need to take action--action to restore the \neconomy to its potential, action to restore a healthy job market, \naction to ensure that our workers are the most productive and best paid \nin the world. It is time for us to live up to our duties. The American \npeople are waiting for action. I think we still have enough time, even \nthough it may have to be during a lame duck session, to be able to get \nthis done.\n\n  One last thing. I, for one, am very disappointed that we were unable \nto get a prescription drug benefit bill passed. Everybody knew the \ntripartisan bill would have swooshed through the Senate Finance \nCommittee. We were foreclosed from allowing that bill to come through \nthe normal legislative process because it was known that it would have \nswooshed through and it would become the bill of merit on the floor and \nit would have passed the Senate.\n  That bill had $70 billion more in it, in the final analysis, than \nwhat those on the other side asked for last year.\n  Instead, we had a bill which was brought up pursuant to rule 14, \nwhich is a procedural mechanism on the floor which allows you to call \nup a bill once and, if it is objected to, then it goes on the calendar \nand on the agenda of the U.S. Senate.\n  We had a bill called up that would have been probably twice as \nexpensive as this $370 billion bill we had. It would have passed--our \nbill would have passed. The competing proposal was twice as expensive \nand never once had the final CBO scoring necessary for a bill of that \nmagnitude on the floor of the Senate. It was pulled down because it \nclearly did not have the votes, where we did.\n  We could have had the prescription drug benefit package for our \nseniors in this society, had it not been for politics. I, for one, \nlament that. We could have had it. We had Democrats, Republicans, and \nan Independent in support of that bill.\n  Would everybody have been pleased with that bill? No, but it would \nhave\n\n[[Page S10628]]\n\npassed and would have passed overwhelmingly. Now we do not have a \nprescription drug bill for senior citizens, all because of the way this \nfloor has been managed over the last year or so.\n  I have to tell you I think it is going to be virtually impossible to \npass it next year, especially if we are in a conflict with Iraq. That \nwill have to take precedence and the spending for that will have to \ntake precedence. Everybody knows that. Everybody knew those were the \nfacts. This was the year to get that job done, and we had it done. I \nbelieve we could have gotten it through the House.\n  As somebody who has been on the passing end of a lot of legislation \nover the last 26 years, I think I can speak with authority. We could \nhave gotten it through the House as well, and it would be law today.\n  So I, for one, think we have lost a tremendous opportunity, mainly \nbecause of politics and the hoped-for advantage that one side might \nhave had over the other. Our side would have supported the tripartisan \nbill, and I think a considerable number of Democrats would have, too. \nBut we don't control the floor and we were not able to get that bill \nup. I am disappointed because I think we should have done that.\n  There are a lot of other things I wish we could have done during this \nyear. Had we had a budget, we might have been able to. Had we had \nappropriations bills, we might have been able to. I just wish all our \ncolleagues well. At the end of this session I have good will towards \nevery person in this Chamber. I care for every Member of this body, and \nI will tell the public at large that most everybody in the Congress I \nknow happens to be a good person who is trying to do the job to the \nbest of their ability.\n  But occasionally politics gets in the way and we do not get things \ndone that should be done. This year has been a prime example of that, \nin my humble opinion.\n  But I wish everybody well. With that, I yield the floor and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper).

Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the Senate \na message from the House of Representatives on S. 2690, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate a message from the House \nof Representatives:\n\n                                S. 2690\n\nStrike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On November 11, 1620, prior to embarking for the shores \n     of America, the Pilgrims signed the Mayflower Compact that \n     declared: ``Having undertaken, for the Glory of God and the \n     advancement of the Christian Faith and honor of our King and \n     country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern \n     parts of Virginia,''.\n       (2) On July 4, 1776, America's Founding Fathers, after \n     appealing to the ``Laws of Nature, and of Nature's God'' to \n     justify their separation from Great Britain, then declared: \n     ``We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness''.\n       (3) In 1781, Thomas Jefferson, the author of the \n     Declaration of Independence and later the Nation's third \n     President, in his work titled ``Notes on the State of \n     Virginia'' wrote: ``God who gave us life gave us liberty. And \n     can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have \n     removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of \n     the people that these liberties are of the Gift of God. That \n     they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed, I \n     tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just; that \n     his justice cannot sleep forever.''.\n       (4) On May 14, 1787, George Washington, as President of the \n     Constitutional Convention, rose to admonish and exhort the \n     delegates and declared: ``If to please the people we offer \n     what we ourselves disapprove, how can we afterward defend our \n     work? Let us raise a standard to which the wise and the \n     honest can repair; the event is in the hand of God!''.\n       (5) On July 21, 1789, on the same day that it approved the \n     Establishment Clause concerning religion, the First Congress \n     of the United States also passed the Northwest Ordinance, \n     providing for a territorial government for lands northwest of \n     the Ohio River, which declared: ``Religion, morality, and \n     knowledge, being necessary to good government and the \n     happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education \n     shall forever be encouraged.''.\n       (6) On September 25, 1789, the First Congress unanimously \n     approved a resolution calling on President George Washington \n     to proclaim a National Day of Thanksgiving for the people of \n     the United States by declaring, ``a day of public \n     thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging, \n     with grateful hearts, the many signal favors of Almighty God, \n     especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to \n     establish a constitution of government for their safety and \n     happiness.''.\n       (7) On November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln \n     delivered his Gettysburg Address on the site of the battle \n     and declared: ``It is rather for us to be here dedicated to \n     the great task remaining before us--that from these honored \n     dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they \n     gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly \n     resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--that \n     this Nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--\n     and that Government of the people, by the people, for the \n     people, shall not perish from the earth.''.\n       (8) On April 28, 1952, in the decision of the Supreme Court \n     of the United States in Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306 \n     (1952), in which school children were allowed to be excused \n     from public schools for religious observances and education, \n     Justice William O. Douglas, in writing for the Court stated: \n     ``The First Amendment, however, does not say that in every \n     and all respects there shall be a separation of Church and \n     State. Rather, it studiously defines the manner, the specific \n     ways, in which there shall be no concern or union or \n     dependency one on the other. That is the common sense of the \n     matter. Otherwise the State and religion would be aliens to \n     each other--hostile, suspicious, and even unfriendly. \n     Churches could not be required to pay even property taxes. \n     Municipalities would not be permitted to render police or \n     fire protection to religious groups. Policemen who helped \n     parishioners into their places of worship would violate the \n     Constitution. Prayers in our legislative halls; the appeals \n     to the Almighty in the messages of the Chief Executive; the \n     proclamations making Thanksgiving Day a holiday; `so help me \n     God' in our courtroom oaths--these and all other references \n     to the Almighty that run through our laws, our public \n     rituals, our ceremonies would be flouting the First \n     Amendment. A fastidious atheist or agnostic could even object \n     to the supplication with which the Court opens each session: \n     `God save the United States and this Honorable Court.' ''.\n       (9) On June 15, 1954, Congress passed and President \n     Eisenhower signed into law a statute that was clearly \n     consistent with the text and intent of the Constitution of \n     the United States, that amended the Pledge of Allegiance to \n     read: ``I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States \n     of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one \n     Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for \n     all.'';\n       (10) On July 20, 1956, Congress proclaimed that the \n     national motto of the United States is ``In God We Trust'', \n     and that motto is inscribed above the main door of the \n     Senate, behind the Chair of the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and on the currency of the United States.\n       (11) On June 17, 1963, in the decision of the Supreme Court \n     of the United States in Abington School District v. Schempp, \n     374 U.S. 203 (1963), in which compulsory school prayer was \n     held unconstitutional, Justices Goldberg and Harlan, \n     concurring in the decision, stated: ``But untutored devotion \n     to the concept of neutrality can lead to invocation or \n     approval of results which partake not simply of that \n     noninterference and noninvolvement with the religious which \n     the Constitution commands, but of a brooding and pervasive \n     devotion to the secular and a passive, or even active, \n     hostility to the religious. Such results are not only not \n     compelled by the Constitution, but, it seems to me, are \n     prohibited by it. Neither government nor this Court can or \n     should ignore the significance of the fact that a vast \n     portion of our people believe in and worship God and that \n     many of our legal, political, and personal values derive \n     historically from religious teachings. Government must \n     inevitably take cognizance of the existence of religion and, \n     indeed, under certain circumstances the First Amendment may \n     require that it do so.''.\n       (12) On March 5, 1984, in the decision of the Supreme Court \n     of the United States in Lynch v. Donelly, 465 U.S. 668 \n     (1984), in which a city government's display of a nativity \n     scene was held to be constitutional, Chief Justice Burger, \n     writing for the Court, stated: ``There is an unbroken history \n     of official acknowledgment by all three branches of \n     government of the role of religion in American life from at \n     least 1789 . . . [E]xamples of reference to our religious \n     heritage are found in the statutorily prescribed national \n     motto `In God We Trust' (36 U.S.C. 186), which Congress and \n     the President mandated for our currency, see (31 U.S.C. \n     5112(d)(1) (1982 ed.)), and in the language `One Nation under \n     God', as part of the Pledge of Allegiance to the American \n     flag. That pledge is recited by many thousands of public \n     school children--and adults--every year . . . Art galleries \n     supported by public revenues display religious paintings of \n     the 15th and 16th centuries, predominantly inspired by one \n     religious faith. The National Gallery in Washington, \n     maintained with Government support, for example, has long \n     exhibited masterpieces with religious messages, notably the \n     Last Supper, and paintings depicting the Birth of Christ, the \n     Crucifixion, and the Resurrection, among many others with \n     explicit Christian themes and\n\n[[Page S10629]]\n\n     messages. The very chamber in which oral arguments on this \n     case were heard is decorated with a notable and permanent--\n     not seasonal--symbol of religion: Moses with the Ten \n     Commandments. Congress has long provided chapels in the \n     Capitol for religious worship and meditation.''.\n       (13) On June 4, 1985, in the decision of the Supreme Court \n     of the United States in Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38 \n     (1985), in which a mandatory moment of silence to be used for \n     meditation or voluntary prayer was held unconstitutional, \n     Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment and addressing \n     the contention that the Court's holding would render the \n     Pledge of Allegiance unconstitutional because Congress \n     amended it in 1954 to add the words ``under God,'' stated \n     ``In my view, the words `under God' in the Pledge, as \n     codified at (36 U.S.C. 172), serve as an acknowledgment of \n     religion with `the legitimate secular purposes of solemnizing \n     public occasions, [and] expressing confidence in the future.' \n     ''.\n       (14) On November 20, 1992, the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the 7th Circuit, in Sherman v. Community \n     Consolidated School District 21, 980 F.2d 437 (7th Cir. \n     1992), held that a school district's policy for voluntary \n     recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance including the words \n     ``under God'' was constitutional.\n       (15) The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals erroneously held, in \n     Newdow v. U.S. Congress, (9th Cir. June 26, 2002) that the \n     Pledge of Allegiance's use of the express religious reference \n     ``under God'' violates the First Amendment to the \n     Constitution, and that, therefore, a school district's policy \n     and practice of teacher-led voluntary recitations of the \n     Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional.\n       (16) The erroneous rationale of the 9th Circuit Court of \n     Appeals in Newdow would lead to the absurd result that the \n     Constitution's use of the express religious reference ``Year \n     of our Lord'' in Article VII violates the First Amendment to \n     the Constitution, and that, therefore, a school district's \n     policy and practice of teacher-led voluntary recitations of \n     the Constitution itself would be unconstitutional.\n\n     SEC. 2. ONE NATION UNDER GOD.\n\n       (a) Reaffirmation.--Section 4 of title 4, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 4.

Mr. President, at the same time President Bush is telling \nus that because of severe budget constraints there is no money for \nimportant programs, he, Vice President Cheney, and other members of the \nadministration are spending taxpayer dollars to jet around the country \nfor political fundraisers and campaign events.\n  Many people wonder why President Bush is traveling around the country \nso much for political reasons, to give political speeches regarding \npolitical candidates, when our Nation is at war on terrorism and we are \nfacing what he called an imminent and serious threat to our national \nsecurity posed by Iraq.\n  Many people believe it is improper for President Bush to be racing \nfrom one campaign event to another--raising record amounts of campaign \ncash for Republican candidates--instead of spending time solving \nAmerica's severe economic problems. I agree with them.\n  I, too, wish the President would focus on the issues that we in \nNevada--and I believe all Americans--are concerned about, such as jobs, \nSocial Security, pension protection, corporate scandals, stock market \ndeclines, high cost of health care, access to affordable quality \neducation, and other priorities.\n  I understand that President Bush has a role. He is not only the \nCommander in Chief, but also the Republican Party's cheerleader in \nchief. I understand and accept that. What I don't accept is this \nconstant campaigning being paid for by taxpayers. If he decides to \ncampaign 100 percent of the time for Republican House and Senate \ncandidates, or gubernatorial candidates, whatever he chooses, that is \nhis business. But it should not be at the expense of taxpayers in \nNevada and in other places. That is what it is. Flying this corporate \nentourage around is very expensive, whether it is the President or Vice \nPresident. Flying that big jet--I am glad the President has it, and I \nwas here when we paid for it for President Reagan. It is important they \nhave that airplane, but it should be for the business of the people, \nnot for the business of the Republican Party or the Democratic Party.\n  I wrote to Mitch Daniels and said I want to know how much this costs. \nOf course, I received no answer. I guess the letter is in the mail. It \nhas been weeks. So I have asked the General Accounting Office to find \nout. The Vice President met with them during the establishment of a so-\ncalled national energy policy, and they even took the GAO to court so \nthey would not have to disclose who they met with, when, or what they \ntalked about. The courts will decide that. We are going to find out how \nmuch this cost. It should not be paid for by taxpayers. It should be \npaid for by the Republican National Committee, or whatever Republican \narm they believe should pay for it.\n  If we have a Democratic President, the same thing should apply. But \nthis has to stop. People have a right, if they are President, to make \ncampaign speeches, but they should be paid for by their political \nparties, political fundraisers; but the President seems to be devoting \nan excessive amount of time on these activities. He has scheduled the \nlast 14 consecutive days for campaign travels, every day from next \nMonday to the election on Tuesday. The taxpayers are paying for that. \nThat is wrong. They have a little program where they have incidental \nexpenses paid for by the local people--maybe extra police or \nsomething. But that won't do the trick. That is not right, fair, or \nequitable.\n\n  I think that rather than spending--this is my personal opinion--14 \ndays on the campaign trail, he should be spending 14 days trying to do \nsomething about this economy, which is stumbling, staggering, \nfaltering. That is what he should be doing. Given the amount of staff \nand transportation resources required for Presidential travel, the \nPresident's fundraising trips are costing the taxpayers not a few \nhundred dollars or a few thousand dollars but millions of dollars.\n  Why should the taxpayers foot the bill for that? They should not. The \nscheduling of these trips is largely driven by the administration's \npolitical agenda of electing more Republicans. Mr. President, I repeat: \nIf he wants to spend 24 hours a day campaigning, he is the President \nand he can do that. I think it is wrong, but he has that right. It \nshould not be paid for by taxpayers.\n  President Bush pledged that his administration would do business \ndifferently, that there would be a new atmosphere in Washington. I \nwould think that spending taxpayer money on political campaigning and \nfundraising is the type of frivolous spending he vowed to curb. \nAccording to newspaper articles and TV reports, the President has \ntraveled more to political fundraisers than any past President.\n  On September 26, almost 3 weeks ago, I sent a letter to Mitch \nDaniels. No answer. I have asked the GAO to investigate the President's \ncampaign travel, including the expenses charged to the taxpayers. The \nPresident said he wanted to change the atmosphere in Washington. The \nAmerican people took him at his word. They didn't realize it would \nchange for the worse. This is an example. I think it is wrong.\n\n[[Page S10630]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand both leaders are now talking \nabout doing some important nominations, and some of us are here to make \nsure that those happen. I will cease and desist from speaking as soon \nas the leaders return and wish to conduct the business of the Senate. \nIn the meantime, I thought it would be interesting to sum up where we \nare and try to focus some attention on this economy.\n  Today, the Senate did take a first step in addressing the economy, \nand that is by trying to restore some discipline to our budgetary \nprocess. Sadly, we had a holdup from the Republican side which delayed \nus. As a matter of fact, the way we resolved it, as I understand it, is \nwe did not extend these very important budget rules for a year. We just \ndid it until April. They have been extended until April, but at least \nwe have some fiscal discipline until April 15.\n  It amazes me that our friends on the other side of the aisle talk \nabout how conservative they are. They are certainly not very \nconservative when it comes to balancing our budget and having some \nfiscal discipline. What we were able to do today was to at least reach \nan agreement until April 15 that we will have a 60-vote requirement in \norder to waive the points of order in the Senate if somebody wants to \ndip into the Social Security trust fund, tries to increase spending or \nincrease tax cuts, and completely abandon the kind of fiscal discipline \nwe need. So we have kept that 60-vote requirement so we cannot \ncompletely destroy the budget, which is what has been happening.\n  As everyone in America knows, we went from a period of fiscal health \nunder President Clinton to a position now where we are deep in debt. If \nwe do not put some discipline back into our budget, it is only going to \nget worse.\n  We also have retained, at least until April, a pay-as-you-go point of \norder so that if, in fact, spending is increased in any way or the \ndeficit goes up in any way, it can be offset, and that is very \nimportant.\n  Pay-as-you-go is something I have been working on since my days in \nthe House of Representatives, and it makes a lot of sense. Most of our \nfamilies have to do that. If they decide, for example, that they want \nto send their son or daughter to an expensive college, they have to \nfind extra money, they have to figure out how they are going to pay for \nit. All of America does it. We ought to do it here. At least we were \nable to get that done through April 15.\n  I want to read what Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Chairman, has \nsaid about the importance of putting this discipline back into our \nbudget process. First, I have to compliment Senator Conrad, who is the \nchairman of our Budget Committee, for leading us so well, for fighting \nthis battle and for not giving up. It would have been very easy for him \nto say, ``forget about it,'' and relent. People want to go home, they \nwant to campaign, they want to see their constituents in California, as \nI want to, or the Dakotas, where Senator Conrad's people are.\n  The bottom line is, we said we would stay until we got this done, and \nat least we got the Republicans to agree to do this through April.\n  This is what Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said about the \nimportant rules we passed today:\n\n       The budget enforcement rules are set to expire on September \n     30. Failing to preserve them would be a grave mistake . . . \n     if we do not preserve the budget rules and reaffirm our \n     commitment to fiscal responsibility, years of hard effort \n     could be squandered.\n\n  It is incredible to me that with that kind of endorsement by Alan \nGreenspan--and all of us know how hard it was to bring the budget into \nbalance, to bring the deficit down, to start to reduce the national \ndebt. It is incredible to me that our Republicans friends, who claim to \nbe fiscal conservatives, were objecting to this. In fairness, we did \nhave some of our friends helping us get this through. There was an \nobjection on that side of the aisle that caused us not to be able to \nput the budget rules in place until April.\n\n  We did take the first step to restore some kind of discipline to our \nbudgeting which is necessary to see an economic recovery. When we are \nout of control and we are losing control over our budget, it carries \nover into the private sector. Eventually higher interest rates will \ncome about because there will be a squeeze on lending.N O T I C E\n\nEffective January 1, 2003, the subscription price of the \nCongressional Record will be $434 per year or $217 for six months. \nIndividual issues may be purchased for $6.00 per copy. \nSubscriptions in microfiche format will be $141 per year with \nsingle copies priced at $1.50.

DiMario, Public Printer\n[[Page S10632]]\n\n\n  I will share some situations we are facing with the current economic \nsituation. We have many problems. This is just one of our problems. We \nare in a recession. We hope it will not be long term. We pray it will \nnot be long term. We know there are a lot of problems. Superimposed \nover all the economic problems is the fact that our workers are having \nto pay so much more for their health insurance. By the way, this goes \nfor the small business people as well.\n  From my family experience, we have seen in small businesses the cost \nof health insurance rising enormously, and good employers who want to \npay the premiums are looking at disastrous increases in the cost of \nhealth care for their employees. Family coverage has risen 16 percent \nand single coverage has risen 27 percent in the year 2002. If you have \na good economy and jobs are plentiful, you can absorb this hit, but if \nyou are seeing a recession, maybe your job is not secure, maybe you are \nworking fewer hours, you surely have a problem when you look at your \nnest egg, which is another problem we are facing in terms of \ninvestments for retirement. These increases are hurting our people and \nhurting them badly.\n  Now a look at the bigger picture and what has happened under this \nPresident's watch. We have two arrows on this chart, an ``up'' arrow \nand a ``down'' arrow. It is miserable to look at. Everything you want \ndown is up and everything you want up is down. What is up on the \neconomic indicators? Job losses, way up; health care costs, way up; \nforeclosures, way up. People are losing their homes. In America today, \nthe average American is just a few months away from not being able to \nmake that mortgage payment if they were to lose their job. The national \ndebt, way up. We are seeing the debt grow again after we thought we \nreally had a plan to reverse it. Federal interest costs are going up. \nSocial Security trust fund has been raided. The fact is our interest \ncosts each year are going up, and that means we do not have funds to \nspend on other things.\n  What is down in the Bush economic record? Economic growth is down. As \na matter of fact, we took a look at the GDP and it looks to us to be \nthe worst in 50 years when compared to other administrations. Business \ninvestment is down. We know the stock market is down. It is volatile. I \nused to be a stockbroker many years ago. I have never seen these \ngyrations. Where is the bottom? We hope we have seen the bottom. \nCertainly we have a problem when we have an administration that is \ntalking about privatizing Social Security, when we see what has \nhappened to the stock market. If we had turned away from Social \nSecurity and we had invested as a government in the stock market \ninstead of safe government bonds, where would we be with our seniors \ntoday? Believe me, it would be a disaster. I hope the American people \nwill think about that as they look at these economic indicators.\n  Retirement accounts are down, 401(k) plans. Everyone--I have spoken \nto so many people--is afraid to open up their mail to see what has \nhappened to their 401(k)'s. They believe in this country. We all know \nwe will come back. But right now it is a problem.\n\n  If you are at retirement age right now and you do not have the luxury \nto say, as a lot of people tell me, ``Senator, I will just work another \n5 years,'' that is all well and good if you are healthy and can work \nanother 5 years. But what is the ramification of that? Not only are you \ndelaying this time of your life you wanted to enjoy your family, \nperhaps take a trip, you are staying in the job market. That means \nyounger people do not have the opportunity to move in. There are a lot \nof ramifications when we see the stock market down and the retirement \naccounts down. That may not hit you at first glance.\n  Consumer confidence is down. The minimum wage, when you take \ninflation into account, is way down. On the other side of the aisle, my \nRepublican friends do not want to raise the minimum wage. I ask how \nthey can live on $10,600 a year? They know it would be very difficult. \nThe minimum wage has not been raised in years. I don't understand their \nopposition. It is not only the right thing to do for our people, but we \nknow people at that scale of the economic ladder will spend. That will \nhelp restore this economy. They will go down to the local store. They \nwill spend that increase in the minimum wage.\n  This administration believes you give tax cuts to the wealthiest and \nyou will solve all the problems of the world. The fact is the wealthy \npeople do not spend it. If they earn over a million a year, they do not \nneed it; they will not necessarily spend it. Therefore, the economy \ndoes not get a benefit; whereas, if you direct those tax cuts to the \nmiddle class, say the people even earning $40,000, $50,000 or $60,000 a \nyear or lower, you will have an immediate impact. That is why I never \nunderstood the ``economic plan'' of this administration with all its \ntax breaks for the richest of the richest of the rich. It does not help \nour economy. We know it does not. Look at our economy. This \nadministration has been in for a couple of years now, and we have never \nhad a worse economy. Their plan for everything is cut taxes for the \nwealthiest people. It doesn't work. Every indicator you want to see \ndown is up, and the opposite is true.\n  John Adams said: Facts are stubborn things. They are stubborn, but \nthey are facts. And the American people have to look at the facts and \nlook them in the eye and think about them.\n  The Bush economic record: Record job losses; weak economic growth; \ndeclining business investment; falling stock market; shrinking \nretirement accounts; eroding consumer confidence; rising health care \ncosts; escalating foreclosures; vanishing surpluses and higher interest \ncosts for the government. We have to borrow now to pay for the daily \noperations of the government. We pay interest for that--billions of \ndollars of interest that we cannot spend investing in education, \ninvesting in our people, investing to clean up our environment. Raiding \nSocial Security.\n  We see record executive pay. That is not healthy for our country to \nhave that great disparity. I am all for success. But I saw this runaway \ncorporate irresponsibility in my State perhaps before others, a little \ncompany called Enron. Finally we are getting justice. Today we have the \nfirst news of a guilty plea of a fellow very high up in the chain. What \ndid he admit to? Creating these scams to defraud the people, making \nphony electricity shortages. He admitted to conspiracy, wire fraud. The \nbottom line is, names will be named. These people receive record \nexecutive pay.\n  A stagnating minimum wage. I see my friend from Massachusetts, who \nhas been a lion on this point. Every day he is here, calling for our \nfriends on the other side to let us pass a minimum wage increase. I \nthank him for that because we need his voice. We need it all the time. \nThe fact is, people are suffering out there and our economy is \nsuffering because the people at the minimum wage have nothing to spend. \nIf they got a little increase, it would go right into those local \nstores. So we are very hopeful that maybe there will be a change around \nhere and maybe my friend from Massachusetts will hear the echoes from \nthe other side of the aisle, and maybe there will be more on this side. \nWe don't know what is going to happen.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. When we think of the minimum wage, we too infrequently \nthink of the people who are earning that minimum wage. It has always \nbeen interesting to me that we are willing to have those who are \nearning the minimum wage take care of some of those individuals who are \nthe most precious to us and the most fragile.\n  Many of the minimum-wage workers work in child care settings and are \ntaking care of the children while workers are out there working, trying \nto provide for their families. Many of them are working in schools with \nteachers. We know how important education is, and these minimum-wage \nworkers are working to assist teachers. Many of them are working in \nnursing homes, to try to help take care of parents and grandparents who \nhave made such a difference to this country. They have fought in the \nwars and brought the country out of the Great Depression.\n  These are men and women of great dignity. Even though these jobs are \ndifficult and they are tough, they are prepared to do them because they \ntake pride in their work. They are trying to\n\n[[Page S10633]]\n\nprovide for their families. All they are looking for is to be treated \nfairly.\n  I thank the good Senator from California for being such a strong \nsupporter of the increase in the minimum wage. This is an issue I think \nall Americans can understand. People who work hard, 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks a year, should not continue to live in poverty for themselves and \ntheir children in this country of ours. Americans understand that. Why \nare we constantly denied the opportunity to bring that measure up here \non the floor of the Senate, to permit the Senate of the United States \nto at least vote on it?\n  We are facing Republican opposition here, we were facing Republican \nopposition in the House of Representatives, and in the White House. \nThis is something I find extraordinary. For years the increase in the \nminimum wage, as the good Senator understands, was never a partisan \nissue. It really only became a partisan issue after the 1980 election. \nPrior to that time, we had bipartisan support for it.\n  I thank the Senator for including that in the Senator's evaluation of \nthe economic record of this administration. The failure to provide that \nnot only denies us the economic stimulus that would be provided but \nalso is a denial of fairness for a group of men and women who work \nhard, play by the rules, try to raise their children, and ought to be \ntreated fairly. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before the Senator leaves, I have a question for him.\n  We have not seen an increase in the minimum wage since 1996. This is \ngoing on 7 years. Does it not amaze my friend to see the passionate \ndebate that happens here when our friends on the other side of the \naisle talk about giving tax breaks worth 10 times more than what \nsomeone working at minimum wage for 1 year would earn? In other words, \nfor people earning a million dollars a year, the Bush tax cut is going \nto be more than $50,000 a year in their pocket. That is more than--\nwell, how many times more than $11,000? Maybe four times. And our \nfriends, we see them get tears in their eyes worrying about the people \nat the top of the economic ladder.\n\n  Yet they will not even give us a vote. I just cannot believe it, in \nthis day and age, that we would have to wait so long to do this little \npiece of economic justice.\n  I wonder if my friend thinks about that. He and I talk about this as \nwe watch our friends when there is a tax cut to the wealthy few--the \npassion, the excitement, the dedication to this. Yet we cannot get a \nvote for the people at the bottom of the ladder.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator makes an excellent point. I think she would \nagree with me that, as our President said, ``We are one nation with one \nhistory and one destiny. We are all really basically together.''\n  Yet when we see this callous disregard for working men and women who \nare trying to provide for themselves and for their children, on the one \nhand, and complete callous disregard--and the preference and special \nprivileges granted to another group--this really flies in the face of \nwhat I think this society and this country is really all about.\n  I am sure the Senator understands that the $1.50 increase in the \nminimum wage would affect nearly 9 million people in this country. It \nwould represent one-fifth of 1 percent of the nation's payroll. That is \nwhat we are talking about.\n  People say it is highly inflationary. Of course, the economic studies \nshow it is not because these are funds that are spent by these minimum-\nwage workers. It helps the economy. It helps stimulate the economy. \nThese are Americans who will invest in the community.\n  Wouldn't you think we could say we want to make sure people who are \nworking, providing for their families, will not be left out and left \nbehind in the richest nation of the world?\n  We have Americans who are in the service fighting overseas. We have \nheard the debates of war and peace. We have to ask, why are they the \nbest? The reason they are the best is not only that they have the best \ntraining, are the best equipped, and the best led, but because they \nhave values. Those values also include fairness and decency to their \nfellow human beings and to their fellow workers. Fairness and decency \nto those workers includes the raise in the minimum wage.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. He has made, of course, a great moral \nargument for increasing this minimum wage.\n  I point out that in 1996 when we passed this--my friend from Nevada \nmay well remember--my friends on the other side finally went along. \nRemember, we had a Democratic President. They predicted we would have a \nterrible economy because we were raising the minimum wage. Oh, this was \ngoing to be a damper. This was going to be awful. What happened? We had \nthe greatest economic recovery we have ever seen, the greatest economic \nboom we have ever seen.\n  Now, when we are making a plea to our colleagues that those who have \ncarried this country through these good times have fallen behind, they \nare too busy thinking of ways to cut the taxes for the people at the \ntop.\n  I believe it is important to note, as we look at this economic record \nand how terrible it is, that there are a few actions we could take.\n  Yes, we did something today. We got some budgetary discipline back \ninto this body today. I am proud we did that. But I say to my friends, \nthere is lots we could do to change this pattern. One is to change this \nstagnating minimum wage. Give a little boost to a few people. They will \nturn around, spend it at the corner store, have more dignity, and spark \nthis economy in a way that all the tax cuts to the top people just \ndon't. It just doesn't happen that way.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator mentioned the creation of jobs during the 8 \nyears President Clinton was in office. The Senator is aware, I am \ncertain, that he, during his administration, created over 20 million \nnew jobs.\n  What has happened during the first 2 years of the Bush administration \nis there have been over 2 million jobs lost. A net gain of over 20 \nmillion jobs under Clinton; already a net loss of 2 million jobs under \nBush.\n  Would the Senator comment on that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. I have pointed out here, as has the Senator, my \nfriend, and Senator Daschle, record job losses that we are seeing, the \nweakest economic growth. We all know stories. We read the headlines: \n10,000 jobs lost here, 5,000 there, 2,000 there.\n  I say to my friend from Nevada, behind every one of these record job \nlosses is a personal story. It is not as if this administration is \nwilling to give folks the tools to retrain. We on this side of the \naisle have to fight every inch of the way to save programs that give \npeople the tools to retrain. We have had to fight the Bush \nadministration on the H-1B program--it is a wonderful program that my \nfriend has supported along with me--to retrain people. We have personal \nstories of those people, where they have done so well with worker \nretraining. We have to fight every step of the way. Even with the free \ntrade bill, there was a big struggle to see if we could make part of \nthat, at least, some worker retraining.\n  My friend is right. This is not only a terrible record, it is a \nreversal from policies that were brought to us by a Democratic \nPresident, Bill Clinton, that brought us a wonderful economy and hope \nin our future.\n  I think it is important that our friends ask, What do you Democrats \nwant to do? I think Senator Daschle laid that out.\n  I want to spend a couple of minutes in closing by laying out what our \nsolution is here.\n  We took a step today--budget enforcement. Here it is. We took a step. \nWe couldn't get it for another year. We took it for as long as we could \nget it.\n  It is going to take 60 votes--at least through April--to raid the \nSocial Security trust fund again. It is going to take 60 votes to bleed \nthis budget without paying for it.\n  So we did that. That is something Alan Greenspan said we should do.\n  What else can we do?\n  Unemployment insurance. We have people who are suffering because they \ncannot find a new job in this terrible recessionary period. They need \nan extension of unemployment. Day after day Democrats have been down \nhere asking, begging, cajoling, Can we not pass another extension?\n  We can't get it through. They do not want to raise the minimum wage. \nPeople can't live on a minimum wage.\n\n[[Page S10634]]\n\n  They won't expand unemployment insurance to help people get through \nuntil they find a job.\n  What is their answer? More tax cuts for the rich. It doesn't work. We \ntried that. I didn't vote for it, I am happy to say. But it passed here \nbecause most Presidents get 90 percent of what they ask for. That is \ntrue of Democrat Presidents and Republican Presidents. The President \ngot it.\n  What have we seen as a result? Terrible times.\n  That is not the answer. Why doesn't this President spend some time on \nthe economy? Call Senator Daschle and say, Senator Daschle, you came \nover here to the White House to talk about the war in Iraq. Congressman \nGephardt, the Democratic leader, you came over here and talked about \nthe war on terror. We speak as one voice on foreign policy. Even if we \nhave a few disagreements along the way, we set them aside. Why don't we \nhave time to talk about this economy, Mr. President?\n  I have been saying we have to do foreign policy and economic policy. \nWe have to do more than one thing at a time.\n  Now the President is doing two things at one time--foreign policy and \ncampaigning.\n  Call off those campaign trips, Mr. President. Let us have a little \nsummit and talk about the need for unemployment insurance and have that \nto stimulate our economy so people get their money.\n  Minimum wage. This man is a compassionate man. I have seen compassion \nin his face. I know he has compassion in his heart. Where is his \ncompassion for the people who are working at the bottom of the ladder? \nLet us talk about it, Mr. President.\n  Fiscal relief to States. This administration is asking States to do a \nlot after we were attacked on 9/11, and the States are trying their \nbest. We have been hit with recession. Where is the money for port \nsecurity? Where is the money for airport security? Where is the money \nfor chemical plant security? Where is the money for nuclear plant \nsecurity? We gave it to this President--and he refused to spend it--\n$5.1 billion for all those things. He is complaining that we will not \npass this reshuffling and this new Department, which I have a lot of \ndoubts about. You could do more good by spending the $5.1 billion that \nwe Democrats and Republicans voted to spend under the emergency powers \nwe have.\n  Instead of walking away from that, that would have helped our people \nin local and State government. That would have helped our people by \ngiving them protection.\n  We are offering people who live within 10 miles of a nuclear power \nplant an iodine pill in case they are exposed. Wouldn't you rather \nprevent something from happening by making sure that the plants are \nsecure?\n  All of these things are on point with the economy because we must \nprotect the homeland, and if we do it right, we will provide jobs and \nwe will stimulate this economy. It all fits in with fiscal relief to \nStates, and that will help this economy.\n  We have even offered rebates and better targeted business incentives. \nWhy do we give businesses incentives to run away off shore to avoid \ntaxes? Let us give them real incentives to invest, real incentives to \nhire, and real incentives if they retrain workers.\n  I already talked about investments in homeland security. But I didn't \nmention schools.\n  We have schools that are falling apart, Mr. President. I know how \ndedicated you are to education. You and I know there is a message sent \nto our children when they go to school and there are tiles falling off \nthe ceiling, the place is dirty, and you are breathing in mold. Some of \nthese schools haven't been really touched in tens of years. That is \nwhere our teachers are supposed to teach our children.\n  We Democrats believe you are sending a message when a child goes to a \ndepartment store and sees how beautiful it is. There is a message \nthere. It is a subtle message--or maybe it is not so subtle. Gee, this \nis important. But when the child goes to school, the place where they \nare going to get the American dream--I am the product of public \nschools. I never went to a private school in my life, from kindergarten \nthrough college. It is the way I got the skills I needed.\n  We need to invest in those schools. In that investment, we will give \na boost to this economy.\n  Investment in health research. How many people do we meet whose \nrelatives are suffering from Alzheimer's, or cancer, or heart disease, \nor diabetes? We know we have a host of diseases--spinal cord injuries. \nWe should invest in that science. That will help our people. It will \nlift our economy.\n  Pension reform. God knows we need pension reform. We can't have a \ncircumstance where people are relying on a pension, and when they are \nready to retire it is not there. That is devastating. It is devastating \nto our whole country. The bottom line is we haven't done anything about \npension reform. We haven't attacked the problem. Our friends on the \nother side of the aisle are not interested in it. That is a fact.\n  We now have to enforce the Corporate Accountability Act. Harvey Pitt \nwas supposed to appoint someone under the new board created in the \nSarbanes bill. It got a little too hot at the top there for this man. \nIt was too good, and they backed off.\n  How can we get anywhere against these people who are in these high \npositions in corporate America if we don't enforce our own laws?\n  This President needs a new economic team.\n  I listen to the people who come here, and they talk about how great \nthe economy is. It is a rosy scenario. They do not even admit we have a \nproblem. I could name every single one of them, and I could give you \ntheir quotes. Maybe someone will do that later in the day. But every \nsingle member of the economic team is in denial: Oh, everything is \nwonderful. The stock market is turning around. Recession, we don't have \na recession. We have turned the corner.\n  Maybe this is the reason they do not want to act on any of these \nissues. They don't want to raise the minimum wage. They don't care. \nThey don't want to give people unemployment insurance. They do not \ncare. They don't care about our States. It is unbelievable to me.\n  Here is the bottom line. We are getting ready to leave here for a few \nweeks. The people of America are going to make their decisions. I just \nhope whatever side of the aisle they are from, or whatever ideology \nthey are from, whatever they are thinking, they will assert their \nresponsibility and vote in this election. This election is crucial.\n  I meet people all the time who say, Oh, all the candidates are alike. \nNo; not true. If you broach any of these issues to people who may have \ntouched your heart, you will find people with differing views.\n  You are never going to find anyone with whom you agree 100 percent of \nthe time. But what happens in this Chamber is dependent on the views of \nthe American people. And this is an important time. Whether you agree \nwith everything I said, whether you agree with 50 percent of what I \nsaid, or if you disagree with me on everything I said, that is not \nimportant.\n  It is important to understand what is at stake right now. Are we \ngoing to move forward with an economic plan that addresses this economy \nwhile we engage in the challenge we were given on September 11 and all \nthe other foreign policy challenges we face? I think we have no choice. \nWe need to do more than one thing at a time. We need to do a lot of \nthings.\n  (Ms. CANTWELL assumed the Chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. I see my friend from Washington is now presiding. She and \nI have worked very hard to preserve and protect the environment of this \ncountry. Not a day goes by that this administration isn't doing \nsomething to weaken our environmental laws, whether it is clean air or \nit is clean water. We all know what happened with arsenic in the water. \nWe stopped that. But every day, in every way, they are doing something \nto weaken laws.\n  Just the other day, in California, this administration sided with the \nbig auto companies. They are suing my State because my State wants \nclean air and they want to see cars that emit less pollution.\n  Here is an administration that claims they love States rights, they \nlove local control. Well, they love States rights, and they love local \ncontrol, unless they disagree with your State at the moment or your \nlocality\n\n[[Page S10635]]\n\nat the moment. Then, suddenly, oh, the Federal Government: We are the \nones who have to make the rules.\n  So there is so much at stake. I just took to the floor because I \nthought before we recessed, I might put it in the Record. I want to \nsay, in relation to all these issues that are so very difficult--the \nissue of war and peace, the issue of this economy, the issue of the \nenvironment, the issue of a woman's right to choose, that is under \ntremendous attack every day by this administration--and I should \nmention the horrible time people in the Washington, DC, area are going \nthrough because of a sniper out there--these are hard times, but a \nlittle light peeks through every once in a while.\n  I thought I would end on an up note: Two of my teams in California \nare going to the World Series. So even in these hard times, a little \nbrightness shines through. For this Senator from California, I could \nnot be more proud of these two teams from San Francisco and Anaheim.\n  It is going to be very hard for me. What am I going to do? I have to \nroot for everybody. But whatever happens, California will win. And if I \nhave my way, once that is over, I want California to win on this \neconomy, on the environment. I want the kids in my State to have the \nbest education, the best health care, the best life, the best shot at \nthe American dream.\n  So after the World Series is over, and after the elections are over, \nI will be back here and I will be fighting for those very things.\n  I thank you very much, Madam President. I yield the floor and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10635-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FCC VACANCY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, earlier today I spoke briefly about the \nnomination of Mr. Adelstein to serve as a member of the Federal \nCommunications Commission. I know that the two Senate leaders are \nworking on nominations to see if they could clear some today. I don't \nknow the final result of that, but it now appears as if that will not \nbe the case. I want to speak not about all of the nominations that are \nawaiting confirmation by the Senate but only about this nomination.\n  This nomination doesn't have so much to do with the person I am \nspeaking of, Jonathan Adelstein, as it has to do with the position at \nthe Federal Communications Commission, a vacant spot that has been \nthere over a year. That particular nomination is critically important \nespecially to rural States and rural areas.\n  We have a Federal Communications Commission that is on the edge of \nmaking critically important decisions about the future of \ntelecommunications. These decisions will have a profound impact on a \nsignificant part of our country.\n  Chairman Powell and others, I fear, are going to take action in a \nwide range of areas that will have a significant impact on rural \nAmerica. Mr. Copps is one commissioner fighting valiantly. His is a \nrefreshing voice that stands up for the interests of rural America. But \nwe now have this vacancy at the FCC for 13 months.\n  Mr. Jonathan Adelstein is a superbly qualified candidate who should \nhave been there long ago and has been held up at a number of \nintersections with this process.\n  On September 7, Gloria Tristani resigned the FCC. This is a \nDemocratic seat. There are Republican and Democratic appointments. This \nis a Democratic appointment. It took forever for the White House to get \nhis nomination to the Senate. The Commerce Committee on which I serve \napproved it and reported it out on July 23. So 13 months after the \nvacancy was available, and 4 months after the Commerce Committee took \naction on Jonathan Adelstein's nomination, that position is still \nvacant. We have one commissioner's slot down at the FCC that is \nunfilled.\n  The voice of Mr. Adelstein could join that of Mr. Copps in speaking \nup, standing up, and fighting for rural interests for those millions of \nAmericans who live in more sparsely populated States and for whom \ntelecommunications policy will be the difference of being on the right \nor wrong side of the digital divide, will mean whether you have \neconomic opportunity and economic growth or not. These policies are \ncritically important for all Americans but especially for Americans who \nlive in my part of the country and in a rural State.\n  Think back to the 1930s, when we had a country in which if you lived \nout on the farm, you had no electricity. No one was going to bring \nelectricity to the farm until public policy said, through the REA \nprogram, we will electrify America's farms. We will have a Federal \nprogram and public policy that says we will move electricity to all the \nsmall towns and family farms in our country. We did that, and we \nunleashed productivity never before imagined.\n  Some who are in a regulatory body today have the mindset that if the \nmarket system doesn't provide for it, it shall not be available. They \nwould never have had an REA program. We would still be having America's \nfarms without electricity. We would not have made the progress we did. \nBut we have people in these regulatory agencies who have this mindset. \nThey worship at the altar of the market system. Listen, the market \nsystem is a wonderful thing. I am all for it, but it needs effective \nregulation. Effective regulation by the FCC in telecommunications \npolicy is critical to our future.\n\n  The market system is a system that says to us that someone who \nportrays a judge on television--I will not name the judges. There are \nthree or four of them. I will name one--Judge Judy--makes $7 million a \nyear, I read in the paper. That is the market system. The Chief Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court makes $180,000 a year. That is the market \nsystem. A schoolteacher might make $30,000 or $40,000, and a shortstop \nfor the Texas Rangers may make $250 million over 10 years. The market \nsystem. The market system is wonderful.\n  I have studied economics, taught it, and been able to overcome it, \nhowever, and still lead a good life. I believe in the market system. I \nthink it is a wonderful thing. But it needs effective regulation, and \nit needs policymakers and regulatory authorities and regulatory bodies \nthat have some common sense.\n  I worry about the FCC and the decisions they are about to make. At \nthe FCC, we need a full complement of commissioners, and we need this \nslot filled--not tomorrow, not next week, not next year. We need this \nslot filled now. We must find a way to overcome this logjam on \nnominations. I am only speaking of this one because it is really \nimportant in terms of telecommunication policy and future opportunities \nand economic growth in rural States. In the coming days and weeks, as \nwe reconvene following the election--which I understand will now be the \nweek of November 12--my hope is we can find a way to clear these \nnominations. I know Senator Daschle understands that and has tried to \ndo that. The Senate should do this, clear this nomination and other \nnominations that have been waiting on the calendar for some long while.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to express my \ndisappointment. I was going to call up some legislation that we have \nworked very hard on dealing with children, the Keeping Children and \nFamilies Safe Act. It was legislation approved by the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee in September, about a month \nago. I think it was adopted unanimously. It deals with abused children. \nIt reauthorizes the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, better \nknown as CAPTA.\n\n[[Page S10636]]\n\n  This is a piece of legislation that has been around for a number of \nyears. It was a bipartisan bill that was introduced by myself, Senators \nGregg, Kennedy, Collins, DeWine, and Wellstone, and approved \nunanimously by voice vote. This is one of those bills with that kind of \nsupport out of the committee, on a bipartisan basis, and was done early \nenough that we thought we would have little difficulty in having this \nadopted as part of a unanimous consent calendar, rather than engaging \nin taking up the time of the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, I am told that any effort to try to pass this \nlegislation will be objected to. As such, I regret to inform my \ncolleagues that the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act \nreauthorization will just not get an endorsement by this Congress. That \nis a sad note indeed.\n  Mr. President, about 3 million children each year are abused in this \ncountry. Close to 900,000 children were found to be victims of child \nmaltreatment or abuse.\n  The most tragic consequence of child maltreatment is death, \nobviously. The most recent data available for the year 2000 show that \n1,200 children died in this country of abuse and neglect. Children \nyounger than 6 years of age accounted for 85 percent of child \nfatalities, and children younger than 1 year of age accounted for 44 \npercent of child fatalities.\n  What more tragic news could there be than a child, an infant--1,200 \nin this country of ours--dying as a result of abuse and neglect? Here \nwe are trying to do everything we can to help bring these numbers down.\n  Just imagine the face of a young child facing the horror of abuse and \nneglect that goes on far too often. Unfortunately, despite the \nunanimous vote out of the committee of jurisdiction, a bipartisan \nagreement to reauthorize these dollars, to allow us to go forward and \ndeal with this situation, we are told: We are sorry, we cannot do this. \nWe do not have either the time or the desire.\n  I am deeply saddened by it. As a first-time father with a 1-year-old \nchild, I cannot imagine anyone abusing my daughter Grace. The idea that \nsome child her age, some infant--1,200 of them around the country, \naccording to the statistics in the year 2000--lost their lives, not to \nmention the several thousands more who are abused and survive but \nsuffer the scars of that abuse, and that the Child Abuse Treatment and \nPrevention Act, which has actually done a great deal to assist families \nand communities in dealing with this issue is not going to have the \nimprimatur approval, despite the unanimous bipartisan agreement of the \ncommittee, to bring that matter up for consideration by this body.\n  The people who work in this area give tirelessly of their time and \nefforts to go out and save a few lives. I am not suggesting we save all \n1,200, but what if we save 20? What if we save 10? Is it worth this \nSenate's time to spend a few minutes to pass some legislation that \nmight save one child's life this year? Would that be wrong?\n  I would not hesitate to say our allocation of time for an issue of \nthat type, the life of one child we might save, is worthy of this \nSenate's attention and time.\n  It is with a high degree of sadness that I report to my colleagues we \nare going to have to wait for another day, I guess, maybe later in the \nnext Congress, to do something. But when you pick up a newspaper over \nthe next several months and read another child lost their life as a \nresult of abuse and neglect, then you might look back on a moment like \nthis and wonder: Maybe this Congress, despite the time we spent on \nother issues of questionable value, could have found a few minutes to \ndeal with this issue of child neglect and abuse.\n  I regret to report to colleagues and others that this issue will have \nto wait for another day. Hopefully, the families of some children will \nnot have to look back and wonder whether or not if we acted, we might \nhave saved a life or saved a child from the lifetime scars that abuse \nand neglect can bring.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we are in the closing hours of this \nsession--I am told there is some discussion about coming back after the \nelection--we have not yet reached a final agreement on the terrorism \ninsurance bill in the sense that there are conference reports that are \nbeing read. Obviously, Members from this Chamber and the other Chamber \nhave departed for their respective districts and States. So despite the \nlong hours last night, the early hours of this morning and today to \nachieve the final signing of a conference report, that particular \neffort has not been achieved yet.\n  It is appropriate and proper to suggest to those who are interested \nin the subject matter that we are on the brink of a very good and \nstrong agreement dealing with terrorism insurance. Obviously, it is not \nfinished until the conferees of the Senate and the other body sign the \nconference report, both bodies then vote on a conference report, and \nthe President signs it. So there are several steps to go after people \nwho have worked on a product and submit it to all of our colleagues, \nparticularly those who are on the conference, for their approval.\n  I am heartened and confident that when Members look at the agreement, \nthey will be satisfied we did a good job. I will quickly point out that \nlike any agreement involving 535 different people, not including the \nPresident of the United States, where there are divided institutions, \nas they are in the Senate and the other body, getting an agreement that \none side or the other would find entirely favorable is very \nunrealistic.\n  I went through a process with my good friend now from the State of \nOhio, Bob Ney, on election reform. We have spent a lot of days, a lot \nof nights and weekends working out that bill.\n  There are those in this Chamber and the other Chamber who are not \nsatisfied with everything we did--I understand why--but we never would \nhave achieved a bill had it been a bill to the total satisfaction of \none side or the other. I will say the same is going to be true about \nterrorism insurance.\n  I commend Mike Oxley, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, \nJim Sensenbrenner, and others who have worked on this legislation.\n  I commend the White House and the Treasury Department.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, who is the chairman of the \nBanking Committee and chairman of the conference on terrorism \ninsurance, Senator Schumer, Senator Reed of Rhode Island, Senator \nGramm, Senator Shelby, and Senator Enzi, all of whom have been \nconferees on the Senate side. Certainly, their staffs have labored.\n  I thank the majority leader's office and the minority leader's \noffice. A lot of people have worked on this bill.\n  If I were asked whether this is the bill I would write if I could \nwrite it alone, I would say no. I am sure Chairman Oxley would say the \nsame thing. Were it his opportunity to write a bill perfectly, he would \nwrite something different than what we wrote. But we believe it is the \nbest we could do under these circumstances.\n  The terrorism insurance bill is about policyholders. It is about \njobs. It is about an economic condition of a country that is faltering. \nWhile this proposal is not going to solve all of those problems when \nthere are a lot of people out of work, a lot of construction projects \nthat have stopped, a lot of fine businesses and industries that cannot \nget insurance and thus cannot borrow money, then that contributes to an \neconomic difficulty in the country which we are witnessing.\n\n  We have worked a long time to arrive at a product we think can be \nconstructive, one that the President could sign, and one that Members \ncould support. Obviously, I do not know all of the situations in the \nother body, but I can say that in this Senate we are going to make a \nreal effort to send this conference report around and give Members a \nchance to read it. Frankly, we wanted to have that done before the \nclose of business today, but when we were up until about 4 or 4:30 this \nmorning, began again at 9:30 this morning,\n\n[[Page S10637]]\n\nand did not finish the final product until late this afternoon, it is \nunrealistic to assume everyone could have read this, gone over it \ncarefully, and signed off on it.\n  I regret we were unable to get that done, but I believe before the \nfinal gavel comes down on this session, whenever that is, the Congress \nof the United States will have a chance to express its approval of this \neffort.\n  I wish I could stand here and say that this is done. It is not, \nbecause we need those signatures on this conference report. But I can \nsay that those who have been involved in trying to craft it believe we \nhave put together a good agreement.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. This is more of a comment than a question. The Senator from \nConnecticut has been on the floor this week for two very important \nreasons. One was to announce election reform, which is landmark \nlegislation. No matter how one looks at it, it is landmark legislation. \nAlso, the Senator from Connecticut has worked on this terrorism \ninsurance bill for more than a year.\n  The reason I mention this is that there are no legislative winners or \nlosers. It is something that was done on a bipartisan basis, each not \ngetting everything they wanted but coming up with a product that is \ngood for the American people.\n  The Senator is a veteran legislator. We all know that. But I really \nwant to spread on the Record of this Senate how important it is to have \nsomeone such as the Senator from Connecticut who can work with people \non the other side of the aisle to come up with a product for which no \none can claim credit. This is not a Democrat or Republican victory with \nregard to election reform and terrorism insurance--when that is \napproved, and I am confident it will be. It will not be a victory for \nthe Democrats or the Republicans. It will be a victory for the American \npeople.\n  The way we were able to do so was with patience, perseverance, and \nthe expertise of the Senator from Connecticut. On behalf of the entire \nSenate, the people of Nevada, who badly need both pieces of \nlegislation, and the rest of the country, I applaud the work of the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada for those \nvery gracious comments. I thank him for his efforts, as well as the \nvery fine staff people, on both the terrorism insurance issue, which is \nan important question in his State, and the election reform bill.\n  I think we have finally come to realize--maybe it takes some of us \nlonger than others--that any product that is going to have much merit \nrequires that it be one reached on a bipartisan basis. The very fact \nthat this institution is divided about as equally as it can be demands \nthat.\n  I have served in this Chamber in the minority by a significant number \nof seats, and I have served in the majority by a significant number of \nseats. I have served in this Chamber, obviously, as we all do today, \nwhen we have been evenly divided. Under any set of circumstances short \nof an overwhelming number, measures need to be worked out with each \nother. We have to sit down and resolve differences across party lines.\n  The Senator from Nevada is a master at it. He was generous in his \ncomments about the Senator from Connecticut. All of us admire the \npatience, the diligence, and the tenacity of Senator Reid. There is no \none who fights harder and spends more time every day to try to make \nthings happen. There is no more frustrating job.\n  I found that out working on these last two issues, and that was \nfrustrating enough. I am tired. I have been up several nights into the \nwee hours of the morning. I have talked about that 1-year-old daughter \nof mine. I have been accused of trying to avoid some of the paternal \nresponsibilities that come with a new child by legislating too late at \nnight. That is hardly the case. I cannot wait to get home to her.\n  I have admiration for Senator Reid, who does it every day, but for \nthose who do this on occasion, it is very hard. To do it every single \nday we are here takes a special talent and ability and commitment to \nthis country. No one embraces those qualities better than the senior \nSenator from Nevada.\n\n  I thank the Senator for the kind words about the Senator from \nConnecticut. But they can be said with greater emphasis about the \nSenator from Nevada. I am sorry we cannot urge the adoption of a \nconference report on terrorism insurance. We will do that shortly \nsometime within the next few weeks. I am confident that before the \nCongress ends, enough Members, as they have already indicated in this \nChamber, will be willing to sign a conference report, and hopefully the \nother Chamber will do the same.\n  Again, my compliments to the leadership of the other body and the \nleadership here for insisting we work to try to get this done. It is \nnever an easy job. You have to try to work things out. I thank the \nPresident of the United States, as well, and his very kind staff. They \nworked very hard to keep us at this. When a number of us became \ndiscouraged on whether it was worthwhile spending anymore time, people \nat the White House, legislative staff kept saying: let's stick with it \nand see if we cannot come up with some answers. I admire that tenacity \nand that commitment.\n  I look forward to the final passage of this bill. It will happen, \nwithout any doubt. It is just a matter of time. I thank those involved \nin the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I join my colleague from Nevada in complimenting the \nSenator from Connecticut on the passage of the election reform law. I \nhad the distinct pleasure and privilege to sit in the chair to preside \nwhen this matter was debated and discussed many months ago. As the \nSenator from Connecticut has observed, no one could have known then how \nlong the ordeal remained before they could bring the conference report \nback this week. What the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from \nKentucky, and the Senator from Missouri accomplished on behalf of the \nSenate and, more importantly, on behalf of the citizens of America, is \nextraordinary. Given all that has not been brought to fruition in the \nfinal days, the accomplishment the Senator brought to the Senate is an \nextraordinary tribute to his endurance and his legislative skills.\n  He was very gracious yesterday to commend all of the people who \nworked so hard on this legislation--his colleagues and the staff across \nthe aisle. He was too modest to compliment himself. I join with the \nSenator from Nevada in saying that Senator Dodd has performed an \nextraordinary service to his Nation. We will--in Minnesota and Hawaii \nand Connecticut and across the country--conduct better elections, more \nreliable elections, elections where citizens can vote and know the \nvotes will be counted and counted accurately.\n  His daughter Grace and his grandchildren and my children and \ngrandchildren will be the beneficiaries of those hours of hard work. I \nthank the Senator. I congratulate him for that extraordinary \naccomplishment. It is one of the true highlights of our session.\n\n  Also, to follow up, I was presiding when the Senator referred to a \ncouple of pieces of legislation that were not enacted in this session. \nWe will be finishing our work and perhaps coming back in November after \nthe election, with an agenda then that has not yet been determined and \nwith prospects that are unknown. I express my great disappointment in \nsome of the matters that were not accomplished.\n  When I was elected 2 years ago--so this is my first session of \nCongress--perhaps I came with loftier expectations and perhaps less \nseasoned assumptions of what could be accomplished, especially given \nthe opportunities that presented themselves less than 2 years ago when \nwe arrived and were looking at these months of time, the trillions of \ndollars of resources available to do the things that needed to be done.\n  One of the promises I made to the people of Minnesota during my \ncampaign, which I took very seriously, was the passage of prescription \ndrug legislation to provide for coverage through Medicare or some other \nmeans, but my own view was, through the Medicare Program for senior \ncitizens throughout\n\n[[Page S10638]]\n\nMinnesota, I am sure Hawaii and elsewhere, have been ravaged by these \nrising prices, by their inability to control the costs, by the need, as \nI have discovered in my age, to require more prescription medication. \nThe benefits of those medications are lifegiving, lifesaving, life-\nenhancing for millions of Americans.\n  However, for our elderly population, they are literally the \ndifference between life and death. They are literally the difference, \ntime after time, between being able to enjoy their lives, rather than \nbeing consigned to pain and suffering, and infirmity that no one should \nbe subjected to, certainly not in your last months or years of your \nlife. We had all these good intentions. If we totaled the assurances \nMembers made from both sides of the aisle when they sought election or \nreelection that year, we would have had a unanimous agreement that this \nlegislation was overdue, was badly needed, and we might have had some \ndifferences of views as to how it was going to be enacted.\n  But when I came here in January of 2001 I felt as certain as I felt \nabout anything that we would pass that legislation and we would have \nthat moment that Senator Dodd enjoyed yesterday, to bring back to the \nSenate a conference report, something that was agreed upon by the \nHouse, by the White House, and by the Senate, and we could pass it and \ngo back and proudly tell our fellow citizens we had done the job they \nsent us to do.\n  I am terribly distraught and disappointed and disillusioned. I feel \napologetic to the citizens of Minnesota, to the senior citizens who \nplaced their trust in me and sent me here. I remember one elderly woman \nin Duluth, MN, in the northeastern part of our State, about half my \nsize and twice my age, who spoke to me in December of the year 2000 \njust before I came here. She looked at me after I visited her with her \nand her friends. She said, If you do not keep your promises, I will \ntake you out behind the woodshed for an old-fashioned thrashing.\n  I don't dare go back to Duluth, MN, after our failure to pass this \nlegislation. I think in some ways this whole process that we failed to \nmaster, if not ourselves, individually, the failure of this entire \nendeavor, needs an old-fashioned thrashing. It is shameful we have not \nenacted that legislation on behalf of seniors in Minnesota and \neverywhere.\n  It is only one instance, unfortunately, where this failure to enact \nthe people's business occurred in this body. I have presided over this \nSenate more hours in the last 2 years than anyone, save my colleague, \nSenator Carper, of Delaware, and it has been in most respects a very \nenjoyable, fascinating, and certainly educational experience as a new \nMember of the Senate to see firsthand what occurs here and how these \nmatters are handled. The masters of the Senate, through years of \nexperience, know how this process works; also, unfortunately, masters \nof the process who know how to prevent it from working and how to \nobstruct and delay it.\n  I have watched since the beginning of this year, time after time the \nefforts of the majority leader, my good friend from the neighboring \nState of South Dakota, who has the responsibility as leader of our \nmajority caucus to try to schedule and move legislation forward. I have \nseen time after time that he has not been given the agreement \nnecessary. In the Senate, it takes, as you know, unanimous consent. It \ntakes all 100 of us to agree individually just to bring up a matter of \nlegislation. Without that unanimous consent, we have to go through a \nprocedure that then requires the majority leader to file cloture. Then \nit takes 2 more days before we can vote on proceeding, just going ahead \nto take up a piece of legislation.\n\n  Time after time we have had to go through that process. The majority \nleader has had to follow it. I believe, if we tallied up all those days \nthat we have been obstructed and delayed from just considering \nlegislation in this body, it would be 50 or 60 during the last year \nalone. That is 10 to 12 weeks of time. That is 2\\1/2\\ to 3 months of \ntime that we have not been able to conduct the people's business, where \nwe couldn't consider legislation, where we couldn't bring up amendments \nand vote them up or down.\n  Here we are now just at a point of recess or adjournment or whatever \nit is going to be, and we have not passed prescription drug coverage \nfor seniors, we have not extended unemployment benefits but once. I \nbelieve we have tried two or three other times to do so. We have not \nbeen able to get to so many things the people of Minnesota depended on \nme to provide and I think the people of America were looking for from \nall of us.\n  So as we are in these closing moments, and as Senator Dodd from \nConnecticut has brought attention to some of the unfinished business \nbefore us, I wanted to highlight some of that myself and to say, the \nGood Lord willing, I will be back here, whether it is in November or \nDecember or January of next year or the new session of Congress. I wish \nwe would have been able to leave here with much more accomplished. \nThose who are out there wondering, who do not want excuses or \nexplanations, who want real results, which they should have, who want \nprograms that will benefit them, who want help when they need it, who \nwant improvements in their lives--if they really want to understand why \nwe are leaving some of these matters undone, I invite their calls. I \nwould be happy to discuss those matters with them.\n  They should look, as I say, and count the number of days we have had \nto wait to let the clock tick so we could follow the rules of the \nSenate just to move on to another matter. Then I would recommend they \nask themselves why it is and who it was behind this delay and this \nobstruction, and hold those individuals to account when they visit the \nvoting booth in the next occasion.\n  With that, I wish the President a good evening, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10638-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           NOMINATIONS DISCHARGED AND PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Dr. McClellan has an impressive background. He is both\n\n[[Page S10640]]\n\neconomist and a physician. He is a member of the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisers and he is also a major advisor on health policy to \nthe President today. He was an associate professor of economics and \nmedicine at Stanford University. He also served as deputy assistant \nsecretary in the Department of Treasury. And, best of all, he received \nhis medical degree, his doctorate in economics, and his master's degree \nin public health at Harvard and MIT.\n  This nomination to a major public health position is long overdue. \nDr. McClellan has the training, the experience, and the stature to \nserve as the head of the country's most important public health \nregulatory agency--an agency that serves as the gold standard for the \nrest of the world.\n  FDA's mission is to protect the public health. Its mission affects \nmore than a quarter of every dollar spent in the U.S. economy. The \nproducts that it regulates--food, drugs, biologics, devices supplements \nand cosmetics--affect public health and safety every day.\n  The agency also has a long and distinguished history of serving the \npublic interest. It has a proud tradition of promoting the public \ninterest ahead of special interests. It is an agency of skilled \nprofessionals who set high standards and demand excellence from the \nindustries it regulates.\n  In this time of extraordinary medical breakthroughs and as new \nthreats to public health arise, the FDA faces enormous challenges. The \nAmerican people increasingly depend on the FDA to safeguard public \nhealth. Now is not the time for FDA to retreat from these challenges, \nor surrender its authority over public health.\n  Dr. McClellan has been nominated to a position of great \nresponsibility. I believe he will make a fine commissioner, one who \nwill help lead the agency into the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10640-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROTOCOL RELATING TO THE MADRID AGREEMENT--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 106-41\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, early last Friday morning, the Senate \nacted on the President's request to grant him authority to use force in \nIraq. I joined with a majority of my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle to support the resolution granting that authority, but made clear \nthen and continue to believe now that our vote was the first step in \nour effort to address the threat posed by Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction. In my statement before that vote, I indicated the \nPresident faces several challenges as he attempts to fashion a policy \nthat will be successful in our efforts against Saddam Hussein and his \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  One of those challenges is preparing for what might happen in Iraq \nafter Saddam Hussein and preparing the American people for what might \nbe required of us on this score. To that end, I was interested to see \nan article in Friday morning's newspaper with the title, ``U.S. Has a \nPlan to Occupy Iraq, Officials Report.''\n  Citing unnamed administration officials, the article contends the \nadministration is modeling plans for the economic and political \nreconstruction of Iraq on the successful efforts in post-WWII Japan. \nThe article goes on to report that the Administration has yet to \nendorse a final position and this issue had not been discussed with key \nAmerican allies. When questioned at a press conference Friday \nafternoon, the White House spokesperson distanced himself from this \nspecific plan.\n  If this news account is true, I have no choice but to conclude this \nadministration has much to do before it will be in position to present \na plan to the American people and the world about what\n\n[[Page S10641]]\n\nit feels is necessary to promote economic and political stability in \npost-conflict Iraq. We do know, however, that a plan based on the Japan \nprecedent would require a significant and lengthy commitment of \nAmerican political will, economic resources, and military might.\n  While I do not doubt either our resolve or capability to be \nsuccessful in Iraq, it is critical that the Administration be clear \nwith the Congress, the American people, and the world about what it \nbelieves will be needed in post-Saddam Iraq, what portion of that it \nbelieves America should undertake, and what it believes others should \nbe prepared to do. To this end, I urge the President and his \nadministration to keep in mind the following facts and questions as \nplanning for post-conflict Iraq continues.\n  General MacArthur and President Truman made a strategic choice in \npost-WWII Japan to leave intact as much as 95 percent of the imperial \nJapanese government, including the Emperor himself, because of the fear \nof what impact a massive upheaval of the government structure would \nhave on stability in Japan. Do the President and his team intend to \nfollow that precedent, or we will start from scratch in constructing \npost-conflict institutions in Iraq?\n  We maintained nearly 80,000 troops in Japan for 6 years after V-J Day \nand still maintain 47,000 troops to this day, more than a half century \nafter the conflict officially ended. How long does the administration \nanticipate having U.S. forces in post-conflict Iraq, and how much of \nthis burden can we anticipate our friends allies will assume?\n  Post-WWII Japan represented an ethnically and religiously homogenous \npopulation. How does the fact that Iraq is riven by ethnic and \nreligious difference impact U.S. planning for post-conflict Iraq?\n  From 1946 to 1950, the Congressional Research Service estimates that \nthe United States spent a yearly average of $3 billion, in today's \ndollars, for the occupation of Japan. Are those the kinds of numbers \nthe President and his team anticipate for political and economic \nreconstruction in post-conflict Iraq?\n  If the administration plans on obtaining assistance from others, what \nnations is it assuming will be willing to help us? What is the \nadministration assuming these other nations are prepared to do and for \nhow long? If no plan is yet in place and no allies briefed, when does \nthe administration believe such discussions should begin?\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 11, 2002]\n\n            U.S. Has a Plan To Occupy Iraq, Officials Report\n\n                 (By David E. Sanger and Eric Schmitt)\n\n       Washington.--The White House is developing a detailed plan, \n     modeled on the postwar occupation of Japan, to install an \n     American-led military government in Iraq if the United States \n     topples Saddam Hussein, senior administration officials said \n     today.\n       The plan also calls for war-crime trials of Iraqi leaders \n     and a transition to an elected civilian government that could \n     take months or years.\n       In the initial phase, Iraq would be governed by an American \n     military commander--perhaps Gen. Tommy R. Franks, commander \n     of United States forces in the Persian Gulf, or one of his \n     subordinates--who would assume the role that Gen. Douglas \n     MacArthur served in Japan after its surrender in 1945.\n       One senior official said the administration was \n     ``coalescing around'' the concept after discussions of \n     options with President Bush and his top aides. But this \n     official and others cautioned that there had not yet been any \n     formal approval of the plan and that it was not clear whether \n     allies had been consulted on it.\n       The detailed thinking about an American occupation emerges \n     as the administration negotiates a compromise at the United \n     Nations that officials say may fall short of an explicit \n     authorization to use force but still allow the United States \n     to claim it has all the authority it needs to force Iraq to \n     disarm.\n       In contemplating an occupation, the administration is \n     scaling back the initial role for Iraqi opposition forces in \n     a post-Hussein government. Until now it had been assumed that \n     Iraqi dissidents both inside and outside the country would \n     form a government, but it was never clear when they would \n     take full control.\n       Today marked the first time the administration has \n     discussed what could be a lengthy occupation by coalition \n     forces, led by the United States.\n       Officials say they want to avoid the chaos and in-fighting \n     that have plagued Afghanistan since the defeat of the \n     Taliban. Mr. Bush's aides say they also want full control \n     over Iraq while American-led forces carry out their principal \n     mission: finding and destroying weapons of mass destruction.\n       The description of the emerging American plan and the \n     possibility of war-crime trials of Iraqi leaders could be \n     part of an administration effort to warn Iraq's generals of \n     an unpleasant future if they continue to support Mr. Hussein.\n       Asked what would happen if American pressure prompted a \n     coup against Mr. Hussein, a senior official said, ``That \n     would be nice.'' But the official suggested that the American \n     military might enter and secure the country anyway, not only \n     to eliminate weapons of mass destruction but also to ensure \n     against anarchy.\n       Under the compromise now under discussion with France, \n     Russia and China, according to officials familiar with the \n     talks, the United Nations Security Council would approve a \n     resolution requiring the disarmament of Iraq and specifying \n     ``consequences'' that Iraq would suffer for defiance.\n       It would stop well short of the explicit authorization to \n     enforce the resolution that Mr. Bush has sought. But the \n     diplomatic strategy, now being discussed in Washington, Paris \n     and Moscow, would allow Mr. Bush to claim that the resolution \n     gives the United States all the authority he believes he \n     needs to force Baghdad to disarm.\n       Other Security Council members could offer their own, less \n     muscular interpretations, and they would be free to draft a \n     second resolution, authorizing the use of force, if Iraq \n     frustrated the inspection process. The United States would \n     regard that second resolution as unnecessary, senior \n     officials say.\n       ``Everyone would read this resolution their own way,'' one \n     senior official said.\n       The revelation of the occupation plan marks the first time \n     the administration has described in detail how it would \n     administer Iraq in the days and weeks after an invasion, and \n     how it would keep the country unified while searching for \n     weapons.\n       It would put an American officer in charge of Iraq for a \n     year or more while the United States and its allies searched \n     for weapons and maintained Iraq's oil fields.\n       For as long as the coalition partners administered Iraq, \n     they would essentially control the second largest proven \n     reserves of oil in the world, nearly 11 percent of the total. \n     A senior administration official said the United Nations oil-\n     for-food program would be expanded to help finance \n     stabilization and reconstruction.\n       Administration officials said they were moving away from \n     the model used in Afghanistan: establishing a provisional \n     government right away that would be run by Iraqis. Some top \n     Pentagon officials support this approach, but the State \n     Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and, ultimately, \n     the White House, were cool to it.\n       ``We're just not sure what influence groups on the outside \n     would have on the inside,'' an administration official said. \n     ``There would also be differences among Iraqis, and we don't \n     want chaos and anarchy in the early process.''\n       Instead, officials said, the administration is studying the \n     military occupations of Japan and Germany. But they stressed \n     a commitment to keeping Drag unified, as Japan was, and \n     avoiding the kind of partition that Germany underwent when \n     Soviet troops stayed in the eastern sector, which set the \n     stage for the cold war. The military government in Germany \n     stayed in power for four years; in Japan it lasted six and a \n     half years.\n       In a speech on Saturday, Zalmay Khalilzad, the special \n     assistant to the president for Near East, Southwest Asian and \n     North African affairs, said, ``The coalition will assume--and \n     the preferred option--responsibility for the territorial \n     defense and security of Iraq after liberation.''\n       ``Our intent is not conquest and occupation of Iraq,'' Mr. \n     Khalilzad said. ``But we do what needs to be done to achieve \n     the disarmament mission and to get Iraq ready for a \n     democratic transition and then through democracy over time.''\n       Iraqis, perhaps through a consultative council, would \n     assist an American-led military and, later, a civilian \n     administration, a senior official said today. Only after this \n     transition would the American-led government hand power to \n     Iraqis.\n       He said that the Iraqi armed forces would be ``downsized,'' \n     and that senior Baath Party officials who control government \n     ministries would be removed. ``Much of the bureaucracy would \n     carry on under new management,'' he added.\n       Some experts warned during Senate hearings last month that \n     a prolonged American military occupation of Iraq could \n     inflame tensions in the Mideast and the Muslim world.\n       ``I am viscerally opposed to a prolonged occupation of a \n     Muslim country at the heart of the Muslim world by Western \n     nations who proclaim the right to re-educate that country,'' \n     said the former secretary of state, Henry A. Kissinger, who \n     as a young man served as district administrator in the \n     military government of occupied Germany.\n       While the White House considers its long-term plans for \n     Iraq, Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, arrived in Moscow \n     this evening for a day and a half of talks with President \n     Vladimir V. Putin. Aides said talks were focused on resolving \n     the dispute at the United Nations. Mr. Blair and Mr. Putin \n     are to hold\n\n[[Page S10642]]\n\n     formal discussions on Friday, followed by a news conference.\n       Mr. Blair has been a steadfast supporter of the \n     administration's tough line on a new resolution. But he has \n     also indicated that Britain would consider France's proposal \n     to have a two-tiered approach, with the Security Council \n     first adopting a resolution to compel Iraq to cooperate with \n     international weapons inspectors, and then, if Iraq failed to \n     comply, adopting a second resolution on military force. \n     Earlier this week, Russia indicated that it, too, was \n     prepared to consider the French position.\n       But the administration is now saying that if there is a \n     two-resolution approach, it will insist that the first \n     resolution provide Mr. Bush all the authority he needs.\n       ``The timing of all this is impossible to anticipate,'' one \n     administration official involved in the talks said. ``The \n     president doesn't want to have to wait around for a second \n     resolution if it is clear that the Iraqis are not \n     cooperating.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10642-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the people of the United States were shocked \nand saddened to learn of the cold blooded and cowardly attack on \nhundreds of Australian tourists vacationing on the island of Bali, on \nOctober 12. In a few shocking seconds our friends lost more of their \nfellow Australians than at any time since the darkest days of World War \nII.\n  Although Australia is at the farthest corner of the earth, America \nhas no greater friend or ally. Just this year Prime Minister John \nHoward addressed a joint session of the United States Congress to \ncelebrate the 50th Anniversary of the signing ANZUS Treaty, the \ndocument that has formally tied our strategic destinies together for \nthe Food of the entire Asian Pacific Rim.\n  But our relationship with Australia did not begin with the \nratification of one treaty. American and Australian soldiers have \nfought together on every battlefield of the world from the Meuse \nArgonne in 1918 to the Mekong Delta and Desert Storm. In all of our \nmajor wars there has been one constant, Americans and Australians have \nbeen the vanguard of freedom. In fact when American troops launched \ntheir first combined assault on German lines in World War I, it was \nunder the guidance of the legendary Australian fighter General John \nMonash. We share a common historic and cultural heritage. We are \nimmigrant peoples forged from the British Empire. We conquered our \ncontinents and became a beacon of hope for people struggling to be \nfree.\n  For over 100 years, the United States and Australia have been the \nfoundation for stability in the South Pacific. When America suffered \nits worse loss of life since December 7, 1941, the first nation to \noffer a helping hand was Australia. The day after the attacks on \nWashington and New York, Australia invoked the mutual defense clause of \nthe ANZUS Treaty. They were the first to offer military support. \nAustralian special forces are in Afghanistan and after Great Britain \nhave made the largest per capita contribution to our efforts there. In \nthe fight to break the back of al-Quaeda and the Taliban, Australian \ntroops scaled the mountains around Tora Bora.\n  Mr. President, we received another wake-up call on October 12. We can \nno longer let the nay sayers and the hand wringers counsel timidity \nhave their way. The free world is clearly in the sights of fanatics who \nwant to plunge us into a new dark age. Whether it be Saddam Hussein, \nOsama bin Laden, or the coward who attacked men, women, and children on \nholiday in Bali, they are part of the same threat to free peoples.\n  We send our heartfelt condolences to the people of Australia and \npledge to stand with them in their fight for peace and freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10642-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10642-S10645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PRESIDENTIAL ABILITY TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nsubmit for the Record two very thoughtful and well-researched documents \nsubmitted to me by renowned constitutional scholars with respect to the \nPresident's ability to launch an unprovoked military attack against a \nsovereign state.\n  Earlier this year, I wrote to a number of constitutional scholars \nadvising them that I was concerned about reports that our Nation was \ncoming closer to war with Iraq. I asked a number of esteemed academics \ntheir opinion as to whether they believed that the Bush Administration \nhad the authority, consistent with the U.S. Constitution, to introduce \nU.S. Armed Forces into Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power.\n  All of the scholars I consulted responded by stating that, under \ncurrent circumstances, the President did not have such authority. I \nhave previously submitted for the Record the responses of professors \nMichael Glennon of Tufts, and Jane Stromseth of Georgetown University \nLaw Center.\n  Now, I would like to submit two additional responses I received on \nthis same subject from professors Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School \nand William Van Alstyne of the Duke University School of Law. I found \nthe depth and breadth of their scholarship on this subject to be \nextremely impressive and, for this reason, I ask unanimous consent that \ntheir responses to me be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                  Duke University,\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                      Durham, NC., August 7, 2002.\n     Senator Robert C. Byrd,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate\n     Committee on Appropriations,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Byrd: I am writing in response to your letter \n     of July 22 inquiring whether in my opinion, ``the Bush \n     Administration currently has authority, consistent with the \n     U.S. Constitution and the War Powers Resolution, to introduce \n     U.S. Armed Forces into imminent or actual hostilities in Iraq \n     for the purpose of removing Saddam Hussein from Power.'' You \n     raise the question because, as you say, in your letter, you \n     are ``deeply concerned about comments by the Bush \n     Administration and recent press reports that our nation is \n     coming closer to war with Iraq.''\n       I was away from my office at Duke University During the \n     week when your inquiry arrived. Because you understandably \n     asked for a very prompt response, I am foregoing a fuller, \n     more detailed, statement to you just now, the day just \n     following my reading of your letter, on August 6. I shall, \n     however, be pleased to furnish that more elaborate statement \n     on request. Briefly, these are my views:\n       A. The President may not engage our armed forces in ``war \n     with Iraq,'' except in such measure as Congress, by joint or \n     concurrent resolutions duly passed in both Houses of \n     Congress, declares shall be undertaken by the President as \n     Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. As Commander in \n     Chief, i.e., in fulfilling that role, the President is solely \n     responsible for the conduct of whatever measures of war \n     Congress shall authorize. It is not for the President, \n     however, to presume to ``authorize himself'' to embark on \n     war.\n       Whether the President deems it essential to the National \n     interest to use the armed forces of the United States to make \n     war against one of our neighbors, or to make war against \n     nations yet more distant from our shores, it is all the same. \n     The Constitution requires that he not presumed to do so \n     merely on his own assessment and unilateral order. Rather, \n     any armed invasions of or actual attack on another nation by \n     the armed forces of the United States as an act of war \n     requires decision by Congress before it proceeds, not after \n     the President would presume to engage in war (and, having \n     unilaterally commenced hostilities, then would merely \n     confront Congress with a ``take-it-or-leave it'' fait \n     accomplis). The framers of the Constitution understood the \n     difference vividly--and made provision against vesting any \n     war-initiating power in the Executive.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ It is today, even as it was when Thomas Jefferson wrote \n     to James Madison from Paris, in September, 1789, referring \n     then to the constitutional clauses putting the responsibility \n     and power to embark on war in Congress rather than in the \n     Executive. And thus Jefferson observed: ``We have given, in \n     example, one effectual check to the dog of war, by \n     transferring the power of letting him loose from the \n     Executive to the Legislative body, from those who are to \n     spend to those who are to pay.'' C. Warren, The Making of the \n     Constitution 481 n. 1 (1928). (See also Chief Justice Johnson \n     Marshall's Opinion for the Supreme Court in Talbot v. Seeman, \n     5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 1,28 (1803) (``The whole powers of war \n     being, by the constitution of the United States, vested in \n     congress, the acts of that body can alone be resorted to as \n     our guides.'')\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       B. Nor does the form of government of--or any policy \n     currently pursued by--an identified foreign nation affect \n     this matter, although either its form of government or the \n     policies it pursues may of course bear substantially on the \n     decision as shall be made by Congress. Whether, for example, \n     the current form of government of Iraq is so dangerous that \n     no recourse to measures short of direct United States \n     military assault to ``remove'' that government (a clear act \n     of war) now seem sufficient to meet the security needs either \n     of the United States or of other states with which we \n     associate our vital interests, may well be a fair question. \n     That is a fair question, however, is merely what therefore \n     also makes it right for Congress to debate that question.\n       Indeed, it appears even now that Congress is engaged in \n     that debate. And far from feeling it must labor under any \n     sense of apology\n\n[[Page S10643]]\n\n     in conducting that debate--whether or not some in the \n     executive department of elsewhere express irritation over \n     what they regard as presumptuous by Congress, it is not \n     presumptuous but entirely proper. It is what the Constitution \n     assigned to Congress the responsibility to do.\n       C. And first, with respect to that debate, suppose it were \n     the case of the President believed that measures of war were \n     not now necessary and ought not be passed by Congress, at \n     least not at this time. I put the point this way the better \n     to clear the air to make a neutral observation of the \n     respective roles.--Were he of that view, without doubt he \n     shall so advise Congress. And equally without doubt, Congress \n     should desire and welcome him to do so, not merely from \n     respect for his office, rather, at least equally because both \n     his information and his views would be among the most \n     important considerations Congress should itself take into \n     account.\n       D. But the same is true in the reverse circumstance as \n     well. It is altogether the right prerogative of the President \n     to lay before Congress every consideration which, in the \n     President's judgment, requires that measures of direct \n     military intervention in Iraq now be approved by Congress, \n     lest the security of the nation be even more compromised than \n     it already is.\\2\\ If the President believes we cannot any \n     longer, by measures short of war, now avoid the unacceptable \n     risk of weapons of mass destruction from developing under a \n     repressive Iraq regime already defiant of various earlier \n     resolutions by the United Nations Security Council, it is by \n     all means his prerogative and his responsibility as President \n     candidly, even bluntly, to say so--to Congress.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ Exactly as President Jefferson did in reporting to \n     Congress in equivalent circumstances, in 1801. Thus, his \n     urgent message to Congress reviewed attacks recently made \n     against American commercial vessels in the Mediterranean, \n     reported defensive steps already taken in repelling those \n     attacks, and then declared the following. ``The Legislature \n     will doubtless consider whether by authorizing measures of \n     offense also, they will place our force on an equal footing \n     with that of its adversaries. I communicate all material \n     information on this subject, that in the exercise of this \n     important function confided by the Constitution to the \n     Legislature exclusively, their judgment may form itself on a \n     knowledge and consideration of every circumstance of \n     weight.'' 22 Annals of Cong. 11 (1801), reprinted inn 1 \n     Messages and Papers of the Presidents, 1789-1897, ata 326-27 \n     (J. Richardson ed. 1898) (emphasis added.)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       And he may as part of that address, accordingly request \n     from Congress that he now be appropriately authorized, as \n     President and as Commander in Chief, ``to deploy and engage \n     the armed forces of the United States in such manner and \n     degree as the President determines to be necessary \n     in affecting such change of government in Iraq'' . . . as \n     will remove that peril, or accomplish such other \n     objectives (if any) as Congress may specify in its \n     authorizing resolution. Supposing Congress agrees, the \n     resolution will be approved, and the authority of the \n     President to proceed, consistent with that resolution, \n     will be at once both established and clear.\n       E. Equally, however, in the event that Congress does not \n     agree. That is, insofar as, despite whatever presentation the \n     President shall make (or shall have made), Congress is \n     unpersuaded that such military intervention under the \n     direction of the President as he may propose is now \n     appropriate to authorize and approve, it may assuredly \n     decline to do so. In that circumstance, and until Congress \n     shall decide otherwise, matters also settled and equally \n     clear. The President may not then proceed to embark upon a \n     deliberate course of war against the government or people of \n     Iraq.\n       F. And correspondingly, however, the President is not to be \n     faulted in that circumstance, insofar as authorization by \n     Congress for military intervention or other measures of war \n     is withheld. For the responsibility (and any fault--if fault \n     it be) then will rest with Congress, even as the Constitution \n     contemplates that it should.\n       In short, the President acquits himself well by making full \n     report to Congress of information, and of his reasons, and of \n     his judgment, as to what the circumstances now require of the \n     nation, in his own view. That Congress may disagree is no \n     reflection upon the President nor, necessarily, upon itself. \n     Rather, it but reminds us of which department of our national \n     government is charged by the Constitution to decide whether \n     and when we shall move from a position of peace, however \n     strained, to one of war. By constitutional designation, that \n     department is assuredly the legislative department, not the \n     executive.\n       G. I do not here presume to address the limited \n     circumstance in which the country comes under attack, in \n     which event the President may assuredly take whatever \n     emergency measures to resist and repel it are reasonably \n     required to that end. Likewise, in respect to exigent \n     circumstances of U.S. forces or American citizens lawfully \n     stationed, or temporarily resident, in areas outside the \n     United States in which local hostilities may unexpectedly \n     occur, with respect to which intervention to effectuate safe \n     rescue will not be regarded as an act of war. Neither these \n     nor other variant possibilities were raised by your letter, \n     however, so I leave them for another day.\n       You also asked for comments respecting three previous Joint \n     Resolutions by Congress, i.e., whether any of these, or some \n     combination, constitute a sufficient basis for the President \n     to proceed to engage whatever magnitude of invasive forces \n     would be necessary to overthrow Iraq's current government \n     and/or seek out and destroy or remove such weapons of mass \n     destruction, as well as the means of their production, as \n     that invading force would be authorized to accomplish. \n     Specifically, you adverted to The War Powers Resolution of \n     1973 (Pub. L. No. 93-148, Nov. 7, 1973); The Authorization \n     for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 1991 \n     (Pub. L. No. 102-1, Jan. 14, 1991); and The Authorization for \n     Use Military Force Resolution of 2001 (Pub. L. No. 107-40, \n     Sept. 18, 2002).\n       As to the first of these, the ``War Powers Resolution of \n     1973'' (or War Powers Act as it is sometimes informally \n     called), I am very clear that it is certainly not a \n     Resolution authorizing or directing the President now to \n     engage the armed forces of the United States in acts of war \n     within or against Iraq. As to the second and third, I do not \n     believe they can serve that function either, though there is \n     some more reasonable margin for disagreement--one which \n     Congress itself, however, is frankly far between situated to \n     attempt to resolve than I do anyone else so removed from a \n     fuller record one would need to be of more than marginal \n     help.\n       The reasons for my uncertainty regarding the Joint \n     Resolution of 1991 (specifically captioned by Congress as \n     ``The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq \n     Resolution'') will take but a few sentences to share. That \n     this Resolution did authorize what became ``Operation Desert \n     Storm'' as a major use of the war power, against Iraq \n     specifically, under the direction of the President (with \n     collaborative forces of other nations), and the use of \n     massive force, including bombardment and invasion of Iraq, is \n     unequivocal. A declared objective sought to be achieved (and \n     thus part of the described scope of the authorized use of \n     force) was . . . to ``achieve implementation of'' . . . \n     eleven United Nations Security Council Resolutions, each \n     identified by specific number. The Resolution also required \n     (i.e., ``the President shall submit'') the President ``at \n     least once every 60 days'' to submit to Congress a summary on \n     the status ``of efforts to obtain compliance by Iraq'' with \n     those resolutions.\n       Foremost among the stated objectives of that authorized use \n     of war power was to force the unconditional withdrawal of \n     Iraq forces from Kuwait and restoration of that country's \n     ``independence and legitimate government.'' As much as that \n     has surely been accomplished--was well accomplished fully a \n     decade ago.\n       However, the Resolution also recited that ``Iraq's \n     conventional, chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and \n     ballistic missile programs and its demonstrated willingness \n     to use weapons of mass destruction pose a grave threat to \n     world peace.'' Thus, it was also in contemplation of that \n     ``grave threat'' the United States was willing to make the \n     commitment as it did. And we have the President's report (as \n     I must assume Congress has received it) that that threat has \n     not yet abated, indeed, may have been renewed.\n       Moreover, it is additionally true that in a significant \n     sense, our ``invasion'' of Iraq, proper as it was immediately \n     following this authorization by Congress (and still may be), \n     continues to this very day. It does so, as the Congress is \n     well aware in a variety of ways, but most notably by the \n     continuing armed overflights through large swaths of Iraq air \n     space, and the continuing forcible interdiction of Iraqi \n     installations in large areas of Iraq (north and south) by \n     direct military force. So, in one reasonable perspective, \n     there has simply been a continuing, albeit immensely reduced \n     and attenuated ``war'' with Iraq, under the direction of the \n     President, and within the boundaries of that original \n     Resolution of 1991.\n       Still, it is far from certain that these elements are \n     enough insofar as the President may now propose to ``re-\n     escalate'' the conflict in enormous magnitude: (a) to \n     overthrow the government of Iraq and (b) insert whatever \n     invading force as he would deem required to locate and \n     destroy any existing stores of weapons of ``mass \n     destruction,'' and the means of their production. The \n     principal basis for that uncertainty (at least my own \n     uncertainty) is twofold. First, that the express \n     authorization made by Congress in 1991 was, as noted above, \n     to use all necessary military force ``to achieve \n     implementation of'' certain specifically numbered UN Security \n     Council Resolutions, none of which I have had the opportunity \n     to read or study, and therefore cannot resolve for suitable \n     fit today. It is my impression that with the exception of \n     ourselves (and perhaps the British), however, that members of \n     the Security Council may not now regard those decade-old \n     resolutions as adequate for the United States to use as an \n     adequate sanction to ``reignite'' a virtual full-scale war, \n     as distinct from the continuing overflights, but I am in no \n     position to speak to that question as well as others. \n     Similarly, I should think it best for Congress itself, to \n     resolve whether the decade-old Resolution enacted by Congress \n     in 1991 can cover the present case as well though, in my own \n     view, it probably does not.\n       Third, and most recent among the resolutions you enclosed, \n     is the express ``Authorization for Use of United States Armed \n     Forces'' by Congress, adopted on September 18, 2001, \n     following the cataclysmic events of September 11. The \n     authorization is quite current and it calls expressly for the \n     use of U.S. Armed Forces ``against those responsible for the \n     recent attacks launched against the United States.'' It is \n     also framed in the following quite inclusive terms, in \n     Sec. 2(a), that:\n       [T]he President is authorized to use all necessary and \n     appropriate force against\n\n[[Page S10644]]\n\n     those nations, organizations, or persons he determines \n     planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist \n     attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such \n     organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts \n     of international terrorism against the United States by such \n     nations, organizations or persons.\n       I nonetheless think it doubtful that this will ``stretch'' \n     to cover a proposal to use military force to overthrow the \n     government of Iraq as is currently being considered, without \n     authorization by Congress, absent quite responsible evidence \n     that Iraq was involved in ``the terrorist attacks that \n     occurred on Sept. 11, 2001''--evidence that may exist but not \n     that I have seen reported in the press or elsewhere. I note, \n     respectfully, that the authorization is not an ``open-ended'' \n     one to authorize the use of military power against any \n     nations, organizations, or persons whom the President \n     identifies as proper targets insofar as it would merely help \n     in some general sense to ``prevent'' future terroristic \n     attacks by such nations, organizations, or persons. Rather, \n     it is to permit such uses of military power only with \n     reference to those identified as having contributed in some \n     substantial manner to the September 11th attacks, or known \n     now to be harboring such persons.\n       But in this effort not to neglect your several requests, I \n     have (more than?) reached my limit to try to be of immediate \n     assistance to you and your committee. The portions of this \n     letter I would emphasize are in its first half, the portions \n     dealing with the constitutional questions reviewed in letter \n     sections A. through F. I wish you well with your \n     deliberations.\n           Sincerely,\n     William Van Alstyne.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Harvard University,\n\n\n                                                   Law School,\n\n                                     Cambridge, MA, July 31, 2002.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: I share the concern expressed in your \n     letter of July 22, 2002, about recent reports that our nation \n     is approaching war with Iraq. I wish I had the time to give \n     your questions regarding those reports the detailed and \n     thoroughly documented reply they deserve. Unfortunately, I \n     will have to be content with a brief statement of my \n     conclusions and of the basic reasons for them.\n       My study of the United States Constitution and its history, \n     as a scholar and teacher of American constitutional law over \n     the past thirty years, has suggested to me no authority for \n     the President, acting as the Commander in Chief, to wage a \n     purely preemptive war against another nation without at least \n     consulting with Congress first, and without obtaining from \n     Congress a formal authorization, whether in the form of a \n     declaration of war or, at the least, a joint resolution \n     expressing the assent of both the House and the Senate--with \n     the exception of so exigent an emergency as to admit of no \n     time for such consultation and authorization without mortal \n     and imminent peril to our nation.\n       Of course, if the President were to learn, for example, \n     that another nation was about to launch a massive \n     thermonuclear attack on the United States, and if there \n     genuinely appeared to be no possibility of deterring such an \n     attack by threatening a fatal counterstrike or by pursuing \n     diplomatic alternatives consistent with our national \n     security, then presumably the U.S. Constitution would not tie \n     the President's hands by committing the Executive Branch to a \n     course that would spell our virtually certain destruction as \n     a nation. As many have famously observed, our Constitution is \n     not a suicide pact. But that exception for cases of self-\n     defense cannot be treated so elastically that the exception \n     threatens to swallow the rule.\n       In circumstances when the President takes the position that \n     delaying a mobilization and deployment of our armed forces to \n     attack another sovereign state while Congress debates the \n     matter, although not necessarily threatening our nation's \n     imminent destruction, would nonetheless expose us to grave \n     and unacceptable danger by letting the optimal moment for a \n     preventive attack pass as that hostile state proceeds to \n     accumulate rapidly deployable weapons of mass destruction and \n     moves inexorably toward unleashing those weapons on us or on \n     our allies, either directly or through proxies, it would be \n     difficult to defend a completely doctrinaire response to the \n     questions your letter addressed to me. In so ambiguous a \n     situation, the allocation of power between the President and \n     Congress is not a matter that admits of absolutely confident \n     and unambiguous assertions, for the Constitution's framers \n     wisely left considerable areas of gray between the black \n     and white that often characterize the views of advocates \n     on both sides of the invariably heated controversies that \n     attend instances of warmaking.\n       That said, it remains my view, as I wrote in volume one of \n     the 2000 edition of my treatise, ``American Constitutional \n     Law,'' Sec. 4-6, at page 665, ``although the Constitution \n     does not explicitly say that the President cannot initiate \n     hostilities without first consulting with and gaining the \n     authentic approval of Congress, that conclusion flows \n     naturally, if not quite inescapably, from the array of \n     congressional powers over military affairs and especially the \n     provisions in Article I, Sec. 8, clause 11, vesting in \n     Congress the power to declare war. To permit the President \n     unilaterally to commit the Nation to war would read out of \n     the Constitution the clause granting to the Congress, and to \n     it alone, the authority `to declare war.' '' (Footnotes \n     omitted.) Whether with the aid of the War Powers Resolution \n     of 1973--a resolution that some have regarded as a quasi-\n     constitutional articulation of the boundaries between the \n     Presidency and the Congress--or without regard to that much \n     mooted (and arguably question-begging) assertion of \n     congressional power to draw those boundary lines for itself--\n     one would be hard-pressed to defend the proposition that, \n     simply because the President thinks it inconvenient to bring \n     Congress into his deliberations and to await Congress's \n     assent, he may suddenly proceed, like the kings and emperors \n     of old, unilaterally to unleash the dogs of war.\n       I put to one side the profound lesson of our ill-fated \n     involvement in Vietnam--the lesson, as I see it, that a \n     President who wages war without first assuring himself of the \n     deep national consensus and commitment that can come only \n     from a thorough national ventilation of the arguments pro and \n     con plunges the nation into a perilous and probably doomed \n     course. Purely from the perspective of wise policy, that is a \n     lesson one hopes is not lost on our President, or at least on \n     his closest advisors, many of whom would seem to be astute \n     students of American history. But it is probably for the \n     best, in the long run, that the Constitution does not \n     invariably enjoin wisdom upon those who wield power in its \n     name. It leaves each of the three great branches of the \n     national government free to make serious, even tragic, \n     blunders--a fate from which not one of the three branches of \n     government is immune. In any event, I reach the \n     constitutional conclusions expressed in this letter not by \n     virtue of any firm convictions one way or the other about the \n     path of wisdom in the difficult circumstances we face when \n     dealing with as malevolent and dangerous a leader as Iraq's \n     Saddam Hussein. I lack the hubris to pretend that I know \n     better than the President and his Administration just what \n     the path of wisdom is in this matter. My very substantial \n     doubt that the President has constitutional authority to \n     launch a preemptive or preventive strike against Iraq \n     therefore represents as detached a reading as I am capable of \n     giving the relevant constitutional text, structure, and \n     history.\n       It seems quite clear that S.J. Res. 23 (Pub. L. No. 107-\n     40), the joint resolution authorizing the use of U.S. \n     military force against those responsible for the attacks of \n     September 11, 2001, would not furnish the requisite \n     congressional assent to any such strike against Iraq, or even \n     to the introduction of U.S. armed forces into imminent or \n     actual military hostilities in Iraq for the purpose of \n     removing Saddam Hussein from power. Unless convincing \n     evidence of Iraq's involvement in the terrorist attacks of \n     September 11 were to emerge, that joint resolution could not \n     be said to offer even a fig leaf of cover for such a military \n     campaign. To its credit, the Bush Administration does not \n     appear to have suggested the contrary.\n       Nor could anyone argue that Pub. L. 102-1, enacted in 1991 \n     to authorize the use of military force by President George \n     H.W. Bush against Iraq to repel its invasion of Kuwait, \n     offers any basis for a current military campaign to topple \n     the Hussein government. To be sure, that enactment, \n     promulgated pursuant to U.N. Security Council Resolution 678 \n     to achieve the implementation of previous Security Council \n     resolutions, may well have authorized U.S. armed forces to \n     proceed to Baghdad at the time of Operation Desert Storm had \n     the first President Bush decided to take that course. But he \n     did not, and the time to complete that military thrust--a \n     thrust that was abruptly ended a decade ago--has long since \n     passed, the causus beli of that occasion now long behind us.\n       The circumstances that Saddam Hussein's government is \n     undoubtedly in violation of numerous commitments that \n     government made to the United Nations as a condition of the \n     termination of Operation Desert Storm--commitments regarding \n     access for U.N. inspectors to confirm that Iraq is not in \n     fact developing and secretly storing lethal materials related \n     to weapons of mass destruction--cannot by itself eliminate \n     the constitutional requirement of congressional authorization \n     for the waging of war by our armed forces.\n       One might, finally, imagine someone arguing that the \n     absence of congressional debate and authorization should not \n     be deemed fatal to the constitutionality of a preemptive \n     military strike on Iraq for the pragmatic reason that such a \n     debate would disclose too much to the enemy, depriving our \n     plans of the shield of secrecy and our troops of the safety \n     such a shield might provide. But any such argument--whatever \n     constitutional standing it might have in other \n     circumstances--would, of course, be unavailing on this \n     occasion, if only because whatever shield secrecy might \n     otherwise have provided has been rendered moot by the Bush \n     Administration's repeated floating of trail balloons on the \n     subject. Not to put too fine a point on it, whatever cover a \n     secret military attack on Iraq might have enjoyed has by now \n     been thoroughly blown.\n       I am therefore constrained to conclude that, on the basis \n     of the facts as I understand them, the Bush Administration \n     does not currently have sufficient constitutional and/or \n     legislative authority to introduce U.S. armed forces into \n     Iraq in order to wage war on that nation's government--even \n     for the overwhelmingly salutary purpose of toppling\n\n[[Page S10645]]\n\n     an authoritarian regime that has deployed weapons of mass \n     destruction against its own people, that is overtly and \n     overwhelmingly hostile to our nation, that threatens the \n     security and stability of some of our closest friends and \n     allies, and that besmirches the very idea of human rights.\n       If the President would use military force against the \n     government in Baghdad, he must first consult with and obtain \n     the consent of the Congress.\n       With best regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n     Laurence H. Tribe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10645-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF SENATOR JESSE HELMS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nlongtime colleague from my neighboring State of North Carolina, Senator \nJesse Helms.\n  It has been my honor and great privilege to have worked so closely \nwith this fine Senator for the past thirty years. Senator Helms has \nbeen one of the great Senate leaders of the 20th century. After serving \nin the United States Navy during World War II, Senator Helms went on to \nhave an illustrious career in journalism. He began his reporting career \nas the city editor of The Raleigh News and later served as the editor \nof the Tarheel Banker, which became the largest State banking \npublication in our Nation. During his many years of reporting and as a \ntop Executive at Capitol Broadcasting Company, his editorials appeared \nin more than 200 newspapers and more than 70 radio stations in North \nCarolina. During these years, he also served on the Raleigh City \nCouncil.\n  In 1972, Jesse ran for the Senate. It was my privilege to campaign \nthroughout the State with him, forging a friendship which I treasure. \nSince his election, Senator Helms has served our Nation with nothing \nbut class, integrity, and honesty. During his five terms in the United \nStates Senate, his service has been marked by countless significant \nachievements for our great Nation. Admired and respected by both \nparties, he truly embodies the qualities of a superior statesman. \nSenator Helms is to be applauded for his work on the Committee of \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, the Rules and Administration \nCommittee, and for his work as Chairman and now ranking Minority member \nof the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  His numerous awards reflect the many and varied contributions he has \nmade to the Senate and to his State. He was the first Republican to \nreceive the Golden Gavel for presiding over the Senate more than 117 \nhours in 1973. Along with others, he holds the Gold Medal of Merit from \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars and on three occasions was named the Most \nAdmired Conservative in Congress by Readers Digest. I would also like \nto note Senator Helms has received the Guardian of Small Business Award \nand the Watchdog of the Treasury Award every year since his 1973 \nelection.\n  Jesse certainly represents the qualities of a true southern \ngentleman. He is a loving husband, father, and grandfather, a devout \nBaptist, and an individual who would stop at nothing to help his fellow \nNorth Carolinians. His wife, Dot, is a lady of grace and charm. They \nare an admirable couple and a wonderful example for others to follow.\n  For thirty years, the tireless Senator Helms has carried out his \nduties as United States Senator with the utmost sense of honor. His \ndedicated service to our Nation has set an example for all to follow, \nand I have been privileged to have served with such an esteemed \nindividual. It is because of leaders like Senator Helms that our Nation \nis the greatest in the world. As the 107th Congress pays tribute and \nsays farewell to one of the greatest Senators of all time, I say thank \nyou to my colleague and my close friend.\n  Again, I congratulate Jesse on his lengthy and distinguished career \nand thank him for the friendship we have enjoyed during our many years \nworking together. On behalf of myself, my colleagues, and a most \ngrateful Nation, I express my gratitude for his outstanding service to \nthe United States Senate. I wish him, his lovely wife Dot, three \nchildren, Jane, Nancy, and Charles, and his seven grandchildren the \nbest of luck and continued health and happiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10645-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10645-S10646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE CLEAN WATER ACT: 30 YEARS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on the 30th anniversary of the Clean Water \nAct, I am pleased to acknowledge progress in the cleanup of our \nNation's lake and rivers. The goals were ambitious. Congress envisioned \na nation of fishable, swimmable rivers and lakes, and zero discharges \nof harmful pollutants. While we have not reached those goals, the steps \nwe have taken have improved the quality of our water, including the \nnatural, and national, resources embodied in the Great Lakes.\n  As cochair of the Great Lakes Task Force, I have worked with other \nMembers to pass appropriations and targeted legislation to protect our \nNation's largest inland body of water. The citizens of Michigan and \nseven other adjoining States recognize the value of the Great Lakes \nsystem to industry, transportation, water resources, and recreation--a \nvital link in a long chain of waterways that enhance our economy, \nprovide pleasurable pastimes, and protect our health.\n  That's why I authored the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act in 1990 \nthat amended the Clean Water Act; these changes help States measure and \ncontrol pollutants discharged into the Great Lakes. My bill helped set \nuniform, science-based water quality criteria, ensuring that citizens \nthroughout the system share the burdens and benefits of reducing \nharmful pollutants that can affect human health. It also provided for \ncontrol and cleanup of contaminated sediments that leach into the \nwater, affecting people, fish, and wildlife.\n  I have helped secure other protections for wild creatures through the \nGreat Lakes Basin Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act. This legislation \nprovides a framework and funding for studying and adopting measures to \nrestore healthy fish, bird, and animal populations and to manage \nfisheries responsibly.\n  Nonpoint source pollution contaminants discharged into water over a \nbroad area are widely recognized as a major problem. The Great Lakes \nSoil Erosion and Sediment Control Program will help. This 2002 farm \nbill program provides grants for education on agricultural techniques, \nsuch as contoured farming and planting of vegetation along banks, that \nreduce the runoff of pesticides and other chemicals into streams and \nrivers.\n  Other legislation has set standards and enabled technology for \nreducing soil erosion, controlling sediment runoff, and creating \nenvironmental research labs specifically targeting the problems of the \nGreat Lakes.\n  Even with our successes, however, EPA reports that more than 40 \npercent of our Nation's waterways remain too polluted for fishing, \nswimming, and other activities. Municipal sewage discharges and urban \nstorm sewers continue to dump massive amounts of pollutants into our \nwater. And more needs to be done in our cities, our industries, and our \nfarms.\n  Thus the fight for water quality continues. In this Congress, I have \nintroduced legislation to protect Great Lakes waters from invasive \nspecies the zebra mussel, Asian carp, and other intruders that enter \nU.S. waters through maritime commerce and on the hulls of ships. These \nintruders can damage ecosystems and wipe out entire populations of \nnative fish.\n  I have also asked the Senate to consider the Great Lakes Legacy Act. \nThis bill would provide funds for States to cleanup and restore areas \nof special concern, which do not meet the basic water quality standards \nlaid out in a 1972 United States Canada agreement. These areas include \nsome vital passages between the Great Lakes, including Michigan's \nDetroit and St. Clair Rivers.\n  Funding water quality management activities and improvements in \nenvironmental infrastructure is one of my highest priorities. Even now, \nCongress is exploring ways to improve funding for the construction of \nwastewater treatment plants to help control urban sewer and stormwater \noverflows, a huge source of nonpoint source pollution.\n  Even as we implement new measures, the Bush administration threatens \na sweeping dismantlement of existing Clean Water Act safeguards by \nremoving Federal oversight, allowing polluters to ``buy'' credits that \nwould permit the continuation of harmful practices, and reneging on the \ndecades-old\n\n[[Page S10646]]\n\ncommitment to protect the Nation's wetlands.\n  The diligence of Congress, previous administrations, Federal and \nState agencies, and dedicated citizens helped us pass the Clean Water \nAct and other tough measures needed to preserve and protect water \nresources. We must stand guard over these gains and move forward, not \nbackward, with even more effective measures. Clean water is a \nprivilege, a pleasure, and something we can't live without.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, tomorrow, as we recognize the 30th \nanniversary of the amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control \nAct, the Clean Water Act, I want to take a moment to reflect on the \nimportance of this cornerstone of environmental legislation and to \nfrankly address the significant amount of work that remains to be done.\n  Vermont is a shining example to the Nation in terms of its \nenvironmental ethics and in its commitment to environmental action. I \nam proud to hail from and to represent a State whose people share a \npassionate and abiding concern for the environment.\n  We Vermonters are especially proud that much of the environmental \nprogress and improvements to water the Nation has achieved in the last \nthree decades can be directly attributed to the legacy of Vermont's own \nRobert Stafford. Bob Stafford's leadership in Congress helped shape \nnational environmental policy from the time that the environmental \nmovement was in its infancy and continued well into its maturity.\n  During his 30 years in the House of Representatives and in the \nSenate, Bob Stafford courageously and successfully stood up to those \nwho sought to diminish and roll back our environmental standards. His \nefforts were heightened during his tenure as Chairman of the Committee \non Environment and Public Works, a post he assumed in 1981 during the \n97th Congress and maintained through the 99th. One of his crowning \nachievements during this time was working with Senator John Chafee to \npass the Clean Water Act.\n  Although we should be proud of the great strides we have made to \nreduce and prevent the levels of pollutants and contaminants in our \nwater, we are far from the visionary goals and ambitious standards set \nby those who conceived this vital legislation 30 years ago. When \nSenator Stafford testified before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee last week, he clearly challenged us to do more. We cannot \nhalt the progress we have made and merely rest on our environmental \nlaurels.\n  I call upon my colleagues, the administration and the American public \nto look back at the debate that took place at the time and the essence \nof this remarkable piece of legislation. The 1972 legislation declared \nas its objective the restoration and maintenance of the chemical, \nphysical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters. Two goals \nalso were established: zero discharge of pollutants by 1985 and, as an \ninterim goal and where possible, water quality that is both \n``fishable'' and ``swimmable'' by 1983.\n  Although we have had more than twice that amount of time to meet \nthese goals, we have only managed to get half-way there. According to \nEPA's 2000 National Water Quality Report released earlier this year, 39 \npercent of assessed river and stream miles and 45 percent of assessed \nlake acres do not meet applicable water quality standards and were \nfound to be impaired for one or more desired uses.\n  In Vermont, too many of our waters still fall into this category. \nOver the last 30 years, we have addressed many of the point-sources of \nwater pollution in Lake Champlain, the Connecticut River and other \nwater bodies around the State. Unfortunately, we learn about new \npollution concerns all the time. Years of unchecked pollution from \ncoal-fired power plants outside of Vermont's borders have overburdened \nLake Champlain and many of our rivers with mercury. Vermont now has \nfish advisories for walleye, lake trout and bass due to mercury.\n  There are solutions to this environmental challenge and others that \nthreaten the health of Vermont's waters. We just need to act on them. \nInstead, I worry that we are ignoring the warning signs, such as \nclimate change, new health problems in our children, loss of our \nnatural resources to pests and disease.\n  By its actions I fear that the current administration seems to be \ninterested in protecting special interests and ignoring public support \nfor strong environmental protections and conservation measures. Just in \nthe last few months, the administration has announced plans to rewrite \nClean Water Act regulations that would allow dirt displaced by mountain \ntop mining to be dumped in waterways. Army Corps of Engineers' \nregulations protecting wetlands have been relaxed, backing away from \nthe decade-old commitment of no net loss of wetlands.\n  Instead of looking at ways to undercut the Clean Water Act, we need \nto get back on track and strengthen it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10646-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10646-S10648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE LEADERSHIP IN UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the current leadership in Ukraine, led by \nPresident Leonid Kuchma, has been one of unmet promises. Failed efforts \nat economic reform, violent repression of independent media; and a rise \nin government corruption and cronyism has robbed the citizens of \nUkraine of the bright future they deserve.\n  Ukraine is a vital country of 48 million people in the heart of \nEurope. A Europe whole, free and secure cannot be achieved without \nUkraine's integration into Europe. However, I have become convinced \nthat the actions of Ukraine's President Kuchma have demonstrated to the \npeople of Ukraine and the world that their integration cannot be \nachieved with Kuchma at the helm.\n  Secret recordings made by a former security guard, who is now seeking \nasylum in the United States, raise suspicions that President Kuchma had \nknowledge of or involvement in the brutal murder of journalist Gyorgi \nGongadze. This callous act shows that he will stop at nothing to \nrepress the opposition and independent media who challenge his control.\n  As the United States and the international community are striving to \neliminate the threat posed by Iraq's possession of weapons of mass \ndestruction, evidence shows that President Kuchma approved the sale of \nthe Kolchuga radar--an advanced system whose purpose is to threaten \nU.S. aircraft in violation of United Nations sanctions. The State \nDepartment recently confirmed the authenticity of an audio recording of \nPresident Kuchma approving the sale of a Kochulga radar system to Iraq \nin July 2000. Iraq has fired anti-aircraft missiles at coalition \naircraft and while our expert pilots are trained to counter such \nmeasures, the Kolchuga radar system gives a boost to Iraqi air defenses \nby detecting approaching aircraft without tipping off the pilots.\n  Ukraine remains important to the United States, we must stand firm \nwith the people and the brave reformers who hope for a better day for \nUkraine. However, President Kuchma's day has passed. He deserves \nnothing more than what his actions bring him, isolation.\n  In bilateral meetings the United States should continue to meet at a \nministerial level and in important multilateral organizations we should \nstrive for the same. This includes NATO. At NATO's Prague Summit next \nmonth, the scheduled NATO-Ukraine Council meeting is an important \nopportunity for NATO and Ukraine to look for greater cooperation. On a \nrange of issues, Ukraine has certain assets such as strategic lift \nwhich could be beneficial to our European NATO allies who lack such \ncapabilities. NATO should conduct this meeting at the Ministerial level \nrather than at a Presidential level and send an important signal to the \ngovernment of Ukraine. To do otherwise would result in President Bush \nsitting two seats down from a corrupt leader who is arming Iraq at a \nSummit which will likely focus on a possible war with Iraq.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following articles that appeared in \nthe Wall Street Journal on October 9, and The Washington Post on August \n8 and September 22 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 9, 2002]\n\n                       Ukraine's Rogue President\n\n                         (By Adrian Karatnycky)\n\n       In his speech Monday night, President Bush laid out the \n     threat posed by the Iraqi regime should it be able to ``buy, \n     produce or\n\n[[Page S10647]]\n\n     steal'' the ingredients for a nuclear weapon. But while the \n     idea that any nation would willingly aid the murderous \n     intentions of Saddam Hussein has long seem far-fetched, the \n     possibility hit close to home in recent days.\n       Just a week before the speech, the Bush administration \n     confirmed that Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma had approved \n     the sale of an antiaircraft radar system to Iraq. President \n     Kuchma's decision, in clear violation of United Nations \n     sanctions, may be the first sign of complications with loose \n     technology in the states of the former Soviet Union.\n\n\n                        deadly know-how for iraq\n\n       Although Ukraine destroyed its last nuclear missile silo \n     last year, the country is still an institutional repository \n     of deadly know-how. It had also, up until last week, been \n     considered a irreproachable friend of the U.S. But the \n     revelation creates doubts which could fundamentally alter the \n     U.S.'s relationship with Ukraine, and particularly with its \n     president. Although Mr. Kuchma has denied any involvement in \n     a sale and offered a joint investigation, the FBI has \n     authenticated a tape of the Ukrainian president and his arms-\n     export chief hatching the scheme.\n       Far from being any old technology, the radar system in \n     question could make a significant difference for Iraq. If the \n     U.S. goes to war, Mr. Kuchma will have tried to provide \n     deadly technology that could cost the lives of American \n     pilots. Whatever the next steps taken against Iraq, Ukraine's \n     president cannot escape without paying a heavy price. If the \n     U.S. succeeds in installing a rigorous U.N. inspections \n     regime, an example must be made of Mr. Kuchma to ensure \n     international compliance with anti-Iraq sanctions.\n       President Bush's anger over the plot by a country that was \n     once the third biggest recipient of U.S. foreign aid is said \n     to be palpable. U.S. officials suggest Mr. Bush is especially \n     livid that Mr. Kuchma plotted the sale to Iraq just before a \n     summit in 2000 with President Clinton, where the U.S.-Ukraine \n     ``strategic partnership'' was celebrated. U.S. officials \n     responsible for Ukraine policy are also indicating they \n     believe Ukraine's ``Kolchuha'' early-warning radar system has \n     been deployed in Iraq, suggesting there is some intelligence \n     data to reach such a conclusion.\n       The new Iraq revelations come in the wake of incriminating \n     details contained in hundreds of additional hours of \n     clandestinely taped conversations of Mr. Kuchma's meetings \n     recorded and smuggled out of the country by his former \n     bodyguard who lives in exile in the U.S. These depict a crude \n     and venal leader at the center of corrupt and criminal \n     behavior. Several of the conversations have been \n     authenticated by the Virginia-based voice analysis firm Bek \n     Tech, headed by a former FBI operative.\n       The behavior appears to fit a pattern. Mr. Kuchma's Ukraine \n     has emerged as a leading supply source for illicit traffic in \n     global arms. In defiance of a U.N. embargo, arms and \n     ammunition of Ukrainian origin have been seized in the \n     weapons caches of Unita guerrillas in Angola. Widespread \n     allegations suggest Ukrainian weapons breached a mid- 1990s \n     arms embargo in the former Yugoslavia and helped equip \n     Afghanistan's Taliban. In 1997, Nigerian authorities alleged \n     that Ukraine was involved in the sale of three aircraft \n     fighters to rebels from Sierra Leone.\n       For years, Ukrainian officials strenuously denied that the \n     illegal arms trade was officially sanctioned. But the \n     authenticated Kuchma tape suggests that while Ukraine is not \n     a rogue state, it has a rogue president. Apart from the Iraq \n     conversation, there is a tape of a meeting between Mr. Kuchma \n     and Oleksander Zhukov, a reputed underworld figure with ties \n     to Leonid Minin, a suspected international arms dealer.\n       Mr. Kuchma's credibility with the U.S. has been pulverized \n     in recent months. In the summer of 2001, the Ukrainian \n     president apparently lied to National Security Adviser \n     Condoleezza Rice in asserting that Ukraine supported a \n     ``political solution'' to the ethnic conflict in Macedonia. \n     All the while--with his approval--Ukraine persisted in \n     shipping weapons to the Macedonian government.\n       In response to U.S. pressure, Ukraine's legislature will \n     launch an investigation into the Iraq sale. But the \n     legislature has refused to investigate an array of alleged \n     crimes involving the president, including the unsolved \n     murder in 2000 of opposition journalist Gyorgi Gonzadze.\n       With the next presidential election coming in two years, \n     the best hope for Ukraine--and for the U.S.--is in pressuring \n     Mr. Kuchma to step aside quietly in favor of early elections. \n     Demonstrations, which began last month and drew nearly \n     100,000 protestors nationwide, are scheduled to start up \n     again later this month.\n       For Ukraine's president to exit the scene, protests against \n     him must widen--71% of Ukrainians tell pollsters he should \n     go. The reformist former prime minister, Viktor Yushchenko, \n     must try to woo Mr. Kuchma's wavering supporters, among them \n     oligarchs and regional leaders, to support a transition. \n     Diplomatic isolation of Mr. Kuchma by the U.S. and Europe \n     must be airtight and confined to the president and his \n     corrupt cronies, not the entire Ukrainian government or \n     nation. Finally, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stands \n     by Mr. Kuchma, must be convinced that Russian interests would \n     be better served by a reformist-led coalition government \n     including significant representation from Ukraine's pro-\n     Russian eastern regions.\n       The current U.S. review of its Ukraine policy must include \n     initiatives that help encourage these trends while ensuring \n     that change is constitutional and peaceful.\n       For months, Ukraine's rumor mills have been working \n     overtime with hints that a deal to pave the way for a post-\n     Kuchma Ukraine is in the works. One possible compromise would \n     be to give Mr. Kuchma blanket amnesty for past \n     transgressions. Even Yuliya Tymoshenko, a former economic \n     magnate and deputy prime minister who is Mr. Kuchma's most \n     bitter enemy, supports such a deal. As she told me several \n     months ago, ``If one criminal can sleep easily so that the \n     rest of the country can sleep well, then so be it.''\n\n\n                        russia's cynical embrace\n\n       If Mr. Kuchma resigns, Ukraine's Iraq-gate will have borne \n     positive fruit. If he does not, the U.S. will confront two \n     problems: Ukraine's president will demonstrate to other \n     leaders that you can conspire with Iraq and get away with it. \n     And Mr. Kuchma's inevitable isolation will drive Ukraine, a \n     strategically important country of 50 million that sits on \n     NATO's eastern frontier, into Russia's cynical embrace.\n       Both outcomes would cause headaches for Europe and the U.S. \n     But the worst would be if Ukraine's movement toward Europe, \n     democracy and the rule of law is hijacked by Mr. Kuchma's \n     insistence on remaining in office.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 8, 2002]\n\n                          Ukraine and the West\n\n       NATO's coming eastward expansion and its new partnership \n     with Russia have prompted a major change in direction by one \n     of Europe's largest and most unsettled nations, Ukraine. A \n     country of more than 50 million people that is still \n     struggling to gain its political and economic footing after a \n     decade of independence, Ukraine has abruptly dropped its \n     longstanding policy of balancing itself between the West and \n     Russia. Its government recently requested talks on becoming a \n     full member of both NATO and the European Union. The reaction \n     has been guarded: Both European governments and the Bush \n     administration seem unsure whether Ukraine should be a part \n     of the Western alliance in the future, and there is \n     resistance even to upgrading its relations with the EU. But \n     Ukraine is too big to be safely kept on the back burner. The \n     United States and Europe must formulate a clear answer. In \n     some respects, the question of what to do about Ukraine seems \n     easy. Given its huge size, strategic location in southern and \n     central Europe and relatively sophisticated industrial \n     economy, Ukraine is a natural member of the translational \n     organizations that are slowly spreading across the continent. \n     Without Ukraine, the longstanding Western goal of a Europe \n     ``whole and free'' will remain incomplete; without an anchor \n     in those institutions, the country's long-term stability and \n     even its viability as an independent nation could be \n     seriously threatened. Yet Ukraine as it exists today is a \n     most difficult partner for the West to take on. Its economy \n     remains a post-Communist shambles, and though it is nominally \n     a democracy its president, Leonid Kuchma, has frequently \n     resorted to thuggish tactics. His own poll ratings are in \n     single digits, but Mr. Kuchma managed to manipulate a recent \n     parliamentary election so that his cronies, rather than \n     opposition parties that won 70 percent of the popular vote, \n     maintained control.\n       Of even greater concern in Ukraine's involvement in \n     improper arms trafficking and service as a transit point for \n     illegal drugs and other contraband. Floating Western appeals, \n     Ukraine's big weapons companies have shipped arms to \n     Macedonia, Serbia and East Africa; secretly recorded \n     audiotapes suggest that Mr. Kuchma himself at least discussed \n     selling sophisticated antiaircraft systems to Iraq. Iraq \n     recently opened an embassy in Kiev and announced it was \n     interested in purchasing Ukrainian industrial goods and \n     technology.\n       The Bush administration and most European governments have \n     steadily distanced themselves from Mr. Kuchma. Congress has \n     reduced U.S. aid. Some officials argue that Ukraine should \n     not be invited even to begin discussions with NATO on \n     conditions for becoming a member, at least as long as Mr. \n     Kuchma and his cronies are in power. But NATO, which has laid \n     out comprehensive and detailed reform programs for each of \n     the countries seeking membership offers later this year, \n     could also provide a structure for long-term change by \n     Ukraine. A dialogue could constructively begin on such issues \n     as arms sales, drug trafficking and military reform, with the \n     understanding that these are the first steps in a membership \n     preparation process that could extend for a decade. Making \n     countries such as Ukraine fit for the club of Western \n     democracies may not be NATO's first purpose, but the alliance \n     is the best vehicle that exists for managing what is, \n     ultimately, a transition vital to long-term European \n     security.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 22, 2002]\n\n                     Unfinished Business in Europe\n\n                          (By Michael McFaul)\n\n       President Bush has made a strong commitment to a distinct \n     tradition in international diplomacy by stating repeatedly \n     that the United States has a strategic interest in regime \n     change in Iraq. If Iraq changes from\n\n[[Page S10648]]\n\n     dictatorship to democracy, so the argument goes, then Iraq \n     will follow a friendlier foreign policy toward the United \n     States.\n       To make his case, Bush has a powerful historical experience \n     to draw upon: the end of the Cold War. Regime change in \n     Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union fundamentally enhanced \n     American national security. If Iraq possessed Russia's \n     nuclear arsenal today, the United States would be in grave \n     danger. Two decades ago we feared this same arsenal in the \n     hands of the Kremlin. Today we do not. The reason we do not \n     is that the regime in Russia has become more democratic and \n     market-oriented and therefore also more Western-oriented. \n     Unfortunately, the task of promoting democratic regime change \n     in the former Soviet Union is not complete. In rightly \n     focusing on how to promote democratic regimes in the Muslim \n     world, the Bush administration is failing to complete the \n     consolidation of capitalism and democracy in the former \n     communist world and the integration of these new democracies \n     into the Western community of democratic states.\n       To assume that this process of democratization and \n     integration will march forward without American prodding is \n     misguided. First, the lines between East and West in Europe \n     are beginning to harden, not fade. After the next round of \n     expansion, the European Union is very unlikely to offer \n     membership to countries farther to the east in the near \n     future. Bureaucrats in Brussels simply laugh when the idea of \n     Russian or Ukrainian membership in the EU is raised. NATO has \n     moved more aggressively to extend its borders eastward, but \n     it too will become fatigued and inwardly focused after the \n     next round of expansion. If the prospect of membership in \n     NATO and the EU can no longer be considered a foreign policy \n     goal for those left out of the next wave of expansion, then \n     the pull of the West will diminish.\n       Second, democratization on the periphery of Europe has \n     stalled. A dictator who praises Stalin and Hitler runs \n     Belarus. President Vladimir Putin has weakened democratic \n     institutions and grossly violated the human rights of his own \n     citizens in Chechnya in his attempt to build ``managed \n     democracy'' in Russia. In Ukraine, President Leonid Kuchma \n     aspires to create the same level of state control over the \n     democratic process as Putin has achieved in Russia to ensure \n     a smooth--that is, Kuchma-friendly--transition of power when \n     his term ends in 2004. In contrast to Russia, Ukraine has a \n     vibrant democratic opposition, whose leader, Viktor \n     Yuschenko, is likely to win a free and fair presidential \n     election. This vote in 2004 will be free and fair, however, \n     only if the West is watching. Only in Moldova has \n     authorization creep been avoided, but that's because of the \n     weakness of the state, hardly a condition conducive to long-\n     term democratic consolidation.\n       Over time, the combination of a closing Western border and \n     growing authoritar- ianism on the Eastern side of this wall \n     spells disaster for American security interests in the \n     region. As the United States gears up to create new regimes \n     with a democratic and Western orientation in the Middle East, \n     it may be losing the gains of similar efforts of democratic \n     promotion in the communist world during the Cold War.\n       Obviously, President Bush's foreign policy team is \n     overworked and focused now on Iraq. Nonetheless, the United \n     States should be able to conduct more than one foreign policy \n     at the same time. In numerous speeches, Bush has already \n     outlined his grand strategy for foreign policy. He has stated \n     repeatedly that the United States should champion freedom and \n     liberty for people around the world, and when necessary even \n     promote regime change in those countries that do not offer \n     their citizens basic democratic rights. To be a successful \n     and credible doctrine, however, this strategy must be applied \n     consistently.\n       When diplomatic historians look back on the 1990s, they \n     should describe it as the era of European integration. They \n     will do so, however, only if the project is completed. As the \n     Bush administration begins the process of promoting \n     democratic regime change along a new frontier in the Muslim \n     world, it must also finish the job on the European frontier.\n       The writer, a Hoover Fellow and professor of political \n     science at Stanford University, is a senior associate at the \n     Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10648-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            STEPHEN AMBROSE\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nSenator Landrieu's resolution honoring the life of Dr. Stephen E. \nAmbrose, a distinguished historian, storyteller and treasure of the \nState of Wisconsin. Born in Whitewater, WI, Dr. Ambrose attended the \nUniversity of Wisconsin for both his undergraduate and his doctorate, \nmolding a career in American history and embarking on a path he almost \ndidn't take. From his first book, ``Wisconsin Boy in Dixie,'' published \nin 1961, Dr. Ambrose went on to publish more than 30 books, captivating \naudiences, young and old, for 41 years.\n  Dr. Ambrose once said, ``When I'm writing at my best, I want to share \nmy own discoveries with the reader. I want to take people to a new \nunderstanding of an event, an individual or a story. I want them to be \nas amazed as I am.'' It was with this great love for storytelling Dr. \nAmbrose catapulted readers into the horrific, yet glorifying days of \nWorld War II, reigniting old memories and sparking new compassion among \nthose who lived through the era and those who have only read about it \nin history books. He dedicated numerous books to the courage and \nsacrifice of the men and women who fought in World War II and is the \nfounder of The National D-Day Museum in New Orleans, LA, the only \nmuseum in the country dedicated to ``all of the `D-Days' of World War \nII, and to those at home who supported these efforts.''\n  From a little-known history professor came this thunderous voice for \nthe thousands of Americans who fought to preserve the freedom of this \ncountry. His contributions to the historical education of the American \npeople are both priceless and unmatched. His knowledge, enthusiasm and \ndedication to the preservation of hometown heroes and history \nenthusiasts alike will be greatly missed. Speaking on behalf of the \nstate of Wisconsin, this country has certainly lost one of its finest \nhistorians.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10648-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOLD TO H.R. 4125\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise yet again to address the Senate on \nthe subject of military construction projects added to an \nappropriations bill that were not requested by the Department of \nDefense. This bill contains over $900 million in unrequested military \nconstruction projects.\n  I did not object to the unanimous consent request to proceed to a \nvoice vote on the fiscal year 2003 Department of Defense Military \nConstruction appropriations conference report because on the day that \nthis funding bill passed, I had managed the floor for more than 16 \nhours while the Senate proceeded with the serious matter of debating \nand finally approving the Iraqi War Resolution.\n  America remains at war, a war that continues to unite Americans in \npursuit of a common goal, to defeat terrorism. All Americans have, and \nundoubtably in the future will make sacrifices for this war. Many have \nbeen deeply affected by it and at times harmed by difficult, related \neconomic circumstances. Our servicemen and women in particular are \ntruly on the front lines in this war, separated from their families, \nrisking their lives, and working extraordinarily long hours under the \nmost difficult conditions to accomplish the ambitious but necessary \ntask their country has set for them.\n  Every year, I come to the Senate floor to highlight programs and \nprojects added to spending bills for primarily parochial reasons. While \nI recognize that many of the projects added to this bill may be \nworthwhile, the process by which they were selected is not.\n  There are 26 conferees of the Appropriations Military Construction \nConference report who represent 19 States. Of those 19 States only one, \nWisconsin, did not have projects added on this appropriations bill. Of \n119 projects added to this bill, 60 projects are in the states \nrepresented by the MILCON Appropriations Conferees, totaling over $530 \nmillion. Those numbers, needless to say, go well beyond the realm of \nmere coincidence.\n  By adding over $900 million above the President's request, the \nAppropriations Conference Committee is further draining away funds \ndesperately needed for enhancing our warfighting capability. \nCommonsense reforms, closing military bases, consolidating and\n\n[[Page S10649]]\n\nprivatizing depot maintenance, ending ``Buy American'' restrictions, \nand ending pork-barrel spending--that I have long supported would free \nup nearly $20 billion per year which could be used to begin our long-\nneeded military transformation.\n  We are waging a war against a new enemy and at the same time \nundertaking a long-term process to transform our military from its cold \nwar structure to a force ready for the challenges of tomorrow. A lack \nof political will had previously hamstrung the transformation process, \nbut the President and his team have pledged to transform our military \nstructure and operations to meet future threats.\n  The reorganization of our armed services was an extremely important \nsubject before September 11, and it is all the more so now. The threats \nto the security of the United States, to the very lives and property of \nAmericans, have changed in the last decade.\n  In the months ahead, no task before the Administration and the \nCongress will be more important or require greater care and \ndeliberation than making the changes necessary to strengthen our \nnational defense in this new, uncertain era. Needless to say, this \ntransformation process will require enlightened, thoughtful leadership, \nand not the pork-barreling of military funds if we are to best serve \nAmerica in this time of rapid change in the global security \nenvironment.\n  I look forward to the day when my appearances on the Senate floor for \nthis purpose are no longer necessary. I reiterate, over $900 million in \nunrequested military construction projects were added by the Committee \nto the defense appropriations bill. Consider how that $900 million, \nwhen added to the savings gained through additional base closings and \nmore cost-effective business practices, could be used so much more \neffectively.\n  The problems of our Armed Forces, whether in terms of force structure \nor modernization, could be more assuredly addressed and our warfighting \nability greatly enhanced. The American taxpayers expect more of us, as \ndo our brave servicemen and women who are, without question, fighting \nthis war on global terrorism on our behalf.\n  But for now, unfortunately, they must witness us, seemingly blind to \nour responsibilities at this time of war, going about our business as \nusual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10649-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUPPORT FOR OUR TROOPS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to indicate my resolve that \nour men and women in uniform have this Senate's full support in \nwhatever actions might be taken regarding Iraq and in our ongoing war \nagainst terrorism.\n  The question has never been whether Saddam should be disarmed but \nrather how best to accomplish that goal.\n  I was pleased to join with my colleagues, Senator Carl Levin, Chair \nof the Armed Services Committee, Senator Bob Graham, Chair of the \nIntelligence Committee, and Senator Dan Inouye, Chair of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee in supporting a resolution that focused on \nthe creation of an international coalition to enforce a tough \ninspection regime with real deadlines for Saddam along with the \nauthorization of force to disarm him in cooperation with our allies \nthrough the United Nations.\n  But that is not the approach that was passed by this body. I hope \nPresident Bush will wisely use the broad powers that Congress has given \nhim. I continue to hope he will take the time to assemble a worldwide \ncoalition--ready to use force if necessary--that will convince Saddam \nhe has no choice but to disarm.\n  But we have had the debate. We have had the vote. And it is time for \nCongress to show there are no Democrats and no Republicans when it \ncomes to supporting our troops.\n  We have shown that support by quickly passing the Defense \nappropriations bill. This ensures our troops will have the most up-to-\ndate weapons, fast-moving logistical support and the best pay and \nbenefits of any armed forces in the world. This is essential to support \nthese patriots and their families at home.\n  This bill does that by boosting defense spending to more than $355 \nbillion for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1--a $34.4 billion increase \nover last year. This new spending will help not only with any action \nagainst Iraq, but also in honoring our commitments around the world in \nthe global fight against terrorism.\n  It is important to recognize that this bill includes nearly $94 \nbillion to provide for a 4.1 percent pay increase as well as full \nfunding of all authorized benefits for all military personnel.\n  I think all of us agree that war should always be our last choice.\n  But, if it comes to that last resort, I promise that I will do \neverything within my power to ensure that our armed forces have the \nweapons and materials they need to defeat any enemy and expose our \ntroops to the least possible risk.\n  We have to remember that it is not just Iraq that poses a threat. We \nstill have troops in Afghanistan and the Philippines. We have seen new \nterrorist attacks in Kuwait, Bali and against a French oil tanker. The \nwar against terrorism is far from over and our troops need support in \nthat battle as well.\n  Upon our Nation's shoulders have fallen staggering duties as the \nworld's sole remaining superpower. But Americans already stand on the \ntall shoulders of our own history and we do not shrink from these \nburdens.\n  I believe that if we stand tall for our ideals the world will follow \nand we can disarm Iraq and defeat world terrorism as part of a broad \ncoalition of allies.\n  If our country acts alone, our men and women in uniform must always \nknow that their Nation is united behind them in gratitude for their \nservice, in pride of their dedication to duty and in awe of their \nbravery.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10649-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10649-S10650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            U.S. TRADE LAWS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe Senator from West Virginia. On May 23, during the debate of the \ntrade bill, Senator Rockefeller spoke on some of the provisions in the \nTrade Promotion Authority provisions relating to trade remedy laws. \nThere has been continued discussion of these issues over the past \nseveral months, so I would like to take this opportunity to clarify \nthat the points we made in discussing the Senate bill apply equally to \nthe Conference Bill.\n  Section 2102(b)(14) of the TPA bill states that it is a ``principal'' \nU.S. negotiating objective to preserve, in all trade negotiations, the \nability of the United States to enforce rigorously its trade remedy \nlaws and to avoid any agreement that would require weakening of the \ncurrent U.S. antidumping, countervailing duty and safeguard remedies. \nThe Committee on Finance regards strict adherence to this directive as \ncritical in advancing the economic interests of the United States in \nfuture trade agreements.\n  The directive encompasses any weakening of the existing remedies, \nwhether at the level of statute, regulation or agency practice. This \nmeans that the Administration must reject any new international rule or \nobligation whose acceptance would lead to relief under our existing \ntrade laws becoming more difficult, uncertain, or costly for domestic \nindustries to achieve and maintain over time.\n  I want to highlight again some examples of new international \nobligations that have been proposed by WTO members, and that would \nobviously result in a weakening of U.S. trade laws and therefore must \nbe rejected under the standard set out in section 2102(b)(14).\n  These include:\n  No. 1, a ``public interest'' rule politicizing and encumbering the \nadministrative processes under which trade remedy laws are currently \napplied;\n  No. 2, a requirement to exempt from trade remedy measures items \nalleged to be in ``short supply'' in the domestic market;\n  No. 3, a ``lesser duty'' rule limiting antidumping and countervailing \nduties to some amount less than the calculated margin of dumping or \nsubsidy, such as the amount supposedly necessary to offset the injury;\n  No. 4, any extension of faulty dispute resolution models such as \nChapter 19 of the NAFTA;\n  No. 5, changes to the rules for ``sunset'' reviews of antidumping and \nCVD measures which would make it more difficult to keep relief in \nplace;\n  No. 6, additional constraints or criteria for dumping calculations, \nin areas\n\n[[Page S10650]]\n\nwhere current WTO rules and U.S. law vest discretion in the \nadministering authority; and\n  No. 7, special rules and standards that would make it easier for a \nparticular group of countries, such as developing countries, to utilize \ninjurious dumping or subsidies as a means of getting ahead in \ninternational trade.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I agree, and I also want to clarify that section \n2102(b)(14) is a ``no weakening'' provision, and not a ``no net \nweakening'' provision. In other words, it encompasses any new \ninternational obligation whose acceptance would impair current U.S. \ntrade remedies by making relief costlier, more uncertain, or otherwise \nharder to achieve and maintain over time. An agreement that includes \nsuch changes must be rejected, and it is no answer, insofar as section \n2102(b)(14) and the intent of the Congress is concerned, to contend \nthat the agreement in question also includes some ``strengthening'' \nprovisions.\n  As I believe the strong vote on the Dayton-Craig amendment \ndemonstrated, it would be a serious mistake to think that an agreement \nor package of agreements can be successfully presented to Congress for \napproval, under fast-track rules or otherwise, if it includes weakening \nchanges to our trade remedy laws.\n  I would also like to clarify that this negotiating directive does not \npreclude U.S. negotiators from addressing the very serious shortcomings \nthat have become apparent in the operation of the WTO dispute \nsettlement system.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is exactly right. As explained in the Finance \nCommittee's report on the TPA measure, in a series of decisions \ninvolving trade remedy measures, the WTO Appellate Body and lower \ndispute settlement panels have fabricated obligations which our \nnegotiators never accepted and blatantly disregarded the discretion \nwhich the Uruguay Round negotiators intended national investigating \nauthorities to retain. These WTO tribunals have violated their mandate \nnot to increase or reduce the rights and obligations of WTO Members; \nhave imposed their preferences and interpretations, and those of a \nbiased WTO Secretariat, on the United States and on other WTO Members; \nand have issued decisions with no basis in the legal texts they \nsupposedly were interpreting.\n  The effect has been to upset the careful balance achieved in the \nUruguay Round by adding new, and wholly unwarranted, constraints on the \nuse of trade remedies. The no-weakening directive presents no \nimpediment to the pursuit of a forceful U.S. agenda to address the \nproblems plaguing WTO dispute settlement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10650-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10650-S10651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COST ESTIMATES--S. 2667, H.R. 3656, AND H.R. 4073\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

It would authorize a doubling in the number of \n     volunteers to 14,000 and would increase the authorized \n     readjustment allowance paid to returning volunteers to $275 \n     for each month of service. The bill also would authorize $10 \n     million in 2003 for a grant program to support returned Peace \n     Corps volunteers' efforts to promote a better understanding \n     of other peoples on the part of the American people. Assuming \n     the appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO estimates \n     that implementing S. 2667 would cost $1.9 billion over the \n     2003-2007 period. S. 2667 would not affect direct spending or \n     revenues.\n       S. 2667 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 2667 is shown in the following table. \n     The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 150 \n     (international affairs).

Specifically, it would \n     protect the ECB's assets from judicial process and \n     attachment. The ECB is an independent legal entity owned by \n     the central banks of the 12 countries of the European Union \n     that comprise the euro area and functions as the central bank \n     for the euro. It holds some of the foreign reserve assets of \n     those countries in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and \n     commercial banks in the United States. The act would assure \n     that the assets held collectively by the ECB retain the same \n     protection they had when they were held separately by the \n     central banks of its member countries.

The act would place emphasis \n     on assistance to persons living within the bottom 50 percent \n     below a country's poverty line or living on less than the \n     equivalent of $1 per day. CBO estimates that implementing \n     H.R. 4073 would cost $328 million over the 2003-2007 period, \n     assuming the appropriation of the authorized amounts. The act \n     would not affect direct spending or revenues.\n       H.R. 4073 contains no integovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of H.R. 4073 is shown in the following \n     table. The estimate assumes this legislation will be enacted \n     near the beginning of 2003, that the specified amounts will \n     be appropriated before the start of each fiscal year, and \n     that outlays will follow historical spending patterns.

Mr. President, I rise today to highlight a very important \ninitiative in my State of Utah, The Center for Advancement of \nLeadership.\n  The Center for the Advancement of Leadership was approved by the Utah \nBoard of Regents in January of 2001 and operates as a part of the Utah \nValley State College School of Business.\n  The center was established for college students, K-12 students, and \nprofessional practitioners to accomplish several goals: first, to \nadvance leadership and character development education through classes, \nprograms, and conferences; second, to expand the body of leadership \nknowledge through studies, projects, and research; and finally, to \nreinforce the importance of ethical behavior in doing business.\n  In order to accomplish these goals, The center has undertaken several \nprojects designed to establish leadership education programs for each \nof the target demographics mentioned.\n  The focal point of The Center is the certification program for \nstudents from all collegiate disciplines attending Utah Valley State \nCollege, UVSC. Students may earn a ``Leadership Certificate'' that will \nbe a part of their official college transcript by completing 15 credit \nhours in leadership management.\n  The Center and the School of Business at UVSC have launched a \nleadership education program that is reaching students in several of \nthe local high schools. These students, through state-approved \nconcurrent enrollment, are receiving college credit in high school for \ntaking School of Business leadership classes.\n  UVSC Athletics and the center, along with local school districts and \ncommunity-based organizations, have developed and implemented a program \ntitled, ``No Greater Heroes.'' Student athletes from UVSC use a well-\nplanned script to present a high-powered, energetic program that builds \nself-confidence in young, elementary school-age children. They are \ntaught character-development abilities to set high standards for \nthemselves.\n  The center will also provide support to the ``Why Try'' program for \njunior high schools. ``Why Try'' was created to provide simple hands-on \nsolutions for helping youth overcome challenges. The goal of the ``Why \nTry'' program is to help youth answer the question, ``Why try in \nlife?'' during times when they are frustrated, confused, or angry with \nlife's pressures. It teaches youth that it is worth putting the effort \nin overcoming the challenges at home, at school, and with peers. It \nalso provides opportunity from more freedom and self-respect.\n  The Center also hosts the Annual Leadership Conference on the campus \nof Utah Valley State College. Keynote speakers in the past have \nincluded such high-profile individuals as Sheri Dew, Rulon Gardner, Ed \nJ. Pinegar, Steve Young, and Denis Waitley. During this 1-day \nconference, attendees are able to learn from some of the best minds in \nthe leadership field. In addition to the keynote addresses, \nparticipants are able to choose from a diverse selection of topics for \nbreakout sessions. The topics are tailored to meet the needs of the \nstudents, advisors, and business and community leaders.\n  There is significant demand for the current leadership programs at \nUVSC. Already 15 students have graduated from UVSC with a ``Certificate \nin Leadership,'' 45 are enrolled in the 4-year integrated studies \nprogram with a leadership emphasis, and over 100 taking classes toward \nthe certification program; the concurrent enrollment classes have \nincreased from seven high schools to 10 high schools, with 13 more \nwaiting to participate; ``No Greater Heroes'' has a waiting list of \nelementary schools wanting to participate; and the attendance at the \nannual conference has grown from a couple of hundred to several \nthousand.\n  I commend the center for taking on these important projects. I am \npleased to be able to share with my colleagues some examples of the \nfine work done by the center. I am very supportive of this program and \ncommend it to my colleagues as an excellent example of educational \ninnovation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10651-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10651-S10653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PEACE CORPS CHARTER FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my satisfaction with \nlast night's passage by unanimous consent of S. 2667, the Peace Corps \nCharter for the 21st Century Act. I would like to thank Gaddi Vasquez \nand the staff of the Peace Corps for their willingness to work with me \nto come up with a bill that I believe will make it possible for the \nPresident to achieve the goal that he set during the State of the Union \naddress in January, namely the doubling of the size of the Peace Corps \nover the next several years. I am proud of the bill we have passed, and \nI am confident that the provisions it contains will help us continue to \nfulfill President Kennedy's original vision of the Peace Corps as an \nAmerican volunteer service dedicated to ``promoting world peace and \nfriendship.''\n  It is always with tremendous fondness and pride that I speak of the \nPeace Corps, as it gives me occasion to recall my own years as a \nvolunteer in the Dominican Republic. I have often spoken of how these 2 \nyears changed my life. Indeed, living and working outside of the United \nStates and seeing the way other nations operated for the first time, I \ngrew to appreciate our nation more and more, and developed a strong \nsense of what it means to be an American. I was proud to share my \nexperience as an American citizen with the people I was there to help. \nThose 2 years were invaluable to me, and truly brought home to me the \nvalue of public service.\n  As remarkable as the success of the Peace Corps has been, and as \nimportant a symbol and example it is of public service, in the \naftermath of the tragic\n\n[[Page S10652]]\n\nattacks on America on September 11, it has become something more. It \nhas become a necessity. The terrorist attacks of last year have shown \nus that the world has become a much smaller place. The United States \ncan no longer afford to neglect certain countries, or certain parts of \nthe world. We need to find ways to help developing countries meet their \nbasic needs, and we need to do so now. We especially need to act in \nplaces where the citizens are particularly unfamiliar with American \nvalues. Now, more than ever, Peace Corps volunteers play a pivotal role \nin helping us achieve a greater understanding of America abroad, \nespecially in predominantly Muslim countries.\n  However, if we are to expand the aims of the Peace Corps, to broaden \nits scope, and to send our volunteers into more countries, then we must \nprovide the Peace Corps with a new charter and adequate resources to \nsafely and effectively pursue these objectives. I believe that the \nlegislation that passed the Senate last night, the Peace Corps Charter \nfor the 21st Century Act, will go a long way to meeting anticipated \nfunding needs, as well as charting the future course for this valuable \norganization.\n  I believe that the Peace Corps Charter for the 21st Century Act will \ndo an excellent job of modifying the Peace Corps Act to better meet the \nneeds of both our volunteers and an expanding and changing \norganization. The Peace Corps is a truly remarkable institution in \nAmerica, a symbol of the very best of our ideals of service, sacrifice, \nand self-reliance. Our volunteers are to be commended again for their \nenduring commitment to these ideals, and for the way they are able to \ncommunicate the message of the Peace Corps throughout the world. They \ndeserve the very best from us, and the passage of the Peace Corps \nCharter for the 21st Century Act is an important step toward fulfilling \nour responsibility to the Peace Corps and its volunteers.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support S. 2667, The Peace Corps Charter \nfor the 21st Century Act. I commend Senator Dodd for developing this \nlegislation and for working closely with the administration to advance \nit through the Foreign Relations Committee, where last week it was \nreported unanimously. Support for the Peace Corps is not, and should \nnot be, a partisan issue. Senator Dodd's quiet work in moving this \nlegislation forward is a testament to that principle.\n  From promoting environmental conservation, to teaching primary school \nclasses; from working to increase food production to training health \ncare workers, Peace Corps volunteers do a lot of good throughout the \nworld. Since the organization was founded 40 years ago, over 165,000 \nvolunteers have served in 135 countries. If you multiply that number by \nthe number of people reached by each volunteer, the phenomenal impact \nof the Peace Corps becomes apparent. Our Peace Corps volunteers \nrepresent, in many ways, U.S. diplomacy at its best--reaching remote \ncommunities as well as urban neighborhoods, and helping people improve \ntheir lives in immeasurable ways.\n  The Peace Corps is stronger and more popular than ever. Since \nJanuary, the organization estimates that there has been a 300 percent \nincrease in inquiries from potential volunteers. We must ensure that \nthe Peace Corps has the necessary resources to capture and utilize this \nunprecedented surge in interest.\n  For these reasons, I am pleased to support S. 2667, which goes a long \nway in advancing and strengthening the Peace Corps. The legislation \nauthorizes yearly increases in funding for the Peace Corps to $560 \nmillion in fiscal year 2007, in order to double the number of \nvolunteers over the next 5 years. This increase in funding and \nvolunteer capacity is long overdue, and is now more crucial than ever.\n  Furthermore, the bill calls for the Peace Corps to develop a strategy \nfor special placement of volunteers in countries whose governments are \nseeking to foster greater understanding between their citizens and the \nUnited States, particularly in countries with significant Muslim \npopulations. Through person-to-person contact, Peace Corps volunteers \ncan make great strides in eroding the deep misconceptions of the United \nStates that exist in many cultures. The volunteers give a human face to \nthe term ``American,'' bringing personal knowledge of our ideals and \nattitudes to communities all over the world.\n  The legislation also establishes a global infectious disease \ninitiative to comprehensively train Peace Corps volunteers in the \neducation, prevention and treatment of the infectious diseases HIV/\nAIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has killed more \npeople than the bubonic plague of the Middle Ages. Five million people \nwere infected with HIV/AIDS in the past year alone, creating an \nunthinkable number of orphans worldwide. In some countries, the disease \nthreatens to wipe out an entire generation. Tuberculosis and malaria \nhave also caused millions more preventable deaths. It is imperative \nthat Peace Corps volunteers be equipped with the knowledge and \nresources to protect their health, and that of the communities in which \nthey serve, to the greatest extent possible.\n  Again, I congratulate and thank Senator Dodd for his enduring \nallegiance to the Peace Corps. At a time when we must do all we can to \npromote mutual understanding worldwide, this legislation is an \nimportant effort to strengthen the Peace Corps, the United States' most \nvaluable international volunteer program.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act, S. 2268. I feel that this bill is \nnecessary in light of the large numbers of lawsuits initiated in recent \nyears seeking to impose liability on gun manufacturers and dealers for \nthe violent conduct of third-party criminals. At common law, tort \nliability would not lie for harm that was proximately caused by the \nintervening acts of a third party. It was universally understood that \nyou could not hold a person responsible for the behavior of another \nperson whom he did not control. Applying these long-standing \nprinciples, the vast majority of courts have thrown out these types of \ngun lawsuits.\n  Unfortunately, however, some courts have allowed these suits to go \nforward. Ohio's Supreme Court, for example, recently overruled both \ntrial courts and appellate courts when, in a 4-3 vote, it reinstated a \nlawsuit against firearms manufacturers brought by the City of \nCincinnati. Lower courts in Massachusetts have also allowed such \nlawsuits to go forward.\n  This type of politicized litigation affects all firearms \nmanufacturers' and dealers' right to conduct lawful commerce. These \nlawsuits thus affect all Americans' second amendment rights, not just \nthe rights of those in the jurisdictions that have allowed these suits \nto go forward. For this reason, a Federal solution to this problem is \nappropriate.\n  I, therefore, am pleased to cosponsor S. 2268, though I do so with \none reservation. The bill as introduced in the Senate appears that it \nwould not only bar political lawsuits, but would also bar recovery for \na type of claim that I believe to be legitimate: an action for damages \nthat result if a dealer knowingly or negligently sells a gun to a \ncriminal. The same concern about barring this type of lawsuit was \nraised during the House of Representatives' consideration of the House \ncompanion to this bill, one member knew of a case in his district in \nwhich a dealer was sued for selling a gun to someone who was \nintoxicated. In response, the House Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, \nTrade, and Consumer Protection added an additional exception to the \nbill's preemption for actions arising from: the supplying of a firearm \nor an ammunition product by a seller for use by another person when the \nseller knows or should know the person to whom the product has been \nsupplied is likely to use the product, and in fact does use the \nproduct, in a manner involving unreasonable risk of injury to himself \nand others.\n  I believe that this House amendment is sufficient to allow legitimate \nlawsuits for harm arising from improper gun sales to go forward, while \nstill protecting dealers and manufacturers from politicized anti-gun \nlitigation. On the understanding that Senate conferees would accede to \nthis or an equivalent provision in the House-Senate conference on this \nlegislation, I am pleased to cosponsor the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act.\n\n[[Page S10653]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10651-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10651-S10653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PEACE CORPS CHARTER FOR THE 21ST CENTURY ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD.

The same concern about barring this type of lawsuit was \nraised during the House of Representatives' consideration of the House \ncompanion to this bill, one member knew of a case in his district in \nwhich a dealer was sued for selling a gun to someone who was \nintoxicated. In response, the House Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, \nTrade, and Consumer Protection added an additional exception to the \nbill's preemption for actions arising from: the supplying of a firearm \nor an ammunition product by a seller for use by another person when the \nseller knows or should know the person to whom the product has been \nsupplied is likely to use the product, and in fact does use the \nproduct, in a manner involving unreasonable risk of injury to himself \nand others.\n  I believe that this House amendment is sufficient to allow legitimate \nlawsuits for harm arising from improper gun sales to go forward, while \nstill protecting dealers and manufacturers from politicized anti-gun \nlitigation. On the understanding that Senate conferees would accede to \nthis or an equivalent provision in the House-Senate conference on this \nlegislation, I am pleased to cosponsor the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act.\n\n[[Page S10653]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10653-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF CONGRESSMAN JOHN LaFALCE\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, Congressman John LaFalce, the ranking \nmember of the House Committee on Financial Services, has announced his \nretirement after 28 years of dedicated service to his constituents in \nupstate New York and to our country.\n  I rise today to acknowledge and applaud the interests and \naccomplishments of John LaFalce during his long and productive career \nin Congress, and to wish him the very best in his future endeavors. We \nserved together in the House, and we worked closely on a bicameral \nbasis for many years on a variety of financial, consumer, and community \ndevelopment issues.\n  By way of background, John LaFalce was first elected to Congress from \nthe 32nd Congressional District of New York in 1974 as part of the \n``Watergate class.'' His victory was the first by a Democrat since \n1912. His constituents then had the wisdom to return him to Washington \nas their representative 14 times. Since his arrival in the House, his \ncommittee assignments have included the Committee on Banking, Finance \nand Urban Affairs--the counterpart to the Senate committee I am honored \nto chair--and the Committee on Small Business, which he chaired from \n1987 until 1994. He was elected ranking Democrat on the renamed \nCommittee on Financial Services in 1998.\n  I know firsthand of John's passion for public policy--and the \nintellectual vigor he brought to its formulation--because of our common \ninterests and frequent collaboration in such areas as consumer \nprotection, housing and community development, the safety and soundness \nof the financial system, corporate accountability, financial \nmodernization, and the effectiveness of international lending programs.\n  Let me offer some illustrations. Congressman LaFalce was a leader in \nthe longstanding efforts to modernize the Nation's complex financial \nservices system to promote competition between financial intermediaries \nwhile protecting consumers and ensuring that financial institutions \ncontinue to contribute to community development and provide services to \nunserved and underserved communities and populations. Early in 1999, \nworking closely with the Clinton Treasury Department, John helped to \njump-start serious consideration of financial modernization legislation \nby garnering administration support for the first time in the recent \nhistory of that debate. That bill provided the basis for the eventual \nbipartisan agreement that led to enactment of Gramm-Leach-Bliley, \nreferred to by The New York Times as ``landmark legislation. . . . The \npre-eminent legislative accomplishment of the year.''\n  More recently, John has been a leading advocate for strong investor \nprotections. He sounded some of the earliest and most accurate alarms \nabout conflicts of interest by investment professionals, questionable \naccounting practices, inadequate enforcement efforts by the SEC, and \ninadequate agency funding. The colossal failures of Enron, WorldCom, \nGlobal Crossing, and other firms, and the devastating impact on \ninvestors and on the working men and women of those companies, have \nmore than justified John's concerns.\n  John was a prime mover of the sweeping corporate accounting reform \nlegislation signed into law by President Bush on July 25, 2002. John \nactually introduced in the House in early February of this year the \nfirst comprehensive legislative solution offered to address the serious \nproblems in the capital markets and corporate boardrooms. John deserves \nthe praise he has received from many consumer, investor, and labor \ngroups for his leadership in helping to achieve these landmark reforms. \nA comment by AFL-CIO president John Sweeney is typical of the praise \nJohn received: ``I particularly want to thank Congressman LaFalce, who \nhas really stood out these last few months as a leader ready to take on \npowerful Wall Street and big money interests on behalf of working \nfamilies.''\n  I want to make one last observation about John's legislative legacy. \nOver the years, he has been a tireless and committed crusader for \nconsumers and community development.\n  For example, in the area of financial privacy, where John and I have \nworked so closely together, it was legislation that John had introduced \nin 1998 and 1999 that laid the basis for the historic financial privacy \nprotections that Congress included within Gramm-Leach-Bliley. Since \nthen, John and I have continued to work on new legislation to further \nenhance these financial privacy protections.\n  Similarly, John has been a leader in the fight against predatory \nlending. He crafted excellent legislation that would provide real and \nsubstantive protections for the many homeowners, many of whom are \nelderly, minorities, or immigrants who are financially unsophisticated, \nwho fall prey to unscrupulous mortgage lenders and brokers. I have used \nJohn's bill as a basis for my own legislation here in the Senate.\n  John has also been a strong and consistent advocate for the Community \nReinvestment Act. During the debate surrounding financial modernization \nlegislation, we opposed those who wanted to either repeal or undermine \nit. He has been an ardent defender of funding for affordable housing \nand community development and has taken the lead in enacting into law \nimportant elderly housing and homeless prevention provisions. In \naddition, he has developed major legislative initiatives to expand \nhomeownership opportunities, and reform the mortgage loan process.\n  I have had the pleasure and privilege of knowing and working closely \nwith John for almost three decades. I do not expect his retirement from \nelective office to end either his public service or his significant \ncontributions to our Nation. In fact, I have every expectation that \nJohn LaFalce will continue to be an active, thoughtful, and valuable \ncontributor to public debate on critical national issues.\n  Finally, I pay tribute to John's staff. John has been the first to \npoint out that he has always surrounded himself with talented people. \nJeanne Roslanowick is an outstanding public servant, and we will miss \nworking with her and the rest of his staff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10653-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 23, 2001 \nin Thibodaux, LA. Two white teens attacked and injured a black woman by \nshooting her in the face with a paintball gun. The victim and her \nhusband were walking through their front yard when the two teens \nattacked. Prior to the assault, the teens were heard to say that they \nwanted to ``shoot black people'', and police investigated the incident \nas a hate crime. The victim was treated for her injuries in a local \nhospital.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10653-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10653-S10654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SALUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL LEE A. ARCHER, JR., USAF (RET.)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, tomorrow night I have the privilege of \nspeaking at the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum's 17th \nAnnual Salute Reception and Dinner in my hometown of Detroit. This \nevent is held each year at the museum to present an outstanding \nindividual with a Distinguished Achievement Award. This year's honoree \nis Lieutenant Colonel Lee A. Archer, who was one of the original \nTuskegee Airmen. He is being honored for his exemplary military, \ncorporate executive, and entrepreneurial careers.\n  Colonel Archer was born in 1921 and enlisted in the Army in 1941. He \nreceived his commission after training at the Tuskegee Army Air Field \nin Alabama and was assigned to the 332nd Fighter Group. He successfully \nflew 169 combat missions over central and southern Europe and had 4.5 \nconfirmed aerial victories. He modestly shared\n\n[[Page S10654]]\n\ncredit with another pilot for the first victory but a subsequent review \nindicated that he deserved full credit and the coveted status of \n``Ace.'' He received the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal \nwith 18 Oak Leaf Clusters and numerous other awards over the course of \nhis Active Duty career, which lasted 29 years.\n  These tremendous accomplishments would probably satisfy most people. \nBut Colonel Archer has since gone on to have an equally successful \nbusiness career. After retiring from the Air Force, he joined the \nGeneral Foods Corporation in 1970 and became a director just 1 year \nlater. In 1975, he was elected corporate vice president of General \nFoods. Over the years, he also served as president, chairman, and chief \nexecutive officer, CEO, of Vanguard Capital Corporation; chairman and \nCEO of Hudson Commercial Corporation; and Chairman and CEO of Archer \nAssociates, LTF, a venture capital holding corporation. This is just a \npartial listing, and doesn't include his numerous civic activities and \nboard memberships.\n  Colonel Archer, along with his fellow Tuskegee Airmen, and the other \nmembers of the ``Greatest Generation'' who fought in the Second World \nWar have earned our Nation's enduring respect and gratitude for their \nheroic and selfless deeds in defense of our country, our freedoms, and \nour way of life.\n  Regrettably, the Tuskegee Airmen faced rigid segregation and a \nprevailing prejudice that questioned their ability to serve as Airmen \nand prevented them from training and working with their white \ncounterparts. But they certainly proved their mettle. Led by the \nrecently departed General Benjamin O. Davis, the first black general in \nthe Air Force; Colonel Archer; and so many other valiant men, the \nTuskegee Airmen flew over 15,500 sorties, completed over 1,500 combat \nmissions, and downed over 260 enemy aircraft. They even sank a German \ndestroyer in the harbor of Trieste, Italy. Amazingly, no bomber \nescorted by the Tuskegee Airmen was ever downed by enemy aircraft.\n  All in all, 992 men graduated from pilot training at Tuskegee during \nWorld War II, 450 of whom were sent overseas for combat assignment. One \nhundred and fifty men made the supreme sacrifice for our Nation and \nwere killed while in training or on combat missions. Thirty-two downed \nAirmen were taken as prisoners of war.\n  Collectively, the Tuskegee Airmen received 3 Presidential Citations, \n95 distinguished flying crosses, 8 purple hearts and 14 bronze stars.\n  Upon returning home from war, these Airmen found a society still \ndeeply segregated. The Tuskegee Airmen themselves remained segregated \nfrom the larger military and were unable to provide their skills and \naptitude to other units that were in dire need of qualified airmen. It \nwas not until President Truman issued Executive Order 9981 that \nsegregation was ended in the United States Armed Services. This \nExecutive Order played a vital role in the subsequent integration of \nour Nation. The valor and dedication of the Tuskegee Airmen played a \nvital role in changing our Nation's attitude toward integration and \nracial diversity.\n  The author and historian Edith Hamilton, commenting on the works of \nthe ancient Greek dramatist Aeschylus, said, ``Life for him was an \nadventure; perilous indeed, but men are not made for safe havens.'' \nCertainly, life for Lee Archer has been an adventure, perilous indeed. \nCertainly, Lee Archer was not made for safe havens; nor has he ever \nsought them. All Americans are the better for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10654-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CYBER SECURITY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT, S. 2182\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the passage of H.R. \n3394, the Cyber Security and Research Development Act. I want to \nspecifically congratulate and thank Senators Allen and Wyden for \nproposing this measure and for working with me to address a few \nconcerns I had relating to ensuring appropriate national security \nprotections.\n  This important legislation authorizes computer and network security \nresearch and development and research fellowships through the National \nScience Foundation and the Secretary of Commerce for the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology. This legislation is an important \nstep in protecting our country's computer infrastructure, and will \nquickly bear fruit by increasing research and development in this \ncritical area.\n  Our country's computer infrastructure is critical to our nation's \nhomeland defense. This measure is a much needed effort to improve our \nresearch and development efforts in this area by enlisting and \nbolstering research by our universities, colleges, and research \nentities. At the same time, I wanted to ensure that access to such \ncritical cyber-research information is appropriately tailored to ensure \nthat our national security interests are protected.\n  Mr. President, I want to highlight the modifications that I proposed \nand were included in the bill. These include: (1) expanding the \npurposes for such grants to include research to enhance law enforcement \nefforts to detect, investigate and prosecute cyber-crimes, including \nthose that involve piracy of intellectual property, and (2) ensuring \ncompliance with the immigration laws by requiring that those who \nreceive funds comply with United States immigration laws and are not \nfrom countries that sponsor international terrorism terrorism, unless \nthe Attorney General and Secretary of States make an individualized \ndetermination that the individual is not a threat to our national \nsecurity. Theft of intellectual property on the internet is becoming a \nserious threat to many in our creative community and one of our most \nimportant exports.\n  Again, I am grateful that the authors of this legislation were \nwilling to work with me to include these modifications and I strongly \nsupport enactment of this legislation into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10654-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10654-S10655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICA'S STRENGTHENED RESOLVE\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this year, we did not wait passively for \nSeptember to arrive; we began preparing weeks ago to greet this month \nwith offerings of memorial in hand. At services across the Commonwealth \nand in remembrances around the country, last fall's attacks have again \ndrawn the focus of our Nation. There is a new sentiment this time \naround, though, one that is hopeful, grateful, more determined, and \nless confused.\n  For all of us, it has been a week of reflection on the losses and \nlessons of the attack that changed our history and our lives. The \ndestruction wrought by a hateful few was intended to unravel America's \nstrength, but it has only made us stronger. And from this strength, we \nhave come to understand that the tragedy of last September 11 has in \nfact blessed us with an opportunity. The attacks are still tangible in \nPennsylvania, and so we take this opportunity very seriously, proud to \nhave a part in creating a positive legacy for 9/11. It was aboard the \nplane that crashed in Shanksville that America's response to terrorism \nfirst began.\n  Somerset County, for this reason, will be a symbol of the heroism and \nsacrifice that a few brave, ordinary citizens chose to exhibit when \nfaced with the most difficult and dangerous situation of their lives. \nShanksville, the World Trade Towers, and the Pentagon can all be \nreminders of what the American spirit is capable of overcoming, of what \nTodd Beamer meant when he said, ``Let's roll,'' if we as a Nation \nchoose to make it so. The anniversary of September 11 should, \ntherefore, be about the resolve to honor the memories of all those lost \nto the terrorist attacks by living to make ourselves, our communities, \nand our country better.\n  Looking back over the past twelve months, the most inspiring aspect \nof the national recovery effort was the compassion, cooperation, and \nconcern that citizens across the country shared with one another. \nThrough the charity of time, prayer, blood, consolation, money, and \nother expressions of support, Americans exhibited a goodwill that is \nrarely seen so universally, but comes so naturally to us all at times \nof crisis. As we settle back into our normal, peaceful lives, however, \nthis goodwill tends to steal away from us. As a result, our collective \nawareness of a common humanity and a world view larger than our own \nback yards also begins to fade. In the aftermath of 9/11 and the years \nto follow the shock of terrorism on our soil, we must renew\n\n[[Page S10655]]\n\nthe commitment we have to our neighbors, our communities, and our \nNation. Across the country, we can make the courage and responsibility \ndisplayed by the heroes at Ground Zero endure. In this way, we will \ntriumph over evil and devastation, and we can try to make sense out of \nall that we have suffered.\n  When I first visited the cratered field in Shanksville, and when I \nreturned to that crash site this week, I was struck by the importance \nof our continued hope. I was also inspired by the strength of those \nFlight 93 family members, now carrying the torches of their loved ones \nwho gave their last measure of bravery for our nation. I have resolved \nto make every day a memorial to September 11th by working to keep the \nbigger picture in mind and a better world in sight. I hope you will \nfind your own way to keep and exhibit this renewed American spirit in \nyour lives. May God bless you and our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10655-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                USDA TESTING FOR CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to urge Secretary Veneman \nto provide more details on the United States Department of \nAgriculture's recent announcement regarding chronic wasting disease, \nCWD, testing, and urge her to provide hunters with more testing \nopportunities for CWD.\n  On Tuesday of this week, USDA announced an increase of up to 200,000 \nmore Government-approved tests for chronic wasting disease this deer \nhunting season. Prior to the announcement, USDA officials have said \nlabs certified to test for the disease would only accommodate the needs \nof the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, DNR, and not provide \ntesting opportunities for hunters.\n  I appreciate USDA's recent decision to allow Government laboratories \ncertified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, to offer an \nadditional 200,000 chronic wasting disease or CWD tests to Wisconsin \nhunters. As I noted in my September 24, 2002, letter to Secretary \nVeneman, given hunters' concerns in my state, it is appropriate for \nUSDA to offer any excess test processing capacity in the Government \nsystem to Wisconsin on a priority basis. This assistance from USDA \nallows Wisconsin to be able to offer testing to our hunters on request, \nand gives Wisconsin hunters access to the ``gold standard'' \nimmunohistochemistry, IHC, test.\n  While I commend USDA for these efforts, I will be closely monitoring \nthe implementation of the new testing program in the State, and in \nparticular the Department's stated commitment of providing 200,000 more \ntests to Wisconsin hunters. It is important to note that nine of the \nGovernment laboratories that will be processing Wisconsin tests this \nfall have not previously conducted such tests. Given the time it took \nto get the Wisconsin State Veterinary Laboratory in a position to be \nable to process CWD tests, USDA must be vigilant in ensuring that these \nGovernment labs are ready in the next month. In addition, I also urge \nUSDA to assist the State of Wisconsin in ensuring that the labs that \nwill process Wisconsin's CWD tests provide accurate and prompt \ninformation regarding the test processing costs.\n  I commend the USDA for finally taking steps to provide more testing \nopportunities through Government labs. But the USDA must do more, \nincluding continuing efforts to certify private labs, like the \nMarshfield Clinic, and to approve rapid test kits for this fall's hunt. \nI want to ensure that USDA meets, and I hope exceeds, its commitment of \nproviding 200,000 additional tests to Wisconsin's hunters for this \nyear's hunt.\n  To that end, I hope that the administration will endorse my \nlegislation, S. 3090, the Comprehensive Wildlife Disease Testing \nAcceleration Act of 2002. This legislation would provide hunters with \nmore testing opportunities for chronic wasting disease by requiring \nUSDA to develop appropriate testing protocols and to certify private \nlabs to conduct CWD tests.\n  My legislation will remove bureaucratic roadblocks by requiring the \nUSDA to expand the number of labs that can provide CWD testing to \nhunters. Until I am satisfied that USDA has done everything possible to \nbring this disease under control, I will continue to press this \nlegislation forward.\n  Our 2001 deer hunt involved more than 400,000 deer. With only 250,000 \ntests total for Wisconsin, some hunters may still lack the ability to \nhave their deer tested. USDA must continue efforts to provide more \ntesting opportunities for hunters. By certifying private labs like the \nMarshfield Clinic and approving a rapid test this fall, USDA can ensure \nthat Wisconsin hunters have the information they deserve.\n  Action on this problem is urgently needed. I am glad that the \nSecretary has finally begun to take a step in the right direction, and \nI urge her to undertake all the necessary measures to bring these \ndiseases under control.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10655-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESCRIPTION DRUGS\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, we have been debating important \nissues in the Senate these past few weeks, Homeland Security, and the \npossibility of war in Iraq, and other issues that have resulted from 9/\n11. While these important debates take place here on the Senate floor \nand in the kitchens and living rooms across America, there is still \nanother longstanding issue that affects the health and livelihood of \nour senior citizens, that of prescription drug coverage for our \nnation's seniors.\n  As the end of the legislative year looms closer, I am angry to say \nthat we are no closer to having a prescription drug program for our \nseniors. When the Senate debated the addition of a prescription drug \nbenefit to the Medicare program in July, there was clear agreement that \nsuch a benefit was badly needed and that time was of the essence for \ndelivering such a benefit to America's seniors. Over several weeks of \ndebate on prescription drugs, progress was made toward agreement, but \nunfortunately, the discussion was cut short by the August recess.\n  I believe this issue is so important, and so urgent for seniors, that \nI stand before you today to say that this Congress should stay in \nsession until we are able to pass a prescription drug benefit for our \nseniors. It is not too late to pass a prescription drug bill this year.\n  With the help of new treatments and therapies, it is now possible for \nseniors to live longer and better than at any other time in history. \nEvery day that Medicare excludes prescription drugs from coverage is a \nday that countless seniors will not have access to medications that \ncould improve their health--or save their lives. In addition, every \nyear that passes without adding a prescription drug benefit to \nMedicare, the cost of adding such a benefit increases substantially.\n  In recent weeks, there has been a lot of talk about adjusting \nMedicare payments to reimburse health care providers fairly for \ntreating seniors. My home state of Oregon ranks 46th in the country for \nMedicare spending per beneficiary. These incredibly low Medicare \nreimbursement rates have made it impossible for some health care \nproviders to continue serving Medicare beneficiaries. This means that \nmany seniors in Oregon are now having difficulty even finding a health \ncare provider to see them. Therefore, I am very supportive of the \nMedicare provider payment components of the package proposed by \nSenators Baucus and Grassley, and I urge passage of this legislation \nbefore this Congress adjourns. However, I also believe there must be \nrenewed interest in reaching a consensus on how to add an affordable, \nuniversal, voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare this year.\n  I know we have a lot of work to do this year. Urgent work, important \nwork. But I can think of no more important issue than ensuring that our \nparents, our neighbors, our friends, our Nation's seniors, never have \nto lose their homes when they lose their health. We can pass a \nprescription drug bill this year, and we must. I urge my colleagues to \nstay in Washington until we are able to pass a prescription drug \nbenefit for our Nation's seniors, and have it signed into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10655-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10655-S10658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FDA APPROVAL OF BUPRENORPHINE/NALOXONE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last week, the fight against heroin \naddiction took a major leap forward after a decade of struggle. On \nOctober 8, 2002, the Food\n\n[[Page S10656]]\n\nand Drug Administration, FDA, announced the approval of a new anti-\naddiction drug, buprenorphine/naloxone, which, followed with the \ndirectives of a new law I authored along with Senators Hatch and Biden, \nmakes a dramatic change in the way America fights heroin addiction. \nThis new anti-addiction drug, developed under a Cooperative Research \nand Development Agreement, CRADA, between the National Institute on \nDrug Abuse, NIDA, and a private pharmaceutical company, has been the \nsubject of extensive successful research and clinical trials in the \nUnited States. The new law, the Drug Addition Treatment Act of 2000, \npermits, for the first time, such anti-addiction medications to be \ndispensed in the private office of qualified physicians, rather than in \na centralized clinic. That change can have a revolutionary reduction in \nthe number of addicts, the crimes some of them commit, and the heroin \nrelated deaths which have occurred.\n  This newly approved anti-addiction medication has already been in use \nin France, where significant success has been achieved in getting \npatients off of heroin, reducing drug-related crime and reducing \nheroin-related deaths. For example, user crime in France and arrests \nare down by 57 percent and there has been an 80 percent decline in \ndeaths by heroin overdose.\n  It is estimated that there are approximately 1 million individuals in \nthe U.S. who are addicted to heroin. The new office-based system is a \nrevolutionary change and will make our communities better and safer \nplaces to live. It will open the door to tens of thousands of \nindividuals to get rid of their addiction, but are now unable to or are \nreluctant to seek medical treatment at centralized methadone clinics, \nwhere their appearance amounts to an announcement of their addiction \nand which for many addicts are difficult to get to for their once or \ntwice a day use. According to a report by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, many individuals who want to get rid of their addiction \nwill not go to centralized clinics, ``. . . because of the stigma of \nbeing in methadone treatment. . . .'' The report went on to say that \nHHS was:\n\n     . . . especially encouraged by the results of published \n     clinical studies of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is a partial \n     mu opiate receptor agonist, in Schedule V of the Controlled \n     Substances Act, with unique properties which differentiate it \n     from full agonists such as methadone or LAAM. The \n     pharmacology of the combination tablet consisting of \n     buprenorhine and naloxone results in . . . low value and low \n     desirability for diversion on the street. Published clinical \n     studies suggest that it has very limited euphorigenic \n     affects, and has the ability to precipitate withdrawal in \n     individuals who are highly dependent upon other opioids. \n     Thus, buprenorphine and Buprenorphine/naloxone products are \n     expected to have low diversion potential . . . and should \n     incerase the amount of treatment capacity available and \n     expand the range of treatment options that can be used by \n     physicians.\n\n  The compelling need for this new system of treatment is borne out in \nsome astonishing data. A recent study by the U.S. Office of National \nDrug Control Policy, ONDCP, released in January of this year, shows \nthat illegal drugs drain $160 billion a year from the American economy; \nand that the majority of these costs, $98.5 billion, stem from lost \nproductivity due to drug-related illnesses and deaths, as well as \nincarcerations and work hours missed by victims of crime. The report \nfound that illegal drug use cost the health-care industry $12.9 billion \nin 1998. Commenting on the release of the study, ONDCP Director John P. \nWalters said:\n\n       Drugs are a direct threat to the economic security of the \n     United States . . . and results in lower productivity, more \n     workplace accidents, and higher health-care costs, all of \n     which constrain America's economic output. Reducing substance \n     abuse now would have an immediate, positive impact on our \n     economic vitality. When we talk about the toll that drugs \n     take on our country, especially on our young people, we \n     usually point to the human costs: lives ruined, potential \n     extinguished, and dreams derailed. This study provides some \n     grim accounting, putting a specific dollar figure on the \n     economic waste that illegal drugs represent.\n\n  Another recent study, released in September of this year, determined \nthat the majority of drug offenders in our State prisons have no \nhistory of violence or high-level drug dealing. The study found that of \nthe estimated 250,000 drug offenders in state prisons, 58 percent are \nnonviolent offenders. The authors concluded that these nonviolent \noffenders ``. . .  represent a pool of appropriate candidates for \ndiversion to treatment programs . . . .'' They went on to say that \n``The `war on drugs' has been overly punitive and costly and has \ndiverted attention and resources from potentially more constructive \napproaches.''\n  Of the juveniles who land behind bars in State institutions, more \nthan 60 percent of them reported using drugs once a week or more, and \nover 40 percent reported being under the influence of drugs while \ncommitting crimes, according to a report from the Bureau of Justice \nStatistics. Drug-related incarcerations are up and we are building more \njails and prisons to accommodate them, more than 1000 have been built \nover the past 20 years. According to the July 14, 1999 Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy Update, ``Drug-related arrests are up from \n1.1 million arrests in 1988 to 1.6 million arrests in 1997--steady \nincreases every year since 1991.''\n  In a September 3, 2001 interview with the New York Times, then-Drug \nEnforcement Administration nominee Asa Hutchinson underscored the need \nfor drug rehabilitation for nonviolent offenders, saying that we are \n``not going to arrest [our] way out of this problem.''\n  I believe that the system that we have finally put in place will \neffectively put America on the right road to fighting and winning the \nheroin addiction war. It has been a long and difficult road for over a \ndecade. First, in providing the resources to help speed the development \nand delivery of anti-addiction drugs that block the craving for illicit \naddictive substances. Second, authoring a law that would allow for such \nmedications to be dispensed in an office-based setting rather than \ncentralized clinics, by physicians who are certified in the treatment \nof addiction. In 1996, the Senate adopted my amendment to the budget \nresolution to steer $500 million over 6 years to the National Institute \non Drug Abuse, which resulted in substantial increases in funding for \nresearch conducted by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Then, in \n1997, when Senator Moynihan and Senator Bob Kerrey joined me in \nconvening a panel of experts to present their expert views at a Drug \nForum on Anti-addiction Research, in an effort to assess the level of \nprogress and needed support to expedite new anti-addiction discoveries. \nIn October, 2000, the Drug Addiction Treatment Act, was enacted into \nlaw. Today, we are taking a giant step forward with the Food and Drug \nAdministration's approval of this new anti-addiction drug, which will \nallow for the appropriate and long awaited, conventional, office based \napproach to addiction treatment in this country.\n\n  The protections in the new law against abuse are as follows: \nPhysicians may not treat more than 30 patients in an office setting; \nappropriate counseling and other ancillary services must be offered. \nUnder this legislation the Attorney General may terminate a physician's \nDEA registration if these conditions are violated and the program may \nbe discontinued altogether if the Secretary of HHS and Attorney General \ndetermine that this new type of decentralized treatment has not proven \nto be an effective form of treatment.\n  This great success would not have been possible without the \nscientific genius, leadership and steadfast support of many \nindividuals, including, Dr. Alan Leshner, who, during his 7-year tenure \nas Director of NIDA, energetically led the government initiated \npartnership that produced buprenorphine/naloxone for the treatment of \nheroin addiction; Dr. Frank Vocci, a brilliant scientist who heads up \nMedications Development at NIDA and whose tutoring has led me to a \nbetter understanding of the science of addiction; Dr. Charles Schuster \nof Wayne State University, a past director of NIDA who has conducted \nclinical trials on buprenorphine/naloxone, the results of which have \nbeen presented in testimony before Congress. Dr. Schuster has been my \nresource and my guide on this issue from the very beginning and his \nadvice and expertise continues today; Dr. James H. Woods, Director of \nDrug Addiction Research Projects at the University of Michigan, has \nlong been a progressive force in the area of addiction research, and \nhas been an effective voice in the formulation of legislative policy in \nthe area of addiction\n\n[[Page S10657]]\n\nboth at home and abroad. Dr. Herbert Kleber, Professor of Psychiatry at \nColumbia University and one of the Nation's foremost experts on drug \naddiction and treatment, provided invaluable assistance to me in \nputting together this new system of treatment. Dr. Chris-Ellyn \nJohanson, President-elect of the College on Problems of Drug Dependence \nand Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral \nNeuroscience at Wayne State University, has made major contributions to \nunderstanding the basis of the buprenorphine therapeutic effects in the \ntreatment of heroin abuse and dependence; and Dr. Stephanie Meyers \nSchim, former president of the Michigan Public Health Association, who \nhas helped us to understand that drug addiction is a public health \nproblem that is in crisis and that our health policies should reflect \nthis reality.\n  In closing, I would like to thank those who too often go unnoticed, \nthe Senate staff members who kept this legislation on track despite the \nmany twists and turns and the unforeseen challenges along the way. My \nDeputy Legislative Director Jackie Parker, whose commitment and \ndiligence in moving this issue was characteristically unwavering. Bruce \nArtim, who serves Senator Hatch on the Judiciary Committee and Marcia \nLee of Chairman Biden's Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs were undeterred \nin their resolve to move all obstacles that came in the way of making \nthis new system of treatment a reality.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of Dr. James H. \nWoods of the University of Michigan, Dr. Chris-Ellyn Johanson and Dr. \nCharles R. Schuster of Wayne State University, and Dr. Herbert Kleber \nof the New York State Psychiatric Institute, along with a list of \nparticipants, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Dr. James H. Woods, University of Michigan, Press Conference on Food \n   and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval of Buprenorphine/nx (BUP), \n                            October 9, 2002\n\n       There are a variety of reasons for the scientific and \n     medical excitement today celebrating the approval of \n     buprenorphine for the pharmacotherapy of narcotic abuse. It \n     fits in what I hope will be a succession of new therapies for \n     drug abuse that will be employed under The Drug Addiction \n     Treatment Act to change the way we view addictions and how \n     they may be treated.\n       There are, of course, many different groups of individuals \n     who are responsible for this important day. We need to show \n     our considerable appreciation to Senators Levin, Hatch, and \n     Biden for their support for The Drug Addiction Treatment Act. \n     Having worked most with Sen. Levin, I know that he has been \n     long interested in the important problem of drug abuse. He \n     has visited us at the University to see firsthand what we \n     were up to in evaluating different, novel approaches to \n     pharmacotherapy of drug abuse. He has kept the problems of \n     developing these therapies in mind and has worked long and \n     hard to bring this legislation into being. I know the Senator \n     believes fervently that buprenorphine's approval is going to \n     produce some major changes in the treatment of narcotic abuse \n     because of the ways that it will be used in conjunction with \n     The Drug Addiction Treatment Act. I wholeheartedly agree and \n     I hope what we are seeing today with buprenorphine will be \n     replicated with increasing frequency in the future.\n       In my opinion, we will see the individual physician taking \n     an increasingly important role in dealing with narcotic \n     addiction in a different way. They will be dealing with \n     individuals who would not otherwise present themselves for \n     the kinds of treatment currently available. Those who prefer \n     the privacy of individual physician treatment can be allowed \n     that privilege with this new medication for it is very, very \n     safe. When we consider that 5 of 6 narcotic abusers are not \n     in treatment, it is clear that this new approach to therapy \n     is sorely needed.\n       We need to show our appreciation to the National Institute \n     on Drug Abuse and their efforts toward medications \n     development. Were it not for their support in developing \n     buprenorphine, we would not be having this meeting today. \n     They have supported strongly both the effort to move \n     buprenorphine along towards this drug abuse indication, and \n     related research toward the development of other much needed \n     therapies in the field of drug abuse. Thus, knowing a bit \n     about what they have in mind for the future, I think we will \n     be seeing more of these meetings.\n       We need to thank the firm, Reckitt Benckiser, for \n     sponsoring buprenorphine. It was clear early in the study of \n     buprenorphine that it might have potential as a \n     pharmacotherapy. This has been demonstrated quite well. The \n     drug has been fascinating to opioid pharmacologists ever \n     since it was made public, and its interesting pharmacological \n     properties were described. Though some of its pharmacology \n     remains elusive to us, it is clear that we may have happened \n     upon just the right molecule for opioid abuse treatment. Our \n     Narcotic Center Grant at the University, funded by NIDA for \n     some 30 years, has had the objective of improving upon some \n     of the effects of buprenorphine. We have made and studied \n     extensively hundreds of chemical relatives and found many \n     compounds comparable to buprenorphine, but none superior to \n     it in safety or duration of action. Thus, we believe that \n     buprenorphine is a substance that will be the best of its \n     kind for this type of therapy.\n       I appreciate the concert of effort that it takes to bring \n     this new type of attention to the problem of drug abuse. It \n     is only with the combined legislative, governmental, \n     pharmaceutical, and scientific efforts that these problems \n     will be dealt with effectively.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Dr. Chris-Ellyn Johanson, Wayne State University, Press Conference on \n Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approval of Buprenorphine/nx (BUP)\n\n       My name is Chris-Ellyn Johanson and I am a professor in the \n     Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences at \n     Wayne State University and the incoming president of the \n     College of Problems of Drug Dependence. When I joined the \n     Wayne State faculty in 1995, I was fortunate enough to become \n     a part of a research center at the University of Michigan, \n     headed by Dr. James Woods and funded by the National \n     Institute on Drug Abuse. This center is devoted to the \n     development of safer and better opiate drugs and has been \n     continuously funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse \n     for over 30 years. My research has focused on trying to \n     understand how buprenorphine exerts its therapeutic effects \n     in the treatment of heroin abuse and dependence.\n       I have been fortunate to work in collaboration with Jon-Kar \n     Zubieta, also from the University of Michigan, using state-\n     of-the-art neuroimaging techniques in conjunction with \n     behavioral measures to understand the biobehavioral basis of \n     the therapeutic efficacy of buprenorphine. Our studies have \n     clearly demonstrated that because buprenorphine's unique \n     pharmacology as a partial mu agonist, it can block the \n     dependence-related effects of heroin-like drugs and in many \n     ways combines the characteristics of the agonist treatment \n     agent methadone and the antagonist treatment, naltrexone. \n     Further, its pharmacology makes it a drug with a long \n     duration of action and a remarkable margin of safety.\n       So I am very pleased to be here today to welcome \n     buprenorphine into the armamentaria for the treatment of \n     heroin addiction. Not only will buprenorphine allow the \n     expansion of treatment options for clinicians, but because of \n     the legislation sponsored by Senator Levin to allow office-\n     based practice for drugs such as buprenorphine, this option \n     will be available to an increased number of opiate-dependent \n     patients. I want to personally thank Senator Levin and his \n     staff for their efforts in promoting more rationale treatment \n     for heroin addiction. The Drug Abuse Treatment Act of 2000, \n     which allows qualified physicians to treat opiate addicts in \n     their office, brings the treatment of heroin addiction into \n     mainstream medicine. This will not only increase the \n     availability of treatment but will as well destigmatize it. \n     Without this legislation, buprenorphine's unique advantages \n     could not be effectively utilized.\n       I would also like to thank Senator Levin and his staff on \n     behalf of the College on Problems of Drug Dependence. One of \n     the major goals of this scientific organization, which has \n     been in existence since 1929, is the development of safer and \n     more useful medications for the treatment of addiction, \n     including heroin dependence. Most of the scientists who have \n     been responsible for the development of buprenorphine are \n     members of this organization and have presented their \n     findings with buprenorphine at its annual scientific meeting. \n     Because of this, CPDD has been very involved in pushing for \n     the approval of buprenorphine and has been appreciative of \n     the help of Senator Levin in getting approval.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Dr. Charles R. Schuster, Wayne State University\n\n       My name is Charles R. Schuster and I am a Professor of \n     Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the Wayne State \n     University School of Medicine.\n       I am extremely excited by the news that the Food and Drug \n     Administration has approved the marketing of two \n     buprenorphine preparations, Subutex and Suboxone, for the \n     treatment of opiate dependence. These products are the first \n     to be available in a new model of office-based treatment of \n     opiate dependence allowed under the Drug Abuse Treatment Act \n     of 2000. We can thank Senator Levin for his incredible \n     thoughtfulness and tenacity in fighting to get this \n     legislation through Congress.\n       One of the major advances that has been made in the past \n     several years by a joint effort between Reckitt-Benckiser \n     Pharmaceutical company and the National Institutes on Drug \n     Abuse/NIH is the development of buprenorphine for the \n     treatment of opiate addition. I am privileged to have had a \n     role in the development of this safe, effective treatment \n     both during my tenure as the Director of NIDA and \n     subsequently as a NIDA\n\n[[Page S10658]]\n\n     grantee. Under the auspices of a NIDA funded treatment \n     research project I have utilized buprenorphine as a \n     maintenance therapy and have been very impressed not only \n     with its effectiveness in curtailing heroin use, but as well \n     with its acceptance by patients who would not have considered \n     treatment with methadone. Thus this medication may reach \n     opiate addicts who currently are resistant to enrollment in \n     opiate maintenance programs that use ORLAAM and methadone. I \n     have letters on my desk from patients whose lives have been \n     turned around by the buprenorphine maintenance treatment we \n     have provided them. I have even more letters from opiate \n     addicted people who are asking where they can find such \n     treatment. Because of the approval by the FDA of two \n     buprenorphine preparations and the passage of the Drug Abuse \n     Treatment Act of 2000, it is now possible to give the answer. \n     Find a qualified physician in your area of the country and be \n     seen as a regular patient in their office receiving a \n     prescription for buprenorphine. Tragically, I see young \n     people every day who are in need of medications to ease their \n     need for heroin so that they can become invested in \n     rehabilitation activities that can return their life \n     trajectory to a normal, productive and fulfilling course. \n     Currently the available medications, methadone and ORLAAM, \n     are extremely useful but ensnared in regulations that grossly \n     limit their potential effectiveness. Having a safe, effective \n     narcotic preparation like buprenorphine that can be used by \n     qualified physicians for the treatment of opiate addition \n     that is unfettered by the methadone regulations is a major \n     advance in our ability to provide badly needed services in a \n     cost effective manner.\n       I am very proud as a resident of the state of Michigan to \n     have Senator Levin as my representative in the United States \n     Senate. He and his staff have worked tirelessly to secure the \n     passage of the Drug Abuse Treatment Act of 2000. This \n     landmark legislation represents a major shift in policy in \n     how we view and treat the problem of opiate addition. This \n     advance in our policies regarding the treatment of opiate \n     addition has been a long time in coming. But thanks to the \n     efforts of Senator Levin, it has finally arrived. I join in \n     celebrating this achievement which has the potential for \n     providing significant help to those attempting to overcome \n     the ravages of opiate addition. Individuals seeking help for \n     their opiate addition do not have much political power and \n     are rarely heard in drug abuse policy debates. Fortunately \n     for them they have a compassionate and steadfast advocate in \n     Senator Levin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Remarks of Dr. Herbert Kleber at Press Conference on FDA Approval of \n                            Buprenorphine/NX\n\n       Today marks an important milestone in the treatment of \n     substance dependence disorders. Buprenorphine, both in the \n     combined form with antagonist naloxone and in the mono-form, \n     have just been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, \n     the first therapies approved for in-office prescribing under \n     the Federal Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000. The path \n     has been a long and at times torturous one but a careful one. \n     It can hardly be described as a rush to market: my first \n     research paper on buprenorphine was published in 1988 and \n     colleagues had published earlier. During this decade and a \n     half we have learned much about this agent and it's potential \n     for the treatment of narcotic addition. I am very grateful \n     for the help from certain key senators, both in passing the \n     Drug Addition Treatment Act and for their continued \n     encouragement during this long and difficult process. Senator \n     Carl Levin of Michigan has been a special stalwart in this \n     process but the effort has truly been a bipartisan one with \n     Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Joseph Biden of Delaware \n     both playing active roles along with Senator Levin.\n       The importance of this day, however, is much more than the \n     particular medications involved. Buprenorphine to be sure \n     should help in combating opioid dependence in formerly \n     underserved communities. It is estimated that there are up to \n     1 million opioid dependent individuals in the United States \n     of whom less than 200,000 are in treatment. The annual cost \n     to society of opioid addiction is more than 20 billion \n     dollars. Buprenorphine may increase the likelihood of people \n     who have not currently sought out treatment to do so, thus \n     reducing the enormous toll, both in health and in crime, that \n     addiction takes on society. Injecting drug users and their \n     sexual partners, for example, have become the largest new \n     group of individuals becoming HIV positive. While \n     buprenorphine is neither a panacea nor a magic bullet, it \n     has major advantages in terms of safety, duration of \n     action, and ease of withdrawal in comparison to existing \n     medications on the market. That plus the ability to be \n     treated in the privacy of the doctor's office are all \n     important advances.\n       The major importance of the FDA approval and the Drug Abuse \n     Treatment Act, however, go well beyond the particular \n     medications and instead to how we think about addiction. \n     Papers by myself and my colleagues have emphasized that \n     opioid dependence as with other addictions is a chronic \n     relapsing disorder, not a character flaw, failure of will, or \n     lack of self-control. These drugs change our brains, changes \n     that can persist long after the individual has stopped taking \n     the drug and lead frequently to relapse. When a patient who \n     cannot stop smoking on his own seeks help from his physician, \n     he is seen as a patient who needs help and the physician will \n     respond with a variety of medications and behavioral \n     interventions. Likewise, it is my hope that with the advent \n     of these medications the treatment of opioid dependence will \n     be able to be mainstreamed. Individuals who are dependent \n     either on street opioids like heroin or on prescription \n     opioids will be able to receive help in doctors' offices and \n     medical clinics. They will hopefully one day be treated with \n     the same dignity with which we treat the patient trying to \n     give up smoking or the diabetic or the hypertensive, all \n     individuals that have chronic relapsing disorders involving \n     both physical and behavioral components.\n       Addiction is initiated by a voluntary act but this initial \n     voluntary behavior is in many cases shaped by pre-existing \n     genetic factors and there are early brain changes, which may \n     evolve into compulsive drug taking less subject to voluntary \n     control. It is important to recognize, however, that drug \n     dependence erodes but does not erase a dependent individual's \n     responsibility for control of their behavior. Many patients \n     with other chronic illnesses fail to see the importance of \n     their symptoms and thus may ignore physician's advice, fail \n     to comply with medication, and engage in behaviors that \n     exacerbate their illnesses. While such patients may not be as \n     disruptive, demanding, or manipulative as alcohol or drug \n     dependent patients, the patterns of denial of symptoms, \n     failure to comply with medical care and subsequent relapse \n     are not particular to addiction. One thing, however, that \n     does separate addiction from other illnesses is the waiting \n     list for treatment throughout the United States which \n     contradicts assertions that addicted persons do not want \n     help.\n       Compassion or sympathy is not the basis for the argument \n     that physicians should treat addicted individuals. Medically \n     oriented treatments can be quite effective. In addition, \n     addiction treatments have been effectively combined with \n     legal sanctions such as drug courts and court-mandated \n     treatments. Medical interventions should be taught in medical \n     schools and primary care residencies. If physicians develop \n     and apply the skills available to diagnose, treat, monitor, \n     and refer patients in the early stages of substance \n     dependence, there will be fewer late-stage cases.\n       I have been involved in treatment and research with \n     substance dependent individuals for over 35 years, initially \n     at Yale University and the last decade at Columbia \n     University. In between I spent approximately 2\\1/2\\ years as \n     the Deputy Director of the Office of National Drug Control \n     Policy under Bill Bennett and the first President Bush. The \n     new era in office-based treatment of opioid dependence is a \n     worthy successor to efforts made by our Office back in the \n     early 1990's to expand the number of individuals in treatment \n     with substance dependence. My appreciation--and that of many \n     future patients--to the legislators and federal agencies that \n     made this possible.\n       Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n\nPress Conference Participants, FDA Approval of Buprenorphine/Naloxone, \n                        October 9, 2002, SR 236\n\n       Senator Carl Levin.\n       Senator Orrin Hatch.\n       Dr. Frank Vocci, Director of the Division of Treatment \n     Research and Development, National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n       Dr. Steven K.

Mr. President, I wish to bring the Senate's attention to \nthe importance of energy literacy to a national energy policy.\n  The National Energy Policy Development Group recommended an energy \nliteracy project in the May 2001, National Energy Policy. You can find \nit on the first page of Chapter Two, entitled ``Striking Home.'' The \nrecommendation states, ``The NEPD\n\n[[Page S10659]]\n\nGroup recommends that the President direct the Secretary of Energy to \nexplore potential opportunities to develop educational programs related \nto energy development and use. This should include possible legislation \nto create public awareness programs about energy. Such programs should \nbe long term in nature, should be funded and managed by the respective \nenergy industries, and should include information on energy's \ncompatibility with a clean environment.''\n  The legislation currently under consideration in the House/Senate \nconference addresses a lot of important issues but these are tactical \nissues relating to energy. In order to better solve the Nation's long-\nterm energy security or energy needs we must address public education.\n  One of the best ways to go about this would be with a broad based \neducation program as recommended in chapter two. Today's public is far \nbetter informed about their energy choices than the public of even a \ndecade ago, but there is always more room to learn. A highly informed \npublic will be able to make better energy choices and will demand a \nlong-term, far-reaching energy policy.\n  This will require broad based national, and international, public \neducation and information programs on energy issues, including \nconservation and efficiency, the role energy plays in the economy and \nthe impact energy use has on the environment. There must also be a \nfocus on the interlocking relationship of what are referred to as the 3 \nEs: energy, economy, and environment.\n  It is important that all 3 Es be considered simultaneously in order \nto have credibility and to recognize this interlocking relationship. It \nis also important that any effort that tries to achieve a cultural \nchange in how society views energy recognize its importance in the \npublic's economic well-being and its role in the public's quality of \nlife.\n  An excellent example of this is being conducted by the Energy \nLiteracy Project, ELP. The ELP is currently supporting an ongoing \nresearch effort at the Colorado School of Mines to identify programs \nthat offer educational material about the interlocking nature of \nEnergy, the Economy and the Environment, the 3 Es. The ELP is a non-\nprofit 501(c)(3) corporation whose goal is to see a cultural change in \nhow society views the role energy plays in its economic well-being and \nin its quality of life. They have an excellent web site that explains \nmuch of their work located at www.energy-literacy.org.\n  The public wants and deserves sound, reliable information. A \nsustainable energy policy will be much more easily attained with a \nknowledgeable public that can make informed, well-reasoned decisions \nabout its choices and a sustainable energy policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10659-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I would like to raise another \nissue today which has a major impact on older and disabled Americans \nand their families, nursing homes. Under current law, Medicare rates \nfor seniors in nursing homes were reduced by ten percent as of October \n1, because a series of previously-enacted add-on provisions expired. \nLet me be clear. On October 1, the average per diem payment to a \nnursing home to care for a Medicare patient was cut to a level ten \npercent lower than it was on September 30. The average rate fell from \n$337/day to slightly more than $300/day. This is a real cut.\n  This negative quirk results from the fact the Clinton Administration \npoorly implemented the Balanced Budget Act, BBA, of 1997, and in the \nprocess, set Medicare rates for seniors in nursing homes far below the \nlevels Congress set out in the BBA of 1997. Recognizing that the new \nsystem was paying much less for nursing home care for Medicare patients \nthan it had intended, Congress passed the Balanced Budget Refinement \nAct of 1999 and then the Beneficiary Improvement Protection Act of \n2000, which provided limited fixes to the payment structure for skilled \nnursing care through add-on payments. But, because it was expected \nHCFA, now CMS, would ``refine'' the rates and fix the problem, these \nadd-ons were temporary. However, CMS has not yet acted, and the ``add-\non'' provisions have now expired.\n  Recognizing the pending cuts needed to be prevented, in June, I, \nalong with several of my Senate colleagues, introduced the Medicare \nSkilled Nursing Beneficiary Protection Act of 2002. Because I felt \nCongress must ensure beneficiary access to quality care, my bill would \nprotect funding levels for Medicare skilled nursing patients by \nmaintaining payments at 2002 levels going forward.\n  During the last few years, five of the nation's largest providers of \nlong-term care have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Some of \nthose companies are just now emerging from that wrenching process. \nMoreover, 353 skilled nursing homes have closed. In my home State of \nOregon alone, 23 skilled nursing facilities, SNFs, have closed--a loss \nof almost 1,500 beds. For a small state like Oregon, this is a \nsignificant loss. With the cuts in Medicare funding, a vital segment of \nour country's health care system is beginning to be thrown, once again, \ninto crisis. More facilities will close. Patients, especially those in \nrural areas, will find it more difficult to obtain the long-term care \nservices they need.\n  The instability of skilled nursing facilities is expected to worsen \nas states reduce Medicaid expenditures in the face of significant \nbudget shortfalls and as private market capital continues to withdraw \nfrom the sector. If Congress goes home before re-instating the Medicare \npayment add-ons, it will result in failures in the sector that will \ntranslate to unparalleled access problems for Medicare patients needing \ncare in our nation's skilled nursing facilities. I will do everything I \ncan to ensure quality care for our nation's seniors is not threatened.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10659-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10659-S10661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRESSIONAL-EXECUTIVE CONSULTATION ON TRADE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the coming weeks, the Finance Committee \nwill be working closely with the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to develop written Guidelines on consultations between \nthe Administration and Congress in trade negotiations. These Guidelines \nwill be our roadmap for collaboration between the Executive and \nLegislative Branches on trade negotiations for the next five years. \nThey will be the basis for the partnership of equals called for by the \nTrade Act of 2002.\n  The trade negotiation agenda promises to be busy. Even before passage \nof the Trade Act, work was under way in the Doha Round of WTO \nnegotiations and in the Free Trade Area of the Americas negotiations. \nUSTR also was busy concluding free trade agreements with Chile and \nSingapore. Since passage of the Trade Act, USTR has expressed the \nAdministration's interest in beginning FTA negotiations with Morocco, \nCentral America, the Southern African Customs Union, and Australia.\n  This busy agenda requires maximum clarity in the rules governing \ninteraction between the Administration and Congress. Clear rules will \nform a foundation for a common understanding of how we bring trade \nagreements from the concept phase to the implementation phase. This \ncommon understanding will help ensure a smooth process, with few if any \nsurprises or bumps in the road.\n  The Trade Act defines the scope of coverage of the contemplated \nGuidelines on trade negotiations. Specifically, the Guidelines are \nrequired to address: the frequency and nature of briefings on the \nstatus of negotiations; Member and staff access to pertinent \nnegotiating documents; coordination between the Trade Representative \nand the Congressional Oversight Group at all critical periods during \nnegotiating sessions, including at negotiation sites; and consultations \nregarding compliance with and enforcement of trade agreement \nobligations.\n  The Guidelines also must identify a time frame for the President's \ntransmittal of labor rights reports concerning the countries with which \nthe United States concludes trade agreements.\n  The Trade Act contemplates collaboration among USTR, the House Ways \nand Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee in developing the \nGuidelines. I would like to use this opportunity to propose specific \nprovisions that should be included in the Guidelines to maximize the \npotential for a\n\n[[Page S10660]]\n\ntrue partnership between the Legislative and Executive branches.\n  The first issue that needs to be addressed is access to negotiating \ndocuments. When U.S. negotiators prepare to make an offer to their \nforeign counterparts, Congressional trade advisers and staff must be \nable to review the proposed offer in time to provide meaningful input. \nIn general, trade advisers and staff should be able to see such \ndocuments not less than two weeks before U.S. negotiators present their \noffer to our negotiating partners. This will give trade advisers time \nto convey comments and make recommendations, with a reasonable \nexpectation that their comments and recommendations will receive \nserious consideration.\n  By the same token, when another country makes an offer during the \ncourse of a negotiating session, that offer should promptly be made \navailable to Congressional trade advisers and staff. This will enable \ntrade advisers to keep abreast of the give-and-take of negotiations and \nto provide intelligent input into the development of the U.S. position.\n  Second, Congressional trade advisers and staff should have access to \nregularly scheduled negotiating sessions. I know that some in the \nAdministration will bridle at this suggestion, citing separation of \npowers concerns. However, I do not think those concerns are warranted.\n  I am not suggesting that trade advisers or staff actually engage in \nnegotiations. I am suggesting only that they attend as observers. This \nlevel of Congressional involvement in negotiations has well established \nprecedents. A recent study by the Congressional Research Service on the \nrole of the Senate in treaties and other international agreements \ncatalogued instances of Congressional inclusion in delegations \nstretching back to negotiations with Spain in 1898 and continuing to \nthe present day.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the relevant pages of this lengthy CRS \nstudy be printed in the Record at the conclusion of this statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In the early part of the last century, Presidents Harding \nand Hoover actually designated Senators as delegates, not merely \nobservers, to arms limitation negotiations. President Truman included \nMembers of Congress in the delegations that negotiated the \nestablishment of the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty.\n  More recently, a special Senate Arms Control Observers Group was \ncreated in 1985 to oversee negotiations that led to the first Strategic \nArms Reduction Treaty. It included distinguished members of this body, \nincluding Senators Lugar, Stevens, Nunn, Pell, Wallop, Moynihan, \nKennedy, Gore, Warner, and Nickles. President Reagan embraced this \nendeavor, precisely because he knew that a close working relationship \nwith the Senate at the beginning of negotiations would increase the \nlikelihood of ratification at the conclusion.\n  Indeed, the history of Congressional involvement in the negotiation \nof treaties and other international agreements has its roots in the \nvery origins of our Nation. Until the closing days of the \nConstitutional Convention of 1787, the Framers had intended for the \nSenate to have the sole authority to make treaties. And in the \nFederalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton acknowledged that treaty making \n``will be found to partake more of the legislative than of the \nexecutive character . . .''\n\n  The well-recognized utility of Congressional involvement in treaty \nand international agreement negotiation applies with even greater force \nwhen it comes to international trade. For here, the making of \ninternational agreements intersects with the Constitution's express \ngrant of authority to Congress to regulate commerce with foreign \nnations.\n  The statute that framed trade negotiations for the last quarter \ncentury, the Trade Act of 1974, contemplated a close working \nrelationship between Congress and the Administration. Thus, during the \nTokyo Round and Uruguay Round of multinational trade negotiations, \nstaff of the Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee \ntraveled regularly to Geneva. They were included in U.S. Trade \nRepresentative staff meetings and observed negotiations of plurilateral \nand multilateral agreements. They had regular access to cable traffic \nand other negotiating documents. By all accounts, this process worked \nwell. Staff, and, in turn, Members were kept well informed of the \nprogress of negotiations, which helped to secure Congressional support \nfor the resulting agreements.\n  In fact, there are numerous illustrations of close interaction \nbetween Executive and Legislative Branches in the trade negotiation \narena. I myself have attended trade negotiating sessions on a number of \noccasions. Just last year, my staff and I attended a session of the \nFree Trade Area of the Americas negotiations in Quebec City. Before \nthat, I attended some sessions of the mid-term meeting of the Uruguay \nRound negotiations in Montreal. I know that Members of Congress also \nhave been included in delegations to WTO Ministerial meetings in \nSingapore and Seattle. And, I understand that during the Uruguay Round, \nMembers traveled to Geneva at key junctures in negotiations on trade \nremedy laws, and were included in the official delegation to a \nMinisterial meeting in Brussels.\n  Even in the period from 1994 to 2002, when fast track negotiating \nauthority lapsed along with the express mandate for a Congressional-\nExecutive partnership on trade, Members of Congress sought to remain \nclosely involved. For example, I understand that my friend Senator \nGrassley sought permission for staff of the General Accounting Office \nto attend certain negotiations, in order to keep Congress well \ninformed.\n  Now, fast track has been renewed. Once again, we have an express \nmandate for a Congressional-Executive partnership on trade. Indeed, the \nTrade Act of 2002 contemplates an even closer working relationship \nbetween Congress and the Administration than the Trade Act of 1974. It \nis time to revive and strengthen the practices that solidified a close, \nrobust working relationship in the past.\n  Given the long history of Legislative-Executive partnership in \nnegotiating in a whole host of sensitive areas, given the \nconstitutional role of Congress when it comes to regulation of commerce \nwith foreign nations, and given the policy articulated in the Trade Act \nof 2002, I see little basis for excluding Congressional observers from \ntrade negotiations.\n\n  Third, the Guidelines should set forth a clear schedule and format \nfor consultations in connection with negotiating sessions. At a \nminimum, negotiators should meet with Congressional advisers' staff \nshortly before regularly scheduled negotiating sessions and shortly \nafter the conclusion of such sessions. To the extent practicable, the \nAdministration participants in these consultations should be the \nindividuals negotiating on the subjects at issue, as opposed to their \nsupervisors.\n  Consultations should be an opportunity for negotiators to lay out, in \ndetail, their plan of action for upcoming talks and to receive and \nrespond to input from Congressional advisers. Whenever practicable, \nconsultations should be accompanied by documents pertaining to the \nnegotiation at issue. If advisers of staff make recommendations during \nconsultation sessions, arrangements should be made for negotiators to \nrespond following consideration of those recommendations.\n  Additionally, to the extent that Congressional advisers or staff are \nunable to attend negotiating sessions, arrangements should be made to \nprovide briefings by phone during the negotiations.\n  The key point here is that it is the quality as much as the quantity \nof negotiations that counts. It matters little that the Administration \nbriefed Congressional advisers a hundred times in connection with a \ngiven negotiations, if the briefings amount to impressionistic \nsummaries with no meaningful opportunity for advisers to offer input.\n  Fourth, the Guidelines must set forth a plan to keep Congressional \nadvisers fully and timely informed of efforts to monitor and enforce \ntrade agreements. In any trade agreement, follow up is critical. If \ncompliance is spotty, the agreement is not worth the paper it is \nwritten on. Also, monitoring and enforcement help to identify \nprovisions that might be modified in future trade agreements.\n  Currently, Congressional advisers get briefed when a formal dispute \narises or\n\n[[Page S10661]]\n\nsanctions are threatened or imposed. Keeping Congressional advisers in \nthe monitoring and enforcement loop tends to be episodic. It should be \nsystematic.\n  The Guidelines should provide for consultations with Congressional \nadvisers on monitoring and enforcement at least every two months. These \nconsultations should not just highlight problems. They should provide a \ncomplete picture of how the Executive Branch is deploying its \nmonitoring and enforcement resources. They should identify where these \nefforts are succeeding, as well as where they require reenforcement.\n  In conclusion, the Trade Act of 2002 represents a watershed in \nrelations between the Executive and Legislative Branches when it comes \nto trade policy and negotiations. Before the Trade Act, the Executive \nBranch generally took the lead, and the involvement of Congressional \nadvisers tended to be cursory and episodic. In the Trade Act, Congress \nsent a clear message that the old way will not do.\n  From now on, the involvement of Congressional advisers in developing \ntrade policy and negotiations must be in depth and systematic. Congress \ncan no longer be an afterthought. The Trade Act establishes a \npartnership of equals. It recognizes that Congress's constitutional \nauthority to regulate foreign trade and the President's constitutional \nauthority to negotiate with foreign nations are interdependent. It \nrequires a working relationship that reflects that interdependence.\n  Our first opportunity to memorialize this new, interdependent \nrelationship is only weeks away. I am very hopeful that the \nAdministration will work closely with us in developing the Guidelines \nto make the partnership of equals a reality.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Treaties and Other International Agreements: The Role of the United \n                             States Senate\n\n       On occasion Senators or Representatives have served as \n     members of or advisers to the U.S. delegation negotiating a \n     treaty. The practice has occurred throughout American \n     history. In September 1898, President William McKinley \n     appointed three Senators to a commission to negotiate a \n     treaty with Spain. President Warren G. Harding appointed \n     Senators Henry Cabot Lodge and Oscar Underwood as delegates \n     to the Conference on the Limitation of Armaments in 1921 and \n     1922 which resulted in four treaties, and President Hoover \n     appointed two Senators to the London Naval Arms Limitation \n     Conference in 1930.\n       The practice has increased since the end of the Second \n     World War, in part because President Wilson's lack of \n     inclusion of any Senators in the American delegation to the \n     Paris Peace Conference was considered one of the reasons for \n     the failure of the Versailles Treaty. Four of the eight \n     members of the official U.S. delegation to the San Francisco \n     Conference establishing the United Nations were Members of \n     Congress: Senators Tom Connally and Arthur Vandenberg and \n     Representatives Sol Bloom and Charles A. Eaton.\n       There has been some controversy over active Members of \n     Congress serving on such delegations. When President James \n     Madison appointed Senator James A. Bayard and Speaker of the \n     House Henry Clay to the commission that negotiated the Treaty \n     of Ghent in 1814, both resigned from Congress to undertake \n     the task. More recently, as in the annual appointment of \n     Senators or Members of Congress to be among the U.S. \n     representatives to the United Nations General Assembly, \n     Members have participated in delegations without resigning, \n     and many observers consider it ``now common practice and no \n     longer challenged.''\n       One issue has been whether service by a Member of Congress \n     on a delegation violated Article I, Section 6 of the \n     Constitution. This section prohibits Senators or \n     Representatives during their terms from being appointed to a \n     civil office if it has been created or its emoluments \n     increased during their terms, and prohibits a person holding \n     office to be a Member of the Senate or House. Some contend \n     that membership on a negotiating delegation constitutes \n     holding an office while others contend that because of its \n     temporary nature it is not.\n       Another issue concerns the separation of powers. One view \n     is that as a member of a negotiating delegation a Senator \n     would be subject to the instructions of the President and \n     would face a conflict of interest when later required to vote \n     on the treaty in the Senate. Others contend that \n     congressional members of delegations may insist on their \n     independence of action and that in any event upon resuming \n     their legislative duties have a right and duty to act \n     independently of the executive branch on matters concerning \n     the treaty.\n       A compromise solution has been to appoint Members of \n     Congress as advisers or observers, rather than as members \n     of the delegation. The administration has on numerous \n     occasions invited one or more Senators and Members of \n     Congress or congressional staff to serve as advisers to \n     negotiations of multilateral treaties. In 1991 and 1992, \n     for example, Members of Congress and congressional staff \n     were included as advisers and observers in the U.S. \n     delegations to the United Nations Conference on \n     Environment and Development and its preparatory meetings. \n     In 1992, congressional staff advisers were included in the \n     delegations to the World Administrative Radio Conference \n     (WARC) of the International Radio Consultative Committee \n     (CCIR) of the International Telecommunications Union.\n       In the early 1990s, Congress took initiatives to assure \n     congressional observers. The Senate and House each designated \n     an observer group for strategic arms reductions talks with \n     the Soviet Union that began in 1985 and culminated with the \n     Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) approved by the \n     Senate on October 1, 1992. In 1991, the Senate established a \n     Senate World Climate Convention Observer Group. As of late \n     2000, at least two ongoing groups of Senate observers \n     existed:\n       1. Senate National Security Working Group.--This is a \n     bipartisan group of Senators who ``act as official observers \n     to negotiations * * * on the reduction or limitation of \n     nuclear weapons, conventional weapons or weapons of mass \n     destruction; the reduction, limitation, or control of missile \n     defenses; or related export controls.''\n       2. Senate Observer Group on U.N. Climate Change \n     Negotiations.--This is a ``bipartisan group of Senators, \n     appointed by the Majority and Minority Leaders'' to monitor \n     ``the status of negotiations on global climate change and \n     report[ing] periodically to the Senate * * *.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10661-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OUR LADY OF PEACE ACT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, a sensible gun safety measure has been \nrecently passed by our colleagues in the House of Representatives. The \n``Our Lady of Peace Act'' was first introduced by Representative \nCarolyn McCarthy after Reverend Lawrence Penzes and Eileen Tosner were \nkilled at Our Lady of Peace church in Lynbrook, NY on March 12, 2002. \nThese deaths may have been prevented if the assailant's misdemeanor and \nmental health records were part of an automated and complete background \ncheck system.\n  According to the House Judiciary Committee Report on the bill, 25 \nStates have automated less than 60 percent of their felony criminal \nconviction records. While many States have the capacity to fully \nautomate their background check systems, 13 States do not automate or \nmake domestic violence restraining orders accessible through the \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System, otherwise known as \nNICS. Fifteen States do not automate domestic violence misdemeanor \nrecords or make them accessible through NICS. Since 1994, the Brady Law \nhas successfully prevented more than 689,000 individuals from illegally \npurchasing a firearm. More ineligible firearm purchases could have been \nprevented, and more shooting deaths may have been avoided had state \nrecords been fully automated.\n  The Our Lady of Peace Act would require Federal agencies to provide \nany government records with information relevant to determining the \neligibility of a person to buy a gun for inclusion in NICS. It would \nalso require states to make available any records that would disqualify \na person from acquiring a firearm, such as records of convictions for \nmisdemeanor crimes of domestic violence and individuals adjudicated as \nmentally defective. To make this possible, this bill would authorize \nappropriations for grant programs to assist States, courts, and local \ngovernments in establishing or improving automated record systems. I \nhope we can move in this direction this Congress or next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10661-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10661-S10664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ASSISTANCE FOR SOUTH DAKOTA MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND PROVIDERS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, one of the key remaining issues of the \n107th Congress that I believe must be addressed yet this year is \nMedicare relief for rural health care providers and beneficiaries. \nRecently, bipartisan legislation was introduced, called the Beneficiary \nAccess to Care and Medicare Equity Act of 2002, S. 3018, that will \nprovide definitive steps to strengthen South Dakota's rural health care \ndelivery system. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill.\n  The legislation will provide $43 billion over ten years for provider \nand beneficiary improvements in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. \nEarlier\n\n[[Page S10662]]\n\nthis summer, the House passed a Medicare bill, which provides \napproximately $30 billion over ten years. The Senate legislation will \nprovide South Dakota with nearly $84.2 million in Medicare improvements \nfor rural hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health services, \nphysicians, and beneficiaries alike. Although the Administration has \nexpressed some resistance to working with Congress on Medicare \nlegislation this year, I will continue to fight for passage of this \ncritically important legislation.\n  As I travel throughout South Dakota, many health care providers and \nMedicare beneficiaries have expressed concerns regarding inequities \nwith Medicare reimbursements in rural states like South Dakota. It is a \ntravesty that nationwide, rural providers receive less Medicare \nreimbursement for providing the same services as their urban \ncounterparts. Therefore, I remain committed to improving the equity in \nMedicare reimbursement levels for rural States, and increasing access \nto quality, affordable health care for the citizens of South Dakota.\n  As a member of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, I joined several of my \nfellow caucus members in sending a letter to the Senate Finance \nCommittee expressing our rural health priorities as compiled from the \ninput that I received from South Dakotans, such as yourself. I was \npleased that many of my rural priorities were included in S. 3018, and \nwould ask unanimous consent that the text of this letter be printed in \nthe Congressional Record. As well, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsummary of S. 3018 also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 16, 2002.\n     Hon.

We are \n     particularly concerned about geographic inequities in \n     Medicare spending, which are caused in part by disparities in \n     current Medicare payment formulas. Related to this, we \n     strongly urge the Committee to address needed rural payment \n     improvements in its Medicare refinement bill.\n       Nationwide, rural providers receive less Medicare \n     reimbursement for providing the same services as their urban \n     counterparts. According to the latest Medicare figures, \n     Medicare's annual inpatient payments per beneficiary by state \n     of residence range from slightly more than $3,000 in \n     predominately rural states like Wyoming, Idaho and Iowa to \n     over $7,000 in other states.\n       This problem is compounded by the fact that rural Medicare \n     beneficiaries tend to be poorer and have more chronic \n     illnesses than urban beneficiaries. This inherent \n     vulnerability of rural providers combined with historic \n     funding shortfalls and rising costs has placed additional \n     burdens on an already strained rural health care system.\n       It is due to these unique circumstances that rural \n     providers and beneficiaries deserve to be the Committee's top \n     priority as it writes legislation to strengthen the Medicare \n     system. We encourage the Committee to give special \n     consideration to those states that are experiencing the \n     lowest aggregate negative Medicare margins. We request the \n     following rural specific provisions be included in the \n     Committee's final Medicare provider legislation:\n\n                           1. Rural Hospitals\n\n       Market Basket Update: Under current law, all hospitals will \n     receive a Medicare payment update in FY2003 of hospital cost \n     inflation minus approximately one-half percent. However, \n     hospitals in rural areas and smaller urban areas have \n     Medicare profit margins far lower than those of hospitals in \n     large urban areas. Therefore, we urge the Committee to \n     provide hospitals located in rural or smaller urban areas \n     with a full inflation update.\n       Equalize Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital Payment \n     (DSH) Formula: Hospitals receive add-on payments to help \n     cover the costs of serving a high proportion of uninsured \n     patients. While urban facilities can receive unlimited add-\n     ons corresponding with the amount of patients served, rural \n     add-on payments are capped at 5.25 percent of the total \n     amount of the inpatient payment. We urge the Committee to \n     remove this cap for rural hospitals, bringing their payments \n     in line with the benefits urban facilities receive.\n       Close Gap Between Urban and Rural ``Standardized Payment'' \n     Levels: Inpatient hospital payments are calculated by \n     multiplying several different factors, including a \n     standardized payment amount. Under current law, hospitals \n     located in cities with more than 1 million people receive a \n     base payment among 1.6 percent higher than those serving \n     smaller populations. We urge the Committee to address this \n     disparity by bringing the rural base payment up to the urban \n     payment level.\n       Low-Volume Hospital Payment: According to recent data, the \n     current hospital inpatient payment rate has placed low-volume \n     hospitals at a disadvantage because it does not adequately \n     account for the fact that smaller facilities have difficulty \n     achieving the economies of scale of their larger \n     counterparts. To address this problem, we request the \n     Committee create a low-volume inpatient payment adjustment \n     for hospitals that have less than 1,000 annual discharges per \n     year and are located more than 15 miles from another \n     hospital.\n       Outpatient Payment Improvements: Rural Hospitals are highly \n     dependent on outpatient services for revenue; however, the \n     Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System sets payments \n     at 16 percent below costs. We urge the Committee to take the \n     following actions to ensure outpatient stability for rural \n     hospitals.\n       1. Increase emergency room and APC payments by 10 percent.\n       2. Limit the pro rata reduction in pass-through payments to \n     20 percent.\n       3. Limit the budget neutrality adjustment to no more than 2 \n     percent.\n       4. Extend current provision that holds small, rural \n     hospitals harmless from the current Outpatient PPS for three \n     more years.\n       5. Improve and extend transitional corridor payments to \n     rural hospitals.\n       Wage Index Issues: Medicare's current inpatient hospital \n     payments fail to accurately reflect today's labor costs in \n     rural areas. The Caucus has long been concerned about this \n     issue and its impact on rural hospitals as they strive to \n     recruit and retain key health care personnel. We strongly \n     urge the Committee to address the area wage index disparities \n     with new money.\n       Current law allows rural facilities located near urban area \n     to receive the higher wage index available to the facilities \n     located in the metropolitan area. However, this wage index \n     ``reclassification'' is available only for inpatient and \n     outpatient services. We believe re-classification should \n     extend to other services offered by hospitals, such as home \n     care and skilled nursing services.\n\n            2. Critical Access Hospital Program Improvements\n\n       The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created the Critical Access \n     Hospital program (CAH) to ensure access to essential health \n     services in underserved rural communities that cannot support \n     a full service hospital. This program has proven to be \n     critically important to rural areas as 667 hospitals across \n     the nation have converted to Critical Access Hospital status. \n     We urge the Committee to include the following modifications \n     to strengthen this critical program.\n        Reinstate Periodic Interim Payments (PIP), which \n     provide facilities with a steadier stream of payment in order \n     to improve their cash flow.\n        Eliminate the current requirement that CAH-based \n     ambulance services be at least 35 miles from another \n     ambulance service in order to receive cost-based payment.\n        Allow for home health services operated by CAHs to \n     be reimbursed on a cost basis, as other CAH services already \n     are.\n        Provide cost-based reimbursement for certain \n     clinical diagnostic lab tests furnished by a CAH.\n        Provide Medicare coverage to CAHs for certain \n     emergency room on-call providers.\n        Allow CAHs to interchange the number of their \n     acute and swing beds as necessary, but still maintain the \n     current 25 bed limit.\n        Alleviate payment reductions that will occur as a \n     result of recent cost report changes made by CMS related to \n     the amount of allowable beneficiary coinsurance payments.\n\n                   3. Rural Home Health Improvements\n\n       Home health care is a critical element of the continuum of \n     care, allowing Medicare beneficiaries to remain in their \n     homes rather than being hospitalized. Current law provides \n     for a 10 percent payment boost for patients residing in rural \n     areas, to reflect the higher costs due to distance, as well \n     as the reality that there is often only one provider in rural \n     areas. However, this special payment will expire with the \n     current fiscal year.\n\n                        4. Rural Health Clinics\n\n       Under current law, rural health clinics receive an all-\n     inclusive payment rate that is capped at approximately $63. \n     Various analyses have suggested that this cap does not \n     appropriately cover the cost of services for more than 50 \n     percent of rural health clinics that the cap should be raised \n     by 25 percent to address this shortfall. We request that the \n     Committee raise the rural health clinic cap to $79.\n       Certain provider services, such as those offered by \n     physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and \n     qualified psychologists are excluded from the consolidated \n     payments made to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) under the \n     prospective payment system. However, the same services \n     provided to SNFs by physicians and other providers employed \n     by rural health clinics are not excluded from the \n     consolidated SNF payment. We request the Committee ensure \n     skilled nursing services offered by rural health clinic \n     providers will receive the same payment treatment as services \n     offered by providers employed in other settings.\n\n                           5. Rural Providers\n\n       Rural Physicians: There are several ways to improve the \n     current Medicare Incentive\n\n[[Page S10663]]\n\n     Payment program to increase payments to rural physicians. \n     Such changes include: placing the burden for determining \n     eligibility for the current 10 percent rural physician bonus \n     payment on the Medicare carrier rather than the individual \n     physician; creating a Medicare Incentive Payment Education \n     program at CMS; and establishing an on-going analysis of the \n     program's ability to improve Medicare beneficiaries' access \n     to physician services. We urge the Committee to make these \n     critical changes to the Medicare Inventive Payment program.\n       Mental Health Providers: The majority of rural and frontier \n     areas are federally designated mental health professional \n     shortage areas. In many of these underserved communities, a \n     Marriage and Family Therapist or a Licensed Professional \n     Counselor is the only mental health provider available to \n     seniors, but is not able to bill Medicare for their services. \n     We strongly urge the Committee to provide Medicare \n     reimbursement for Licensed Professional Counselors and \n     Marriage and Family Therapists at the rate that Social \n     Workers are paid.\n\n                         6. Other Rural Issues\n\n       Ambulance Services: The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \n     directed the Secretary of Health and Human services to \n     establish a fee schedule payment system for ambulance \n     services. The negotiated rule making committee that was \n     utilized in the regulatory process instructed the Secretary \n     to account for geographic differences and develop a more \n     appropriate coding system. However, the current ambulance \n     payment system does not recognize the unique circumstances of \n     low-volume, rural providers. We strongly urge the Committee \n     to address these issues to ensure access to critical \n     ambulance services in rural and frontier communities.\n       Pathology Labs: Currently, independent labs can bill \n     Medicare directly for all services. After January 1, 2003 \n     labs will only be able to bill for diagnosis of slides \n     prepared by the lab. The costs of slide preparation must be \n     recovered separately from the hospital. Small, rural \n     hospitals that do not have their own pathology departments \n     and independent labs face increased administrative costs and \n     complexity in this new billing arrangement. We request that \n     the Committee make permanent the grandfather clause enacted \n     in BIPA to allow independent labs to receive direct \n     reimbursement from Medicare.\n       National Health Service Corps Taxation: The National Health \n     Service Corps program (NHSC) provides either scholarships or \n     loan-repayments to clinicians who agree to serve for at least \n     three years in a designated health professional shortage \n     area. Last year's tax cut exempted NHSC scholarships from \n     taxation, but loan-repayments are still considered taxable \n     income. As a result, almost half of the current NHSC \n     appropriation is spent in the form of stipends to clinicians \n     to offset the tax liability on loan repayments. We strongly \n     urge the Committee to exempt the NHSC loan repayments from \n     taxation.\n       Flex Reauthorization: As you know, the Balanced Budget Act \n     of 1997 created the Rural Hospital Flexibility program (known \n     as the ``flex'' program) to assist small rural hospitals in \n     making the switch to Critical Access Hospital status (CAH). \n     This program has proven to be very successful in rural areas \n     as it has maintained access to critical care in small \n     communities. Program funds are used by states for Critical \n     Access Hospital designation and assistance, rural health \n     planning and network development, and rural emergency medical \n     services. We urge the Committee to reauthorize this important \n     rural health program.\n       We greatly appreciate the Committee's past efforts on \n     behalf of our nation's rural health care delivery system. We \n     look forward to continuing to work with you to ensure that \n     all rural providers receive the necessary resources to \n     provide quality health care services to rural seniors.\n           Sincerely,\n         Craig Thomas (Co-Chair), Sam Brownback, ----, Byron L. \n           Dorgan, Ben Nelson, ----, Fred H.

Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to recess until \nafter the November elections, I would like to take a moment to express \nmy thanks and the thanks of the people of Wisconsin to our Nation's \nveterans and their families.\n  The Senate will not be in session on Veterans Day, November 11th. I \nurge my colleagues and all Americans to take a moment on that day to \nreflect upon the meaning of that day and to remember those who have \nserved and sacrificed to protect our country and the freedoms that we \nenjoy as Americans.\n  Webster's Dictionary defines a veteran as ``one with a long record of \nservice in a particular activity or capacity,'' or ``one who has been \nin the armed forces.'' But we can also define a veteran as a \ngrandfather or a grandmother, a father or a mother, a brother or a \nsister, a son or a daughter. Veterans live in all of our communities, \nand their contributions have touched all of our lives.\n  November 11 is a date with special significance in our history. On \nthat day in 1918--at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the \neleventh month--World War I ended. In 1926, a joint resolution of \nCongress called on the President to issue a proclamation to encourage \nall Americans to mark this day by displaying the United States flag and \nby observing the day with appropriate ceremonies.\n  In 1938, ``Armistice Day'' was designated as a legal holiday ``to be \ndedicated to the cause of world peace'' by an Act of Congress. This \nannual recognition of the contributions and sacrifices of our Nation's \nveterans of World War I was renamed ``Veterans Day'' in 1954 so that we \nmight also recognize the service and sacrifice of those who had fought \nin World War II and the veterans of all of America's other wars.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's veterans and their families have given \nselflessly to the cause of protecting our freedom. Too many have given \nthe ultimate sacrifice for their country, from the battlefields of the \nRevolutionary War that gave birth to the United States to the Civil War \nthat sought to secure for all Americans the freedoms envisioned by the \nFounding Fathers. In the last century, Americans fought and died in two \nworld wars and in conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf. \nThey also participated in peacekeeping missions around the globe, some \nof which are still going on. Today, our men and women in uniform are \nwaging a fight against terrorism. And in the future, our military \npersonnel could be asked to undertake a campaign in Iraq.\n  As we prepare to commemorate Veterans Day 2002, we should reflect on \nthe\n\n[[Page S10665]]\n\nsacrifices--past, present, and future--that are made by our men and \nwomen in uniform and their families. We can and should do more for our \nveterans to ensure that they have a decent standard of living and \naccess to adequate health care.\n  For those reasons, I am deeply concerned about a memorandum that was \nsent to Veterans Integrated Service Network Directors by Deputy Under \nSecretary for Health for Operations and Management Laura Miller in July \nordering them to ``ensure that no marketing activities to enroll new \nveterans occur within your networks.'' The memo continued, ``[i]t is \nimportant to attend veteran-focused events as part of our \nresponsibilities, but there is a difference between providing general \ninformation and actively recruiting people into the system.''\n  Deputy Under Secretary Miller's memo states that the increased demand \nfor VA health care services exceeds the VA's current resources. \nAccording to the memo, ``In this environment, marketing VA services \nwith such activities as health fairs, veteran open houses to invite new \nveterans to the facilities, or enrollment displays at VSO, Veteran \nService Officer meetings, are inappropriate.''\n  While it is clear that more funding should be provided for VA health \ncare and other programs, what is inappropriate is for the VA to \ninstitute a policy to stop making veterans aware of the health care \nservices for which they may be eligible.\n  Soon after this memo was issued, I joined with the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) and a number of colleagues to send a letter \nto the President that expressed concern about the memo and asked that \nthe policy outlined in it be reversed. As of today, Mr. President, more \nthan two months later, we have yet to receive a reply to that letter.\n  I call on the President and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nreverse immediately this unacceptable policy.\n  After the 108th Congress convenes next year, I plan to introduce a \ncomprehensive package of reforms that will help to ensure that our \nnation's veterans are treated in a fashion that respects and recognizes \nthe contributions that they have made to protect generations of \nAmericans.\n  I am working to build on two pieces of legislation that I introduced \nduring the 107th Congress. The National I Owe You Act, which I \nintroduced with the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], would require the \nVA to take more aggressive steps to make veterans aware of the benefits \nthat are owed to them. This legislation, which was inspired by the \nWisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs' ``I Owe You'' program, would \ncreate programs that identify eligible veterans who are not receiving \nbenefits, notify veterans of changes in benefit programs, and encourage \nveterans to apply for benefits. The bill also would direct the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to develop an outreach program that \nencourages veterans and dependents to apply, or to reapply, for federal \nbenefits.\n\n  This legislation in no way duplicates the work of County Veterans \nService Officers (CVSOs) in my state and other states. The work of \nCVSOs is indispensable for reaching out to veterans, particularly in \nrural areas. The I Owe You Act simply calls for the VA to develop a \nprogram that encourages veterans to apply for benefits, identify \nveterans who are eligible but not receiving benefits, and notify \nveterans of any modifications to benefit programs. The new VA policy \nthat prohibits marketing of health programs underscores the need for \nlegislation in this area.\n  In addition, I have heard from many Wisconsin veterans about the need \nto improve claims processing at the VA. They are justifiably angry and \nfrustrated about the amount of time it takes for the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration to process their claims. In some instances, veterans are \nwaiting well over a year. Telling the men and women who served their \ncountry in the Armed Forces that they ``just have to wait'' is wrong \nand unacceptable.\n  In response to these concerns, I joined with the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch) to introduce the Veterans Benefits Administration \nImprovement Act, which would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nto submit a comprehensive plan to Congress for the improvement of the \nprocessing of claims for veterans compensation and pensions. In \naddition, every six months afterwards, the Secretary must report to \nCongress about the status of the program. I remain concerned about \nclaims processing, and will continue to work with the VA and with my \ncolleagues to address this important issue.\n  I look forward to continuing to meet with veterans and their families \naround Wisconsin in order to hear directly from them what services they \nneed and what gaps remain in the VA system.\n  And so, Mr. President, this coming Veterans Day, and throughout the \nyear, let us continue to honor America's great veterans.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10665-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10665-S10666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WORKPLACE SAFETY IN THE CHEMICAL PROCESSING INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's \nattention a disturbing new Federal study related to chemical plant \nsafety. This report, dated September 24th from the U.S. Chemical Safety \nand Hazard Investigation Board, describes the hazards of what are \ncalled reactive chemicals. These are substances that can react \nviolently, decompose, burn or explode when managed improperly in \nindustrial settings. Process accidents involving reactive chemicals are \nreported to be responsible for significant numbers of deaths and \ninjuries and considerable property losses in U.S. industries.\n  The investigation by the independent, non-regulatory board points out \nsignificant deficiencies in federal safety regulations that are meant \nto control the dangers from chemical processes. As the result of these \ninadequacies, more than half of the serious accidents caused by \nreactive chemicals occurred in processes that were exempt from the \nmajor Federal process safety rules.\n  These regulations known as the OSHA Process Safety Management \nstandard and the EPA Risk Management Program rule -were mandated in the \nlandmark 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Unfortunately, OSHA chose to \nregulate just a small handful of reactive chemicals only 38 substances \nout of the many thousands of chemicals used in commerce. EPA for its \npart did not regulate any reactive chemicals at all.\n  The tragic results of these omissions now seem apparent. The Chemical \nSafety Board uncovered 167 serious reactive chemical incidents in the \nU.S. over the last 20 years. More than half of these occurred after \nOSHA's rules were adopted in 1992. Serious chemical explosions and \nfires continue to occur in states around the country. Recent fatal \naccidents in Texas, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey are among \nthose catalogued in the Chemical Safety Board's investigation.\n  Take the case, for example, of 45-year old Rodney Gott, a supervisor \nat the Phillips Chemical complex in Pasadena, Texas, outside of \nHouston. On numerous occasions Mr. Gott was spared as deadly accidents \noccurred at his plant and those nearby. On one occasion in 1989, 23 of \nhis coworkers were killed during a chemical explosion at his plant. But \neleven years later, as he worked next to a 12,000 gallon storage tank \ncontaining reactive chemical residues, he fell victim to a huge \nexplosion. Sixty-nine of his colleagues were injured, including some \nwho were burned almost beyond recognition. Rodney Gott never made it \nout.\n  As a result of the loophole in OSHA and EPA regulations, many \nindustrial facilities that handle reactive chemicals are not required \nto follow basic good engineering and safety management practices \npractices such as hazard analysis, worker training, and maintenance of \nprocess equipment.\n  Frankly, this is hard to understand. These sound to me like practices \nthat should be followed universally in the chemical industry. There \nshould be little disagreement about the need to require these practices \nwherever dangerous reactive chemicals are in use.\n  Nonetheless, OSHA has failed to take action to improve its process \nsafety standard. The last administration had regulation of reactive \nchemicals on its agenda, but did not complete work on the task before \nleaving office. In December 2001, the new OSHA administration \ninexplicably dropped rulemaking on reactive chemicals from their \npublished regulatory agenda. I convened\n\n[[Page S10666]]\n\nan oversight hearing of the Subcommittee on Employment, Safety and \nTraining in July of this year to examine this issue among others.\n  OSHA Assistant Secretary John Henshaw appeared at that hearing. While \nhe earlier stated that reactive chemical safety is a ``vital interest'' \nof the agency, he would not commit to me any particular timetable to \nput this important rulemaking back on track. I am deeply concerned at \nOSHA's failure to issue new and revised safety standards on an \nefficient schedule and at the low priority this item appears to have on \nOSHA's agenda. As the Chemical Safety Board's compelling statistics \nmake clear, every year of delay on this regulation will cause \nadditional needless deaths among America's working families. And there \nis ever present risk of a public catastrophe.\n  The Chemical Safety Board has now issued strong recommendations to \nboth OSHA and EPA to address the safety of reactive chemicals through \nnew regulations. President Bush's new appointee to head the Board, \nCarolyn Merritt, endorsed both these actions. A 30-year veteran of the \nchemical industry, she lamented the loss of life from reactive \nchemicals, noting that ``it is much cheaper to invest in sound safety \nmanagement systems than to pay the cost of a major accident.'' I hope \nthis is a view that prevails within the administration.\n  By statute, OSHA and EPA must respond to the Chemical Safety Board's \nrecommendations within 180 days. I urge both Assistant Secretary \nHenshaw and Administrator Whitman not to wait, but to immediately \naccept these recommendations and begin enacting new standards. Every \nday without these standards is another day of peril for workers like \nRodney Gott, and for the thousands of people who live and work around \nchemical facilities nationwide.\n  The Executive Summary of the Chemical Safety Board's investigation \nImproving Reactive Hazard Management is too lengthy to include in the \nrecord. It can be found on the Chemical Safety Board Web site: http://\nwww.csb.gov/info/docs/2002/ExecutiveSummary.pdf\n\n____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10666-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10666-S10667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REALITY CHECK ON BALLISTIC IMAGING\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Washington, DC, area is in the midst of \na terrible crisis. As we all know too well, a murderer has gunned down \nnine people in cold blood during the past two weeks. Two other victims, \nincluding a child, have by the grace of God survived these sick and \nsenseless attacks. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the bereaved, \neven as we try to comfort and reassure our own families and \ncommunities.\n  I am confident that the deranged person or persons causing all this \nsuffering will be caught. The attempt to hold this area hostage to fear \nand intimidation will fail, and law enforcement officers will bring the \nguilty to justice.\n  As investigators are running down tips and testing forensic evidence, \na sudden cry has gone up in some quarters demanding the dramatic \nexpansion of a process known as ``ballistic imaging.'' This technology \nis a tool employed to assist law enforcement in the analysis of crimes \ncommitted with a firearm.\n  I would like to take a moment to talk about this technology and make \nsure all our colleagues understand its benefits and limitations. It is \neasy for good people in the heat and emotion of these troubled times to \nbe swept away by apparently easy solutions to enormously complex \nproblems, and I believe that before we begin to think about expanding \nballistic imaging in the United States, we should first take stock of \nwhat we do know.\n  Ballistic imaging technology can be a useful tool in the \ninvestigation of crimes committed with firearms. As currently used, \nforensic experts are able to electronically scan into a database a \nshell casing recovered from a crime scene to determine if that case \nmatches those from other crime scenes. The technology can serve as a \nstarting point in assisting law enforcement in determining if the same \nfirearm was involved in multiple crimes.\n  The Federal Government has worked for nearly 10 years on developing \nan imaging network. The National Integrated Ballistic Information \nNetwork, NIBIN, administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms, BATF, provides Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nofficials with critical ballistics information on crimes committed with \na firearm. This system matches shell casings recovered from crime \nscenes to ascertain if a firearm has been used in multiple assaults. By \nfocusing strictly on cases recovered from crime scenes, NIBIN cannot be \nused to build a database of firearm owners, thereby guaranteeing the \nsecurity and legal rights of millions of Americans who are law-abiding \ngun owners.\n  How does it work? When a firearm is discharged, both the shell casing \nand the bullet traveling down the barrel of the gun are imprinted with \ndistinctive marks. The bullet takes on marks from the barrel's rifling, \nand the casing is marked by the gun's breech face, firing pin and shell \nejector mechanism. Some guns, such as revolvers or single-shot rifles, \nmight not leave ejection marks. These imprints are distinctive to a \nfirearm. A ballistic imaging program can run a casing through its \ndatabase and select those that offer a close match. A final \nidentification is made visually by a highly trained ballistic examiner. \nThis process does not lend itself to examining bullets from a firearm. \nOften, bullets are severely damaged on impact. Bullets recovered are \nusually examined visually by experts.\n  It is critically important to understand that this is not ``ballistic \nDNA'' or ``ballistic fingerprinting.'' Unlike DNA or fingerprints that \ndo not change over time, the unique marks that can identify a \nparticular bullet or shell casing can change because of a number of \nenvironmental and use factors. Barrels and operating parts of firearms \nchange with use and wear and tear over time. Moreover, a person can, \nwithin minutes, use a file to scratch marks in a barrel or breech face, \nor replace a firing pin, extractor, and barrel thereby giving a firearm \na completely ``new'' ballistic identity. In other words, imaging \nremains a tool, but not a silver bullet, in criminal investigations.\n  Legitimate concerns have been raised about creating a national \ndatabase that would store ballistic images from all firearms sold. We \nknow that such a database would involve huge costs to the government, \nfirearms manufacturers, and customers. Furthermore, it raises questions \nabout a legal ``chain of evidence,'' i.e., how to handle and store \nhundreds of millions of bullets or shell casings without exposing all \nsuch evidence to attack by defense lawyers. It could also break \nexisting law by creating a database of law-abiding firearms owners and \nprove much less effective than NIBIN.\n  A recent study completed by the California Department of Forensic \nServices on creating a ballistic imaging network merely on a statewide \nlevel stated: ``When applying this technology to the concept of mass \nsampling of manufactured firearms, a huge inventory of potential \ncandidates will be generated for manual review. This study indicates \nthat the number of candidate cases will be so large as to be \nimpractical and will likely create logistic complications so great that \nthey cannot be effectively addressed.'' The study pointed out that when \nexpanding the database of spent shell casings, the system will generate \nso many ``hits'' that could be potential matches, it would not be of \nany use to forensic examiners. Other problems included guns making \ndifferent markings on casings from different ammunition manufacturers; \nthe shipping, handling, and storage of spent shell casings; the fact \nthat some firearms do not leave marks that can be traced back to that \nparticular firearm; and the requirement of highly-trained personnel for \nproper operation.\n  What about the success rate of statewide systems already in \noperation? Maryland introduced its own ballistic imaging system in \n2000. Every new handgun that is sold in the State must be accompanied \nby spent shell casings for input into the imaging network. According to \nMaryland budget figures, approximately $5 million has been spent on the \nsystem. According to Maryland law enforcement officials, it contains \nover 11,000 imaged cartridges, has been queried a total of 155 times \nand has not been responsible for solving any crimes. Meanwhile, in New \nYork, there have been thousands of cartridges entered into their \ndatabase\n\n[[Page S10667]]\n\nand, according to reports, no traces have resulted in criminal \nprosecutions.\n  Let me raise one more concern. It is clear that any ballistic imaging \nnetwork would only be as good as the records it contains. While all the \nproposals put forward deal with compiling information from new \nfirearms, today in the United States, it is estimated that there are \nmore than 200 million firearms in private hands. It would be impossible \nto retrieve these firearms for ballistics documentation without \nviolating the constitutional rights of millions of law abiding firearms \nowners.\n  All of these considerations should be food for thought to anyone \nseriously contemplating a national ballistic imaging network. At the \nvery least, they support the conclusion that we should look, and look \ncarefully, before we leap into this system. President Bush is calling \nfor a study of the ballistic imaging technology, and so are some \nmembers of Congress. For example, the Ballistic Imaging Evaluation and \nStudy Act, introduced in both the House and Senate by the bipartisan, \nbicameral team of Representative Melissa Hart and Senator Zell Miller, \nwould order the Department of Justice to contract for a study by the \nNational Academy of Sciences, which would examine the many questions \nsurrounding imaging technology and provide a list of recommendations to \npolicymakers and Congress. Enacting legislation to begin a study of \nthis technology should be a priority. The proper allocation of dollars \nto fight crime is critical to ensuring safe communities, and we should \nobtain firm scientific conclusions on which to base decisions on how \nbest to deploy this technology.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10667-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               IN CELEBRATION OF THE WOMEN AT GROUND ZERO\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to share with the Senate my thoughts on 33 women who \ncourageously served as rescue and medical workers, firefighters and \npolice officers in New York City on September 11, 2001.\n  It is my great honor to recognize the extraordinary contributions \nmade by these rescue workers who bravely worked to save lives at Ground \nZero in New York City during the horror of September 11, 2001. The \nselfless actions of these women helped heal our country during a time \nof national tragedy. On September 11, we found out as a Nation what \nheroism truly is, how strong and united we can be, how we can set aside \ndifferences for the greater good and work together. And these women \nhelped show us the way.\n  Some wonderful people in my home State of California are bringing \nthese women to Sonoma County for an all-expense-paid week in the wine \ncountry to pay tribute to their heroism. I want to send my warmest \nthanks to Susan Hagen and Mary Carouba, authors of Women at Ground \nZero, who wanted to make sure that the contributions of women rescue \nworkers were recognized and honored along with their male counterparts.\n  In honor of their incredible efforts on September 11 and the \nimportant work they do every day, I am going to read the names of 30 \nwomen who worked at Ground Zero and then I will remember 3 women rescue \nworkers who lost their lives on September 11, 2001.\n  Detective Jennifer Abramowitz; Rose Arce, who is not a rescue worker \nbut who was doing a live broadcast next to Ground Zero on September 11 \nin order to get vital escape and rescue information out; Lieutenant \nDoreen Ascatigno; Captain Brenda Berkman; Maureen Brown; Tracy Donahoo; \nMajor Kally Eastman; Bonnie Giebfried; Lieutenant Kathleen Gonczi; \nSarah Hallett, PhD; Captain Rochelle ``Rocky'' Jones; Sue Keane; Tracy \nLewis; Patty Lucci; Christine Mazzola; Lieutenant Ella McNair; Captain \nMarianne Monahan; Lieutenant Amy Monroe; Lois Mungay; Captain Janice \nOlszewski; Carol Paukner; Sergeant Carey Policastro; Mercedes Rivera; \nLieutenant Kim Royster; Maureen McArdle-Schulman; Major Molly \nShotzberger; JoAnn Spreen; Captain Terri Tobin; Nancy Ramos-Williams; \nand Regina Wilson.\n  I also want the following names to be memorialized today: Yamel \nMerino, Emergency Medical Technician; Captain Kathy Mazza, Commanding \nOfficer of the Police Academy at the Port Authority Police Department; \nand Moira Smith, police officer with the New York Police Department. \nAll three of these women sacrificed their lives on September 11, 2001 \nin their heroic efforts to save the lives of others.\n  None of us is untouched by the terror of September 11, and many \nCalifornians were part of each tragic moment of that tragic day.

Mr. President, I come before my colleagues today \nto pay tribute to the San Francisco Giants and their exceptional \nachievements on their road to the National League Pennant. On October \n14, the Giants won the National League Championship Series in the \nbottom of the ninth inning on three consecutive hits in a rally that \nbegan with two outs. This game, and this particular conclusion, were \nemblematic of their entire season--hard fought, dramatic and filled \nwith contributions from the entire lineup.\n  Earlier in the season some said that the team did not have a serious \nchance to make the post-season. One local sports columnist said the \nGiants should play minor league prospects in September because their \nsituation was effectively hopeless--the Giants were 11\\1/2\\ games out \nof first place in the Western Division with a week left in August.\n  Manager Dusty Baker said throughout the season that the Giants were a \nteam of veterans, and he expected them to have a strong second half of \nthe season. He was right, as he has been so many times. After their low \nmark in August the team went on a run that never ended. The Giants have \nwon 32 of their past 43 games, including eight straight at the end of \nthe season.\n  This will be the first World Series appearance for the San Francisco \nGiants since 1989. Their only other trip to the Series was in 1962. \nGiants fans are rightly thrilled. This has been a special season for \nthe Giants, marked by savvy decisions in the front office, great \nleadership from the manager, key contributions from the entire team and \noutstanding fan support.

The Angels 13 to 5 win on October \n13 gives Anaheim its first World Series berth in its 42-year history, a \ndream come true for Angels' fans around the country.\n  Throughout the 2002 season, the Angels have demonstrated the grit, \ndedication and focus that it takes to become champions. Baseball fans \nacross the Nation have fallen in love with this team, not only because \nof its winning ways, but because of how it wins. It is only appropriate \nthat the Angels' hard work be rewarded with a chance at a World Series \nChampionship.\n  The road to the World Series was not easy for the Anaheim Angels. \nMaking the playoffs as a wildcard team, nobody expected the Angels to \nwin. When the team matched up against the perennial favorite New York \nYankees in the first round of the playoffs, the odds against them grew \neven greater. However, against all odds, and contrary to the experts \nwho said they could not win, the Anaheim Angels went out and proved \neveryone wrong.\n  On the strength of a record-tying inning, and a three home-run night \nby second baseman Adam Kennedy, the Angels scored 10 runs in the \nseventh inning to beat a determined Minnesota\n\n[[Page S10668]]\n\nTwins team. This come-from-behind win epitomizes the heart of the \nAngels organization, not only this year but throughout its storied \nhistory, a history that came full circle when Jackie Autry, widow of \nthe Angels founder and owner and cowboy legend Gene Autry, presented \nthe team with the League Championship trophy.\n  The Anaheim Angels symbolize what makes team sports great. The team \nproved that you do not need the biggest stars or the highest payroll to \nachieve the greatest of goals. I wish the Angels the best of luck in \nthe World Series, and, on behalf of all the fans, I thank the team for \nwhat has already been one of the most memorable baseball seasons \never.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10668-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LILLIAN GOLDMAN\n\n Mrs. CLINTON.

I was fortunate \nenough to be Lillian's friend, and I know how much her friendship meant \nto me and to so many others. I witnessed the effects she had on people \nand their futures. Four years ago, Lillian gave a significant gift to \nthe 92nd Street Y for the family center. Two years ago, I was \nprivileged to attend the dedication of the Lillian Goldman Law Library \nat Yale Law School. Among the many things about which she cared was the \nability of women to make careers in the law, and especially to be \neducated at Yale Law School. Not only would she provide the \nscholarships to make that possible, she would have the foresight to \nsupport daycare at the law school, as well.\n  Women, children and their families, will be indebted to Lillian \nGoldman, her generosity and her progressivism for many generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10668-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO KATHLEEN CLARK HOYT\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today to honor and \ncongratulate Kathleen Clark Hoyt of Norwich, VT, who will retire from \nVermont State government on November 1 after many years of dedicated \npublic service.\n  Most recently, Kathy Hoyt has served as Secretary of Administration \nin the cabinet of Governor Howard B. Dean, a position she has held \nsince 1997. As such, she has been one of the most influential forces in \nour State government.\n  Kathy Hoyt's years of service date back more than three decades. In \nher native State of North Carolina, she worked to help fight poverty, \ncreate jobs and housing, and provide leadership training for minorities \nand the poor. After arriving in Vermont in 1968, she went to work with \nthe State Office of Economic Opportunity, devoting herself to such \nissues as welfare reform and child care. She went on to become \nCommissioner of the Vermont Department of Employment and Training, and \nin 1989, she was appointed Chief of Staff and Secretary of Civil and \nMilitary Affairs for Gov. Madeleine Kunin.\n  Kathy Hoyt left State government when Gov. Kunin's term ended in \nJanuary 1991, but her absence was short-lived. When Gov. Kunin's \nsuccessor, Gov. Richard Snelling, died in office eight months later, \nKathy Hoyt was summoned back to assist incoming Gov. Dean with the \nsudden transition. Once again, Kathy Hoyt found herself serving as \nChief of Staff to a Vermont governor. Her unexpected re-entry in State \ngovernment would keep her there for nearly a dozen more years.\n  Of all the tributes that have been made and will be made to Kathy \nHoyt, perhaps her contribution to State government was best summed up \nby Gov. Dean. In a newspaper profile of Kathy Hoyt, Gov. Dean referred \nto his close confidante simply as ``Saint Kathy.''\n  I would like to take this opportunity to wish Kathy Hoyt the best in \nher future endeavors, and to personally thank her for the devotion she \nhas shown to our great State of Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10668-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10668-S10670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN CELEBRATION OF HISPANIC HERITAGE IN NEW MEXICO\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncontributions of Hispanic Americans to New Mexico and this great \ncountry. I am so proud that New Mexico leads the Nation with the \nhighest Hispanic percentage of population of any State, 42 percent. Of \nthe 50 counties nationwide where Hispanics made up a majority of the \npopulation, 43 were located in either New Mexico or Texas. Today New \nMexico received the news that five of our own have been named to \nHispanic Business magazine's ``100 Most Influential Hispanics'' list. \nIt is no surprise that our State has produced tremendous representation \nof Hispanic accomplishments on the national scene in the past year. It \ngives me great pleasure today to acknowledge the many ways Hispanic New \nMexicans have made a national name for themselves and our state in \nmilitary and government service, the arts, education, business, sports, \nand many other fields.\n  As our Nation focuses on fighting terrorism around the globe and \nkeeping our homeland safe, we are indebted more than ever to those \nserving in our military. Currently, more than 100,000 Hispanic \nAmericans serve in our Nation's armed forces, making up about nine \npercent of our military. Thirty-eight Hispanics have attained the \nNation's highest award for valor, the Medal of Honor. Five Hispanic New \nMexicans have earned this medal serving in the United States Army, \nthree in World War II, including Private Joseph P. Martinez, of Taos; \nPrivate First Class Alejandro R. Renteria Ruiz of Loving, NM, and \nPrivate First Class Jose F. Valdez, born in Governador, NM; and two in \nVietnam, including Army Specialist Fourth Class Daniel Fernandez of \nAlbuquerque, and Warrant Officer, then Sergeant First Class, Louis R. \nRocco, of Albuquerque.\n  April 2002 marked the 60-year anniversary of the horrific Bataan \nDeath March, a calamitous event that involved 1,817 New Mexicans, with \nfewer than 900 returning home. Memorials were unveiled in Albuquerque \nand Las Cruces to commemorate the brave veterans of this horrific \nordeal, many of whom were Hispanic. In fact, several of the veterans on \nwhich this memorial was based were Hispanic natives of Southern New \nMexico who survived the march, Private First Class Jose M. ``Pepe'' \nBaldonado, and Staff Sergeant Juan T. Baldonado. One of the veterans of \nthis 65-mile forced march and labor camp internment, Ruben Flores of \nLas Cruces, passed away this year just before the memorial was \nunveiled. I am pleased that this year we have created a lasting tribute \nto thank these members of the New Mexico National Guard for their \ngallant service and valorous sacrifice under conditions too horrific \nfor words, and today I salute them once again.\n  It has been fantastic for New Mexico that several of our citizens \nhave been appointed by President Bush to serve in important capacities \nin the Federal Government. But it is also terrific for Hispanics around \nour nation that many of these individuals happen to be Hispanic. We are \nseeing greater representation of Hispanics in appointed positions and \nas candidates in elections around the country, and I'm proud of the New \nMexicans who are blazing the trail in government service.\n  Just to name a few, I am thinking of Lou Gallegos, now Assistant \nSecretary of Agriculture for Administration; Dr. Cristina Beato, Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Health at the Department of Health and Human \nServices; and Roberto Salazar, head of the Agriculture Department's \nFood and Nutrition Service. President Bush has also named two qualified \nHispanic New Mexicans to serve in the federal judiciary: David \nIglesias, United States Attorney for the District of New Mexico and \nJudge Christina Armijo of the U.S. District Court of New Mexico.\n  I am so proud of New Mexico's place on center stage in the world of \nHispanic arts and culture. A center for Hispanic culture for centuries, \nSanta Fe has recently drawn renewed attention with its Museum of \nSpanish Colonial Art. Last month, the Wall Street Journal provided an \nin-depth look at the unique contributions of this institution to the \npreservation of Hispanic culture in an article titled Arte Hispanico, \nsaying, ``Though Spanish-colonial artworks are in the collections of \nmany major museums, the Santa Fe museum is uniquely focused on \nillustrating the cultural connections among people of Spanish descent, \nshowing, for example, how Baroque influences in style and artistic \nmethod traveled first from Spain to Mexico and then to New Mexico . . . \n''\n\n[[Page S10669]]\n\n  Likewise, this article highlighted New Mexico's role as home to the \nSpanish Colonial Arts Society, saying, ``For more than seven decades, \nthe society has purchased historic and contemporary Spanish-colonial \nartworks and sponsored markets and competitions among living artists, \nfostering what has grown into a vibrant commercial market for \ntraditional Spanish-colonial arts. Some 300 artists in New Mexico alone \ncontinue to make art like their ancestors did . . . Many of the artists \nparticipate in the Art Society's annual Spanish market, which drew \nabout 70,000 colonial art aficionados to Santa Fe's plaza earlier this \nsummer.''\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not recognize once again the New \nMexican who brought home a National Medal of Arts for 2001, writer \nRudolfo Anaya. President Bush honored Rudolfo with this award earlier \nthis year for his accomplishments such as his well-known novel ``Bless \nMe, Ultima,'' and his work to inspire and promote other Hispanic \nwriters. Rudolfo is a New Mexico treasure, and I want to thank this \nfellow New Mexican for the fine work he has done.\n  I would now like to recognize another citizen of our state who has \nhad a hand in inspiring the next generation of New Mexicans. Hispanics \nmake up the fastest growing part of the nation's public school system. \nEarlier this year, we enacted the most comprehensive education reform \nlaw in decades, the No Child Left Behind Act, which will help give \nteachers and schools the tools and resources they need to do their \njobs. Joseph Torrez, the principal for the third through fifth grades \nin Tucumcari, NM, provides a shining example of how our teachers and \nprincipals hold the key to ensuring that no child is left behind. In \nhonor of his outstanding contributions to the community and the \neducation profession, the Department of Education and the National \nAssociation of Elementary School Principals selected Joseph as the \nNational Distinguished Principal for New Mexico.\n  Joseph created an after-school program providing recreational \nactivities and assistance to children at risk of failing in school, as \nwell as job training for their parents. He also helped children at his \nschool become in new community opportunities, such as helping the \nhomeless and visiting senior citizens. I appreciate Joseph's great \ncontribution to his community, and this New Mexican has certainly \nearned the national recognition he has gained.\n  New Mexico is leading the pack by leaps and bounds in Hispanic \nbusiness ownership. Hispanics own 21.5 percent of all firms in our \nState, the highest percentage of any State, or a total of 28,300 \nbusinesses, according to the latest figures released by the Department \nof Commerce. Not surprisingly, Hispanic New Mexicans made an impressive \nshowing this year in the business honors bestowed by the Minority \nBusiness Development Agency, MBDA, of the Department of Commerce.\n  I want to take this opportunity to commend Deborah Valenzuela Baxter, \nPresident and CEO of Integrity Networking Systems, Inc. of Albuquerque, \nfor gaining the prestigious title of Minority Female Entrepreneur of \nthe Year. Under her leadership, an enterprise that began as a two-man \noperation has blossomed into a highly motivated staff of 40 with \nrevenues of over $20 million in 2001. Carlo Lucero, President of \nSparkle Maintenance, Inc. of Albuquerque was named 8(a) Graduate of the \nYear, after his firm this year put its 36 years of experience in \ncommercial janitorial and building maintenance service to work in a \ncontract for the high-tech clean rooms of Sandia National Laboratories.\n  Finally, this year marked the retirement of a national great from New \nMexico, whose achievements charted new waters for both women and \nHispanics in the United States. Nancy Lopez, a Roswell native and one \nof New Mexico's favorite daughters, won 48 titles on the Ladies \nProfessional Golf Association, LPGA, tour, and was inducted into the \nLPGA Hall of Fame in 1987. Nancy is a luminary and a pacesetter whose \naccomplishments give testimony to the power of dreaming big and working \npersistently.\n  I mentioned that today Hispanic Business magazine announced five New \nMexicans selected for the ``100 Most Influential Hispanics'' list. I \nhave recognized several of their names already, but allow me to include \nfor the record the magazine's list of New Mexican leaders who have \nblazed the trail in business and their fields: author Rodolfo Anaya; \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, Assistant Secretary for \nAdministration Lou Gallegos; LPGA golfer Nancy Lopez; Director of \nUSDA's Food and Nutrition Service, Roberto Salazar; and Eufemia Lucero \nof the U.S. Postal Service.\n  In honoring our State's Hispanic heritage, we should be very proud of \nthe New Mexicans whose accomplishments have garnered the national \nspotlight and appreciation within our State because of the ways they \nhave enriched our lives. I have no doubt that the best is yet to come. \nI ask that the October 17, 2002 Albuquerque Journal article ``5 New \nMexicans make top-100 list'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n             [From the Albuquerque Journal, Oct. 17, 2002]\n\n               5 New Mexicans Make Top-100 Hispanic List\n\n                         (By Charles D. Brunt)\n\n       Albuquerque author Rudolfo Anaya, U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture Assistant Secretary for Administration Lou \n     Gallegos, and LPGA Hall of Fame golfer Nancy Lopez have been \n     named to Hispanic Business magazine's annual ``100 Most \n     Influential Hispanics'' list.\n       Also on the list are Roberto Salazar, who heads the USDA's \n     Food and Nutrition Service, and Eufemia S. Lucero, a longtime \n     administrator with the U.S. Postal Service.\n       The magazine's October 2002 edition says nominations for \n     the list come from the magazine's staff, nominees themselves, \n     readers and Web-site visitors. Nominees must be U.S. citizens \n     of Hispanic origin and must ``have had recent national \n     impact,'' the magazine says.\n       ``That's something,'' Anaya said of his making the list. \n     ``I think it's kind of far-sighted for a business magazine to \n     include a writer.''\n       Anaya said people don't usually think of writers as \n     business people.\n       ``We're also part of the economy. I think maybe it's a \n     wake-up call for some of the business organizations here in \n     New Mexico to realize that we're in there punching away,'' \n     Anaya said.\n       ``I told my wife I was No. 1'' on the list, he equipped. \n     ``But she told me it was because my name's Anaya.'' The \n     magazine lists its selections in alphabetical order.\n       Anaya, widely recognized as the father of Chicago \n     literature, is best known for his New Mexico trilogy ``Bless \n     Me, Ultima,'' ``Tortuga'' and ``Heart of Aztlan'' and a dozen \n     other works. He received the Premio Quinto Sol National \n     Chicano Literary Award for his first novela, ``Bless Me, \n     Ultima,'' in 1972, and the PEN Center West Award for his 1992 \n     novel ``Alburquerque.''\n       In 2001 Anaya was awarded the National Medal of Arts award \n     by President Bush.\n\n\n                                Farming\n\n       Gallegos, who herded sheep on his family's ranch near \n     Amalia in northern Taos County as a child, made the list for \n     the second year in a row.\n       ``It is kind of a feather in one's hat,'' Gallegos said \n     from his Washington office.\n       Gallegos also wrote an article for the same issue of the \n     magazine outlining the prospects for Hispanic farmers in the \n     United States.\n       The essence of the article is that, given that the number \n     of Hispanic farmers has doubled in recent years, farming is \n     still a business. The skills necessary to farm successfully \n     have to be upgraded to keep pace, he said.\n       For 15 months in 1989-90, Gallegos was assistant secretary \n     for policy, management and budget under Interior Secretary \n     Manuel Lujan, Jr., also of New Mexico.\n       Gallegos was Gov. Gary Johnson's chief of staff from 1994 \n     until May 2001, when he left for Washington.\n       Gallegos also made the magazine's list in 2001.\n\n\n                              Hall of Fame\n\n       Former Roswell resident Lopez first picked up a golf club \n     at age 8 and learned the game from her father, Domingo Lopez, \n     by following him around Roswell's Cahoon Park Golf Course.\n       When she debuted on the LPGA tour in 1978, she won nine \n     tournaments. During her career, she has added 39 more titles. \n     She was named to the LPGA Hall of Fame in 1987.\n       Lopez, 45, announced in March that 2002 would be her final \n     full season on the tour.\n       Lopez lives in Albany, Ga., with her husband of 20 years, \n     Cincinnati Reds coach Ray Knight, and her three daughters.\n       According to the LPGA, Lopez has earned $2.25 million \n     during her career.\n       ``Without Nancy and her fans, we would not have a $3 \n     million purse today,'' Cora Jane Blanchard, the U.S. Golf \n     Association women's committee chairwoman, told the Journal \n     last summer at the start of the U.S. Women's Open.\n\n\n                             In Washington\n\n       Salazar, a native of Las Vegas, N.M., was state director of \n     the USDA's Rural Development agency in New Mexico before \n     taking the Washington job.\n       He held senior positions with the New Mexico Economic \n     Development Department and the U.S. Department of Commerce's \n     Minority Business Development Agency.\n\n[[Page S10670]]\n\n       Lucero was manager of the Postal Service's Executive \n     Resources and Leadership Development Program for two years \n     before being named human resources director.\n       She also has held several management positions with the \n     Postal Service's Albuquerque District office.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10670-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PORTLAND, OREGON AWARDED DIGITAL TV ZONE\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate the city of Portland for recently being awarded the \n``Digital TV Zone'' distinction by the National Association of \nBroadcasters and the Consumers Electronics Association.\n  In Portland my constituents are already served by a number of free, \nover-the-air, digital signals. Portland stations broadcasting in \ndigital include: KPDX, a Meredith Corporation owned FOX affiliate; \nKPTV, a FOX owned UPN affiliate; KGW, a Belo Corporation owned NBC \naffiliate; KOIN, an Emmis Communications owned CBS affiliate; KATU, a \nFisher Broadcasting owned ABC affiliate and KOPB, Oregon's local PBS \nstation.\n  The Digital TV Zone distinction, recognizes Portland as a technology \nleader for having all of its local network affiliated stations \nbroadcasting in digital.\n  However, the distinction means more than just that. As part of the \nDigital TV Zone project, these local stations undertook an awareness \ncampaign to educate Portland consumers about the digital television \nfuture. The stations pooled their resources to host digital watch \nparties in local restaurants and consumer outlets.\n  The stations posted digital sets in high traffic areas throughout the \ncity like the Rose Garden Arena, the Oregon History Center, and the \nPortland City Hall. In these venues, Portlanders could see local \ndigital signals displayed in all their glory on High-definition digital \ntelevision sets.\n  The stations spent their own revenue airing an advertisement that \nexplains the benefits of digital television to viewers. Some of you may \nhave seen this advertisement. It was entitled ``Time Marches On,'' a \nreference to how digital television and Portland's digital stations are \nlooking towards the future.\n  All of these activities worked in tandem to spread the news of \ndigital television among Portland consumers, my constituents.\n  I am proud of these stations for making the leap into the digital \nfuture. I know it is not an inexpensive undertaking. Stations \nconverting to digital must purchase new transmission facilities and \noften, they must erect new broadcast towers. Once they are on the air \nin digital, they must broadcast two signals simultaneously: their new \ndigital signal and an analog signal to continue serving viewers who \ncan't yet receive digital signals. Despite the costs, these local \nPortland stations have invested in digital television and for that they \nshould be commended.\n  For those who are not familiar with digital television, let me say \nthat it is the next exciting step in TV. Digital television's capacity \nmakes High Definition broadcasting possible, bringing viewers enhanced \nviewing resolution and sound. Moreover, the capacity can also allow \nstations to ``multi-cast'' or provide multiple programs simultaneously, \ngiving viewers more programming options and allowing stations to convey \neven more information over the airwaves.\n  As with every other technological advance, there will be challenges \nbefore consumers can fully benefit from everything digital television \noffers. The American consumer will need to embrace digital television \nfor it to catch on. That is why I am so proud of these Portland \nstations. Not only have they invested in the technology of digital \ntelevision, they have invested to see that the technology takes hold \namong consumers. These stations are small businesses like any other. \nThey have payroll to fulfill; they must pay overhead. I think it is \ncommendable that they have shown such a commitment to the future of \nfree, over-the-air television through the ``Digital Television Zone'' \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10670-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ON THE 150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THIRD BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on November 10, 2002, Third Baptist \nChurch of San Francisco will celebrate 150 years of service to the \ncommunity. I would like to take this opportunity to direct the Senate's \nattention to this remarkable milestone and reflect about the history of \nthe church and what it means to the people of San Francisco.\n  Third Baptist Church, formally known as the First Colored Baptist \nChurch of San Francisco, was founded in the home of William and Eliza \nDavis in August, 1852. Since then, the church has grown and thrived. \nToday it serves as place of worship for thousands of congregants. In \naddition, it provides a wide variety of ministries to people of all \nages.\n  As the first black Baptist congregation established west of the Rocky \nMountains, Third Baptist has developed into a great source of guidance \nand strength for the people of San Francisco, especially in the African \nAmerican Community. It is a place of solace and sanctuary, a place \nwhere the spirit and soul can be rejuvenated. And it is a place where \npeople gather to celebrate the great joys of life and share in the \nfellowship of other parishioners. Not just a part of the community, \nThird Baptist is a community unto itself.\n  During the past 150 years, thousands of people have found inspiration \nthrough Third Baptist's doors. The church has witnessed many pivotal \nmoments in the history of our state, nation and the African-American \ncommunity. And with each challenge, it has emerged as a stronger, more \nvibrant institution.\n  Third Baptist Church has been blessed with the leadership of many \nfine pastors. From Reverend Charles Satchell to Reverend Amos C. Brown, \nthe current senior pastor, the Third Baptist Church continues to be a \nstrong voice for those who too often have no voice at all.\n  I am aware that President Bill Clinton and other dignitaries will be \npresent at this 150th anniversary event. I extend my personal \ncongratulations and thanks for 150 years of devoted service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10670-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IN COMMEMORATION OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN HERITAGE CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the American \nIndian Heritage Celebration which took place at Frank Vaydik Line Creek \nPark in Kansas City, MO on October 5th and 6th of 2002, and to \nrecognize the Otoe-Missourina nation. For over 10,000 years, the Kansas \nCity area has been home to several ancient cultures with sites that are \nrecorded with the Archaeological Survey of Missouri and the National \nRegister of Historic Places.\n  In 1673, when French explorers traveled along what is now the \nMissouri River, they named the indigenous people living in the area, \nOumessourit, meaning ``people of the big wooden dug out canoes.'' \nOumessourit, later became Missouri and the state of Missouri would \nsubsequently be named after the natives.\n  The Missouria's main village was approximately 90 miles east of \nKansas City. A related tribe, the Otoe, lived in the area of Kansas \nCity, particularly the ``Northland.'' Along with the Winnebagos and \nLoway, the Otoe and Missouria were once part of a single nation living \nin the Great Lakes area. The Otoe and Missouria would later reunite to \nbecome the Otoe-Missouria nation and in the late 1800s were relocated \nto a reservation in Oklahoma.\n  Lewis and Clark once spoke of the Missouria as ``a remnant of the \nmost numerous nation inhabiting the Missouria''. Today, there are no \npure blood Missourias left, only distant decedents which have been \nabsorbed into the Otoe tribe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10670-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10670-S10671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARGARET CARTER\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr President, Former Oregon Governor Tom \nMcCall once said, ``Heroes are not giant statues framed against a red \nsky. They are people who say, ``This is my community, and it's my \nresponsibility to make it better.''\n  I rise today to pay tribute to Oregon State Senator Margaret Carter, \na remarkable woman who truly is a hero, for she has devoted much of her \nlife to making her community and state better.\n  Senator Carter was honored earlier this week at a dinner saluting her \nservice as President of the Portland Urban\n\n[[Page S10671]]\n\nLeague. Nearly 300 civic and business leaders gathered in Portland to \nthank Margaret for the leadership she provided to the Urban League \nduring a very crucial time.\n  I first got to know Margaret when I came to the Oregon State Senate \nin 1993. At that time, she was serving the fifth of her seven terms in \nthe Oregon State House of Representatives, where she made history as \nthe first African-American woman ever elected to the Oregon House.\n  Margaret was a Democrat representing inner-city Portland. I was a \nRepublican representing rural Eastern Oregon. Yet, we quickly became \nfriends and decided there were a number of projects on which we could \nunite our efforts. We have been working together ever since.\n  An educator by training, Margaret has worked as a youth counselor, \nthe assistant director of a community action agency, and for 27 years \nshe served on the faculty of Portland Community College, where she was \na founder of the PCC Skills Center. While in the State Senate, I was \nproud to work with Margaret to preserve funding for the Skills Center, \nwhich is a center of hope for those looking for a better future.\n  In 2000, Margaret was elected to the Oregon State Senate, having won \nthe nomination of both the Democrat and Republican parties. Her \nlegislative achievements include helping to create a statewide Head \nStart program and the Oregon Youth Conservation Corps. She was also the \nchief sponsor of the law that created a state holiday to honor Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. Indeed, few Oregonians have done more to make \nDr. King's dreams a reality that Margaret Carter.\n  Included among Margaret's many talents is the fact that she has one \nof the most remarkable singing voices I have ever heard. While I \ncouldn't join in the dinner in her honor this week, I did want to raise \nmy voice here on the Senate floor to pay tribute to a woman who I am \nhonored to call my friend a woman who is a true Oregon hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10671-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO MARY COX\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mary was nominated by her employer at the \nKansas City Public Library in Kansas City, Missouri.

At the library, she entered a fast-paced, highly \ncomputerized, and customer service oriented world. Mary spent her first \nyear learning how to shelve books, organize materials, and then \nreceived computer training. She loves her work as a library clerk \nbecause she continually learns new information and enjoys helping \nlibrary patrons complete research. Mary says, ``working keeps me strong \nphysically and mentally.''

Hurst of Minot, ND.\n  This young man tragically lost his life in an attempt to rescue one \nof my fellow Iowans. Mr. Hurst loved his job as a canoe guide in the \nBoundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota. While working on \nJuly 30, 2002, Mr. Hurst witnessed a young lady, Jamie Christenson, \ndrowning in the boundary Waters near Basswood Falls. Without \nhesitation, Mr. Hurst dove in to rescue Ms. Christenson. Unfortunately, \nboth Mr. Hurst and Ms. Christenson were pulled under water by the \nstrong undercurrent. When they surfaced, revival attempts were futile.\n  Although this story has a tragic ending, we must not forget the \nheroism displayed by Eric Hurst. He was willing to try to save Ms. \nChristenson from the turbulent waters of Basswood Falls without regard \nto the danger it posed to his own life. This is truly the ultimate \nsacrifice one can make.\n  It is with deep respect and great sadness that I recognize Mr. Eric \nC. Hurst before this body of Congress and this nation for his unselfish \nact of heroism. Eric Hurst and Jamie Christenson will be missed by the \nmany people they touched in their life and I express my sincere \ncondolences to their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10671-5", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10671-S10672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH R.

Mr. President, on Saturday, November 16, 2002, the \ncity of Oakland will celebrate the remarkable career in public service \nof retiring Oakland City Councilmember Dick Spees, who has served on \nthe council with grace, wit and distinction for 24 years. The \ncelebration--2003: A Spees Odyssey will take place at the Chabot Space \nand Science Center in Oakland.\n  Councilmember Spees leaves a quarter-century legacy of service to his \nconstituents, as well as council leadership on issues of economic \ndevelopment, marketing, good government, finance, quality of life, \npublic safety, and regional planning.\n  Among his many accomplishments, he led local efforts to found Chabot \nSpace & Science Center; Oakland-Sharing the Vision; Oakland Tours; the \nBay Area Economic Forum; the Bay Area World Trade Center, and the Bay \nArea Bioscience Center.\n  He has led campaigns to pass bond measures that have purchased open \nspace, built recreation centers, libraries and cultural facilities, and \nupgraded emergency response facilities and equipment.\n  As chair of the City Council's Rules Committee, Dick has shepherded \ncampaign finance reform, the sunshine ordinance, the lobbyist \nregistration ordinance and the formation of the public ethics \ncommission. He has also spearheaded development of the city, State and \nFederal legislative programs and led advocacy efforts in Sacramento and \nWashington, DC.\n  A skilled negotiator, Dick has resolved many contentious issues in \nDistrict 4 and in the city, including the expansion of Dreyer's Grand \nIce Cream, Montclair Lucky Store, Fred Finch Youth Center, and Lincoln \nChild Center. He negotiated recent amendments to the Residential Rent \nArbitration Program.\n  In the area of economic development, Councilmember Spees has led many \nof the city's marketing efforts, has collaborated on writing Oakland's \ntelecommunications policy, and has initiated business attraction \nefforts for telecommunications, digital media, software, and bioscience \ncompanies. He has promoted economic development in District 4 through \nzoning changes, streetscape improvements, utility undergrounding, and \noutreach to interested developers.\n  Throughout his career, Dick has represented Oakland on Bay Area \nregional agencies. He currently serves on the Association of Bay Area \nGovernments, the Bay Area Economic Forum, the Regional Airport Planning \nCommittee, the Bay Area World Trade Center, Oakland Base Reuse \nAuthority, and cochairs the City-Port Liaison Committee and the BAR T-\nOakland Airport Connector Stakeholders Committee.\n  The people of Oakland are losing a remarkable public servant in Dick \nSpees, but I suspect that his heart with never be far from the people \nhe has represented so well for so long. I wish the very best to him and \nhis wife Jean.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10672-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10672-S10673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL SPINA BIFIDA AWARENESS MONTH\n\n Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize that \nOctober is National Spina Bifida Awareness Month and to pay tribute to \nthe more than 70,000 Americans, and their family members, who are \ncurrently affected by Spina Bifida, the nation's most common, \npermanently disabling birth defect.\n  Spina Bifida affects more than 4,000 pregnancies each year, with more \nthan half ending tragically in abortion. Each year 1500 babies are born \nwith Spina Bifida, a terrible condition in which the spine does not \nclose completely during the first few weeks of pregnancy. The result of \nthis neural tube defect is that most babies suffer from a host of \nphysical, psychological, and educational challenges, including \nparalysis, developmental delay, numerous surgeries, and living with a \nshunt in their skulls in an attempt to ameliorate their condition. \nAfter decades of poor prognoses and short life expectancy, due to \nbreakthroughs in research, combined with improvements in health care \nand treatment children with Spina Bifida are now living long enough to \nbecome adults with the condition. However, with this extended life \nexpectancy people with Spina Bifida now face new challenges education, \njob training, independent living, health care for secondary conditions, \naging concerns, and other related issues.\n  Therefore, we must do more to ensure a high quality of life for \npeople with Spina Bifida so more families choose the blessing and joy \nof having a child with this condition. Fortunately, Spina Bifida is no \nlonger the death sentence it once was and now most people born with \nSpina Bifida will likely have a normal or near normal life expectancy. \nThe challenge now is to ensure that these individuals have the highest \nquality of life possible.\n  One of my constituents, sixteen year-old Gregory Pote, is one of the \n70,000 Americans who live with Spina Bifida. Gregory had the pleasure \nof visiting Capitol Hill this summer to hear his uncle testify before \nthe Senate Subcommittee on Children and Families' hearing on ``Birth \nDefects: Strategies for Prevention and Ensuring Quality of Life.'' \nGreg's uncle, Hal Pote, President of the Spina Bifida Foundation, \ntestified that one of his proudest moments was the morning that their \nfamily awoke before the crack of dawn and gathered together on the side \nof a street in Philadelphia to watch Greg carry the Olympic torch \nearlier this year. Despite this amazing accomplishment, it is important \nto note that at the age of sixteen Greg has already had more than \ntwenty surgeries. It is my understanding that double-digit numbers for \nsurgeries unfortunately are not unusual for children living with this \ncondition. Therefore, it is essential that we do more to prevent and \nreduce suffering from Spina Bifida and take all the steps we can to \nensure that Greg and the 70,000 other Americans like him who live with \nSpina Bifida every day can have the most productive and full lives \npossible.\n  I would like to commend the Spina Bifida Association of America, \nSBAA, an organization that has helped people with Spina Bifida and \ntheir families for nearly 30 years, works every day, not just in the \nmonth of October, to prevent and reduce suffering from this devastating \nbirth defect. The SBAA puts expecting parents in touch with families \nwho have a child with Spina Bifida, and these families answer questions \nand concerns and help guide expecting parents. The SBAA then works to \nprovide lifelong support and assistance for affected children and their \nfamilies.\n  During the month of October the SBAA and its chapters make a special \npush to increase public awareness about Spina Bifida and teach \nprospective parents about prevention. Simply by taking a daily dose of \nthe B vitamin, folic acid, found in most multivitamins, women of \nchildbearing age have the power to reduce the incidence of Spina Bifida \nby up to 75 percent. That such a simple change in habit can have such a \nprofound effect should leave no question as to the importance of \nawareness and the impact of prevention.\n  In addition, I would like to commend my Senate colleagues for \nallocating $2 million in much-needed funding for a National Spina \nBifida Program at the National Center for Birth Defects and \nDevelopmental Disabilities, NCBDDD, at the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, CDC, to ensure that those individuals living with Spina \nBifida can live active, productive, and meaningful lives. I also am \nvery proud that we in the Senate recently passed by unanimous consent \nthe bipartisan ``Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities \nPrevention Act of 2002,'' which takes many critical steps that will \nwork to prevent Spina Bifida and to improve quality of life for \nindividuals and families affected by this terrible birth defect.\n  I again thank the SBAA and its chapters for their commitment to \nimprove the lives of those 70,000 individuals living with Spina Bifida \nthroughout our Nation. I also wish to thank two nationally respected \ntelevision journalists, Judy Woodruff and Al Hunt for their caring, \nmeaningful leadership in this important cause. In conclusion, I wish \nthe Spina Bifida Association of America the best of results in its \nendeavors, and urge all of my colleagues and all Americans to support \nits important efforts.\n\n[[Page S10673]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10672-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10672-S10673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL SPINA BIFIDA AWARENESS MONTH\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

It has fought for clean air and \nwater, the preservation of our precious wild heritage, and the clean up \nof military bases and toxic waste sites. It has also played a crucial \nrole in the fight to stop oil drilling off our coast, an issue so \nimportant to California.\n  As a longtime supporter of our nation's environment, I know how \ncrucial it is to protect our natural resources. We must continue to \nwork to both safeguard our environment and maintain a healthy economy. \nEDC has helped us work toward this goal.\n  I am pleased to congratulate EDC on this important milestone and wish \nthe staff continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10673-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE RETIREMENT OF LIEUTENANT RAYMOND GRIFFITH\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to take this moment to \nreflect on Lieutenant Raymond Griffith's outstanding service on the \noccasion of his retirement from the Cathedral City Police Department. \nThe Department will honor him on November 8, 2002.\n  Lieutenant Griffith has had a career devoted to public service \nspanning more than 33 years. After graduating as Valedictorian from the \nLos Angeles Police Academy, he began his career at the Orange Police \nDepartment and remained there for 15 years. He served the department in \nmany areas, including patrol, training, internal affairs, detectives, \njuvenile, and nine years in the special weapons unit.\n  Lieutenant Griffith's expertise equipped him well for the next step \nin his career, Sergeant of the then-new Cathedral City Police \nDepartment. As one of the first employees of the department, Lieutenant \nGriffith helped get the operation off to a good start. He played a key \nrole in developing policies and procedures, hiring staff and obtaining \nfacilities and equipment. Throughout the agency's 18-year history, \nLieutenant Griffith has been seen as a ``founding father'' of the \ndepartment and an important leader in its operation.\n  In addition to serving on the police force, Lieutenant Griffith has \nserved as a valued law enforcement instructor and trainer at the \nCollege of the Desert, Riverside Community College and at the Police \nAcademy. He has also served our Nation in the United States Marine \nCorps and the Coast Guard Reserves.\n  It is clear that Lieutenant Griffith deserves the praise he has \nreceived from his colleagues and peers. I extend to him my sincere \ncongratulations for his service to the force, broader community and to \nour Nation. Although his presence will be missed, he has left a legacy \nof leadership that will be long remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10673-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OREGON HERO OF THE WEEK\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a \ncommunity's extraordinary effort to improve their situation. In the \npast year, Oregonians have faced innumerable economic challenges. With \nunemployment rates surpassing all other States, Oregonians have been \npushed to the limit. But in the relatively small eastern Oregon \ncommunity of Baker County, the citizens refused to give in to economic \npressures. The Baker Enterprise Growth Initiative, BEGIN, is helping \nBaker County grow, one business at a time.\n  BEGIN has helped community Entrepreneurs realize their dreams of \nrunning successful small businesses. BEGIN uses simple, yet effective \nmodels to help business owners understand the importance of a balance \nbetween product, marketing and financial stability. Management becomes \na team effort and people are able to succeed at their strengths while \nrelying on others as well.\n  BEGIN is a community effort and its successes lift the entire region. \nIn August of 2001, the BEGIN Program was awarded the Kaufmann \nFoundation Pioneer Award for Leadership in Entrepreneurial Promotion at \nthe National Association of Development Organizations' Annual \nConference in San Antonio, TX. Members of the Northeast Oregon Economic \nDevelopment District were also able to present the BEGIN program and \naccomplishments to the over 200 economic development professionals from \nacross the Nation.\n  BEGIN has not only provided much needed economic development in Baker \nCounty, but has also shown Oregonians, and the entire Nation, that we \nwill overcome this period of economic hardship. BEGIN truly exemplifies \nthe pioneer heritage and nature of Baker County in searching for its \nown solutions to problems rather than waiting for someone else to come \nsolve their problems for them. I am proud to salute the Baker \nEnterprise Growth Initiative as the Oregon Hero of the Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10673-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10673-5", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10673-6", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10673-S10674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n               enrolled bills and joint resolution signed\n\n  At 11:02 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills and joint resolution:\n\n       H.R. 3295.

A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to provide \nassistance to States to support testing of private wells in areas of \nsuspected contamination to limit or prevent human exposure to \ncontaminated groundwater; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am proud to be joined by my \ncolleague Senator Fitzgerald in introducing the Private Well Testing \nAssistance Act of 2002. This legislation seeks to protect the health of \nour Nation's rural families by providing Federal assistance to State \nhealth and environmental agencies for sampling of drinking water wells \nnear suspected areas of groundwater contamination.\n  More than 15.1 million households are served by private drinking \nwater wells in the United States. At times, these wells are affected by \nserious groundwater contaminants, including industrial solvents, \npetroleum, nitrates, radon, arsenic, beryllium, chloroform, and \ngasoline additives such as MTBE.\n  While private well owners generally are responsible for regular \ntesting of drinking water wells, cases of serious or potentially \nwidespread groundwater contamination often require State agencies to \nconduct costly tests on numerous wells. Many of these sites are \nincluded in the Environmental Protection Agency's Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Information System, \nor CERCLIS, for which Federal funding is available for initial site \nassessments, but not for subsequent regular sampling to ensure that \ncontaminants have not migrated to additional household wells.\n  With many State budgets across the country in fiscal crisis, State \ngovernments often do not have the resources to provide regular, \nreliable testing of wells in proximity to suspected areas of \ncontamination. By authorizing EPA\n\n[[Page S10679]]\n\nto provide up to $20 million per year to assist State well testing \nprograms, subject to a 20 percent State match, the Private Well Testing \nAssistance Act will create an incentive for states to improve well \nmonitoring near both new and existing areas of groundwater \ncontamination.\n  I urge my colleagues to help ensure the health and safety of American \nfamilies that rely on groundwater for their drinking water needs by \nsupporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3127\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Private Well Testing \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ASSISTANCE FOR TESTING OF PRIVATE WELLS.\n\n       Part E of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j et \n     seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 1459. ASSISTANCE FOR TESTING OF PRIVATE WELLS.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       ``(1) more than 15,100,000 households in the United States \n     are served by private drinking water wells;\n       ``(2) while private well owners generally are responsible \n     for regular testing of drinking water wells for the presence \n     of contaminants, cases of serious or potentially widespread \n     groundwater contamination often require State health and \n     environmental agencies to conduct costly tests on numerous \n     drinking water well sites;\n       ``(3) many of those sites are included in the Comprehensive \n     Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability \n     Information System of the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     through which Federal funding is available for testing of \n     private wells during initial site assessments but not for \n     subsequent regular sampling to ensure that contaminants have \n     not migrated to other wells;\n       ``(4) many State governments do not have the resources to \n     provide regular, reliable testing of drinking water wells \n     that are located in proximity to areas of suspected \n     groundwater contamination;\n       ``(5) State fiscal conditions, already in decline before \n     the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, are rapidly \n     approaching a state of crisis;\n       ``(6) according to the National Conference of State \n     Legislatures--\n       ``(A) revenues in 43 States are below estimates;

and\n       ``(8) the provision of Federal assistance, with a State \n     cost-sharing requirement, would establish an incentive for \n     States to provide regular testing of drinking water wells in \n     proximity to new and existing areas of suspected groundwater \n     contamination.\n       ``(b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1) Administrator.--The term `Administrator' means the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, acting \n     in consultation with appropriate State agencies.\n       ``(2) Area of concern.--The term `area of concern' means a \n     geographic area in a State the groundwater of which may, as \n     determined by the State--\n       ``(A) be contaminated or threatened by a release of 1 or \n     more substances of concern;

A bill to authorize the Pyramid of Remembrance Foundation to \nestablish a memorial in the District of Columbia and its environs to \nhonor members of the Armed Forces of the United States who have lost \ntheir lives during peacekeeping operations, humanitarian efforts, \ntraining, terrorist attacks, or covert operations; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, nearly ten years ago, a group of \nstudents at Riverside High School in Painesville, OH watched with \nhorror as a U.S. soldier in Somalia was dragged through the streets of \nMogadishu. The students, concerned that there was no memorial in our \nNation's capital to honor members of our armed forces who lost their \nlives during peacekeeping missions such as the one in Somalia, felt \ncompelled to take action.\n  This group of motivated young people spearheaded a campaign to \nestablish a Pyramid of Remembrance in Washington, DC to honor U.S. \nservicemen and women who have lost their lives during peacekeeping \noperations, humanitarian efforts, training, terrorist attacks, or \nconvert operations. The students not only proposed the memorial, they \ncreated a private non-\n\n[[Page S10680]]\n\nprofit foundation to raise the money to construct the memorial. The \ncommunity pulled together, providing legal counsel for the students and \nprivate donations to help fund the project. Thanks to their hard work, \nthe proposed Pyramid of Remembrance would be built at no cost to the \ntaxpayer.\n  In April 2001, the National Capital Memorial Commission, charged with \noverseeing monument construction in Washington, DC, held hearings about \nthe proposed Pyramid of Remembrance. The Commission recommended that \nthe memorial be constructed on Defense Department land, possibly at \nFort McNair. The commissioners also noted that such a memorial would \nindeed fill a void in our Nation's military monuments.\n  On May 6, 1999, I spoke on the Senate floor in honor of two brave \nAmerican soldiers, Chief Warrant Officer Kevin L. Reichert and Chief \nWarrant Officer David A. Gibbs, who lost their lives when their Apache \nhelicopter crashed into the Albanian mountains during a routine \ntraining exercise on May 5, 1999, as U.S. troops joined with our NATO \nallies in a military campaign against Slobodan Milosevic. As I remarked \nat that time, the United States owes David, Kevin and so many other \nservice members a debt of gratitude that we will never be able to \nrepay, for they have paid the ultimate sacrifice. As the Bible says in \nJohn chapter 15:13, ``Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay \ndown his life for his friends.''\n  I support the vision of the students at Riverside High School and \napplaud the work they have done to make the Pyramid of Remembrance a \nreality. I believe it is our duty to honor American men and women in \nuniform who have lost their lives while serving their country, whether \nin peacetime or during war.\n  I am pleased to introduce in the Senate a companion measure to H.R. \n282, introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Steve \nLaTourette, which would authorize the Pyramid of Remembrance Foundation \nto establish a memorial in the District of Columbia or its environs to \nsoldiers who have lost their lives during peacekeeping operations, \nhumanitarian efforts, training, terrorist attacks, or covert \noperations.\n  A monument honoring members of our Armed Forces who have lost their \nlives in peacetime deserves a place of honor in our Nation's capital. I \ncommend and thank the students in Painesville, their parents, and the \nteachers and community leaders who have supported them for their hard \nwork and dedication to this cause. The proposed Pyramid of Remembrance \nwould fill a void among memorials in Washington, DC. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support their worthy endeavor and to join me in support \nof this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3128\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \nColleague from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, to introduce the Truth in Budgeting \nand Social Security Protection Act of 2002.\n\n[[Page S10688]]\n\nThis bill collects a variety of budget process ideas to help protect \nSocial Security, promote balanced budgets, and improve government \naccounting practices. I hope that this effort will help spur greater \ndebate and action to restore fiscal discipline.\n  Our government's finances have taken a dire turn in the last year-\nand-a-half. While in January of last year the Congressional Budget \nOffice projected that, in the fiscal year just ended, fiscal year 2002, \nthe government would run a unified budget surplus of $313 billion, now \nit projects a unified budget deficit of $157 billion.\n  And not counting Social Security surpluses, the picture is even \nworse. While in January of last year CBO projected that for fiscal year \n2002, the government would run a surplus of $142 billion, without using \nSocial Security surpluses, now it projects a deficit of $314 billion, \nnot counting Social Security.\n  We must stop running deficits because they cause the government to \nuse the surpluses of the Social Security Trust Fund for other \ngovernment purposes, rather than to pay down the debt and help our \nNation prepare for the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation.\n  And we must stop running deficits because every dollar that we add to \nthe Federal debt is another dollar that we are forcing our children to \npay back in higher taxes or fewer government benefits. When the \ngovernment in this generation chooses to spend on current consumption \nand to accumulate debt for our children's generation to pay, it does \nnothing less than rob our children of their own choices. We make our \nchoices to spend on our wants, but we saddle them with debts that they \nmust pay from their tax dollars and their hard work. And the government \nshould not do that.\n  That is why I am joining with my Colleague from Ohio to introduce \nthis bill to improve the budget process today. We need to strengthen \nthe budget process. We need to do more.\n  Our bill would: extend the discretionary spending caps and the pay-\nas-you-go rules for 5 years, strengthen the enforcement of those budget \nrules, help protect Social Security surpluses, institute biennial \nbudgeting, improve accounting for long-term costs of legislation, \nimprove accounting for federal insurance programs, highlight the full \nexpenses, including interest costs, of spending or tax cuts, and create \na new commission to study the budget process.\n  Together, these budget process proposals would go a long way toward \nincreasing the responsibility of the Federal budget. I hope that \nbetween now and the beginning of the next Congress, my Colleagues and \nobservers of the budget process will review these proposals, perhaps \nbuild on them, and then join with us in a major effort to strengthen \nthe budget process next year.\n  We must stop using Social Security surpluses to fund other government \nprograms. We must stop piling up debt for our children to pay off. We \nmust enact major reforms of the budget process.\n  I hope that this effort will contribute to those ends.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 3132. A bill to improve the economy and the quality of life for \nall citizens by authorizing funds for Federal-aid highways, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 3133. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \nfunding available to carry out the Maximum Economic Growth for America \nThrough Highway Funding Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills, the \nMaximum Economic Growth for America Through Highway Funding Act'', or \n``MEGA FUND ACT''--Parts one and two.\n  The MEGA FUND ACT is intended to do exactly what its name suggest, \nincrease Federal investment in our Nation's highway system. That is an \nimportant objective. Highway investments create jobs, increase the \nproductivity of our economy, and improve the quality of life for all \nAmericans.\n  In 1998 Congress passed one of the most successful and bipartisan \nbills in recent memory, the ``Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury'', better known as ``TEA-21.'' I am honored to have been an \nauthor of that piece of legislation.\n  The MEGA FUND ACT builds on the success of the highway elements of \nTEA-21, keeping nearly all of its structure in place and increasing \nfunding levels.\n  There are several major aspects of this legislation.\n  First, the MEGA FUND ACT significantly increases highway program \nlevels. The principal feature of the bill is its increased funding for \nthe program, something that will help all States and all citizens. \nUnder TEA-21, as amended, the total obligation authority for FY 2003 is \n$28.485 billion.\n  Under the 6 years of the MEGA FUND ACT, the comparable program level \nwould grow to $34.839 billion in FY 2004 and to $41.839 billion by FY \n2009.\n  These funding increases will be enabled by enactment of legislation \nthat I have already introduced with Senator Crapo, S. 2678, the Mega \nTrust Act and S. 3097, MEGA INNOVATE ACT.\n  While these program levels represent a substantial increase, the \nneeds of our highway system are even greater. So, the program levels in \nthe bill represent only a down payment on the investment in highways \nthat is needed to improve our economy through commerce and job \ncreation, increase personal mobility and make our roads safer.\n  Second, the MEGA FUND ACT continues the basic program structure and \nformulas from TEA-21. The current TEA-21 minimum guarantee formula is \nextended.\n  Also, the bill would continue to focus funding on the core programs \nadministered by the States: Interstate Maintenance, National Highway \nSystem, Surface Transportation Program, Bridge, Congestion Mitigation \nand Air Quality Improvement, and the Minimum Guarantee. These key \nprograms would constitute approximately the same proportion of the \noverall program as under TEA-21.\n  Third, a new category is added to aid states in overcoming economic \nand demographic barriers. The bill would create a new program, at $2 \nbillion annually, to assist States in dealing with certain economic and \ndemographic hardships.\n  This would be a new type of program, not subject to the minimum \nguarantee. It is not keyed to specific project types but to types of \nproblems facing States. States with very high growth rates, high \npopulation density, low population density, or low per capita incomes, \nfor example, face real challenges.\n  This different approach lets States facing those problems receive \nfunds and pick the projects. Every one of the 50 States would receive \nsignificant funding under this program every year.\n  The MEGA FUND ACT continues firewalls and improves RABA. One of the \ngreat contributions of TEA-21 is that it provides the highway program \nprotection under the budget procedures of Congress.\n  These ``firewall'' provisions enable our citizens to be confident \nthat highway taxes will be invested in highways, not saved or diverted.\n  TEA-21 also established Revenue Aligned Budget Authority, or RABA. \nThe principle of RABA is that, if funds available for the highway \nprogram exceed expectations, then additional money can be put to work \nin the highway program. This bill would continue those important \nprovisions with improvements.\n  One key improvement is the elimination of so-called ``negative \nRABA.'' Under the bill, there are only automatic upward adjustments in \nobligation levels under RABA. These adjustments would still take place \nwhen the Highway Account balance is financially stronger than initially \nestimated.\n  Another key reform would focus RABA calculations on the actual \nbalance in the Highway Account, rather than on annual revenues.\n  This important reform will help ensure that monies in the Highway \nAccount of the Highway Trust Fund are invested and not allowed to build \nup to a large balance. Today's RABA did not preclude a build up of \nfunds in the\n\n[[Page S10689]]\n\nHighway Account, delaying the delivery of needed highway investments to \nour citizens.\n  The MEGA FUND ACT increased the stability of distributions to states \nunder the allocation programs. The bill includes proposed revisions to \nseveral so-called ``allocation'' programs that will increase funding \nfor all States.\n  Today, large portions of the program funds that are not apportioned \nto States are distributed on a discretionary basis. This bill would \nleave portions of the program subject to discretion, but move the \nallocation programs, collectively, in a general direction that would \nprovide States greater certainty that they will be participating in \nallocation program funds.\n  Specifically, the bill makes modest changes to the Intelligent \nTransportation System, ITS, program and to the Transportation and \nCommunity and System Preservation Pilot, TCSP, program, to ensure that \nsome of those funds find their way into every State.\n  Another modest change will ensure that each State with a border \nreceives at least some funding under the borders and corridors \nprograms, and that States with significant public lands receive at \nleast some public lands discretionary funding.\n  Let me say a few things about what is not addressed in this bill. The \nMEGA FUND ACT sets forth an outline for the highway program. It does \nnot address the transit program that is within the jurisdiction of the \nBanking Committee, or the highway safety programs within the \njurisdiction of the Commerce Committee, or the revenue for the highway \nprogram that is within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  My proposals for those issues are in previous bills that I have \nintroduced--MEGA RED TRANS, MEGA SAFE, MEGA STREAM, MEGA TRUST, MEGA \nINNOVATE and today, MEGA FUND, Part II. Those are important matters \nthat also must be addressed as part of the final overall legislation \nthat will extend and build upon TEA-21.\n  As for MEGA FUND Part II, this bill although short and simple, \nactually represents the most important step in any reauthorization \nbill. MEGA FUND, Part II allows the funding program set forth in MEGA \nFUND Part I to be spend from the Highway Trust Fund.\n  Without this important step, Congress can write formulas until \nChristmas, but no money can actually be sent to the states and spent. \nThe ability to spend this money requires a change to the Internal \nRevenue Code that makes those Highway Trust Funds available for \npayment. MEGA FUND PART II takes care of that.\n  In summary, the MEGA FUND ACT stays close to the successful program \nstructure of TEA-21 and maintains its apportionment formulas. It would \nsignificantly increase funding for the program as a whole, continue \nbudgetary firewalls and strengthen RABA, and provide some extra funds \nto all States through the economic and demographic barriers program and \nthrough some innovations in other programs not subject to the minimum \nguarantee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis of both \nbills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

aligned budget authority (referred to in this subsection as \n     ``RABA'') has been that, while RABA has produced increases in \n     highway program obligation levels in some fiscal years, RABA \n     also--\n       (i) has allowed the balance in the Highway Trust Fund \n     (other than the Mass Transit Account) to grow since the date \n     of enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \n     Century;\n       (ii) does not provide a mechanism to allow that balance to \n     be expended for the benefit of the public; and\n       (iii) has resulted in unexpectedly large annual \n     differences, or estimated differences, in highway program \n     obligation authority as compared with the levels specified in \n     section 1102 of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \n     Century (23 U.S.C. 104 note; 112 Stat. 115); and\n       (B) Congress has taken legislative action to reject the \n     implementation of estimates that would have resulted in \n     ``negative'' RABA.\n       (2) Sense of the senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the provisions of budget legislation pertaining to the \n     highway program should be amended--\n       (A) to improve predictability and stability in the levels \n     of highway program obligation authority;\n\n[[Page S10691]]\n\n       (B) to facilitate the expenditure of funds in the Highway \n     Trust Fund (other than the Mass Transit Account); and\n       (C) to eliminate the possibility of reductions in the \n     levels of highway program obligation authority being imposed \n     automatically, so that any reductions are solely the \n     prerogative of Congress.\n       (b) Reliable Highway Program Levels.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no spending limits other than the spending limits \n     specified in this subsection may be imposed, for any of \n     fiscal years 2004 through 2009, on budget accounts or \n     portions of budget accounts that are subject to the \n     obligation limitations and the exemptions from obligation \n     limitations that are specified in section 1102 of the \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (23 U.S.C. 104 \n     note; 112 Stat. 115).\n       (2) Amount of obligation authority.--For each of fiscal \n     years 2004 through 2009, the limitation on obligation \n     authority for the budget accounts described in paragraph (1) \n     shall be equal to the sum of--\n       (A) the limitation for that fiscal year specified in \n     section 1102(a) of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \n     Century;\n       (B) all amounts exempt from that limit under section \n     1102(b) of that Act; and\n       (C) the amount of any increase for the fiscal year under \n     paragraph (5).\n       (3) Outlays.--For each of fiscal years 2004 through 2009, \n     the limitation on outlays for the budget accounts described \n     in paragraph (1) shall be the level of outlays necessary to \n     accommodate outlays resulting from obligations for that \n     fiscal year under paragraph (2) and obligations from prior \n     fiscal years.\n       (4) Annual report on estimated balance in highway \n     account.--In the submission by the President of the budget of \n     the United States Government under section 1105 of title 31, \n     United States Code, for each of fiscal years 2005 through \n     2009, the President shall include an estimate of the balance \n     that will be in the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund \n     (as defined in section 9503(e)(5)(B) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986) at the end of fiscal year 2009.\n       (5) Increase based on fund balance.--\n       (A) Estimate for fiscal year 2005.--In the submission by \n     the President of the budget of the United States Government \n     under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, for \n     fiscal year 2005, if the estimate described in paragraph (4) \n     is that, but for this subparagraph, the balance in the \n     Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund at the end of \n     fiscal year 2009 will be in excess of $7,000,000,000, the \n     amount specified in section 1102(a)(8) of the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century shall be deemed to have been \n     increased by an amount equal to 50 percent of the amount of \n     the estimated excess.\n       (B) Estimate for fiscal year 2006.--In the submission by \n     the President of the budget of the United States Government \n     under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, for \n     fiscal year 2006, if the estimate described in paragraph (4) \n     is that, but for this subparagraph, the balance in the \n     Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund at the end of \n     fiscal year 2009 will be in excess of $6,500,000,000, the \n     amount specified in section 1102(a)(9) of the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century shall be deemed to have been \n     increased by an amount equal to 50 percent of the amount of \n     the estimated excess.\n       (C) Estimate for fiscal year 2007.--In the submission by \n     the President of the budget of the United States Government \n     under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, for \n     fiscal year 2007, if the estimate described in paragraph (4) \n     is that, but for this subparagraph, the balance in the \n     Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund at the end of \n     fiscal year 2009 will be in excess of $6,000,000,000, the \n     amount specified in section 1102(a)(10) of the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century shall be deemed to have been \n     increased by an amount equal to 50 percent of the amount of \n     the estimated excess.\n       (D) Estimate for fiscal year 2008.--In the submission by \n     the President of the budget of the United States Government \n     under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, for \n     fiscal year 2008, if the estimate described in paragraph (4) \n     is that, but for this subparagraph, the balance in the \n     Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund at the end of \n     fiscal year 2009 will be in excess of $5,500,000,000, the \n     amount specified in section 1102(a)(11) of the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century shall be deemed to have been \n     increased by an amount equal to 50 percent of the amount of \n     the estimated excess.\n       (E) Estimate for fiscal year 2009.--In the submission by \n     the President of the budget of the United States Government \n     under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, for \n     fiscal year 2009, if the estimate described in paragraph (4) \n     is that, but for

1102(a)(12) of the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century shall be deemed to have been \n     increased by an amount equal to the amount of the estimated \n     excess.\n       (6) No effect on byrd rule.--Nothing in this subsection \n     affects section 9503(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate Supporting Reliable Program Levels \n     in Additional Budget Accounts.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Act reauthorizing highway, highway safety, and \n     transit programs for fiscal years beginning with fiscal year \n     2004 should include, in addition to the budgetary protections \n     for the highway program provided under subsection (b), \n     appropriate budgetary protections for highway safety and \n     transit programs.\n       (d) Conforming Amendments to Revenue Aligned Budget \n     Authority.--Section 110 of title 23, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Maximum Economic Growth for \n     America Through Highway Funding Part II Act'' or the ``MEGA \n     Fund Part II Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION TO MAKE FUNDING AVAILABLE FROM THE \n                   HIGHWAY TRUST FUND.\n\n       Section 9503(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (relating to expenditures from the Highway Trust Fund) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence--\n       (A) by striking ``2003'' and inserting ``2009'';\n       (B) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``or'' at the end;\n       (C) in subparagraph (E), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``, or''; and\n       (D) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(F) authorized to be paid out of the Highway Trust Fund \n     under the Maximum Economic Growth for America Through Highway \n     Funding Act.''; and\n       (2) in the second sentence, by striking ``TEA 21 \n     Restoration Act'' and inserting ``Maximum Economic Growth for \n     America Through Highway Funding Act''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Mega Fund Act--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                         section 1, short title\n\n       This section sets forth the title of the bill.\n\n\n               section 2. authorization of appropriations\n\n       Subsection (a) would authorize the programs subject to the \n     Minimum Guarantee. The 5 principal apportioned programs of \n     TEA-21--Interstate Maintenance, National Highway System, \n     Surface Transportation Program, Bridge, Congestion Mitigation \n     and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ)--would be significantly \n     increased. Collectively, they would grow from $20.2 billion \n     for FY 2003 to $28.6 billion by FY 2009. Also, they would \n     maintain their current proportion to one anther. The \n     Appalachian Highway program would be continued at present \n     levels of $450 million annually and the Recreational Trails \n     program increased to $75 million annually. A technical and \n     conforming provision in section 11 of the bill would extend \n     the Minimum\n\n[[Page S10695]]\n\n     Guarantee program--which would grow considerably by operation \n     of its own terms.\n       The High Priority Projects program would be continued but \n     reduced from nearly $1.8 billion in FY 2003 to a still-\n     generous $1 billion for each of FYs 2004-2009. The bill does \n     not pretend that high priority projects will go away, but \n     tries to set a realistic goal of reducing them, providing \n     States a wider role in administering the program.\n       Subsection (b) would authorize $2 billion annually for the \n     new economic and demographic barriers program set forth in \n     section 5 of the bill.\n       Subsection (c) would authorize additional programs. The \n     borders program and the corridors program would be separately \n     authorized, at $100 million annually each. Federal lands \n     highways programs are reauthorized and increased to the \n     following annual levels: Indian Reservation Roads, $300 \n     million; Public Land Highways, $350 million; Park Roads, $300 \n     million; and Refuge Roads, $35 million. The programs for \n     ferry boats and terminals, scenic byways, and highways in \n     Puerto Rico would be reauthorized at increased annual levels \n     of $50 million, $30 million, and $130 million, respectively.\n       The program to combat highway use tax evasion would be \n     significantly increased, from $5 million today to $40 million \n     annually from FYs 2004-2009. This is an important investment. \n     Improved compliance with highway tax obligations will \n     increase revenues available for the program.\n       Subsection (d) would double, to $50 million annual, the \n     TCSP program. Subsection (e) would continue the National \n     Historic Bridge Preservation program at $10 million annually. \n     Subsection (f) would continue the program for incentive \n     grants for seat belt use at $115 million annually. Subsection \n     (g) would continue current research programs at current \n     levels. Subsection (h) would authorize $75 million annually \n     for 6 years for a new Future Strategic Highway Research \n     Program (``FSHRP''). Subsection (i) would continue the \n     current authorization for magnetic levitation deployment of \n     such sums as may be necessary. Subsection (j) would continue \n     authorization for the TIFIA program at current levels of $130 \n     million annually.\n\n\n                     Section 3, Obligation Ceiling\n\n       This section amends the obligation ceiling provision of \n     TEA-21 to set the obligation limit for FYs 2004-2009 and to \n     make a handful of changes. The non-technical provisions of \n     the section include the following.\n       Paragraph (a)(1) sets the annual obligation ceilings, \n     starting at $34 billion for FY 2004 and rising gradually to \n     $39 billion for FY 2008 and $41 billion for FY 2009. \n     Paragraph (a)(2) continues current exemptions from the \n     obligation ceiling. Paragraph (a)(3) includes an amendment \n     that would newly provide the Indian Reservation Roads program \n     with obligation authority equal to authorizations. Paragraph \n     (a)(5) would continue the practice of setting a separate \n     obligation limit for research. Paragraph (a)(7) would provide \n     for obligation authority to be increased when called for by \n     the terms of the RABA provision. Paragraph (a)(8) would set a \n     distinct obligation limit on administrative expenses.\n\n\n   Section 4, Reliable Highway Program Levels; Revisions to Revenue \n                        Aligned Budget Authority\n\n       Subsection (a) of section 4 sets forth the Sense of the \n     Senate as to why RABA should be continued but improved. \n     Subsection (a) recites that under current law the balance in \n     the Highway Account has grown, denying the public the benefit \n     of the user taxes paid. It also recites that the RABA \n     calculation mechanism has led to annual program levels that \n     differ widely from prior estimates. In addition, the current \n     law produced an estimate of large ``negative RABA'' for \n     fiscal year 2003, a result that Congress found to be totally \n     unacceptable. Congress proceeded to eliminate FY 2003 \n     negative RABA through enactment of legislation (section 1402 \n     of Public Law No. 107-206).\n       Subsection (b) would carry forward firewalls and continue \n     and improve RABA. Paragraphs (b)(1)-(3) would continue \n     firewalls. They would make clear that no spending limits may \n     be imposed to limit highway program obligations below the \n     level of the obligation limit for that year, plus amounts \n     exempt from the obligation limit for that year, plus any \n     applicable upward adjustment due to RABA. The provisions \n     would also protect any outlays made pursuant to the protected \n     obligation (and exempt) levels.\n       Paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) would continue and improve RABA. \n     Under the provisions there would be no negative RABA. As a \n     result, States and the public would be able to count on \n     receiving at least the specified program levels.\n       The determination of whether additional funding would be \n     automatically provided, above the levels set in the \n     obligation provision, would be based on the balance in the \n     Highway Account, not based on current year revenue. Under \n     current law, with program levels keyed to Highway Account \n     income, the current balance is locked up. One can only access \n     Account income, not the balance, even though the user taxes \n     residing in the Account were paid with the expectation that \n     they would be invested in the highway program.\n       As to the specifics of potential upward adjustment in \n     obligation authority under this provision, a key point of \n     reference for the calculations is that Congress should \n     attempt to achieve a prudent, though not overly cautious \n     balance in the Highway Account of approximately $5 billion at \n     the end of FY 2009. As the bill properly deletes negative \n     RABA, it takes a cautious approach to allowing positive RABA \n     in the initial years of the bill, not paying out all funds.\n       Thus, as provided in paragraph (5) if, when the FY 2005 \n     budget is submitted, it is estimated that, but for upward \n     adjustment of obligation levels, the balance in the Account \n     as of the close of fiscal year 2009 would exceed $7 billion, \n     then there would be an upward adjustment in FY 2005 \n     obligation levels of 50% of the estimated excess over that $7 \n     billion balance.\n       However, as the RABA payments are geared towards the fund \n     balance, the 50% of any calculated ``excess'' for a year that \n     is ``forgone'' in that year is not ``lost'' to the highway \n     program, only delayed in release, if the estimates hold firm \n     over the years. By FY 2009, the provision would pay out as \n     RABA, the full excess over a $5 billion balance in the \n     Highway Account.\n       This approach constrains upward adjustments in RABA \n     obligations during the early years of the bill out of respect \n     for the possibility that revenues could be disappointing \n     during the later years of the bill. But this approach still \n     allows the currently large balance in the Highway Account to \n     be put to work.\n       Subsection (b) concerns budgetary protection only for the \n     highway program, as it was developed in conjunction with \n     provisions concerning that program. Subsection (b) does not \n     establish specific budget protections for highway safety and \n     transit programs. Accordingly, subsection (c) of this section \n     includes a Sense of the Senate resolution that appropriate \n     protections for such programs, developed in conjunction with \n     proposals for such programs, should be included in final \n     legislation reauthorizing highway and transit programs.\n\n\n section 5, assistance in overcoming economic and demographic barriers\n\n       Section 5 would create a new type of program that would \n     provide $2 billion per year to assist States in overcoming \n     certain economic and demographic characteristics that can \n     make it more difficult to meet transportation challenges.\n       Five challenges are recognized under this section: low \n     population density ($625 million), high population density \n     ($625 million), low income ($600 million), high population \n     growth ($75 million), and high levels of State road ownership \n     ($75 million). In each category, the amount of funds \n     distributed to a State is increased when the degree of the \n     challenge is more extreme.\n       Once received by a State, these funds are to be treated as \n     if received in the same proportion as the State's \n     apportionments under the Interstate Maintenance, National \n     Highway System, Surface Transportation Program, Bridge, \n     Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality programs and would be \n     subject to the administrative rules governing those programs.\n\n\n                      section 6, emergency relief\n\n       The Emergency Relief program, 23 U.S.C. 125, has been under \n     funded for years. This section would double the Emergency \n     Relief authorization from the Highway Account of the Highway \n     Trust Fund from $100 million to $200 million annually. It \n     also includes language limiting the Highway Account's annual \n     contribution to the program to a maximum of that level. This \n     in no way limits the ability of the Congress to respond \n     rapidly to emergencies, but it does address the degree to \n     which the Highway Account should be financing the response.\n\n\n    Section 7, Increased Stability of Distribution Under Allocation \n                                Programs\n\n       Under this section States would be provided assurance of \n     receiving at least some funding under some of these programs, \n     while leaving some funding for treatment on a discretionary \n     basis. Thus, under subsections (c) and (d), 50 per cent of \n     the funds for the TCSP and ITS deployment programs would be \n     distributed to the States based on their Minimum Guarantee \n     percentage shares, leaving the balance for discretionary \n     distribution. As these programs grow, it is appropriate to \n     move in the direction of mainstreaming their distribution, so \n     that all States participate.\n       In addition, under subsections (a) and (b), concerning the \n     separately funded border infrastructure and corridor \n     programs, each border state, within the meaning of the border \n     program, would receive at least 2 per cent of the program's \n     funds. This leaves most of the funds for discretionary \n     distribution but ensures some participation by the border \n     states in these programs.\n\n\n              Section 8, Historic Park Roads and Parkways\n\n       This section would ensure that, in the administration of \n     the park roads and parkways program, older and intensively \n     used national parks receive some priority in funding. There \n     are major parks, national treasures, where the roads in the \n     parks or providing access to them were initially constructed \n     before 1940 and are in need of serious attention. This \n     provision focuses on such parks that handle many visitors, \n     specifically those with over 1 million visitor days per year. \n     The bill does not ignore other park and parkway needs, as the \n     proposed increase represents an increase apart from this \n     section's requirement that some funds be dedicated to these \n     high-use, old infrastructure parks.\n\n\n      Section 9, Cooperative Federal Lands Transportation Program\n\n       This section would ensure that at least some of the \n     discretionary public lands funding goes to States with \n     significant public\n\n[[Page S10696]]\n\n     lands holdings, in proportion to the extent to which the land \n     in such States is owned by the Federal Government (or held by \n     the Federal Government in trust). The provision should make \n     the delivery of our public lands highway projects more \n     effective and efficient. While leaving significant funds for \n     discretionary distribution, by making the distribution of \n     some funds more regular, the provision would allow States to \n     work with Federal agencies on projects on a longer term and \n     more regular basis.\n\n\n             Section 10, Miscellaneous Program Improvements\n\n       This section contains a number of modest program \n     improvements. Under subsection (c) a State that has the \n     flexibility to use CMAQ funds for highway projects in \n     attainment areas could use those funds for projects in \n     attainment areas that would help prevent pollution. \n     Subsection (e) would codify current practice, under which \n     forest highway projects are not undertaken in a State without \n     the concurrence of the State. Subsection (d) would allow \n     small States the potential to participate in the TIFIA credit \n     program, by lowering the project threshold under that program \n     to $25 million from $100 million. Subsection (b) would \n     increase State flexibility in choosing rail-highway crossing \n     projects. Subsection (a) would correct anomalies in highway \n     statutes that result in inadequate recognition of the \n     economic difficulties facing States with large Federal land \n     holdings.\n       States with significant Federal lands have greater \n     difficulty raising the non-Federal match for Federal projects \n     due to the restrictions on the use of Federal lands for \n     economic activity and the inability of the States to tax such \n     lands. Thus, the basic rule in title 23 of the U.S. Code has \n     long been that the non-Federal match is reduced in such \n     States. Yet careful review of title 23 reveals many \n     provisions, including even the bridge program, which do not \n     follow this general rule. This section would update the \n     Federal lands match provision, to reflect the greater \n     difficulty in raising match faced by such States and to \n     ensure that the principle of the reduced match for Federal \n     lands States is applied to all major elements of the highway \n     program.\n       The subsection on Historic Bridges would allow states to \n     use bridge program funds up to an amount not to exceed 200 \n     percent of the cost of demolishing a historic bridge. \n     Additionally, this subsection repeals the prohibition on the \n     use of Federal-aid highway funds in the future, for projects \n     associated with such bridges after the bridge has been \n     donated.\n       This flexibility does not create an obligation on the state \n     to fund preservation or relocation of a historic bridge.\n\n\n  section 11, miscellaneous program extensions and technical revisions\n\n       This largely technical section would: not extend a takedown \n     of surface transportation program funds that has been used to \n     support a narrow class of projects; continue the Minimum \n     Guarantee program, the discretionary bridge program, Puerto \n     Rico highway program, and the DBE program. Given overall \n     funding increases, the provision does not extent the \n     Interstate Maintenance Discretionary program, further \n     increasing funds available to all the States under that \n     program. It establishes a placeholder for distribution of \n     funds for high priority projects.\n\n\n                       section 12, effective date\n\n       Under this section the provisions of the bill would take \n     effect on October 1, 2003.\n\n          Mega Fund Act, Part II--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                         section 1, short title\n\n       This section sets forth the title of the bill.\n\n\n                               section 2\n\n       This section amends section 9503(c) of the United States \n     Internal Revenue Code to allow expenditures pursuant to the \n     Mega Fund Act to be available from the Highway Trust Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Crapo, and Mr Craig):\n  S. 3134. A bill to amend titles 23 and 49, United States Code, to \nencourage economic growth in the United States by increasing \ntransportation investments in rural areas, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President I rise today to introduce a bill to help \nrural America. Now I am always trying to help Montana, but this bill \nwill help every State. Today I introduce the MEGA RURAL ACT, Maximum \nEconomic Growth for America Through Rural Transportation Investment.\n  Quite simply, there are rural transportation needs not being met \nnationwide. This bill addresses those needs.\n  This is the eighth bill in a series of bills that Senator Crapo and I \nare introducing to highlight our proposals on reauthorization of TEA \n21--the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century.\n  So far we've introduced a series of MEGA ACTs, Maximum Economic \nGrowth for America Through different types of investments and policy \nchanges. In the past 6 months I have introduced MEGA TRUST, MEGA RED \nTRANS, MEGA FUND, Parts I and II, MEGA SAFE, MEGA STREAM and MEGA \nINNOVATE. Today it's the MEGA RURAL ACT.\n  The first provision in the MEGA RURAL Act will help states overcome \ncertain rural hardships. In the same manner as the MEGA FUND ACT \naddresses this, the MEGA RURAL ACT would create a new program, at $2 \nbillion annually, to assist States in dealing with certain economic and \ndemographic barriers.\n  This would be a new type of program, not subject to the minimum \nguarantee, that is not keyed to specific project types but to types of \nproblems facing States. States with low population density, or low per \ncapita incomes, for example, face real challenges. While the provision \nalso addresses some problems faced by non-rural States, this new \nsection will give real help to rural States.\n  The different approach of this program lets States facing those \nproblems receive funds and pick the projects. Every one of the 50 \nStates would receive significant funding under this program every year.\n  The second issue that the MEGA RURAL ACT addresses is that of rural \nroads. I've been hearing from County Commissioners from Montana as well \nas other States, about how much they need direct funding for local \nroads.\n  These localities are hard pressed for funds and many of these roads \nare unsafe. This bill, just as the MEGA SAFE ACT does, would establish \na pilot program, at $200 million annually from FY 2004-2009, to address \nsafety on rural local roads. Funds could be used only on local roads \nand rural minor collectors, roads that are not Federal-aid highways.\n  The program does not affect distribution of funds among States, as \nfunds will be distributed to each of the 50 States in accord with their \nrelative formula share under 23 U.S.C. 105. Funds could be used only \nfor projects or activities that have a safety benefit. By January 1, \n2009 the Secretary of Transportation is to report on progress under the \nprovision and whether any modifications are recommended.\n  Finally, just as the MEGA RED TRANS ACT does, the MEGA RURAL ACT \nwould ensure that, as Federal transit programs are reauthorized, \nincreased funding is provided to meet the needs of the elderly and \ndisabled and of rural and small urban areas.\n  There is no question that our nation's large metropolitan areas have \nsubstantial transit needs that will receive attention as transit \nreauthorization legislation is developed. But the transit needs of \nrural and smaller areas, and of our elderly and disabled citizens, also \nrequire additional attention and funding.\n  The bill would provide that additional funding in a way that does not \nimpact other portions of the transit program. For example, while the \nbill would at least double every State's funding for the elderly and \ndisabled transit program by FY 2004, nothing in the bill would reduce \nfunding for any portion of the transit program or for any State.\n  To the contrary, the bill would help strengthen the transit program \nas a whole by providing that the Mass Transit Account of the Highway \nTrust Fund is credited with the interest on its balance. This is a key \nprovision in the MEGA TRUST Act the MEGA RED TRANS Act, and now the \nMEGA RURAL ACT.\n  Specifically, the bill would set modest minimum annual \napportionments, by State, for the elderly and disabled transit program, \nthe rural transit program, and for States that have urbanized areas \nwith a population of less than 200,000.\n  It would ensure that each State that has a small urbanized area \nreceives a minimum of $11 million for these three programs.\n  It is not a large amount of money but, for my State of Montana it is \ndouble what we get for those programs currently. For some other States \nit is more than four times what they receive.\n  The bill would also establish a $30 million program for essential bus \nservice, to help connect citizens in rural communities to the rest of \nthe world by facilitating transportation between rural areas and \nairports and passenger rail stations.\n  I am very aware of the role that public transit plays in the lives of \nrural citizens and the elderly and disabled.\n\n[[Page S10697]]\n\nWhen most people hear the word ``transit'' they think of a light rail \nsystem. But in rural areas transit translates to buses and vanpools.\n  Its about time that these issues are being addressed for rural \nAmerica. Thank You.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to establish a national \nuniform multiple air pollutant regulatory program for the electric \ngenerating sector; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this past June, at an EPW Committee \nmarkup, I joined the majority of committee members in reporting out \nlegislation to reduce harmful emissions from our Nation's power plants. \nAt that time, I offered, and then withdrew an alternate, comprehensive, \n4-emission approach. Since then, along with representatives from \nelectric generators who would be impacted by such legislation, and some \nleaders in the environmental community, I have worked to strengthen my \namendment even further. The result is the Clean Air Planning Act. I \nrise today to introduce this bill, and am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Chafee, Beaux, and Baucus.\n  The bill takes a market-based approach that would aggressively reduce \nemissions of sulfur dioxide, SO2, nitrogen oxides, \nNOX, carbon dioxide, CO2, and mercury from \nelectrical power generators. This approach also would provide planning \nand regulatory certainty to electric generators, who are required to \nachieve these reductions. It is mindful of the fact that coal fuels \napproximately 50 percent of our Nation's electricity and contributes a \ndisproportionate share of emissions, and will remain the leading source \nof reliable, affordable electricity for decades to come.\n  The public health and environmental impacts of SO2, \nNOX, and mercury have been well documented. While there is \nbipartisan agreement that emissions of these three pollutants from \npower plants need further control, there is some disagreement over how \nmuch and how fast. The Clean Air Planning Act would establish \nsignificant caps on total emissions of these pollutants, but the caps \nwould be phased in to provide the industry the time needed to meet the \ncaps. In addition, the bill includes a flexible trading system to allow \nthe caps to be attained most efficiently.\n  There is also a growing consensus that greenhouse gases such as \nCO2 emissions from power plants are contributing to climate \nchange. The time has come to set up mechanisms that will address these \nemissions without impeding economic growth. The Clean Air Planning Act \nestablishes the modest goal of capping CO2 emissions from \nelectrical generators at 2001 levels by 2012. Generators can meet that \ngoal with a flexible system that allows both trading between \ngenerators.\n  The bill also includes flexible options to reduce the costs of \ncontrolling carbon dioxide emissions through international projects and \nthrough forest and agricultural projects that can sequester carbon from \nthe atmosphere while also providing additional environmental benefits. \nPart of the task ahead is to get better analysis that helps determine \nthe right parameters for these flexibility provisions, so that the bill \nprovides a smooth least-cost transition for the industry yet also \ndelivers a meaningful incentive for improved efficiency and reduced \nemissions from power plants.\n  In the context of comprehensive legislation that will achieve \nsignificant reductions in emissions from power plants, some existing \nregulatory requirements should be updated. This bill carefully updates \nsome New Source Review requirements to eliminate redundancy while \nretaining strict environmental protections.\n  I have heard from several experts in recent weeks who have studied \nprovisions of this bill as it was being developed, and I plan to engage \nthem in further discussions in the weeks and months ahead. I appreciate \ntheir willingness to help keep this important topic moving forward. \nThis is a complex issue, one that should be of great importance to \nelectric generators, environmental leaders, State and local regulators, \nand to each of us here in the Senate. There are numerous complicated \nissues in this legislation such as the proper extent of crediting off \nsystem carbon reductions, equitable allocation of allowances, \nappropriate regulatory streamlining, and prevention of local impacts, \nand we invite assistance from all who want to help us address these \nissues.\n  Today, America's power plants will emit over 6 million tons of \nharmful emissions. They will also power the world's most productive \neconomy. Reducing emissions while retaining affordable electricity is \nthe goal of the Clean Air Planning Act, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in this effort. I look forward to developing consensus within \nthe Senate next year and passing strong, comprehensive legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3135\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Carper \ntoday to introduce the Clean Air Planning Act of 2002. Congress needs \nto advance four pollutant legislation that offers the best chance for \nbroad bipartisan support, and I believe this bill meets that test. The \ntestimony received through hearings in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee over the past several years has clearly outlined the need for \ncontrolling the major emissions from power plants, sulfur dioxide, \nnitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide, while at the same time \nrecognizing the added costs of these new controls. We know through \nexperience that we will only be successful at passing legislation if we \nfind middle ground.\n  The relationship of fossil fuels to global warming is clear and \nscientifically validated. The release of the ``U.S. Climate Action \nReport 2002'' by the Administration in May tells us we need to take \nreal actions toward solving the problem. The longer we wait, the harder \nthis problem will be to solve. The Rio Convention is a perfect example \nof why waiting is not reasonable. In 1992, we agreed to voluntarily \nreduce harmful emissions to 1990 levels. It didn't happen. Now, in 2002 \nwe are told that reductions to 1990 levels will stall the economy. If \nwe wait much longer before taking any action, imagine how much harder \nit will be to achieve real reductions without harming the economy.\n  I am a co-sponsor of Senator Jeffords' bill, S. 556, and I voted for \nit in the Environment and Public Works Committee. However, I believe \nthat Carper-Chafee will ultimately enjoy broader support. Our bill \nwould achieve significant reductions in a more cost effective way than \nother proposals. For sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and mercury, we \nwill establish emission caps that are superior to reductions that can \nbe achieved under the existing Clean Air Act. In addition, for the \nfirst time, we will ensure that we achieve real reductions of carbon \ndioxide emissions.\n  Many predicted that the passage of S. 556 from the Committee would \ncreate a stalemate on this important issue. I believe that the Carper-\nChafee bill offers a real opportunity to break the stalemate and begin \nan honest debate that will eventually lead to enactment of strong \nlegislation. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues as we \nmove forward to pass a bill that enjoys the broadest support and \nadequately addresses the serious health, environmental, and economic \nissues facing the nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 3137. A bill to provide remedies for retaliation against \nwhistleblowers making congressional disclosures; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Congressional \nOversight Protection Act of 2002. The 107th Congress has truly been the \nCongress of the whistleblower. From Sherron Watkins who helped expose \nmany of the misdeeds at Enron, to FBI Special Agent Coleen Rowley and \nothers who brought needed public attention to some of the shortcomings \nof the FBI prior to 9-11, we have been eyewitness to the value of \ngetting the inside story.\n  The 107th Congress has also been one of rejuvenated bipartisan \noversight. On the Judiciary Committee we convened the first series of \ncomprehensive bipartisan FBI oversight hearings in decades after I \nassumed the Chairmanship. The Joint Intelligence Committee is now \nconducting bipartisan hearings to ascertain what shortcomings on the \npart of our intelligence community need to be corrected so as not to \nallow the 9-11 terrorist attacks to recur. The Senate Banking Committee \nconducted extensive oversight of the SEC and its relationship with the \naccounting industry, to ascertain whether a new regulatory scheme was \nrequired. Both the Senate and House Judiciary Committees are attempting \nto ascertain how the new powers we provided in the USA PATRIOT Act are \nbeing used. These are only a few examples.\n  We have all been the beneficiaries of such increased oversight and \nthe courage of the whistleblowers who provided information as part of \nthat effort, because their revelations have led to important reforms. \nThe Enron scandal and the subsequent hearings led to the most extensive \ncorporate reform legislation in decades, including the criminal \nprovisions and the first ever corporate whistleblower protections from \nS. 2010, the Corporate Fraud and Criminal Accountability Act, that I \nauthored. The testimony of the rank and file FBI agents that we heard \non the Judiciary Committee helped us to craft\n\n[[Page S10706]]\n\nthe bipartisan FBI Reform Act, S. 1974. This legislation, which \nincluded enhanced whistleblower protections, was reported unanimously \nto the full Senate in April but is being blocked by an anonymous \nRepublican hold. The same day as Coleen Rowley's nationally televised \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee, President Bush not only \nreversed his previous opposition to establishing a new cabinet level \nDepartment of Homeland Security, but gave a national address calling \nfor the largest government reorganization in 50 years. In the last year \nwe have learned once again that the public as a whole benefits from a \nlone voice in the government.\n  Unfortunately, the people who very rarely benefit from these \nrevelations are the whistleblowers themselves. We have heard testimony \nin oversight hearings on the Judiciary Committee that there is quite \noften retaliation against those who raise public awareness about \nproblems within large organizations even to Congress. Sometimes the \nretaliation is overt, sometimes it is more subtle and invidious, but it \nis almost always there. The law needs to protect the people who risk so \nmuch to protect us and create a culture that encourages employees to \nreport waste, fraud, and mismanagement.\n  For those who provide information to Congress, that protection is a \nhollow promise. On one hand, the law is very clear that it is illegal \nto interfere with or deny, ``the right of employees, individually or \ncollectively, to petition Congress or a Member of Congress, or to \nfurnish information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or \nMember thereof . . .'' See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 7211. Amazingly, however, \nthis simple provision is a right without a remedy. Employees who are \nretaliated against for providing information to Congress cannot pursue \nany avenue of redress to protect their statutory rights. The only \nexception to this applies to employees of publicly traded companies, \nwho are now covered by the whistleblower provision included in the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act that we passed this year. Thus, under current law, \ngovernment whistleblowers reporting to Congress have less protection \nthan private industry whistleblowers.\n  This bill would merely correct this anomaly by providing government \nemployees that come to Congress with the right to bring an action in \ncourt when they suffer the type of retaliation already prohibited under \nthe law. Thus, it does not create new statutory rights, but merely \nprovides a statutory remedy for existing law. That way, we can promise \nfuture whistleblowers who come before Congress that their right to \naccess the legislative branch is not an illusion. We can also assure \nthe public at large that our future efforts at Congressional oversight \nand improving the functions of government will be effective. This \nlegislation is strongly supported by leading whistleblower groups, \nincluding the National Whistleblower Center and the Government \nAccountability Project, and I ask unanimous consent that their letters \nof support be printed in the Record.\n  For all these reasons, I urge swift passage of this legislation. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3137\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: I am writing to strongly support your \n     legislation, the Congressional Oversight Protection Act of \n     2002. The National Whistleblower Center (Center) is the pre-\n     eminent national organization that promotes effective \n     measures to protect whistleblowers who come forward in the \n     public interest at great risk to their careers. In that \n     regard, your introduction of this bill once again \n     demonstrates your leadership in understanding the importance \n     of whistleblowing and its role in our democratic process, and \n     the Center is pleased to support your bill and work hard to \n     achieve its swift passage.\n       In the wake of the events of 9/11, the stakes have been \n     raised for Congress to perform the most effective oversight \n     of the federal government. To do so, Congress must have \n     unfettered access to information. And that means that \n     citizens in both the public and private sectors must be free \n     to come forward to Congress with proper disclosures without \n     the fear of retaliation. Under current law, citizens have the \n     right to make disclosures to Congress, but there is no remedy \n     for them to protect their rights in the event of retaliation. \n     Your bill would provide such a remedy and, in doing so, would \n     put government whistleblowers on a par with whistleblowers in \n     publicly-held companies who have such protections under the \n     newly-passed Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n       This year, the concept and importance of whistleblowing has \n     been etched indelibly on the minds of the public, thanks to \n     congressional investigations into Enron and other companies, \n     thanks to the joint investigation into intelligence lapses in \n     the government, and thanks to extensive media coverage of \n     these matters. The public's appreciation for the necessity of \n     whistleblowers and whistleblower protections creates an \n     atmosphere conducive to passing the Congressional Oversight \n     Protection Act at the earliest possible time. Your leadership \n     in trying to fill an important void in whistleblower law \n     should be commended and hailed by all those who support \n     ``good government.''\n       Once again, thank you for your continued leadership on this \n     and other whistleblower issues throughout the 107th Congress. \n     Please feel free to call on the Center to work together to \n     pass this bill.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                 Kris J. Kolesnik,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Government Accountability Project,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: This letter is to express unqualified \n     appreciation for introduction of the Congressional Oversight \n     Protection Act, providing access to jury trials in court for \n     federal whistleblowers and others who bear witness through \n     disclosures to Congress. This legislation reflects leadership \n     to close an inherent flaw that has prejudiced even the best \n     administrative law remedial systems. Administrative boards do \n     not have the judicial independence or resources for high-\n     stakes, politically sensitive whistleblower disputes with \n     national consequences. Ironically, those type of disputes are \n     the primary, most significant reason for enacting \n     whistleblower protection laws.\n       The legislation puts teeth into the congressional right to \n     know law, the Lloyd LaFollette Act of 1912. (5 USC 7211) That \n     law's purpose is simple, and fundamental--to protect the free \n     flow of information to Congress. It prohibits discrimination \n     for communicating with Congress. It was passed in response to \n     presidential gag orders that had imposed prior approval \n     before federal employees could communicate with Congress. \n     Flood statements before passage emphasized the free flow of \n     information as the lifeblood for Congress to carry out its \n     mission. The need is even greater when freedom of speech \n     means the freedom to warn Congress of national security \n     breakdowns, before the public suffers the consequences again.\n       Unfortunately, Congress failed to specifically provide \n     access to court to enforce Lloyd LaFollette rights. As a \n     result, it has been a right without a remedy. That means it \n     is of little more than rhetorical significance, and no \n     benefit to reprisal victims. Since 1912, 54 whistleblowers \n     have tried to assert their rights under this law. Fifty three \n     cases were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Consistently \n     the explanation is that\n\n[[Page S10707]]\n\n     the statute did not provide the court with jurisdiction as \n     authority to act. The bill's purpose is to strengthen \n     Congress' right to know--a prerequisite for informed \n     oversight. The bill's strategy is to provide reinforced \n     protection, beyond normal civil service remedies, for those \n     who choose to communicate through and work with Congress.\n       There should be no question of the need for reinforced \n     protection of congressional whistleblowers. The system of \n     administrative civil service hearings was never designed for \n     major public policy disputes involving high stakes national \n     consequences and active congressional oversight. The \n     Administrative Judges who hear the cases have no judicial \n     independence and know they will be treated like \n     whistleblowers if they rule for those challenging politically \n     powerful government officials. As a result, those hearing \n     officers treat significant whistleblower cases like poison \n     ivy. Consistently, the administrative process has been a \n     black hole for politically significant disputes, with \n     decisions regularly not being finalized for years, and one \n     case still pending after 11 years. In a significant \n     environmental dispute involving millions of dollars in timber \n     theft, four Forest Service employees are still waiting for \n     their day in court after six years.\n       After lessons learned from the FBI's Coleen Rowley, it is \n     beyond credible debate that whistleblowers can make a major \n     contribution toward preventing another 9/11. Analogous \n     frustrations of Border Patrol, Customs Service, Department of \n     Energy, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Aviation \n     Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     whistleblowers illustrate an unmistakable pattern of ignoring \n     or silencing patriots on the front lines of homeland \n     security. As our nation's modern Paul Reveres, whistleblowers \n     are invaluable as an early warning signal to prevent \n     avoidable disasters.\n       It should also be clear, however, that this legislation is \n     a necessity to strengthen homeland security. It will not \n     solve the complex problems of the civil service system. But \n     it will give whistleblowers a credible remedy for the first \n     time in eight years, if they work with Congress. Increasingly \n     whistleblowers have been lionized for their bravery, but that \n     is no substitute for genuine, enforceable rights. Indeed, the \n     praise can ring cynically hollow to those whose careers are \n     in ashes for doing their duty. It is unrealistic to expect \n     whistleblowers to defend the public, if they cannot defend \n     themselves. Profiles in Courage are the exception, not the \n     rule. If successful, your initiative to add rights matching \n     the rhetoric supporting whistleblowers will be a good \n     government breakthrough.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Tom Devine,\n                                                   Legal Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 3138. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, in \ncooperation with the University of New Mexico, to construct and occupy \na portion of the Hibben Center for Archaeological Research at the \nUniversity of New Mexico, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would \nauthorize the Secretary of the Interior to help construct and occupy \npart of the Hibben Center for Archaeological Research at the University \nof New Mexico. This bill will help the University of New Mexico finish \na state of the art museum facility to store, and display the National \nPark Service's Chaco Collection.\n  Let me give you a bit of background. In 1907, Theodore Roosevelt \nfounded the Chaco Canyon Culture National Historical Park in \nNorthwestern New Mexico. The Monument was created to preserve the \nextensive prehistoric pueblo ruins in Chaco Canyon.\n  The height of the Chaco culture began in the mid 800's and lasted \nover 300 years. People built dozens of complex multi-storied masonry \nbuildings containing hundreds of rooms. These complexes were connected \nto communities by a network of prehistoric roads. I helped to establish \nthe Chaco Culture National Historic Park to preserve these areas.\n  Since 1907, the University of New Mexico and the National Park \nService have been partners in this area. From 1907 to 1949, the \nUniversity owned the land within the Park boundaries. During this \nperiod, Dr. Frank Hibben excavated in Chaco Canyon and remained \ninterested in the area throughout his long career. The University built \na large collection of artifacts that it retains today.\n  In 1949, the University deeded the land to the Federal Government, \nand since that time, the University and the Park Service have continued \na partnership through a series of memoranda of understanding. Since \n1985, the NPS Chaco collections have been housed at University of New \nMexico's Maxwell Museum of Anthropology. As both the University of New \nMexico and the National Park Service collections have begun to grow, a \nnew home for them is needed.\n  To this end, Dr Hibben began planning a new research and curation \nfacility at the University of New Mexico. He asked the Park Service to \npartner with him on this project, and today, construction of the Hibben \ncenter, a modern, professional facility to house the University of New \nMexico's collections as well as the Park Service collections is a \nreality.\n  Dr. Hibben recently passed away, and left the University of New \nMexico the funds to assist with this project. The partnership between \nthe Park Service and the University will mean that the Hibben center \nwill hold a world-class collection and will facilitate and encourage \nthe study of these important Southwestern collections.\n  This bill will provide authorization to pay for the Federal share of \nthe improvement costs to the Hibben Center. This bill is long overdue, \nand will honor both the legacy of Dr. Hibben and the Chaco Culture.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3138\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide a right to be heard for participants and \nbeneficiaries of an employee pension benefit plan of a debtor in order \nto protect pensions of those employees and retirees; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Employee \nPension Bankruptcy Protection Act of 2002. Today, when a company \ndeclares bankruptcy, it is often the employees and retirees who suffer. \nThey suffer because they often loose their hard earned pensions and \nretirement benefits during the bankruptcy process. This is simply not \nright. When Americans loose the pensions and benefits that they have \nworked a lifetime to earn, it is the responsibility of the members of \nthis body to take notice and to act to protect them.\n  The bill I introduce today does one very simple thing it gives \nemployees and retirees the right to request that they be represented \nbefore the bankruptcy court, the same kind of representation that \nprotects the rights of others that are owed money by the corporation. \nUnder this bill, a representative of the employees and retirees can \nappear and be heard if it is likely that the employee benefit pension \nplan of the bankrupt corporation will be terminated or substantially \nunderfunded and if it is possible that the beneficiaries of the plan \nwill be adversely affected.\n  By allowing employees and retirees to be represented before the \nbankruptcy court, we will ensure that the bankruptcy court hears from \nthe people who entrusted their retirement savings to their employer. \nEmployees and retirees will be able to argue to the court that any \ndivision of assets or bankruptcy plan must be fair to the pensioners. \nThe needs of the corporation's employees and retirees should be heard \nBEFORE the assets of a bankrupt corporation are split up among \ncreditors and lost forever. They deserve to have their day in court.\n  It has only recently been brought to my attention that under current \nlaw, employees and retirees are not represented before the bankruptcy \ncourt as creditors. Legally, the pension fund is the ``creditor'' of \nthe corporation, not the employees and retirees. Thus, the pension \ninterests of employees and retirees are represented in the bankruptcy \nprocess by a trustee of the pension, if one exists, or by the PBGC, if \nit takes over the pension fund.\n  Because PBGC, under its governing statutes, can not guarantee the \nfull benefits of the pension plan, but can only guarantee the statutory \namount, significant portions of hard earned pensions can remain unpaid \nwhen a company goes bankrupt. While the PBGC is often able to pay most \nof the pension benefits when a company goes bankrupt, in certain cases \nthe statutory limit can be much lower than the pension payment the \nemployee or retiree was promised by the corporation. Employees and \nretirees deserve more than this. They deserve the additional \nrepresentation before the bankruptcy court that this bill provides if \ntheir hard earned pensions and retiree benefits are to be adequately \nprotected.\n  I would like to thank Mr. John Nichols of Gadsden, AL, and his son, \nPhil for bringing this to my attention. The ordeal faced by Mr. \nNichols, is a prime example of why employees and retirees need more \nrepresentation before the bankruptcy court. Mr. Nichols spent his \nentire career at a steel plant in Gadsden. He began working for \nRepublic Steel in 1956 and stayed with the company through two \nownership changes and a buyout by LTV Steel.\n  When LTV bought out Mr. Nichols employers, LTV Steel took over the \nmonthly pension payments guaranteed to the former employees and \nretirees of Republic Steel, including Mr. Nichols. Soon after the \ntakeover, however, LTV filed for bankruptcy, claiming that it could \nno longer make pension payments to Republic Steel's former employees. \nPBGC, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation stepped in to help LTV \nmake a small part of the pension payments, but LTV eventually stopped \nmaking payments at all.\n\n  Because all the payments LTV had been making were not guaranteed by \nthe PBGC, the long awaited pension payments earned by Mr. Nichols and \nby Republic Steel's other loyal employees were severely reduced. Mr. \nNichols' pension payments went from $2,225.00 to $675.00--only 30 \npercent of what he had been promised. A third of this payment now \ncovers Mr. Nichols' health insurance premium that he can no longer \npurchase through LTV, leaving him with only 20 percent of his promised \npension each month. PBGC could only pay the retirees the amount their \nstatute allowed, and no one had the responsibility of going to the \nbankruptcy court and telling them what was happening to the retirees of \nRepublic Steel. PBGC itself recognized that the claims of the \npensioners against LTV, ``are among the many claims that will probably \nnever be paid, except perhaps in cents on the dollar'' and stated that \nPBGC's claim against LTV for the pension plan underfunding was perhaps \n``[t]he largest of these claims [that will go unpaid].''\n  During LTV's bankruptcy case, various creditors were represented \nbefore the bankruptcy court, but not the employees and retirees. Thus, \nwhen the assets of LTV were divided among its creditors, employees and \nthe retirees were not at the table. If the employees and retirees had \nhad an opportunity to make their case before the bankruptcy judge, the \nresult could have been different.\n  The Employee Pension Bankruptcy Protection Act of 2002 seeks to make \nsure that what happened to the retirees of Republic Steel will never \nhappen again, employees and retirees will never be deprived of their \npensions without having their day in court. While a company may still \nbe able to discharge its obligation to pay pensioners in bankruptcy, \nthis bill at least takes the first modest step to protect pensioners by \nproviding them the opportunity to be part of the bankruptcy bargaining \nprocess. Before the bankruptcy court sells assets or adopts a plan of \nreorganization, the employees and retirees will be heard. After all, it \nis their money. This is only fair.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this bill and \nto work with me to further ensure that employees and retirees of \ncorporations are fairly treated and protected under the United States \nBankruptcy Code.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3139\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to assist law enforcement in their efforts to recover \nmissing children and to clarify the standards for State sex offender \nregistration programs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins to introduce the Prevention and Recovery of \nMissing Children Act of 2002, to improve the recovery of missing \nchildren and the tracking of convicted sexual offenders and child \npredators.\n  Sexual offenders pose an enormous challenge for policy makers. They \ncreate unparalleled fear among citizens, and most of their victims are \nchildren and youth. Two-thirds of imprisoned sex offenders report that \ntheir victims were under age 18, and nearly half report that their \nvictims are ages 12 and younger.\n  Last year, several newspapers across the country, including the \nHartford Courant, highlighted the inadequacy of reporting information \nin missing child cases and the lack of tracking of convicted sex \noffenders and known child predators. One tragic example reported a \nconvicted sex offender who moved from Massachusetts to Montana, where \npolice were never contacted about his history. He brutally murdered \nseveral Montana children before he was apprehended, and was later \nlinked to 54 cases of child abduction and molestation in several \nStates. In many cases, convicted sex offenders and child predators slip \nthrough law enforcement loopholes and continue to prey on children.\n  Over the last decade, Congress enacted several laws designed to \nimprove the tracking of convicted sex offenders and improve the \nrecovery of missing children, including The Jacob Wetterling Crimes \nAgainst Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act of \n1994; Megan's Law of 1996; and The Pam Lyncher Sex Offender Tracking \nand Identification Act of 1996. Collectively, these acts established \nminimum standards for State sex offender registration programs and \ncreated systems to track convicted sex offenders.\n  While these current Federal laws address the main features of an \neffective registry system, the discretion over registry details and \nprocedures is left up to the States. This has led to a lack of \nconsistency and wide disparities between States. For example, State \nrequirements for sex offender notification of registration changes \nrange from 1 day to 40 days, and State requirements for a sex offender \nto register an address after moving to a new State range from 48 hours \nto 70 days.\n  In addition, many States place the burden to notify changes in \nregistry information solely on the sex offender. We need to tighten \nregistry systems so that law enforcement in all States is better \nequipped to track sexual offenders. This bill strengthens the registry \nfoundation for all States built upon the practices already in place in \nsome States. It builds on successful practices to better protect our \ncommunities nationwide.\n  The tracking of released sex offenders is critical to protecting our \nchildren. Most sex offenders are not in prison, about 60 percent of \nconvicted sex offenders are under conditional supervision in the \ncommunity, and those who are in prison often serve limited sentences. \nThis is of great concern because sex offenders, particularly if \nuntreated, are at risk of re-offending.\n  This bill makes several important changes to improve the tracking of \nsex offenders and the recovery of missing children. The bill: amends \nthe definition of ``minimally sufficient program'' to include: the \nregistration of all convicted sex offenders prior to release; the \ncollection of information to assist in tracking individuals, including \na DNA sample, current photograph, driver's license and vehicle \ninformation; and verification of address and employment information for \nall offenders every 90 days; amends penalties for non-compliance with \nregistry requirements. It provides that State programs must designate \nnon-compliance as a felony and permits the issuance of a warrant. This \nprovision is intended to encourage compliance by offenders as well as \nprovide a tool for prosecutors; improves the chances for recovering \nmissing children and aides law enforcement in solving cases by \npreventing the removal of missing children from the National Crime \nInformation Center (NCIC) database and making sure that convicted sex \noffenders do not become exempt from the lifetime registration \nrequirement; improves the chances for recovery of missing children by \nrequiring entry of child information into the NCIC database within 2 \nhours.\n  We must make the tracking of convicted sex offenders and the post-\nrelease supervision of child sexual predators a higher priority. It is \nnot enough to ensure that an offender completes his sentence.\n  Since most sexual offenders are in the community, we must ensure that \nthere is continuing contact and supervision of released sexual \noffenders. We have an obligation to protect our children from sexual \noffenders and sexual predators who prey on our children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 3141. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \nexpand the scope of the Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD: Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Murray, Senator Boxer, Senator Inouye, Senator \nAkaka, and Senator Corzine to introduce the ``Family and Medical Leave \nExpansion Act.'' Since enactment in 1993, more than 35 million \nAmericans have taken leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  Despite the many Americans the Family and Medical Leave Act has \nhelped, too many continue to be left behind. Too many continue to have \nto choose between job and family. The facts are clear: millions of \nAmericans remain uncovered by the Family and Medical Leave Act. And, \ntoo many who are eligible for the Family and Medical Leave Act cannot \nafford to take unpaid leave from work. The ``Family and Medical Leave \nExpansion Act'' addresses both these problems.\n  The ``Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act'' would expand the scope \nand coverage of FMLA. It would fund pilot programs at the state level \nto offer partial or full wage replacement programs to ensure that \nemployees do not have to choose between job and family.\n  Times have changed over the years. More and more mothers are working. \nWhile only 27 percent of mothers with infants were in the labor force \nin 1960, by 1999 that percentage rose to nearly 60 percent. Even as \nemployment rates within this group rises, family responsibilities \nremain constant, a reality that lies at the core of the FMLA. According \nto an employee survey by the Department of Labor, about one fifth of US \nworkers have a need for some form of leave covered under the FMLA, and \nabout 40 percent of all employees think they will need FMLA-covered \nleave within the next five years.\n  According to a Department of Labor study in 2000, leave to care for \none's own health or for the health of a seriously ill child, spouse or \nparent, together account for almost 80 percent of all FMLA leave. \nApproximately 52 percent of the leave taken is due to employees' own \nserious health problems, while 26 percent of the leave is taken\n\n[[Page S10710]]\n\nby young parents caring for their children at birth or adoption.\n  The FMLA requires that all public sector employers and private \nemployers of 50 or more employees provide up to twelve weeks of unpaid \nleave for medical and family care reasons for eligible employees. About \n77 percent of employees, in the private and public sector, currently \nwork in FMLA-covered sites, although only 62 percent of employees are \nactually eligible for leave.\n  However, only 11 percent of private sector work sites are covered \nunder FMLA. Individuals working for small private employers deserve the \nsame work protections afforded to other employees. As a step toward \nexpanding protection to all hard-working Americans, this bill would \nextend FMLA coverage to all private sector worksites with 25 or more \nemployees within a 75-mile radius.\n  Mothers and fathers, sons and daughters have the same family \nresponsibilities and personal health problems, regardless of whether \nthey work for the government, a large private enterprise, or a small \nprivate business. Expanding the FMLA to businesses with 25 or more \nemployees is a crucial acknowledgment of this reality.\n  The bill recognizes the enormous physical and emotional toll domestic \nviolence takes on victims. The bill expands the scope of FMLA to \ninclude leave for individuals to care for themselves or to care for a \ndaughter, son, or parent suffering from domestic violence.\n  Expanding the scope and coverage of FMLA is a positive step for many \nAmericans. But, alone, it is not enough. According to a Department of \nLabor study, 3.5 million covered Americans needed leave but, without \nwage replacement, could not afford to take leave. Over four-fifths of \nthose who needed leave but did not take it said they could not afford \nunpaid leave. Others cut their leave short, with the average duration \nof FMLA leave being 10 days. Of those individuals taking leave under \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act, nearly three-quarters had incomes \nabove $30,000.\n  While the financial sacrifice is often enormous, the need for leave \ncan be even more so. Every year, many Americans bite the bullet and \naccept unpaid leave. As a result, nine percent of leave takers go on \npublic assistance to cover their lost wages. Almost twelve percent of \nfemale leave takers use public assistance for this reason. These \nindividuals are far from unwilling to work. Instead, they are trying to \nbalance work with family, often during a crisis, too often with \ninadequate means to get by.\n  Other major industrialized nations have implemented policies far more \nfamily-friendly to promote early childhood development and family \ncaregiving. At least 128 countries provide paid and job-protected \nmaternity leave, with sixteen weeks the average basic paid leave. In \n1992, before we enacted the Family and Medical Leave Act, the European \nUnion mandated a paid fourteen week maternity leave as a health and \nsafety measure. Among the 29 Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, OECD, countries, the average childbirth-related leave is \n44 weeks, while the average duration of paid leave is 36 weeks.\n  Compared to these other developed nations, the United States is far \nbehind in efforts to promote worker welfare and productivity. The \n``Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act'' builds on current law to \nprovide pilot programs for states and the federal government to provide \nfor partial or full wage replacement for 6 weeks. At a minimum, this \nwill ensure that parents can continue to make ends meet while taking \nfamily and medical leave.\n  No one should have to choose between work and family. Women and men \ndeserve to take leave when family or health conditions require it \nwithout fear of losing their job or livelihood. We must not simply pay \nlip service to family integrity and the promotion of a healthy \nworkplace. Instead, we must actively work to reduce workplace barriers. \nI urge my colleagues to support the ``Family and Medical Leave \nExpansion Act'' to promote our national values and ensure the welfare \nand health of hard-working Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN:\n  S. 3144. A bill to amend title XVI of the Social Security Act to \nclarify that the value of certain funeral and burial arrangements are \nnot to be considered available resources under the supplemental \nsecurity income program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \nthat codifies the exclusion of irrevocable funeral trusts from \nSupplemental Security Income, SSI, resource calculations.\n  Irrevocable funeral trusts are funds set aside for funeral and burial \nexpenses. These funds cannot be accessed until after the owner's death. \nUntil recently, these trusts were not included in SSI resource \ncalculations, but an administrative misinterpretation in 2001 dropped \nthis important exclusion.\n  This misinterpretation has since been corrected, but it had serious \nrepercussions for many senior citizens while it was in effect. When \nirrevocable funeral and burial trusts were included in SSI \ncalculations, it penalized those SSI applicants who chose to save for \ntheir funeral by inflating their actual individual wealth, even though \nthe trusts could not be accessed. The end result was that many senior \ncitizens' SSI applications were rejected. Because the SSI definition of \nresources and exclusions is used for Medicaid eligibility \ndeterminations, the inclusion also affected Medicaid applicants.\n  I am introducing this bill to codify the exclusion to give senior \ncitizens certainty that future administrations will not be able to \nmisinterpret Congressional intent.\n  In the past, Congress has recognized the value of funeral planning as \ngood social policy. We have encouraged consumers to engage in ``pre-\nneed'' funeral planning in a number of ways.\n  This legislation will encourage people to engage in pre-need \nplanning. It will codify the existing practice of excluding irrevocable \nfuneral trusts from SSI calculations and ensure that future \nmisinterpretations are avoided. We must ensure that people are not \npenalized for providing for their own funerals. I encourage my \ncolleagues to give this legislation serious consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 3145. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to \nestablish a scholarship program to encourage and support students who \nhave contributed substantial public services; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with Senators \nEdwards and DeWine, the Youth Service Scholarship Act. This Act would \nauthorize the Secretary of Education to award college scholarships of \nup to $5,000 to students who perform at least 300 hours of community \nservice in each of two years of high school and continuing scholarships \nto students who continue their service in college.\n  I believe that education is the hub of the wheel of our democracy. \nThere is no better way to address any and all of the challenges we face \nas a nation than by providing all of our children with the education \nthey need and deserve. In the 21st Century, higher education is not a \nluxury, it is a necessity, and this Act would extend access to higher \neducation to more low-income students who otherwise might have \ndifficulty attending college.\n  Naturally, education means reading and math and history and science, \nbut it also means learning to be a citizen. It's not easy to be a good \ncitizen, and this Act will encourage our young people to engage in \ncommunity service and reward them for that, and in so doing, will help \nensure that our next generation of leaders understands that being an \nAmerican is not just a privilege, but a responsibility.\n  We know that students who participate in community service and youth \ndevelopment are less likely to use drugs and alcohol and to misbehave \nin school, and are more likely to receive good grades and be interested \nin going to college. We also know that Federal resources can be an \neffective incentive to leverage broader community support.\n  So, I urge my colleagues to join me, and Senators Edwards and DeWine, \nin supporting the Youth Service Scholarship Act so that we can achieve \nmore of those and other positive outcomes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mrs. Carnahan):\n\n[[Page S10711]]\n\n  S. 3146. A bill to reauthorize funding for the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Protecting \nOur Children Comes First Act of 2002,'' which will double funding for \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC, \nreauthorize the Center through fiscal year 2006, and increase Federal \nsupport to help NCMEC programs to find missing children across the \nNation. I am pleased that Senator Carnahan joins me as the original \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  It is painful to see on TV or in the newspapers photo after photo of \nmissing children from every corner of the Nation. As a father and \ngrandfather, I know that an abducted child is the worst nightmare. \nUnfortunately, it is a nightmare that happens all too often. Indeed, \nthe Justice Department estimates that 2,200 children are reported \nmissing each day of the year. There are approximately 114,600 attempted \nstranger abductions every year, with 3,000-5,000 of those attempts \nsucceeding. These families deserve the assistance of the American \npeople and helping hand of the Congress.\n  As the Nation's top resource center for child protection, the \nNational Center for Missing & Exploited Children spearheads national \nefforts to locate and recover missing children and raises public \nawareness about ways to prevent child abduction, molestation, and \nsexual exploitation.\n  As a national voice and advocate for those too young to vote or speak \nup for their own rights, the NCMEC works to make our children safer. \nThe Center operates under a Congressional mandate and works in \ncooperation with the U.S. Department of Justice's, DOJ, Office of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in coordinating the efforts \nof law enforcement officers, social service agencies, elected \nofficials, judges, prosecutors, educators, and the public and private \nsectors to break the cycle of violence that historically has \nperpetuated these needless crimes against children.\n  NCMEC professionals have disturbingly busy jobs, they have worked on \nmore than 90,000 cases of missing and exploited children since its 1984 \nfounding, helping to recover more than 66,000 children, and raised its \nrecovery rate from 60 percent in the 1980s to 94 percent today. The \nCenter has set up a nationwide, toll free, 24-hour telephone hotline to \ntake reports about missing children and clues that might lead to their \nrecovery, a National Child Pornography Tipline to handle calls from \nindividuals reporting the sexual exploitation of children through the \nproduction and distribution of pornography, and a CyberTipline to \nprocess online leads from individuals reporting the sexual exploitation \nof children. It has taken the lead in circulating millions of \nphotographs of missing children, and serves as a vital resource for the \n17,000 law enforcement agencies located throughout the U.S. in the \nsearch for missing children and the quest for child protection.\n  Today, NCMEC is truly a national organization, having established its \nheadquarters in Alexandria, VA; and operating branch offices in five \nother locations throughout the country to provide hands-on assistance \nto families of missing children, advocating legislative changes to \nbetter protect children, conducting an array of prevention and \nawareness programs, and motivating individuals to become personally \ninvolved in child-protection issues. It has also grown into an \ninternational organization, establishing the International Division of \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which has been \nworking to fulfill the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of \nInternational Child Abduction. The International Division provides \nassistance to parents, law enforcement, attorneys, nonprofit \norganizations, and other concerned individuals who are seeking \nassistance in preventing or resolving international child abductions.\n  NCMEC manages to do all of this good work with only a $10 million \nannual DOJ grant, which will expire after fiscal year 2003. We should \nact now both to extend its authorization and increase the Center' s \nfunding to $20 million each year through fiscal year 2006 so that it \ncan continue to help keep children safe and families intact around the \nnation. There is so much more to be done to ensure the safety of our \nchildren, and the legislation we introduce today will help the Center \nin its efforts to prevent crimes that are committed against them.\n  The ``Protecting Our Children Comes First Act'' also increases \nFederal support of NCMEC programs to find missing children by allowing \nthe U.S. Secret Service to provide forensic and investigative support \nto the NCMEC.\n  The bill also amends of the Missing Children's Assistance Act to \ncoordinate the operation of the Center's CyberTipline to provide all \nonline users an effective means of reporting Internet-related child \nsexual exploitation, such as child pornography, child enticement, and \nchild prostitution. Since its creation in 1998, the NCMEC CyberTipline \nhas fielded almost 100,000 reports, which has allowed Internet users to \nquickly and easily report suspicious activities linked to the Internet.\n  Our legislation gives Federal authorities the authority to share the \nfacts or circumstances of sexual exploitation crimes against children \nwith state authorities without a court order. The bill also gives the \nNCMEC the power to make reports directly to state and local law \nenforcement officials instead of only through the FBI and other \nagencies. Finally, it provides that reports to NCMEC by Internet \nService Providers may include additional information, such as the \nidentity of a subscriber who sent a message containing child \npornography, in addition to the required reporting of the contents of \nsuch a communication.\n  I applaud the ongoing work of the Center and hope both the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives will promptly pass this bill to provide \nmore Federal support for the NCMEC to continue to find missing children \nand protect exploited children across the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 3147. A bill to foster local collaborations which will ensure that \nresources are effectively and efficiently used within the criminal and \njuvenile justice systems; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Leahy, \nGrassley, Cantwell, Domenici, and Brownback, to introduce the \n``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act.'' This \nbipartisan measure would, among other things, create a program of \nplanning and implementation grants for communities so they may offer \nmore treatment and other services to mentally ill offenders. Under this \nbill, programs receiving grant funds would be operated collaboratively \nby both a criminal justice agency and a mental health agency.\n  The mentally ill population poses a particularly difficult challenge \nfor our criminal justice system. People afflicted with mental illness \nare incarcerated at significantly higher rates than the general \npopulation. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, while only \nabout five percent of the American population has a mental illness, \nabout 16 percent of the State prison population has such an illness. \nThe Los Angeles County Jail, for example, typically has more mentally \nill inmates than any hospital in the country.\n  Unfortunately, however, the reality of our criminal justice system is \nthat jails and prisons do not provide a therapeutic environment for the \nmentally ill and are unlikely to do so any time soon. Indeed, the \nmentally ill inmate often is preyed upon by other inmates or becomes \neven sicker in jail. Once released from jail or prison, many mentally \nill people end up on the streets. With limited personal resources and \nlittle or no ability to handle their illness alone, they often commit \nfurther offenses resulting in their re-arrest and re-incarceration. \nThis ``revolving door'' is costly and disruptive for all involved.\n  Although these problems tend to manifest themselves primarily within \nthe prison system, the root cause of our current situation is found in \nthe mental health system and its failure to provide sufficient \ncommunity-based treatment solutions. Accordingly, the solution will \nnecessarily involve collaboration between the mental health\n\n[[Page S10712]]\n\nsystem and criminal justice system. In fact, it also will require \ngreater collaboration between the substance abuse treatment and mental \nhealth treatment communities, because many mentally ill offenders have \na drug or alcohol problem in addition to their mental illness.\n  The purpose of the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime \nReduction Act'' is to foster exactly this type of collaboration at the \nfederal, state, and local levels. The bill provides incentives for the \ncriminal justice, juvenile justice, mental health, and substance abuse \ntreatment systems to work together at each level of government to \nestablish a network of services for offenders with mental illness. The \nbill's approach is unique, in that it not only would promote public \nsafety by helping curb the incidence of repeat offenders, but it also \nwould promote public health, by ensuring that those with a serious \nmental illness are treated as soon as possible and as efficiently and \neffectively as possible.\n  Among its major provisions, this legislation calls for the \nestablishment of a new competitive grant program, which would be housed \nat the U.S. Department of Justice, but administered by the Attorney \nGeneral with the active involvement of the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. To ensure that collaboration occurs at the local level, \nthe bill requires that two entities jointly submit a single grant \napplication on behalf of a community.\n  Applications demonstrating the greatest commitment to collaboration \nwould receive priority for grant funds. If applicants can show that \ngrant funds would be used to promote public health, as well as public \nsafety, and if the program they propose would have the active \nparticipation of each joint applicant, and if their grant application \nhas the support of both the Attorney General and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, then it would receive priority for funding.\n  The bill permits grant funds to be used for a variety of purposes, \neach of which embodies the goal of collaboration. First, grant funds \nmay be used to provide courts with more options, such as specialized \ndockets, for dealing with the non-violent offender who has a serious \nmental illness or a co-occurring mental illness and drug or alcohol \nproblem. Second, grant funds could be used to enhance training of \nmental health and criminal justice system personnel, who must know how \nto deal appropriately with the mentally ill offender. Third, grant \nfunds could be devoted to programs that divert non-violent offenders \nwith severe and persistent mental illness from the criminal justice \nsystem into treatment. Finally, correctional facilities may use grant \nfunds to promote the treatment of inmates and ease their transition \nback into the community upon release from jail or prison.\n  In specifically authorizing grant funds to be used to promote more \noptions for courts to deal with mentally ill offenders, this bill \nbuilds on legislation that I introduced with Congressman Ted Strickland \ntwo years ago. That measure, which became law, authorized $10 million \nper year for the establishment of more mental health courts. I have \nlong supported mental health courts, which enable the criminal justice \nsystem to provide an individualized treatment solution for a mentally \nill offender, while also requiring accountability of the offender. The \nlegislation we are introducing today would make possible the creation \nor expansion of more mental health courts, and it also would promote \nthe funding of treatment services that support such courts.\n  In addition to making planning and implementation grants available to \ncommunities, the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction \nAct'' also calls for an Interagency Task Force to be established at the \nfederal level. This Task Force would include the Attorney General and \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, as well as the Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of \nEducation, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Commissioner of \nSocial Security. The Task Force would be charged with identifying new \nways that federal departments can work together to reduce recidivism \namong mentally ill adults and juveniles.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Attorney General and Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to develop a list of ``best practices'' for \ncriminal justice personnel to use when diverting mentally ill offenders \nfrom the criminal justice system.\n  This is a good bill and one that is long overdue. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this important measure. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3147\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mentally Ill Offender \n     Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, over 16 \n     percent of adults incarcerated in United States jails and \n     prisons have a mental illness.\n       (2) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention, over 20 percent of youth in the \n     juvenile justice system have serious mental health problems, \n     and many more have co-occurring mental health and substance \n     abuse disorders.\n       (3) According to the National Alliance for the Mentally \n     Ill, up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a serious \n     mental illness will come into contact with the American \n     criminal justice system at some point in their lives.\n       (4) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention, over 150,000 juveniles who come into \n     contact with the juvenile justice system each year meet the \n     diagnostic criteria for at least 1 mental or emotional \n     disorder.\n       (5) A significant proportion of adults with a serious \n     mental illness who are involved with the criminal justice \n     system are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness; and \n     many of these individuals are arrested and jailed for minor, \n     nonviolent offenses.\n       (6) The majority of individuals with a mental illness or \n     emotional disorder who are involved in the criminal or \n     juvenile justice systems are responsive to medical and \n     psychological interventions that integrate treatment, \n     rehabilitation, and support services.\n       (7) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, as of \n     July 1999, 75 percent of mentally ill inmates had previously \n     been sentenced at least once to time in prison or jail or \n     probation.\n       (8) Collaborative programs between mental health, substance \n     abuse, and criminal or juvenile justice systems that ensure \n     the provision of services for those with mental illness or \n     co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders can \n     reduce the number of such individuals in adult and juvenile \n     corrections facilities, while providing improved public \n     safety.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to increase public safety by \n     facilitating collaboration among the criminal justice, \n     juvenile justice, mental health treatment, and substance \n     abuse systems. Such collaboration is needed to--\n       (1) reduce rearrests among adult and juvenile offenders \n     with mental illness, or co-occurring mental illness and \n     substance abuse disorders;\n       (2) provide courts, including existing and new mental \n     health courts, with appropriate mental health and substance \n     abuse treatment options;\n       (3) maximize the use of alternatives to prosecution through \n     diversion in appropriate cases involving non-violent \n     offenders with mental illness;\n       (4) promote adequate training for criminal justice system \n     personnel about mental illness and substance abuse disorders \n     and the appropriate response to people with such illnesses;\n       (5) promote adequate training for mental health treatment \n     personnel about criminal offenders with mental illness and \n     the appropriate response to such offenders in the criminal \n     justice system; and\n       (6) promote communication between criminal justice or \n     juvenile justice personnel, mental health treatment \n     personnel, nonviolent offenders with mental illness, and \n     other support services such as housing, job placement, \n     community, and faith-based organizations.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Adult and juvenile collaboration programs.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have joined today with Senators DeWine, \nCantwell, Brownback, and Grassley to introduce legislation that will \nhelp State and local governments reduce crime by providing more \neffective treatment for the mentally ill. All too often, people with \nmental illness rotate repeatedly between the criminal justice system \nand the streets of our communities, committing a series of minor \noffenses. Their crimes occupy the ever scarcer time of law enforcement \nofficers, diverting them from their more urgent responsibilities, and \nleave the offenders themselves in prisons or jails where little or no \nmedical care is available for them. With this legislation, we are \ntrying to give State and local governments the tools they need to break \nthis cycle, for the good of law enforcement, corrections officers, our \npublic safety, and mentally ill offenders.\n  I held a Judiciary Committee hearing in June on the criminal justice \nsystem and mentally ill offenders. At that hearing, we heard from State \nmental health officials, law enforcement officers, corrections \nofficials, and the representative of counties around our Nation. All \nagreed that people with untreated mental illness are more likely to \ncommit crimes, and that our State mental health systems, prisons and \njails do not have the resources they need to treat the mentally ill, \nand prevent crime and recidivism. As this legislation's findings \ndetail, 16 percent of adults incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons \nhave a mental illness, more than 20 percent of youth in the juvenile \njustice system have serious mental health problems, and up to 40 \npercent of adults who suffer from a serious mental illness will come \ninto contact with the American criminal justice system at some point in \ntheir lives. This is a serious problem that has not received the \nlegislative or public attention it deserves.\n  Under this bill, State and local governments can apply for funding \nto: a. create or expand mental health courts, which divert qualified \noffenders from prison to receive treatment; b. create or expand \nprograms to provide specialized training for criminal justice and \nmental health system personnel; c. create or expand local treatment \nprograms that serve individuals with mental illness or co-occurring \nmental illness and substance abuse disorders; and d. promote and \nprovide mental health treatment for those incarcerated in or released \nfrom and penal or correctional institution. This new program authorizes \n$100 million for each of the next two fiscal years, and such sums as \nnecessary through fiscal year 2007.\n\n[[Page S10715]]\n\n  I would like to thank a number of people for their advice and \ninvolvement in this legislation. First, we would not be here today \nwithout the hard work of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. I \nknow that the Bazelon Center has additional ideas to improve this \nlegislation, and I look forward to working with the Center as this bill \nmoves through the legislative process. For example, I think we need to \ndo more to ensure close coordination between the Department of Justice \nand the Department of Health and Human Services in designing and making \nthese grants. Through this legislation, we are forcing States to bring \ntogether their health and law enforcement officials to make grant \nrequests it only makes sense to have the joint perspectives of DOJ and \nHHS fully involved in evaluating those requests. This is an issue that \nwe will continue to work on, and I hope we will continue to receive the \ninput of the Bazelon Center as we do so.\n  Second, we have received great advice and support from officials in \nmy State of Vermont. Susan Besio, the commissioner of Vermont's \nDepartment of Developmental and Mental Health Services, and John \nGorczyk, the commissioner of Vermont's Department of Corrections, \nreviewed this legislation and offered their comments, which have been \nadopted in the version that we introduce today. Gary Margolis, the \nChief of Police Services at the University of Vermont, testified at our \nJune hearing and helped me understand the importance of this issue for \nlaw enforcement officers in Vermont and around the nation.\n  Third, the Council of State Governments has also provided invaluable \nassistance and advice on this issue. Indeed, their report on mentally \nill offenders and the criminal justice system was instrumental in \nfocusing the attention of the Judiciary Committee on this important \ntopic.\n  Although I am pleased that we have introduced this bill before the \nend of this Congress, I think we all understand that the passage of \nmeaningful mental health legislation may have to wait until the next \nCongress. I want to work with all of the officials and groups I have \nmentioned, the other sponsors of this legislation, and any other \ninterested parties, to continue to make improvements to this bill. This \nis a topic that should be a priority for the Judiciary Committee next \nyear, and I will work to make it so.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I'm pleased today to be introducing with \nSenators DeWine, Leahy, Brownback, and Cantwell the Mentally Ill \nOffender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2002. This bipartisan \nbill authorizes the Attorney General to administer a grant program to \nassist communities in planning and implementing services for mentally \nill offenders. These grants will increase public safety by fostering \ncollaborative efforts by criminal justice, mental health, and substance \nabuse agencies. I've seen these types of collaborative programs work in \nIowa and I know that they can work elsewhere.\n  We have an obligation to ensure that the public is protected from \nthese offenders who suffer from mental illness. The Bureau of Justice \nStatistics has reported that over 16 percent of adults incarcerated in \nU.S. jails and prisons have a mental illness. In addition, the Office \nof Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has reported that over \n20 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental \nproblems. This grant program will help increase public safety, as well \nas reduce the number of mentally ill adults and juveniles incarcerated \nin correctional facilities.\n  These grant dollars may be used by States and localities to establish \nmental health courts or other diversion programs, create or expand \ncommunity-based treatment programs, provide in-jail treatment and \ntransitional services, and for training of criminal justice and mental \nhealth system employees. The State of Iowa and a number of its counties \nare already leading the way in finding creative and collaborative \nprograms to address the problems presented by these mentally ill \ncriminals. Working together, the criminal justice, mental health, and \nsubstance abuse professionals can make a difference in the lives of \nthis special class of offenders and also increase the safety of the \npublic.\n  I want to thank Senator DeWine for his leadership on this important \nissue. He has drafted a bill that reflects a common sense approach to a \nserious public safety issue. I also want to encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this important piece of legislation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator DeWine \nand Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy along with Senators Grassley and \nBrownback in cosponsoring this important legislation. This bill will \ntake steps to reduce the prevalence of mentally ill individuals in the \ncriminal justice system by providing more effective treatment. Forty \npercent of the mentally ill in this country come in contact with the \ncriminal justice system, many for minor but repeated offenses. This \nwastes tremendous law enforcement resources that can be better focused \non more urgent responsibilities and results in many of the mentally ill \nsitting in jail cells with little treatment available to them. My State \nhas already taken some forward looking action in this area, and this \nlegislation is an important next step.\n  The Mentally Ill Crime Reduction Act of 2002 funds new grants that \nwill give States the tools they need to work collaboratively to break \nthe cycle of mentally ill people repeatedly moving through the \ncorrections system. This legislation will allow more jurisdictions to \nfollow Seattle's lead in creating mental health courts that monitor \nindividuals to keep them in treatment and out of jail. It will provide \nmuch needed funding to mental health and substance abuse programs, and \nit will provide critical dollars for treatment of those incarcerated \nin, or released from, prisons. The legislation has the support of \nWashington State Corrections Director Joe Lehman and the Washington \nDepartment of Social and Health Services as well as the National \nAlliance for the Mentally Ill and the Council of State Governments. I'd \nlike to especially thank the Bazelon Center for their work in this area \nand their commitment to improving this situation.\n  Earlier this year, the Council on State Governments Criminal Justice/\nMental Health Consensus Project issued a report that detailed the \ndisparate proportions of the mentally ill in the criminal justice \nsystem. The Project found that while those suffering from serious \nmental illness represent approximately 5 percent of the population of \nthis country, they represent over 16 percent of the prison population. \nOf that 16 percent, nearly three-quarters also have a substance abuse \nproblem, and nearly half were incarcerated for committing a nonviolent \ncrime. In some jurisdictions recidivism rates for mentally ill inmates \ncan reach over 70 percent. Police, judges and prosecutors are usually \nwithout options of what to do with mentally ill patients given the lack \nof health services, and thus many end up in jail for minor crimes. The \nLos Angeles County Jail alone holds as many as 3,300 individuals with \nmental illness, more than any state hospital or mental health \ninstitution in the United States.\n  Each time a mentally ill individual is incarcerated, his or her \nmental condition will likely worsen. Once incarcerated, people with \nmental illness are particularly susceptible to harming themselves or \nothers. This environment exacerbates their mental illness, yet access \nto effective counseling or medication is severely limited. This in turn \nbrings on depression or delusions that immobilize them; many have spent \nyears trying to mask torments or hallucinations with alcohol or drugs \nwhich leads to these individuals, on average, spending more time in \nprisons.\n  This problem is particularly acute in the area of juvenile offenders. \nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention reports that \nover 20 percent of children in the juvenile justice system, over \n155,000, have serious mental health problems. This bill creates \nspecialized training programs for juvenile and criminal justice agency \npersonnel in identifying symptoms of mentally ill individuals that will \nhelp identify and treat juveniles at an earlier stage.\n  The prevalence of people with mental illness in the criminal justice \nsystem comes at a high price to taxpayers. In King County, WA officials \nidentified 20 people who had been repeatedly hospitalized, jailed or \nadmitted to detoxification centers. These emergency\n\n[[Page S10716]]\n\nservices cost the county approximately $1.1 million in a single year. \nIn contrast, an Illinois Cooperative Program, which brought criminal \njustice and mental health service personnel together to provide \nservices to those mentally ill patients released from jail, calculated \nthat the 30 individuals in the study spent approximately 2,200 days \nless in jail, and 2,100 fewer days, in hospitals than they had the \nprevious year for a savings of $1.2 million dollars.\n  In 1997, Seattle Fire Department Captain Stanley Stevenson was \nmurdered by an individual who had been found incompetent by the local \nmunicipal court but was released because of the lack of alternative \noptions. This murder was the impetus for the creation of a Task Force \nthat led directly to the formation of the Seattle mental health court \nin 1999. The primary reason why this Court has been growing more \neffective in dealing with mentally ill offenders is that it has \nincreased cooperation between the mental health and criminal justice \nsystems, operations that have traditionally not worked closely \ntogether. Building on the model of the drug court, the mental health \ncourt closely monitors compliance with treatment regimens through a \nteam proficient in dealing with the mentally ill and at using the stick \nof the criminal justice system to make that treatment work. The vast \nmajority of these individuals are responsive to treatment.\n  This program has progressed well and is becoming an effective means \nof helping mentally ill offenders, assuring public safety, and running \na more cost efficient system. Yet to allow this system to continue to \nexpand in Seattle and other communities in Washington state, as well as \nto allow other states to begin using these types of programs, federal \ngrant funding is critical. That is what this bill provides.\n  Collaboration between mental health, substance abuse, law \nenforcement, judicial, and other criminal justice personnel is also \ncritical to the success of our mental health court program in Seattle. \nIt is only through full coordination between the criminal justice and \nthe mental health treatment community at the federal and the local \nlevel that these efforts will be successful.\n  Similarly, only through full coordination at the federal and local \nlevel will this bill be able to make a critical difference. I believe \nthat some additional improvements can be made to strengthen that \ncritical coordination and I look forward to working with Senator DeWine \nand Chairman Leahy to accomplish that goal. I welcome the introduction \nof this legislation and look forward to working with my cosponsors to \nmake this bill law in the next Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 3148. A bill to provide incentives to increase research by private \nsector entities to develop antivirals, antibiotics and other drugs, \nvaccines, microbicides, and diagnostic technologies to prevent and \ntreat illnesses associated with a biological, chemical, or radiological \nweapons attack; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, America has a major flaw in its \ndefenses against bioterrorism. Hearings I chaired in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee on bioterrorism demonstrated that America has not \nmade a national commitment to research and development of treatments \nand cures for those who might be exposed to or infected by a biological \nagent, chemical toxin, or radiological material. Correcting this \ncritical gap is the purpose of legislation we are introducing today. \nThis legislation is a refined and upgraded version of legislation I \nintroduced last year (S. 1764, December 4, 2001) and I am delighted \nthat Senator Hatch has joined me as the lead cosponsor of the new bill.\n  Obviously, our first priority must be to attempt to prevent the use \nof these agents and toxins by terrorists, quickly assess when an attack \nhas occurred, take appropriate public health steps to contain the \nexposure, stop the spread of contagion, and then detoxify the site. \nThese are all critical functions, but in the end we must recognize that \nsome individuals may be exposed or infected. Then the critical issue is \nwhether we can treat and cure them and prevent death and disability.\n  In short, we need a diversified portfolio of medicines. In cases \nwhere we have ample advance warning of an attack and specific \ninformation about the agent, toxin, or material, we may be able to \nvaccinate the vulnerable population in advance. In other cases, even if \nwe have a vaccine, we might well prefer to use medicines that would \nquickly stop the progression of the disease or the toxic effects. We \nalso need a powerful capacity quickly to develop new countermeasures \nwhere we face a new agent, toxin, or material.\n  Unfortunately, we are woefully short of vaccines and medicines to \ntreat individuals who are exposed or infected. We have antibiotics that \nseem to work for most of those infected in the current anthrax attack, \nbut these have not prevented five deaths. We have no effective vaccines \nor medicines for most other biological agents and chemical toxins we \nmight confront. We have very limited capacity to respond medically to a \nradiological attack. In some cases we have vaccines to prevent, but no \nmedicines to treat, an agent. We have limited capacity to speed the \ndevelopment of vaccines and medicines to prevent or treat novel agents \nand toxins not currently known to us.\n  We have provided, and should continue to provide, direct Federal \nfunding for research and development of new medicines, however, this \nfunding is unlikely to be sufficient. Even with ample Federal funding, \nmany private companies will be reluctant to enter into agreements with \ngovernment agencies to conduct this research. Other companies would be \nwilling to conduct the research with their own capital and at their own \nrisk but are not able to secure the funding from investors.\n  The legislation we introduce today would provide incentives for \nprivate biotechnology companies to form capital to develop \ncountermeasures--medicines--to prevent, treat and cure victims of \nbioterror, chemical and radiological attacks. This will enable this \nindustry to become a vital part of the national defense infrastructure \nand do so for business reasons that make sense for their investors on \nthe bottom line.\n  Enactment of these incentives is necessary because most biotech \ncompanies have no approved products or revenue from product sales to \nfund research. They rely on investors and equity capital markets to \nfund the research. They must necessarily focus on research that will \nlead to product sales and revenue and, thus, to an end to their \ndependence on investor capital. There is no established or predictable \nmarket for countermeasures. These concerns are shared by pharmaceutical \nfirms. Investors are justifiably reluctant to fund this research, which \nwill present challenges similar in complexity to AIDS. Investors need \nassurances that research on countermeasures has the potential to \nprovide a rate of return commensurate with the risk, complexity and \ncost of the research, a rate of return comparable to that which may \narise from a treatment for cancer, MS, Cystic Fibrosis and other major \ndiseases.\n  It is in our national interest to enlist these companies in the \ndevelopment of countermeasures as biotech companies tend to be \ninnovative and nimble and intently focused on the intractable diseases \nfor which no effective medical treatments are available.\n  The incentives we have proposed are innovative and some may be \ncontroversial. We invite everyone who has an interest and a stake in \nthis research to enter into a dialogue about the issue and about the \nnature and terms of the appropriate incentives. We have attempted to \nanticipate the many complicated technical and policy issues that this \nlegislation raises. The key focus of our debate should be how, not \nwhether, we address this critical gap in our public health \ninfrastructure and the role that the private sector should play. \nMillions of Americans will be at risk if we fail to enact legislation \nto meet this need.\n\n\n         relationship to bioterrorism preparedness legislation\n\n  My proposal is complimentary to legislation on bioterrorism \npreparedness we enacted earlier this year. That law, Bioweapons \nPreparedness Act, focuses on many needed improvements in our public \nhealth infrastructure. These investments provide the infrastructure\n\n[[Page S10717]]\n\nwhere we could deploy the countermeasures that could be developed \npursuant to the incentives proposed in my legislation.\n  Among the provisions in the Frist-Kennedy law are initiatives \nregarding bioterrorism preparedness capacities, improvements in \ncommunications about bioterrorism, protection of children, protection \nof food safety, and global pathogen surveillance and response. We need \nto fully fund these new programs and capacities.\n  My legislation builds on these provisions by providing incentives to \nenable the biotechnology industry acting on its own initiative to fund \nand conduct research on countermeasures. It includes tax, procurement, \nintellectual property and liability incentives. Accordingly, my \nproposal raises issues falling within the jurisdiction of the HELP, \nFinance, and Judiciary Committees.\n  The Frist-Kennedy law and my bill are complimentary. The bottom line \nis that we need both bills--one focusing on public health and one \nfocusing on medical research. Without medical research, public health \nworkers will not have the single most important tool to use in an \nattack--medicine to prevent death and disability and medicine that will \nhelp us avoid public panic.\n\n\n                       Cipro as a Countermeasure\n\n  We are fortunate that we have broad-spectrum antibiotics, including \nCipro, to treat the type of anthrax to which so many have been exposed. \nThis treatment seems to be effective before the anthrax symptoms become \nmanifest, and effective to treat cutaneous anthrax, and we have been \nable to effectively treat some individuals who have inhalation anthrax. \nI am thankful that this drug exists to treat those who have been \nexposed, including my own Senate staff. Our offices are immediately \nabove those of Senator Daschle.\n  We have seen how reassuring it is that we have an effective treatment \nfor this biological agent. We see long lines of Congressional staffers \nand postal workers awaiting their Cipro. Think what it would be like if \nwe could only say, ``We have nothing to treat you and hope you don't \ncontract the disease.'' Think of the public panic that we might see.\n  I am grateful that this product exists and proud of the fact that the \nBayer Company is based in Connecticut. The last thing we should be \ndoing is criticizing this company for their research success. The \ncompany has dispensed millions of dollars worth of Cipro free of \ncharge. Criticizing it for the price that it charges tells other \nresearch companies that the more valuable their products are in \nprotecting the public health, the more likely they are to be criticized \nand bullied.\n  It is fortuitous that Cipro seems to be effective against anthrax. \nThe product was not developed with this use in mind. My point with this \nlegislation is we cannot rely on good fortune and chance in the \ndevelopment of countermeasures. We need to make sure that these \ncountermeasures will be developed. We need more companies like Bayer, \nwe need them focused specifically on developing medicines to deal with \nthe new bioterror threat, and we need to tell them that there are good \nbusiness reasons for this focus.\n  We also are fortunate to have an FDA-licensed vaccine, made by \nBioPort Corporation, that is recommended by our country's medical \nexperts at the DOD and CDC for pre-anthrax exposure vaccination of \nindividuals in the military and some individuals in certain laboratory \nand other occupational settings where there is a high risk of exposure \nto anthrax. This vaccine is also recommended for use with Cipro after \nexposure to anthrax to give optimal and long-lasting protection. That \nvaccine is not now available for use. We must do everything necessary \nto make this and other vaccines available in adequate quantities to \nprotect against future attacks.\n  The point of this legislation is that we need many more Cipro-like \nand anthrax vaccine-like products. That we have these products is the \ngood news; that we have so few others is the problem.\n\n\n                     Biological Weapons Convention\n\n  One unfortunate truth in this debate is that we cannot rely upon \ninternational legal norms and treaties alone to protect our citizens \nfrom the threat of biological or chemical attack.\n  The United States ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons \nConvention (BWC) on January 22, 1975. That Convention now counts 144 \nnations as parties. Twenty-two years later, on April 24, 1997, the \nUnited States Senate joined 74 other countries when it ratified the \nChemical Weapons Convention (CWC). While these Conventions serve \nimportant purposes, they do not in any way guarantee our safety in a \nworld with rogue states and terrorist organizations.\n  The effectiveness of both Conventions is constrained by the fact that \nmany countries have failed to sign on to either of them. Furthermore, \ntwo signatories of the BWC, Iran and Iraq, are among the seven \ngovernments that the Secretary of State has designated as state \nsponsors of international terrorism, and we know for a fact that they \nhave both pursued clandestine biological weapons programs. The BWC, \nunlike the CWC, has no teeth--it does not include any provisions for \nverification or enforcement. Since we clearly cannot assume that any \ncountry that signs on to the Convention does so in good faith, the \nConvention does so in good faith, the Convention's protective value is \nlimited.\n  On November 1 of 2001, the President announced his intent to \nstrengthen the BWC as part of his comprehensive strategy for combating \nterrorism. A BWC review conference, held every five years to consider \nways of improving the Convention's effectiveness, will convene in \nGeneva beginning November 19. In anticipation of that meeting, the \nPresident has urged that all parties to the Convention enact strict \nnational criminal legislation to crack down on prohibited biological \nweapons activities, and he has called for an effective United Nations \nprocedures for investigation suspicious outbreaks of disease or \nallegations of biological weapons use.\n  These steps are welcomed, but they are small. Even sweeping reforms, \nlike creating a more stringent verification and enforcement regime, \nwould not guarantee our safety. The robust verification and enforcement \nmechanisms in the CWC, for instance, have proven to be imperfect, and \nscientists agree that it is much easier to conceal the production of \nbiological agents than chemical weapons.\n  The inescapable fact, therefore, is that we cannot count on \ninternational regimes to prevent those who wish us ill from acquiring \nbiological and chemical weapons. We must be prepared for the reality \nthat these weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists, and could \nbe used against Americans on American soil. And we must be prepared to \ntreat the victims of such an attack if it were ever to occur.\n\n\n                          CDC Quarantine Plans\n\n  On November 26 of last year, the Centers for Disease Control issued \nits interim working draft plan for responding to an outbreak of \nsmallpox. The plan does not call for mass vaccination in advance of a \nsmallpox outbreak because the risk of side effects from the vaccine \noutweighs the risks of someone actually being exposed to the smallpox \nvirus. At the heart of the plan is a strategy sometimes called ``search \nand containment.''\n  This strategy involves identifying infected individual or individuals \nwith confirmed smallpox, identifying and locating those people who come \nin contact with that person, and vaccinating those people in outward \nrings of contact. The goal is to produce a buffer of immune individuals \nand was shown to prevent smallpox and to ultimately eradicate the \noutbreak. Priorities would be set on who is vaccinated, perhaps \nfocusing on the outward rings before those at the center of the \noutbreak. The plan assumes that the smallpox vaccination is effective \nfor persons who have been exposed to the disease as long as the disease \nhas not taken hold.\n  In practice it may be necessary to set a wide perimeter for these \nareas because smallpox is highly contagious before it might be \ndiagnosed. There may be many areas subject to search and containment \nbecause people in our society travel frequently and widely. Terrorists \nmight trigger attacks in a wide range of locations to multiply the \nconfusion and panic. The most common form of smallpox has a 30 percent \nmortality rate, but terrorists might be able to obtain supplies of \n``flat-type'' smallpox with a mortality rate of 96 percent\n\n[[Page S10718]]\n\nand hemorrhagic-type smallpox, which is almost always fatal. For these \nreasons, the CDC plan accepts the possibility that whole cities or \nother geographic areas could be cordoned off, letting no one in or \nout--a quarantine enforced by police or troops.\n  The plan focuses on enforcement authority through police or National \nGuard, isolation and quarantine, mandatory medical examinations, and \nrationing of medicines. It includes a discussion of ``population-wide \nquarantine measures which restrict activities or limit movement of \nindividuals [including] suspension of large public gatherings, closing \nof public places, restriction on travel [air, rail, water, motor \nvehicle, and pedestrian], and/or `cordon sanitaire' [literally a \n`sanitary cord' or line around a quarantined area guarded to prevent \nspread of disease by restricting passage into or out of the area].'' \nThe CDC recommends that states update their laws to provide authority \nfor ``enforcing quarantine measures'' and it recommends that States in \n``pre-event planning'' identify personnel who can enforce these \nisolation and quarantine measures, if necessary.'' Guide C--Isolation \nand Quarantine, page 17.\n  On October 23, 2001, the CDC published a ``Model State Emergency \nHealth Powers Act.'' It was prepared by the Center for Law and the \nPublic's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities, in \nconjunction with the National Governors Association, National \nConference of State Legislatures, Association of State and Territorial \nHealth Officials, National Association of City and County Health \nOfficers, and National Association of Attorneys General. A copy of the \nmodel law is printed at www.publichealthlaw.net. The law would provide \npowers to enforce the ``compulsory physical separation (including the \nrestriction of movement and confinement) of individuals and/or groups \nbelieved to have been exposed to or known to have been infected with a \ncontagious disease from individuals who are believed not to have been \nexposed or infected, in order to prevent or limit the transmission of \nthe disease to others.'' Federal law on this subject is very strong and \nthe Administration can always rely on the President's Constitution \nauthority as Commander in Chief.\n  Let us try to imagine, however, what it would be like if a quarantine \nis imposed. Let us assume that there is not enough smallpox vaccine \navailable for use in a large outbreak, that the priority is to \nvaccinate those in the outward rings of the containment area first, \nthat the available vaccines cannot be quickly deployed inside the \nquarantined area, that it is not possible to quickly trace and identify \nall of the individuals who might have been exposed, and/or that public \nhealth workers themselves might be infected. We know that there is no \nmedicine to treat those who do become infected. We know the mortality \nrates. It is not hard to imagine how much force might be necessary to \nenforce the quarantine. It would be quite unacceptable to permit \nindividuals to leave the quarantined area no matter how much panic had \ntaken hold.\n  Think about how different this scenario would be if we had medicines \nthat could effectively treat and cure those who become infected by \nsmallpox. We still might implement the CDC plan but a major element of \nthe strategy would be to persuade people to visit their local clinic or \nhospital to be dispensed their supply of medicine. We could trust that \nthere would be a very high degree of voluntary compliance. This would \ngive us more time, give us options if the containment is not \nsuccessful, give us options to treat those in the containment area who \nare infected, and enable us to quell the public panic.\n  Because we have no medicine to treat those infected by smallpox, we \nhave to be prepared to implement a plan like the one CDC has proposed. \nTheirs is the only option because our options are so limited. We need \nto expand our range of options.\n\n\n                    the countermeasure research gap\n\n  We should not be lulled by the apparent successes with Cipro and the \nstrains of anthrax we have seen in the recent attacks. We have not been \nable to prevent death in some of the patients with late-stage \ninhalation anthrax and Robert Stevens, Thomas Morris, Jr., Joseph \nCurseen, Kathy Nguyen, and Ottilie Lundgren died. This legislation is \nnamed in honor of them. What we needed for them, and did not have, is a \ndrug or vaccine that would treat late stage inhalation anthrax.\n  As I have said, we need an effective treatment for those who become \ninfected with smallpox. We have a vaccine that effectively prevents \nsmallpox infection, and administering this vaccine within four days of \nfirst exposure has been shown to offer some protections against \nacquiring infection and significant protection against a fatal outcome. \nThe problem is that administering the vaccine in this time frame to all \nthose who might have been exposed may be exceedingly difficult. And \nonce infection has occurred, we have no effective treatment options.\n  In the last century 500 million people have died of smallpox--more \nthan have from any other infectious disease--as compared to 320 million \ndeaths in all the wars of the twentieth century. Smallpox was one of \nthe diseases that nearly wiped out the entire Native American \npopulation in this hemisphere. The last naturally acquired case of \nsmallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977 and the last case from laboratory \nexposure was in 1978.\n  Smallpox is a nasty pathogen, carried in microscopic airborne \ndroplets inhaled by its victims. The first signs are headache, fever, \nnausea and backache, sometimes convulsions and delirium. Soon, the skin \nturns scarlet. When the fever lets up, the telltale rash appears--flat \nred spots that turn into pimples, then big yellow pustules, then scabs. \nSmallpox also affects the throat and eyes, and inflames the heart, \nlungs, liver, intestines and other internal organs. Death often came \nfrom internal bleeding, or from the organs simply being overwhelmed by \nthe virus. Survivors were left covered with pockmarks--if they were \nlucky. The unlucky ones were left blind, their eyes permanently clouded \nover. Nearly one in four victims died. The infection rate is estimated \nto be 25-40 percent for those who are unvaccinated and a single case \ncan cause 20 or more additional infections.\n\n  During the 16th Century, 3.5 million Aztecs--more than half the \npopulation--died of smallpox during a two-year span after the Spanish \narmy brought the disease to Mexico. Two centuries later, the virus \nravaged George Washington's troops at Valley Forge. And it cut a deadly \npath through the Crow, Dakota, Sioux, Blackfoot, Apache, Comanche and \nother American Indian tribes, helping to clear the way for white \nsettlers to lay claim to the western plains. The epidemics began to \nsubside with one of medicine's most famous discoveries: the finding by \nBritish physician Edward Jenner in 1796 that English milkmaids who were \nexposed to cowpox, a mild second cousin to smallpox that afflicts \ncattle, seemed to be protected against the more deadly disease. \nJenner's work led to the development of the first vaccine in Western \nmedicine. While later vaccines used either a killed or inactivated form \nof the virus they were intended to combat, the smallpox vaccine worked \nin a different way. It relied on a separate, albeit related virus: \nfirst cowpox and the vacinnia, a virus of mysterious origins that is \nbelieved to be a cowpox derivative. The last American was vaccinated \nback in the 1970s and half of the US population has never been \nvaccinated. It is not known how long these vaccines provide protection, \nbut it is estimated that the term is 3-5 years.\n  In an elaborate smallpox biowarfare scenario enacted in February 1999 \nby the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilians Biodefense Studies, it was \nprojected that within two months 15,000 people had died, epidemics were \nout of control in fourteen countries, all supplies of smallpox vaccine \nwere depleted, the global economy was on the verge of collapse, and \nmilitary control and quarantines were in place. Within twelve months it \nwas projected that eighty million people worldwide had died.\n  A single case of smallpox today would become a global public health \nthreat and it has been estimated that a single smallpox bioterror \nattack on a single American city would necessitate the vaccination of \n30-40 million people.\n  The U.S. government is now in the process of purchasing substantial \nstocks of the smallpox vaccine. We\n\n[[Page S10719]]\n\nthen face a very difficult decision on deploying the vaccine. We know \nthat some individuals will have an adverse reaction to this vaccine. No \none in the United States has been vaccinated against smallpox in \ntwenty-five years. Those that were vaccinated back then may not be \nprotected against the disease today. If we had an effective treatment \nfor those who might become infected by smallpox, we would face much \nless pressure regarding deploying the vaccine. If we face a smallpox \nepidemic from a bioterrorism attack, we will have no Cipro to reassure \nthe public and we will be facing a highly contagious disease and \nepidemic. To be blunt, it will make the current anthrax attack look \nbenign by comparison.\n  Smallpox is not the only threat. We have seen other epidemics in this \ncentury. The 1918 influenza epidemic provides a sobering admonition \nabout the need for research to develop medicines. In two years, a fifth \nof the world's population was infected. In the United States the 1918 \nepidemic killed more than 650,000 people in a short period of time and \nleft 20 million seriously ill, one fourth of the entire population. The \naverage lifespan in the U.S. was depressed by ten years. In just one \nyear, the epidemic killed 21 million human beings worldwide--well over \ntwice the number of combat deaths in the whole of World War I. The flu \nwas exceptionally virulent to begin with and it then underwent several \nsudden and dramatic mutations in its structure. Such mutations can turn \nflu into a killer because its victims' immune systems have no \nantibodies to fight off the altered virus. Fatal pneumonia can rapidly \ndevelop.\n  Another deadly toxin, ricin toxin, was of interest to the al-Qaeda \nterrorist network. At an al-Qaeda safehouse in Saraq Panza, Kabul \nreporters found instructions for making ricin. The instructions make \nchilling reading. ``A certain amount, equal to a strong dose, will be \nable to kill an adult, and a dose equal to seven seeds will kill a \nchild,'' one page reads. Another page says: ``Gloves and face mask are \nessential for the preparation of ricin. Period of death varies from 3-5 \ndays minimum, 4-14 days maximum.'' The instructions listed the symptoms \nof ricin as vomiting, stomach cramps, extreme thirst, bloody diarrhoea, \nthroat irritation, respiratory collapse and death.\n  No specific treatment or vaccine for ricin toxin exists. Ricin is \nproduced easily and inexpensively, highly toxic, and stable in \naerosolized form. A large amount of ricin is necessary to infect whole \npopulations--the amount of ricin necessary to cover a 100-km\\2\\ area \nand cause 50 percent lethality, assuming aerosol toxicity of 3 mcg/kg \nand optimum dispersal conditions, is approximately 4 metric tons, \nwhereas only 1 kg of Bacillus anthracis is required. But it can be used \nto terrorize a large population with great effect because it is so \nlethal.\n  Use of ricin as a terror weapon is not theoretical. In 1991 in \nMinnesota, 4 members of the Patriots Council, an extremist group that \nheld antigovernmental and antitax ideals and advocated the overthrow of \nthe U.S. government, were arrested for plotting to kill a U.S. marshal \nwith ricin. The ricin was produced in a home laboratory. They planned \nto mix the ricin with the solvent dimethly sulfoxide (DMSO) and then \nsmear it on the door handles of the marshal's vehicle. The plan was \ndiscovered, and the 4 men were convicted. In 1995, a man entered Canada \nfrom Alaska on his way to North Carolina. Canadian custom officials \nstopped the man and found him in possession of several guns, $98,000, \nand a container of white powder, which was identified as ricin. In \n1997, a man shot his stepson in the face. Investigators discovered a \nmakeshift laboratory in his basement and found agents such as ricin and \nnicotine sulfate. And, ricin was used by the Bulgarian secret police \nwhen they killed Georgi Markov by stabbing him with a poison umbrella \nas he crossed Waterloo Bridge in 1978.\n  Going beyond smallpox, influenza, and ricin, we do not have an \neffective vaccine or treatment for dozens of other deadly and disabling \nagents and toxin. Here is a partial list of some of the other \nbiological agents and chemical toxins for which we have no effective \ntreatments: clostridium botulinum toxin (botulism), francisella \ntularensis (tularaemia), Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Marbug hemorrhagic \nfever, Lassa fever, Julin (Argentine hemorrhagic fever), Coxiella \nburnetti (Q fever), brucella species (brucellosis), burkholderia mallei \n(glanders), Venezuelan encephalomyelitis, eastern and western equine \nencephalomyelitis, epsilon toxin of clostridium perfringens, \nstaphylococcus entretoxin B, salmonella species, shigella dysenteriae, \nescherichia coli O157:H7, vibrio cholerae, cryptosporidium parvum, \nnipah virus, hantaviruses, tickborne hemorrhagic fever viruses, \ntickborne encephalitis virus, yellow fever, nerve agents (tabun, sarin, \nsoman, GF, and VX), blood agents (hydrogen cyanide and cyanogens \nchloride), blister agents (lewisite, nitrogenadn sulfur mustards, and \nphosgene oxime), heavy metals (arsenic, lead, and mercury), and \nvolatile toxins (benzene, chloroform, trihalomethanes), pulmonary \nagents (Phosgene, chlorine, vinly chloride), and incapacitating agents \n(BZ).\n\n  The naturally occurring forms of these agents and toxins are enough \nto cause concern, but we also know that during the 1980s and 1990s the \nSoviet Union conducted bioweapons research at forty-seven laboratories \nand testing sites, employed nearly fifty thousand scientists in the \nwork, and that they developed genetically modified versions of some of \nthese agents and toxins. The goal was to develop an agent or toxin that \nwas particularly virulent or not vulnerable to available antibiotic.\n  The United States has publicly stated that five countries are \ndeveloping biological weapons in violation of the Biological Weapons \nconvention, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya, and stated that \nadditional countries not yet named (possibly including Russia, China, \nIsrael, Sudan and Egypt) are also doing so as well.\n  What is so insidious about biological weapons is that in many cases \nthe symptoms resulting from a biological weapons attack would likely \ntake time to develop, so an act of bioterrorism may go undetected for \ndays or weeks. Affected individuals would seek medical attention not \nfrom special emergency response teams but in a variety of civilian \nsettings at scattered locations. This means we will need medicines that \ncan treat a late stage of the disease, long after the infection has \ntaken hold.\n  We must recognize that the distinctive characteristic of biological \nweapons is that they are living micro-organisms and are thus the only \nweapons that can continue to proliferate without further assistance one \nreleased in a suitable environment.\n  The lethality of these agents and toxins, and the panic they can \ncause, is quite frightening. The capacity for terror is nearly beyond \ncomprehension. We do not believe it is necessary to describe the facts \nhere. Our point is simple: we need more than military intelligence, \nsurveillance, and public health capacity. We also need effective \nmedicines. We also need more powerful research tools that will enable \nus to quickly develop treatments for agents and toxins not on this or \nany other list.\n  We need to do whatever it takes to be able to reassure the American \npeople that hospitals and doctors have powerful medicines to treat them \nif they are exposed to biological agents or toxins, that we can contain \nan outbreak of an infectious agent, and that there is little to fear. \nTo achieve this objective, we need to rely on the entrepreneurship of \nthe biotechnology industry.\n\n\n                 direct government funding of research\n\n  There is already some direct funding of research by the Defense \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Institutes of \nHealth (NIH), and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This research \nshould go forward.\n  DARPA, for instance, has been described as the Pentagon's ``venture \ncapital fund,'' its mission to provide seed money for novel research \nprojects that offer the potential for revolutionary findings. Last \nyear, DARPA's Unconventional pathogen Countermeasures program awarded \ncontracts totalling $50 million to universities, foundations, \npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking new ways to fight \nbiological agents and toxins.\n  The Unconventional Pathogen Countermeasures program now funds 43 \nseparate research efforts on anti-bacterials, anti-toxins, anti-virals, \ndecontamination, external protection\n\n[[Page S10720]]\n\nfrom pathogens, immunization and multi-purpose vaccines and treatments. \nA common thread among many of these undertakings is the goal of \ndeveloping drugs that provide broad-spectrum protection against several \ndifferent pathogents. This year, with a budget of $63 million, the \nprogram has received over 100 research proposals in the last two months \nalone.\n  Some of this DARPA research is directed at developing revolutionary, \nbroad-spectrum, medical countermeasures against significantly \npathogenic products. This goal is to develop countermeasures that are \nversatile enough to eliminate biological threats, whether from natural \nsources or modified through bioengineering or other manipulation. The \ncountermeasures would need the potential to provide protection both \nwithin the body and at the most common portals of entry (e.g., \ninhalation, ingestion, transcutaneous). The strategies might include \ndefeating the pathogen's ability to enter the body, traverse the \nbloodstream or lymphatics, and enter target tissues; identifying novel \npathogen vulnerabilities based on fundamental, critical molecular \nmechanisms of survival or pathogenesis (e.g., Type III secretion, \ncellular energetics, virulence modulation); constructing unique, robust \nvehicles for the delivery of countermeasures into or within the body; \nand modulating the advantageous and/or deleterious aspects of the \nimmune response to significantly pathogenic microorganisms and/or the \npathogenic products in the body.\n  While DAPRA's work is specifically aimed at protecting our military \npersonnell, the National Institutes of Health also spent $49.7 million \nin the last fiscal year to find new therapies for those who contract \nsmallpox and on systems for detecting the disease. In recent years, \nNIH's research programs have sought to create more rapid and accurate \ndiagnostics, develop vaccines for those at risk of exposure to \nbiological agents, and improve treatment for those infected. Moreover, \nin the last fiscal year, the Centers for Disease Control has allocated \n$18 million to continue research on an anthrax vaccine and $22.3 \nmillion on smallpox research.\n  Some companies are willing to enter into a research relationships \nfunded by DARPA and other agencies to develop countermeasures. \nRelationships between the government and private industry can be very \nproductive, but they can also involve complex issues reflecting the \ndifferent cultures of government and industry. Some companies--\nincluding some of the most enterpreneurial--might prefer to take their \nown initiative to conduct this research. Relationships with government \nentities involve risks, issues, and bureaucracy that are not present in \nrelationships among biotechnology companies and between them and non-\ngovernmental partners.\n  The Defense Departments Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program (JVAP) \nillustrates the problems with a government led and managed program. A \nreport in December 2000 by a panel of independent experts found that \nthe current program ``is insufficient and will fail'' and recommended \nit adopt an approach more on the model of a private sector effort. It \nneeds to adopt ``industry practices,'' ``capture industry interest,'' \n``implement an organizational alignment that mirrors the vaccine \nindustry's short chain of command and decision making,'' ``adopt an \nindustry-based management philosophy,'' and ``develop a sound \ninvestment strategy.'' It bemoaned the ``extremely limited'' input from \nindustry in the JVAP program.\n  It is clear from this experience that we should not rely exclusively \non government funding of countermeasures research. We should take \nadvantage of the entrepreneurial fervor, and the independence, of our \nbiotechnology industry entrepreneurs. It is not likely that the \ngovernment will be willing or able to provide sufficient funding for \nthe development of the countermeasures we need. Some of the most \ninnovative approaches to vaccines and medicines might not be funded \nwith the limited funds available to the government. We need to provide \nincentives that will encourage every biotech company to review its \nresearch priorities and technology portfolio for its relevance and \npotential for countermeasure research. Some of this research is early \nstage, basic research that is being developed and considered only for \nits value in treating an entirely different disease. We need to kindle \nthe imagination of biotechnology companies and their tens of thousands \nof scientists regarding countermeasure research.\n\n\n                  industry research on countermeasures\n\n  My proposal would supplement direct Federal government funding of \nresearch with incentives that make it possible for private companies to \nform the capital to conduct this research on their own initiative, \nutilizing their own capital, and at their own risk--all for good \nbusiness reasons going to their bottom line.\n  The U.S. biotechnology industry, approximately 1,300 companies, spent \n$13.8 billion on research last year. Only 350 of these companies have \nmanaged to go public. The industry employs 124,000 (Ernest & Young \ndata) people. The top five companies spent an average of $89,000 per \nemployee on research, making it the most research-intensive industry in \nthe world. The industry has 350 products in human clinical trials \ntargeting more than 200 diseases. Losses for the industry were $5.8 \nbillion in 2001, $5.6 billion in 2000, $4.4 billion in 1999, $4.1 \nbillion in 1998, $4.5 billion in 1997, $4.6 billion in 1996, and \nsimilar amounts before that. In 2000 fully 38 percent of the public \nbiotech companies had less than 2 years of funding for their research. \nOnly one quarter of the biotech companies in the United States are \npublicly traded and they tend to be the best funded.\n  There is a broad range of research that could be undertaken under \nthis legislation. Vaccines could be developed to prevent infection or \ntreat an infection from a bioterror attack. Broad-spectrum antibiotics \nare needed. Also, promising research has been undertaken on antitoxins \nthat could neutralize the toxins that are released, for example, by \nanthrax. With anthrax it is the toxins, not the bacteria itself, that \ncause death. An antitoxin could act like a decoy, attaching itself to \nsites on cells where active anthrax toxin binds and then combining with \nnormal active forms of the toxin and inactivating them. An antitoxin \ncould block the production of the toxin.\n  We can rely on the innovations of the biotech industry, working in \ncollaboration with academic medical centers, to explore a broad range \nof innovative approaches. This mobilizes the entire biotechnology \nindustry as a vital component of our national defense against bioterror \nweapons.\n\n\n                   incentives needed to spur research\n\n  The legislation takes a comprehensive approach to the challenges the \nbiotechnology industry faces in forming capital to conduct research on \ncountermeasures. It includes capital formation tax incentives, \nguaranteed purchase funds, patent protections, and liability \nprotections. We believe we will have to include each of these types of \nincentives to ensure that we mobilize the biotechnology industry for \nthis urgent national defense research.\n  Some of the tax incentives in this legislation, and both of the two \npatent incentives I have proposed, may be controversial. In our view, \nwe can debate tax or patent policy as long as you want, but let's not \nlose track of the issue here--development of countermeasures to treat \npeople infected or exposed to lethal and disabling bioterror weapons.\n  We know that incentives can spur research. In 1983 we enacted the \nOrphan Drug Act to provide incentives for companies to develop \ntreatments for rare diseases with small potential markets deemed to be \nunprofitable by the industry. In the decade before this legislation was \nenacted, fewer than 10 drugs for orphan diseases were developed and \nthese were mostly chance discoveries. Since the Act became law, 218 \norphan drugs have been approved and 800 more are in the pipeline. The \nAct provides 7 years of market exclusivity and a tax credit covering \nsome research costs. The effectiveness of the incentives we have \nenacted for orphan disease research show us how much we can accomplish \nwhen we set a national priority for certain types of research.\n  The incentives we have proposed differ from those set by the Orphan \nDrug Act. We need to maintain the effectiveness of the Orphan Drug Act \nand not undermine it by adding many other disease research targets. In \naddition, the tax credits for research for orphan drug research have no \nvalue for most biotechnology companies because few\n\n[[Page S10721]]\n\nof them have tax liability with respect to which to claim the credit. \nThis explains why we have not proposed to utilize tax credits to spur \ncountermeasures research. It is also clear that the market for \ncountermeasures is even more speculative than the market for orphan \ndrugs and we need to enact a broader and deeper package of incentives.\n\n\n        decision making on targets and registration of research\n\n  The government determines which research is covered by the \nlegislation and which companies qualify for the incentives for this \nresearch. No company is entitled to utilize the incentives until the \ngovernment certifies its eligibility.\n  These decisions are vested in the Secretary, Department of Homeland \nSecurity. In S. 1764, the decisions were vested in the White House \nOffice of Homeland Security, but it is now likely that a Department \nwill be created. I have strongly endorsed that concept and led the \neffort to enact the legislation forming the new Department.\n\n  The legislation confers on the Secretary, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Defense and Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nauthority to set the list of agents and toxins with respect to which \nthe legislation and incentives applies.\n  The Secretary determines which agents and toxins present a threat and \nwhether the countermeasures are ``more likely'' to be developed with \nthe application of the incentives in the legislation. The Secretary may \ndetermine that an agent or toxin does not present a threat or that \ncountermeasures are not more likely to be developed with the \nincentives. It may determine that the government itself should fund the \nresearch and development effort and not rely on private companies. The \nDepartment is required to consider the status of existing research, the \navailability of non-countermeasure markets for the research, and the \nmost effective strategy for ensuring that the research goes forward. \nThe legislation includes an illustrative, non-binding list of fifty-\nfour agents and toxins that might be included on the Secretary's list. \nThe decisions of the Secretary are final and are not subject to \njudicial review.\n  The Department then must provide information to potential \nmanufacturers of these countermeasures in sufficient detail to permit \nthem to conduct the research and determine when they have developed the \nneeded countermeasure. It may exempt from publication such information \nas it deems to be sensitive.\n  The Department also must specify the government market that will be \navailable when a countermeasure is successfully developed, including \nthe minimum number of dosages that will be purchased, the minimum price \nper dose, and the timing and number of years projected for such \npurchases. Authority is provided for the Department to make advance, \npartial, progress, milestone, or other payments to the manufacturers.\n  The Department is responsible for determining when a manufacturer \nhas, in fact, successfully developed the needed countermeasure. It must \nprovide information in sufficient detail so that manufacturers and the \ngovernment may determine when the manufacturer has successfully \ndeveloped the countermeasure the government needs. If and when the \nmanufacturer has successfully developed the countermeasure, it becomes \nentitled to the procurement, patent, and liability incentives in the \nlegislation.\n  Once the list of agents and toxins is set, companies may register \nwith the Department their intent to undertake research and development \nof a countermeasure to prevent or treat the agent or toxin. This \nregistration is required only for companies that seek to be eligible \nfor the tax, purchase, patent, and liability provisions of the \nlegislation. The registration requirement gives the Department vital \ninformation about the research effort and the personnel involved with \nthe research, authorizes inspections and other review of the research \neffort, and the filing of reports by the company.\n  The Secretary then may certify that the company is eligible for the \ntax, purchase, patent, and liability incentives in the legislation. It \nbases this certification on the qualifications of the company to \nconduct the countermeasure research. Eligibility for the purchase fund, \npatent and liability incentives is contingent on successful development \nof a countermeasure according to the standards set in the legislation, \nas determined by the Secretary.\n  The legislation contemplates that a company might well register and \nseek certification with respect to more than one research project and \nbecome eligible for the tax, purchase, patent, and liability incentives \nfor each. There is no policy rationale for limiting a company to one \nregistration and one certification.\n  This process is similar to the current registration process for \nresearch on orphan (rare) diseases. In that case, companies that are \ncertified by the FDA become eligible for both tax and market \nexclusivity incentives. This process gives the government complete \ncontrol on the number of registrations and certifications. This gives \nthe government control over the cost and impact of the legislation on \nprivate sector research.\n\n\n                     diagnostics and research tools\n\n  The registration and certification process applies to research to \ndevelop diagnostics and research tools, not just drugs and vaccines.\n  Diagnostics are vital because healthcare professionals need to know \nwhich agent or toxin has been used in an attack. This enables them to \ndetermine which treatment strategy is likely to be most effective. We \nneed quickly to determine which individuals have been exposed or \ninfected, and to separate them from the ``worried well.'' it is likely \nin an attack that large numbers of individuals who have not been \nexposed or infected will flood into healthcare facilities seeking \ntreatment. We need to be able to focus on those individuals who are at \nrisk and reassure those who are not at risk.\n  In terms of research tools, it is possible that we will face \nbiological agents and chemical agents we have never seen before. As \nI've mentioned, the Soviet Union bioterror research focused in part on \nuse of genetic modification technology to develop agents and toxins \nthat currently-available antibiotics can not treat. Australian \nresearchers accidentally created a modified mousepox virus, which does \nnot affect humans, but it was 100 percent lethal to the mice. Their \nresearch focused on trying to make a mouse contraceptive vaccine for \npest control. The surprise was that it totally suppressed the ``cell-\nmedicated response''--the arm of the immune system that combats viral \ninfection. To make matters worse, the engineered virus also appears \nunnaturally resistant to attempts to vaccinate the mice. A vaccine that \nwould normally protect mouse strains that are susceptible to the virus \nonly worked in half the mice exposed to the killer version. If \nbioterrorists created a human version of the virus, vaccination \nprograms would be of limited use. This highlights the drawback of \nworking on vaccines against bioweapons rather than treatments.\n  With the advances in gene sequencing--genomics--we will know the \nexact genetic structure of a biological agent. This information in the \nwrong hands could easily be manipulated to design and possibly grow a \nlethal new bacterial and viral strains not found in nature. A scientist \nmight be able to mix and match traits from different micoorganism--\ncalled recombinant technology--to take a gene that makes a deadly toxin \nfrom one strain of bacteria and introduce it into other bacterial \nstrains. Dangerous pathogens or infectious agents could be made more \ndeadly, and relatively benign agents could be designed as major public \nhealth problems. Bacteria that cause diseases such as anthrax could be \naltered in such a way that would make current vaccines or antibiotics \nagainst them ineffective. It is even possible that a scientist could \ndevelop an organism that develops resistance to antibiotics at an \naccelerated rate.\n\n  This means we need to develop technology--research tools--that will \nenable us to quickly develop a tailor-made, specific countermeasure to \na previously unknown organism or agent. These research tools will \nenable us to develop a tailor-made vaccine or drug to deploy as a \ncountermeasure against a new threat. The legislation authorizes \ncompanies to register and receive a certification making them eligible \nfor the incentives in the bill for this vital research.\n\n\n                  Tax Incentives for Capital Formation\n\n  The legislation includes four tax incentives to enable biotechnology \nand\n\n[[Page S10722]]\n\npharmaceutical companies to form capital to fund research and \ndevelopment of countermeasures. Companies must irrevocably elect only \none of the incentives with regard to the countermeasure research.\n  Four different tax incentives are available so that companies have \nflexibility in forming capital to fund the research. Each of the \noptions comes with advantages and limitations that may make it \nappropriate or inappropriate for a given company or research project. \nWe do not now know fully how investors and capital markets will respond \nto the different options, but we assume that companies will consult \nwith the investor community about which option will work best for a \ngiven research project. Capital markets are diverse and investors have \ndifferent needs and expectations. Over time these markets and investor \nexpectations evolve. If companies register for more than one research \nproject, they may well utilize different tax incentives for the \ndifferent projects.\n  Companies are permitted to undertake a series of discrete and \nseparate research projects and make this election with respect to each \nproject. They may only utilize one of the options with respect to each \nof these research projects.\n  The first option is for the company to establish an R Limited \nPartnership to conduct the research. The partnership passes through all \nbusiness deductions and credits to the partners. For example, under \nthis arrangement, the research and development tax credits and \ndepreciation deductions for the company may be passed by the \ncorporation through to its partners to be used to offset their \nindividual tax liability. These deductions and credits are then lost to \nthe corporation. This alternative is available only to companies with \nless than $750,000,000 in paid-in capital.\n  The second option is for the company to issue a special class of \nstock for the entity to conduct the research. The investors would be \nentitled to a zero capital gains tax rate on any gains realized on the \nstock held for at least three years. This is a modification of the \ncurrent Section 1202 where only 50 percent of the gains are not taxed. \nThis provision is adapted from legislation I have introduced, S. 1134, \nand introduced in the House by Representatives Dunn and Matsui (H.R. \n2383). A similar bill has been introduced by Senator Collins, S. 455. \nThis option also is available to small companies.\n  The third and fourth options grant special tax credits to the company \nfor the research. The first credit is for research conducted by the \ncompany and the other for research conducted at a teaching hospital or \nsimilar institution. Tax credits are available to any company, but they \nare only useful to a company with tax liability against which to claim \nthe credit. Very few biotechnology companies receive revenue from \nproduct sales and therefore have no tax liability. Companies with \nrevenue may be able to fund the research from retained earnings rather \nthan secure funding from investors.\n  A company that elects to utilize one of these incentives is not \neligible to receive benefits of the Orphan Drug Tax Credit. Companies \nthat can utilize tax credits--companies with taxable income and tax \nliability--might find the Orphan Credit more valuable. The legislation \nincludes an amendment to the Orphan Credit to correct a defect in the \ncurrent credit. The amendment has been introduced in the Senate as S. \n1341 by Senators Hatch, Kennedy and Jeffords. The amendment simply \nstates that the Credit is available starting the day an application for \norphan drug status is filed, not the date the FDA finally acts on it. \nThe amendment was one of many initiatives championed by Lisa J. Raines, \nwho died on September 11 in the plane that hit the Pentagon, and the \namendment is named in her honor. As we go forward in the legislative \nprocess, I hope we will have an opportunity to speak in more detail \nabout the service of Ms. Raines on behalf of medical research, \nparticularly on rare diseases.\n  The guaranteed purchase fund, and the patent protections, and \nliability provisions described below provide an additional incentive \nfor investors and companies to fund the research.\n\n\n                Government Countermeasure Purchase Fund\n\n  The market for countermeasures is speculative and small. This means \nthat if a company successfully develops a countermeasure, it may not \nreceive sufficient revenue on sales to justify the risk and expense of \nthe research. This is why the legislation establishes a countermeasures \npurchase fund that will define the market for the products with some \nspecificity before the research begins.\n  The Secretary will set standards for which countermeasures it will \npurchase and define the financial terms of the purchase commitment. \nThis will enable companies to evaluate the market potential of its \nresearch before it launches into the project. The specifications will \nneed to be set with sufficient specificity so that the company--and its \ninvestors--can evaluate the market and with enough flexibility so that \nit does not inhibit the innovativeness of the researchers. This \napproach is akin to setting a performance standard for a new military \naircraft.\n  The legislation provides that the Secretary will determine whether \nthe government will purchase more than one product per class. It might \nmake sense--as an incentive--for the government to commit to purchasing \nmore than one product so that many more than one company conducts the \nresearch. A winner-take-all system may well intimidate some companies \nand we may end up without a countermeasure to be purchased. It is also \npossible that we will find that we need more than one countermeasure \nbecause different products are useful for different patients. We may \nalso find that the first product developed is not the most effective.\n  The purchase commitment for countermeasures is available to any \ncompany irrespective of its paid-in capital.\n\n\n                   intellectual property protections\n\n  Intellectual property protection of research is essential to \nbiotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for one simple reason: they \nneed to know that if they successfully develop a medical product \nanother company cannot expropriate it. It's a simple matter of \nincentives.\n  The patent system has its basis in the U.S. Constitution where the \nfederal government is given the mandate to ``promote the progress of \nScience and the Useful Arts by securing for a limited time to Authors \nand Inventors the exclusive right to their respective Writings and \nDiscoveries.'' In exchange for full disclosure of the terms of their \ninventions, inventors are granted the right to exclude others from \nmaking, using, or selling their inventions for a limited period of \ntime. this quid pro quo provides investors with the incentive to \ninvent. In the absence of the patent law, discoverable inventions would \nbe freely available to anyone who wanted to use them and inventors \nwould not be able to capture the value of their inventions or secure a \nreturn on their investments.\n  The patent system strikes a balance. Companies receive limited \nprotection of their inventions if they are willing to publish the terms \nof their invention for all to see. At the end of the term of the \npatent, anyone can practice the invention without any threat of an \ninfringement action. During the term of the patent, competitors can \nlearn from the published description of the invention and may well find \na new and distinct patentable invention.\n  The legislation provides two types of intellectual property \nprotection. The first simply provides that the term of the patent on \nthe countermeasure will be the term of the patent granted by the Patent \nand Trademark Office without any erosion due to delays in approval of \nthe product by the Food and Drug Administration. The second provides \nthat a company that successfully develops a countermeasure will receive \na bonus of two years on the term of any patent held by that company. \nCompanies must elect one of these two protections, but only small \nbiotechnology companies may elect the second protection. Large, \nprofitable pharmaceutical companies may elect only the first of the two \noptions.\n  The first protection against erosion of the term of the patent is an \nissue that is partially addressed in current law, the Hatch-Waxman \nPatent Term Restoration Act. That act provides partial protection \nagainst erosion of the term (length) of a patent when there are delays \nat the FDA in approving a product. The erosion occurs when the PTO \nissues a patent before the product\n\n[[Page S10723]]\n\nis approved by the FDA. In these cases, the term of the patent is \nrunning but the company cannot market the product. The Hatch-Waxman Act \nprovides some protections against erosion of the term of the patent, \nbut the protections are incomplete. As a result, many companies end up \nwith a patent with a reduced term, sometimes substantially reduced.\n  The issue of patent term erosion has become more serious due to \nchanges at the PTO in the patent system. The term of a patent used to \nbe fixed at 17 years from the date the patent was granted by the PTO. \nIt made no difference how long it took for the PTO to process the \npatent application and sometimes the processing took years, even \ndecades. Under this system, there were cases where the patent would \nissue before final action at the FDA, but there were other cases where \nthe FDA acted to approve a product before the patent was issued. \nErosion was an issue, but it did not occur in many cases.\n  Since 1995 the term of a patent has been set at 20 years from the \ndate of application for the patent. This means that the processing time \nby the PTO of the application all came while the term of the patent is \nrunning. This gives companies a profound incentive to rush the patent \nthrough the PTO. (Under the old system, companies had the opposite \nincentive.) With patents being issued earlier by the PTO, the issue of \nerosion of patent term due to delays at the FDA is becoming more \nserious and more common.\n  The provision in the legislation simply states that in the case of \nbioterrorism countermeasures, no erosion in the term of the patent will \noccur. The term of the patent at the date of FDA approval will be the \nsame as the term of the patent when it was issued by the PTO. There is \nno extension of the patent, simply protections against erosion. Under \nthe new 20 year term, patents might be more or less than 17 years \ndepending on the processing time at the PTO, and all this legislation \nsays is that whatever term is set by the PTO will govern irrespective \nof the delays at the FDA. This option is available to any company that \nsuccessfully develops a countermeasure eligible to be purchased by the \nfund.\n  The second option, the bonus patent term, is only available to small \ncompanies with less than $750,000,000 in paid-in capital. It provides \nthat a company that successfully develops a countermeasure is entitled \nto a two-years extension of any patent in its portfolio. This does not \napply to any patent of another company bought or transferred in to the \ncountermeasure research company.\n  I am well aware that this bonus patent term provision will be \ncontroversial with some. A company would tend to utilize this option if \nit owned the patent on a product that still had, or might have, market \nvalue at the end of the term of the patent. Because this option is only \navailable to small biotechnology companies, most of whom have no \nproduct on the market, in most cases they would be speculating about \nthe value of a product at the end of its patent. The company might \napply this provision to a patent that otherwise would be eroded due to \nFDA delays or it might apply it to a patent that was not eroded. The \nresult might be a patent term that is no longer than the patent term \nissued by the PTO. It all depends on which companies elect this option \nand which patent they select. In some cases, the effect of this \nprovision might be to delay the entry onto the market of lower priced \ngenerics. This would tend to shift some of the cost of the incentive to \ndevelop a countermeasure to insurance companies and patients with an \nunrelated disease.\n  My rationale for including the patent bonus in the legislation is \nsimple: I want this legislation to say emphatically that we mean \nbusiness, we are serious, and we want biotechnology companies to \nreconfigure their research portfolios to focus in part on development \nof countermeasures. The other provisions in the legislation are \npowerful, but they may not be sufficient.\n\n\n                        limitation on liability\n\n  This proposal protects companies willing to take the risks of \nproducing anti-terrorism products for the American public from \npotential losses incurred from lawsuits alleging adverse reactions to \nthese products. It also preserves the right for plaintiffs to seek \nrecourse for alleged adverse reactions in Federal District Court, with \nprocedural and monetary limitations.\n  Under the plan, the Secretary of HHS is required to indemnify and \ndefend entities engaged in qualified countermeasure research through \nexecution of ``indemnification and defense agreements.'' This \nprotection is only available for countermeasures purchased under the \nlegislation or to use of such countermeasures as recommended by the \nSurgeon General in the event of a public health emergency.\n  An exclusive means of resolving civil cases that fall within the \nscope of the indemnification and defense agreements is provided with \nlitigation rights for injured parties. Non-economic damages are limited \nto $250,000 per plaintiff and no punitive or exemplary damages may be \nawarded.\n  Some have tried to apply the existing Vaccine Injury Compensation \nProgram (VICP) to this national effort. That is inappropriate because \nthat program will be extremely difficult to use, both administratively \nand scientifically. For example, it would take several years to develop \nthe appropriate ``table'' that identifies a compensable injury. \nCompanies will be liable during this process. Note that when VICP was \ncreated, there had been studies of what adverse reactions to mandated \nchildhood vaccines had occurred and the table was based largely on this \nexperience. Even so, it has taken years of effort, ultimately resulting \nin wholesale revisions to the table by regulation, to get the current \ntable in place. For anti-bioterrorism products currently being \ndeveloped, it will simply be impossible to construct a meaningful \nVaccine Injury Table--there will be no experience with the product.\n\n\n                       miscellanelous provisions\n\n  The legislation contains a series of provisions designed to enhance \ncountermeasure research.\n  The legislation provides for accelerated approval by the FDA of \ncountermeasures developed under the legislation. In most cases, the \nproducts would clearly qualify for accelerated approval, but the \nlegislation ensures that they will be reviewed under this process.\n  It provides a statutory basis for the FDA approving countermeasures \nwhere human clinical trials are not appropriate or ethical. Rules \nregarding such products have been promulgated by the FDA.\n  It grants a limited antitrust exemption for certain cooperative \nresearch and development of countermeasures.\n  It provides incentives for the construction of biologics \nmanufacturing facilities and research to increase the efficiency of \ncurrent biologics manufacturing facilities.\n  It enhances the synergy between our for-profit and not for profit \nbiomedical research entities. The Bayh-Dole Act and Stevenson-Wydler \nAct form the legal framework for mutually beneficially partnerships \nbetween academia and industry. My legislation strengthens this synergy \nand these relationships with two provisions, one to upgrade the basic \nresearch infrastructure available to conduct research on \ncountermeasures and the other to increase cooperation between the \nNational Institutes of Health and private companies.\n  Research on countermeasures necessitates the use of special \nfacilities where biological agents can be handled safely without \nexposing researchers and the public to danger. Very few academic \ninstitutions or private companies can justify or capitalize the \nconstruction of these special facilities. The Federal government can \nfacilitate research and development of countermeasures by financing the \nconstruction of these facilities for use on a fee-for-service basis. \nThe legislation authorizes appropriations for grants to non-profit and \nfor-profit institutions to construct, maintain, and manage up to ten \nBiosafety Level 3-4 facilities, or their equivalent, in different \nregions of the country for use in research to develop countermeasures. \nBSL 3-4 facilities are ones used for research on indigenous, exotic or \ndangerous agents with potential for aerosol transmission of disease \nthat may have serious or lethal consequences or where the agents pose \nhigh risk of life-threatening disease, aerosol-transmitted lab \ninfections, or related agents with unknown risk of\n\n[[Page S10724]]\n\ntransmission. The Director of the Office and NIH shall issue \nregulations regarding the qualifications of the researchers who may \nutilize the facilities. Companies that have registered with and been \ncertified by the Director--to develop countermeasures under Section \n5(d) of the legislation--shall be given priority in the use of the \nfacilities.\n  The legislation also reauthorizes a very successful NIH-industry \npartnership program launched in FY 2000 in Public Law 106-113. The \nfunding is for partnership challenge grants to promote joint ventures \nbetween NIH and its grantees and for-profit biotechnology, \npharmaceutical and medical device industries with regard to the \ndevelopment of countermeasures (as defined in Section 3 of the bill) \nand research tools (as defined in Section 4(d)(3) of the bill). Such \ngrants shall be awarded on a one-for-one matching basis. So far the \nmatching grants have focused on development of medicines to treat \nmalaria, tuberculosis, emerging and resistant infections, and \ntherapeutics for emerging threats. My proposal should be matched by \nreauthorization of the challenge grant program for these deadly \ndiseases.\n\n  The legislation also sets incentives for the development of adjuvents \nto enhance the potency, and efficacy of antigens in responding to a \nbiological agent.\n  It requires the new Department to issue annual reports on the \neffectiveness of this legislation and these incentives, and directs it \nto host an international conference each year on countermeasure \nresearch.\n\n\n                       calibration of incentives\n\n  The legislation is carefully calibrated to provide incentives only \nwhere they are needed. This accounts for the choices in the legislation \nabout which provisions are available to small biotechnology companies \nand large pharmaceutical companies.\n  The legislation makes choices. It sets the priorities. It provides a \ndose of incentives and seeks a response in the private sector. We are \nattempting here to do something that has not been done before. This is \nuncharted territory. And it also an urgent mission.\n  There may be cases where a countermeasure developed to treat a \nbiological toxin or chemical agent will have applications beyond this \nuse. A broad-spectrum antibiotic capable of treating many different \nbiological agents may well have the capacity to treat naturally \noccurring diseases.\n  This same issue arises with the Orphan Drug Act, which provides both \ntax and FDA approval incentives for companies that develop medicines to \ntreat rare diseases. In some cases these treatments can also be used \nfor larger disease populations. There are few who object to this \nsituation. We have come to the judgment that urgency of this research \nis worth the possible additional benefits that might accrue to a \ncompany.\n  In the context of research to develop countermeasures, I do not \nconsider it a problem that a company might find a broader commercial \nmarket for a countermeasure. Indeed, it may well be the combination of \nthe incentives in this legislation and these broader markets that \ndrives the successful development of a countermeasure. If our intense \nfocus on developing countermeasures, and research tools, provides \nbenefits for mankind going well beyond terror weapons, we should \nrejoice. If this research helps us to develop an effective vaccine or \ntreatment for AIDS, we should give the company the Nobel Prize for \nMedicine. If we do not develop a vaccine or treatment for AIDS, we may \nsee 100 million people die of AIDS. We also have 400 million people \ninfected with malaria and more than a million annual deaths. Millions \nof children die of diarrhea, cholera and other deadly and disabling \ndiseases. Countermeasures research may deepen our understanding of the \nimmune system and speed and development of treatments for cancer and \nautoimmune diseases. That is not the central purpose of this \nlegislation, but it is also an additional rationale for it.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  This issue raised by my legislation is very simple: do we want the \nFederal government to fund and supervise much of the research to \ndevelop countermeasures or should we also provide incentives that make \nit possible for the private sector, at its own expense, and at its own \nrisk, to undertake this research for good business reasons. This Frist-\nKennedy law focuses effectively on direct Federal funding and \ncoordination issues, but it does not include the sufficient incentives \nfor the private sector to undertake this research on its own \ninitiative. That law and my legislation are perfectly complimentary. We \nneed to enact both to ensure that we are prepared for bioterror \nattacks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an outline of the legislation appear at \nthis point in the Record.\n\nBiological, Chemical and Radiological Weapons Countermeasures Research \n                              Act of 2002\n\n       The legislation, a refined version of S. 1764 introduced on \n     December 4, 2001, proposes incentives that will enable \n     biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to take the \n     initiative--for good business reasons--to conduct research to \n     develop countermeasures, including diagnostics, drugs, and \n     vaccines, to treat those who might be exposed to or infected \n     by biological, chemical or radiological agents and materials \n     in a terror attack.\n       The premise of this legislation is that direct government \n     funding of this research is likely to be much more expensive \n     to the government and less likely to produce the \n     countermeasures we need to defend America. Shifting some of \n     the risk and expense of this research to entrepreneurial \n     private sector firms is likely to be less expensive to the \n     government and much more likely to produce the \n     countermeasures we need to protect ourselves in the event of \n     an attack.\n       For biotechnology companies, incentives for capital \n     formation are needed because most such companies have no \n     approved products or revenue from product sales to fund \n     research. They rely on investors and equity capital markets \n     to fund the research. These companies must focus on research \n     that will lead to product sales and revenue and end their \n     dependence on investor capital. When they are able to form \n     the capital to fund research, biotech companies tend to be \n     innovative and nimble and focused on the intractable diseases \n     for which no effective medical treatments are available. \n     Special research credits for pharmaceutical companies are \n     also needed.\n       For both biotech and pharmaceutical companies, there is no \n     established or predictable market for these countermeasures. \n     Investors and companies are justifiable reluctant to fund \n     this research, which will present technical challenges \n     similar in complexity to development of effective treatments \n     for AIDS. Investors and companies need assurances that \n     research on countermeasures has the potential to provide a \n     rate of return commensurate with the risk, complexity and \n     cost of the research, a rate of return comparable to that \n     which may arise from a treatment for cancer, MS, Cystic \n     Fibrosis and other major diseases or from other investments.\n       The legislation provides tax incentives to enable companies \n     to form capital to conduct the research and tax credits \n     usable by larger companies with tax liability with respect to \n     which to claim the credits. It provides a guaranteed and pre-\n     determined market for the countermeasures and special \n     intellectual property protections to serve as a substitute \n     for a market. Finally, it establishes liability protections \n     for the countermeasures that are developed.\n       Specifics of the legislation are as follows:\n       (1) Setting Research Priorities (Section 101): The \n     Department of Homeland Security sets the countermeasure \n     research priorities in advance. It focuses the priorities on \n     threats for which countermeasures are needed, and with regard \n     to which the incentives make it ``more likely'' that the \n     private sector will conduct the research to develop \n     countermeasures. It is required to consider the status of \n     existing research, the availability of non-countermeasure \n     markets for the research, and the most effective strategy for \n     ensuring that the research goes forward. The Department then \n     provides information to potential manufacturers of these \n     countermeasures in sufficient detail to permit them to \n     conduct the research and determine when they have developed \n     the needed countermeasure. The Department is responsible for \n     determining when a manufacturer has, in fact, successfully \n     developed the needed countermeasure.\n       (2) Registration of Companies (Section 102): Biotechnology \n     and pharmaceutical companies register with the Department to \n     become eligible for the incentives in the legislation. They \n     are obligated to provide reports to the Department as \n     requested and be open to inspections. The Department \n     certifies with companies are eligible for the incentives. \n     Once a company is certified as eligible for the incentives, \n     it becomes eligible for the tax incentives for capital \n     formation, and if it successfully develops a countermeasure \n     that meets the specifications of the Department, it becomes \n     eligible for the procurement, patent, and liability \n     provisions.\n       (3) Diagnostics (Section 103): The incentives apply to \n     development of diagnostics, as well as drugs, vaccines and \n     other needed countermeasures.\n       (4) Research tools (Section 104): A company is also \n     eligible for certification for the tax and patent provisions \n     if it seeks to develop a research tool that will make it \n     possible to quickly develop a countermeasure to a previously \n     unknown agent or toxin, or an agent\n\n[[Page S10725]]\n\n     or toxin not targeted by the Department for research.\n       (5) Capital Formation for Countermeasure Research (Section \n     201): The legislation provides that a company seeking to fund \n     research is eligible to elect from among four tax incentives. \n     The companies are eligible to:\n       (a) Establish an R Limited Partnership to conduct the \n     research. The partnership passes through all business \n     deductions and credits to the partners. Section 201 (b)(1).\n       (b) Issue a special class of stock for the entity to \n     conduct the research. The investors would be entitled to a \n     zero capital gains tax rate on any gains realized on the \n     stock. Section 201(b)(2).\n       (c) Receive a special tax credit to help fund the research. \n     Section 201 (b)(3).\n       (d) Receive a special tax credit for research conducted at \n     a non-profit and academic research institution. Section 201 \n     (b)(4).\n       A company must elect only one of these incentives and, if \n     it elects one of these incentives, it is then not eligible to \n     receive benefits under the Orphan Drug Act. The legislation \n     includes amendments (Section 218) to the Orphan Drug Act \n     championed by Senators Hatch, Kennedy and Jeffords (S. 1341). \n     the amendments make the Credit available from the date of the \n     application for Orphan Drug status, not the date the \n     application is approved as provided under current law.\n       (6) Countermeasure Purchase Fund (Section 202): The \n     legislation provides that a company that successfully \n     develops a countermeasure--through FDA approval--is eligible \n     to sell the product to the Federal government at a pre-\n     established price and in a pre-determined amount. The company \n     is given notice of the terms of the sale before it commences \n     the research.\n       (7) Intellectual Property Incentives (Section 203): The \n     legislation provides that a company that successfully \n     develops a countermeasure is eligible to elect one of two \n     patent incentives. The two alternatives are as follows:\n       (a) The company is eligible to receive a patent for its \n     invention with a term as long as the term of the patent when \n     it was issued by the Patent and Trademark Office, without any \n     erosion due to delays in the FDA approval process. This \n     alternative is available to any company that successfully \n     develops a countermeasure irrespective of its paid-in \n     capital.\n       (b) The company is eligible to extend the term of any \n     patent owned by the company for two years. The patent may not \n     be one that is acquired by the company from a third party. \n     This is included as a capital formation incentive for small \n     biotechnology companies with less than $750 million in paid-\n     in capital, or, at the discretion of the Department of \n     Homeland Security, to any firm that successfully develops a \n     countermeasure.\n       In addition, a company that successfully develops a \n     countermeasure is eligible for a 10 year period of market \n     exclusivity on the countermeasure.\n       (8) Liability Protections (Section 204): The legislation \n     provides for protections against liability for the company \n     that successfully develops a countermeasure.\n       (9) Accelerated Approval of Countermeasure (Section 211): \n     The countermeasures are considered for approval by the FDA on \n     a ``fast track'' basis.\n       (10) Special Approval Standards (Section 212): The \n     countermeasures may be approved in the absence of human \n     clinical trails if such trails are impractical or unethical.\n       (11) Limited Antitrust Exemption (Section 213): Companies \n     are granted a limited exemption from the antitrust laws as \n     they seek to expedite research on countermeasures.\n       (12) Biologics Manufacturing Capacity and Efficiency \n     (Sections 214-215): Special incentives are incorporated to \n     ensure that manufacturing capacity is available for \n     countermeasures.\n       (13) Strengthening of Biomedical Research Infrastructure: \n     Authorizes appropriations for grants to construct specialized \n     biosafety containment facilities where biological agents can \n     be handled safely without exposing researchers and the public \n     to danger (Section 216). Also reauthorizes a successful NIH-\n     industry partnership challenge grants to promote joint \n     ventures between NIH and its grantees and for-profit \n     biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries \n     with regard to the development of countermeasures and \n     research tools (Section 217).\n       (14) Adjuvents (Section 219): The legislation provides \n     incentives for the development and use of adjuvents to \n     enhance the potency of countermeasures.\n       (15) Annual Report (Section 220): The Department is \n     required to prepare for the Congress an annual report on the \n     implementation of these incentives.\n       (16) International Conference (Section 221): The Department \n     is required to organize an annual international conference on \n     countermeasure research.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor, with my \ncolleague Senator Lieberman from Connecticut, Chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, legislation that we believe is \nessential to better prepare our nation to prepare for and respond to \nbioterrorist attacks. The goal of our bill, the Biological, Chemical \nand Radiological Measures Research Act of 2002, is to encourage private \nsector research and development of diagnostic products, drugs, and \nvaccines designed to counter biological, chemical, or radiological \nattacks.\n  One year ago our country faced a series of anthrax attacks that \nexposed deficiencies in our nation's ability to respond to attacks of \nbioterrorism. We need to do more. This bill will help protect the \nAmerican public by deterring future acts of bioterrorism and, in the \nevent of another such attack, will increase our capacity to respond \neffectively to the weapon deployed.\n  This legislation complements the bioterrorism bill passed by Congress \nearlier this year that focused on building up the public health \ninfrastructure. Senators Kennedy, Gregg and Frist deserve much credit \nfor their work on that bill as do Congressmen Tauzin, Bilirakis, \nDingell and Brown. Also, we would be remiss if we did not recognize the \nmanner in which the Appropriations Committees in both the Senate and \nthe House adjusted their priorities so quickly last Fall. I salute the \nleadership of Senators Byrd, Harkin, Stevens and Specter in making \navailable substantial new funding for building up the capacity of the \npublic health system to protect our citizens against the threat of \nbioterrorism.\n  When it comes to protecting America, partisanship has no place. \nSenator Lieberman built upon the strong tradition of bi-partisanship in \nthe war against terrorism in introducing this bill today.\n  Although we are far better prepared for a terrorist attack today than \never before, and preventing a terrorist attack is our first priority, \nthere are areas where we can improve our preparedness in the case of \nsuch an attack. Chief among these is the development of preventive \nagents and treatments for those citizens who may become exposed to or \ninfected by deadly biological, chemical, and radiological agents.\n  Building up the public health infrastructure alone will be \ninsufficient if our national medicine chest does not contain safe and \neffective medicines to counter particular threat agents. This bill \ncreates incentives for the private sector to try to fill the medicine \nchest with new products designed to respond to biological or other \nsimilar attacks. We need many new treatments and vaccines and the \nLieberman-Hatch bill will unleash the creative energy and many \nresources of the private sector biomedical research enterprise.\n  America leads the world in biomedical research capacity. The \nLieberman-Hatch bill attempts to help focus the enormous assets of our \nresearch expertise in a manner that will protect the public health. \nThis legislation seeks to help translate the basic knowledge, much of \nit funded through the $27 billion taxpayer-investment in the National \nInstitutes of Health, into tangible products developed by the private \nsector.\n  Given the growing risk of further attacks and the potentially \ndevastating consequences of bioterrorism, we must abandon a business as \nusual attitude and take the vigorous steps that Senator Lieberman and I \nurge through this legislation.\n  Our legislation is an additional measure to other avenues we have \npursued to protect our nation from terrorism, including the Biologic \nWeapons Convention and government funded research at NIH, the Defense \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, and the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, CDC.\n  Though we have mobilized many governmental agencies and increased \ndirect federal funding for research and development of new treatments, \nI agree with Senator Lieberman, that what we have done thus far, \nimpressive as it has been, is not nearly enough. Direct government \nfunding for this research is likely to be insufficient for our national \ndefense needs unless we marry our efforts with the private sector to \nthe greatest extent possible. That is exactly what this bill does.\n  Unfortunately, it is hard to avoid sounding somewhat like an alarmist \nwhen speaking on these matters. But, the truth of the matter today is \nthat we do not have effective treatment for a host of potential \nbiological, chemical and radiological threat agents. We must develop \nthese with a greater sense of urgency and this legislation will serve \nas a catalyst for private sector investment and research and \ndevelopment activities.\n\n[[Page S10726]]\n\n  We need to develop an expedient, efficient capacity that combines the \nbest of what our society has--strong federal and academic institutions \nwith the most innovative biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in \nthe world. It would be a grave mistake to ignore the tremendous \ncapabilities and potential of our country's biotech and pharmaceutical \nprivate sector.\n\n  We must be creative, willing to work together, putting aside partisan \npolitics and our opinions of the government or the private sector when \ndealing with a potential deadly threat to our nation. I believe Senator \nLieberman and I have done that. Though we have not agreed on all the \ndetails on everything related to homeland security, we agree on this \nvital component. We must provide the tools to forge a collaborative \neffort by the private sector and the Federal Government to come up with \nthe cures and vaccines we may, sadly, need one day.\n  The best deterrent of bioterrorist attacks is to be able to \ndemonstrate the capacity to counter such dastardly acts. I think the \ncase can be made that all the rapid progress we have made in smallpox \nin the last year makes an attack with that agent less likely. That is \nthe good news. The bad news is that there are too many agents for which \nwe do not have any vaccine or effective therapeutic response. We need \nto roll up our sleeves and get to work on many other potential tools of \ndestruction. Our bill provides the private sector with important \nincentives to get this work done and to get it done now.\n  Most private sector companies rely on equity capital markets and \ninvestments to fund research. Naturally, they focus on research that \nwill lead to products that will sell and have a dependable market. As \nwe know, thankfully, there is no dependable or established market for \ncounter terrorism. Therefore, not unreasonably, investors need some \nkind of assurance that the costly and complex research we are asking \nthem to invest in will be rewarded--that the reward will be \ncommensurate with the risk.\n  Under current law, private companies are reluctant to enter into \nagreements with government agencies to conduct needed research. The \nbill Senator Lieberman and I are introducing greatly expands the \nincentives for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to develop \nbioterrorism countermeasures. I do not think anyone will oppose \ninvolving some of the most powerful research minds and new technology \nas we defend our country against these threats. We need to involve \nthese biomedical research companies more directly into our national \ndefense plan, as they may very well be the ones to provide us with what \nwe need to the medical front.\n  I know there are novel, and perhaps controversial, features in this \nbill--anything innovative usually does. I ask that each and every one \nof you who has a stake in this issue enter into this debate. Keep in \nmind that the goal is to close any gap that exists in our plan against \nterrorism--I believe this includes engaging the private sector. We need \nto make sure that these companies have the proper incentives to engage \nin expensive, arduous research that could potentially save millions of \nAmericans.\n  Let me now review the specifics of our proposal. We provide \nincentives, such as tax incentives, guaranteed purchase funds, and \npatent and liability protections, which make it possible for private \ncompanies to form the capital needed to conduct this vital research. \nAgain, we cannot expect these companies to engage in expensive research \nand development for an extremely unpredictable market without providing \nthem meaningful incentives and reassurance.\n  In some respects this legislation is similar to another bill I co-\nauthored, the Orphan Drug Act. The Orphan Drug Act utilizes tax credits \nand marketing exclusivity incentives to spur research into rare \ndiseases with patient populations under 200,000 in the United States. \nThis modest little bill has resulted in over 220 approved orphan \nproducts with over 1000 more designated for investigation. It is my \nhope and expectation that, in introducing our bill today, we can \nrecreate the success of the Orphan Drug Act in getting the private \nsector motivated in a particular area of research.\n  The Lieberman-Hatch bill contains powerful incentives. Here is how it \nworks. The bill requires the private sector to work closely with the \nappropriate governmental officials. The legislation ensures that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security sets the countermeasure research \npriorities in advance. The Department of Homeland Security is required \nto take into account the status of existing research, the potential for \nnon-countermeasure markets for the research, and the most effective \nstrategy for propelling the research forward and provides this \ninformation to potential manufacturers. The bill also requires \ncompanies to register with the Department, to provide reports as \nrequested and to be open to inspections, in order to be eligible for \nincentives. Once a company is certified, it is eligible for tax \nincentives for capital formation.\n  The Department then determines if a manufacturer has successfully \ndeveloped a countermeasure. Once the specifications of the Department \nare met, the company is eligible for the procurement, patent, and \nliability provisions. These incentives apply to diagnostics, drugs, \nvaccines and other countermeasures deemed necessary, including research \ntools.\n  If companies seek to develop a research tool that enables the \nadvancement of a countermeasure to a previously unknown agent or toxin, \nor an agent or toxin not targeted by the Department, they are also \neligible for incentives.\n\n  The four tax incentives companies are eligible to select from \ninclude:\n  (a) An R Limited Partnership to conduct the research. The \npartnership passes through all business deductions and credits to the \npartners.\n  (b) A special class of stock for the entity to conduct the research. \nThe investors would be entitled to a zero capital gains tax rate on any \ngains realized on the stock.\n  (c) A special tax credit to help fund the research.\n  (d) A special tax credit for research conducted at a non-profit and \nacademic research institution.\n\n  I want to point out that a company can elect only one of these \nincentives and, if it elects one of these incentives, the company is \nnot eligible to further benefits under the Orphan Drug Act. That is \nonly fair.\n  I would like to briefly discuss the Countermeasure Purchase Fund \ncontained in Section 202 of the bill. Basically, the legislation \naffords a company that successfully develops a countermeasure--through \nFDA approval--eligibility to sell the product to the Federal Government \nat a pre-established price and in a pre-determined amount. The company \nis given notice of the terms of the sale before it begins research.\n  The intellectual property incentives are contained in Section 203 of \nthe bill. There are two patent incentives:\n  One, the company is eligible to receive full patent term restoration \nfor its invention. This means that it is held harmless for patent term \nerosion due to the lengthy FDA approval process. This alternative is \navailable to any company that successfully develops a countermeasure \nirrespective of its paid-in capital. This is a significant incentive \nover the normal partial patent term restoration provisions contained in \nthe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act. I am a co-\nauthor of this law which has contributed to consumer savings of $8 to \n$10 billion each year since its passage in 1984. This was the \nlegislation that created the modern generic drug industry. But under \nthis law the patent term cannot be restored beyond 14 years. When the \n1984 law was enacted the patent term was 17 years from date of patent \nissuance; with the enactment of the GATT Treaty implementing \nlegislation, the patent term was changed to 20 years from date of \napplication. By adopting a policy of day for day patent term \nrestoration, the Lieberman-Hatch bill is sending a strong signal to the \nprivate sector to pour its resources into this research. By lengthening \nthe patent term beyond the existing 14 year cap, drug companies will \nhave a new incentive to devote their efforts to this research.\n  Two, under the bill, small companies are also eligible to elect to \nextend the term of any patent owned by the company for two years. The \npatent may not be one that is acquired by the company from a third \nparty. This is included as a capital formation incentive\n\n[[Page S10727]]\n\nfor small biotechnology companies with less than $750 million in paid-\nin capital, or, at the discretion of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, to any firm that successfully develops a countermeasure. This \nprovision will get the attention of our nation's growing biotechnology \nsector.\n  In addition, a company that successfully develops a countermeasure is \neligible for a 10 year period of market exclusivity on the \ncountermeasure. This means that the FDA may not approve a generic copy \nof such a drug for 10 years regardless of whether the drug has any \npatent protection. This is in contrast to the 5 years of marketing \nexclusivity granted under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act. This is an important incentive because it is the \ngovernment that enforces the marketing exclusivity provision, not the \nfirm through costly, risky, and time-consuming private patent \ninfringement litigation.\n  Other incentives in the bill include the liability protections set \nforth in section 204; a limited antitrust exemption designed to \nexpedite and coordinate research as set forth in section 213; \naccelerated FDA approval provisions described in section 211; and, \nspecial FDA approval standards established in section 212 that codify \nthe FDA regulations that authorize approval in the absence of human \nclinical trails if such trails are impractical or unethical.\n  In addition the bill provide; incentives to enhance biologics \nmanufacturing capacity for countermeasures. This includes grants to \nconstruct specialized biosafety containment facilities where biological \nagents can be handled safely without exposing researchers and the \npublic to danger. The bill also reauthorizes a successful NIH-industry \npartnership challenge grants to promote joint ventures between NIH and \nits grantees and for-profit biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and medical \ndevice industries with regard to the development of countermeasures and \nresearch tools.\n  Finally, the bill also provides incentives for the development and \nuse of adjuvants to enhance the potency of countermeasures; requires \nthe Department of Homeland Security to prepare an Annual Report to \nCongress on the implementation of these incentives in the legislation \nand to organize an annual international conference on countermeasure \nresearch.\n  Let me conclude by saying that this legislation lays out an \nunabashedly aggressive set of incentives designed to stimulate \nresearch. There will undoubtedly be criticisms of some of the features \nof the bill. Senator Lieberman and I recognize that adjustments will \nhave to be made along the way. We want to work closely with President \nBush, Vice President Cheney, Governor Ridge, and Secretary Thompson and \nothers in the Administration in refining this legislation. We recognize \nthat unless the President feel that this type of program is necessary \nit is unlikely to be adopted.\n  The subject mater of this legislation cuts across many Committees of \nthe Senate. Senator Lieberman and I will work with the Finance \nCommittee, the Judiciary Committee I serve on both of these \ncommittees--as well as the HELP Committee, Commerce Committee, and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee which my friend from Connecticut Chairs. \nI might add, as much as I admire Senator Lieberman, I hope that next \nmonth he becomes the Ranking Democratic Member of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee.\n  We will continue to work with all interested parties in the private \nsector to refine this legislation. We welcome this dialog.\n  Let me state clearly that my cosponsorship today is more an \nunambiguous statement that I intend to work in partnership with Senator \nLieberman than it is a statement that I agree with each provision and \ndetail of this bill. Specifically, I do not agree with--and would not \nsupport--the anti-trust and indemnification provisions as currently \ndrafted. We must tread carefully in the areas of government \nindemnification and in holding any meetings with the private sector in \nwhich anti-trust concerns are triggered.\n  My cosponsorship of this legislation today which will serve as a \ndiscussion draft between the 107th and 108th Congress--should not be \nconsidered as a reversal of my views on indemnification and antitrust \npolicy. It is not. My cosponsorship only signals my willingness to be \nopen to rethinking my traditional views of indemnification and \nantitrust policy in light of this grave threat to our national \nsecurity. These sections--as well as many other parts of the bill need \nmore work. At the end of the day, I hope we can come together on these \nquestions.\n  I want to stress the fact that I opposed proposed indemnification \nlanguage in the Kennedy-Gregg-Frist bioterrorism bill passed earlier \nthis year. I have opposed indemnification provisions in discussions \nover matters of homeland security. I continue to hold my position that \nindemnification is not only not the best policy but that it may also be \ncounterproductive in the long run.\n  Similarly, I have rejected any general policy of governmental \nindemnification of those injured by asbestos or tobacco use. The \nprivate sector must bare its share of the risk and responsibility when \nit produces potentially dangerous products.\n  Frankly, I believe the solution to the indemnification issue may \nultimately stem from the hard work of Senators Warner and Thompson with \nrespect to their amendment, Number 4530, to the Homeland Security bill. \nThis language was carefully worked out in close consultation with by \nSenators Warner and Thompson and the White House earlier this year. We \nwill take advantage of amendment Number 4530 as we further refine our \nlegislation in this area.\n  The Warner-Thompson language builds upon the principles contained in \nExecutive order No. 10879 and the authority set forth in Public Law 85-\n804. These authorities grant the Department of Defense, at DoD's \ndiscretion, to include indemnification clauses in its contracts with \nmilitary contractors, with certain limitations and conditions. In order \nfor this authority to apply to the new Office of Homeland Security, \ncurrent law needs to be amended.\n  It is important to note that the language of the Warner-Thompson \namendment retains the principle of discretionary authority. That is \nimportant. We can not write a blank check to the private sector. \nSenator Lieberman and I have included language in our bill that \nrequires the new Secretary of Homeland Security ``to make a \ndetermination . . . that it is in the national security interest of the \nUnited States'' before any indemnification provision could be \ntriggered. The Warner-Thompson amendment is narrowly tailored to the \nprocurement of anti-terrorism technology or services by a federal \nagency directly engaged in homeland security activities. Moreover, \nconsistent with the Warner-Thompson language, we need to flesh out the \nfactors the Administration shall consider in negotiating the extent of \nany indemnification.\n  Although we need to further refine the language in the discussion \ndraft bill we introduce today, my intent is do follow the lead of and \nprinciples contained in the Warner-Thompson Amendment. Further, the \nWarner-Thompson Amendment language includes procurements made by State \nand local governments but only through contracts made by the head of an \nagency of the Federal Government and only to the extent that those \nloses are not covered by insurance.\n  A discussion of indemnification in the context of bioterrorism \ncountermeasures is a very special case. It is a unique circumstance in \nwhich we may very well face many issues never confronted before such as \nthe possibility of using drugs that can not be ethically tested in \nhuman beings due to the danger of the agent the drug is intended to \ntreat. We are not talking about asbestos or tobacco here, we are \ntalking about potential attacks that could undermine the public health, \neconomic wealth, and environmental integrity of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  We are trying to protect against the use weapons of terror in the \nhands of terrorists, not routine uses of consumer and other products. \nIf unforseen side effects occur when countermeasures are dispensed, \nsociety may be presented with problems that will require innovative \nresponses. The future of our country is at stake. I have twenty \ngrandchildren and I want them to hand down our traditions and heritage \nto their grandchildren. It is for their\n\n[[Page S10728]]\n\nsake that we must try to settle these issues.\n  But let us not get to far ahead of ourselves at this point with all \nthese details. This legislation is a work in progress. Anyone who has \nwitnessed the extensive floor debate over the last 2 months over the \ncreation of the Office of Homeland Security understands that we have \nmuch, much more work to do with respect to the creation of the new \ndepartment and many other homeland security issues. I hope and expect \nthat President Bush and the Congress will come together on the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. I commend Senator Lieberman for his \nconstructive role in this ongoing debate.\n  My support of this legislation should be construed as a personal \ncommitment to work closely with Senator Lieberman, the White House and \nother parties to address the issues raised in the bill. It is my hope \nthat we can arrive at an acceptable compromise on the indemnification \nand antitrust provisions, as well as, all the other matters taken up in \nthis important legislation.\n  As a pragmatic legislator, I understand that to make an omelette, you \nalways have to break an egg. I hope this discussion draft bill will \nhelp inspire discussion and move the process along.\n  We are facing unprecedented threats to our Nation's security. We need \nto be open to novel solutions to these new problems. We hope that this \nbill will foster thoughtful discussion on how best to prepare the \nnation for any potential biological, chemical, or radiological attack.\n  Let us not lose sight of our mission to protect our nation from the \ndevastating illness and death that bioterrorism can bring. We \ndesperately need to develop the technology to prevent, detect, \ndiagnose, and treat our citizens who may fall victim to bioterrorism. I \nbelieve that strengthening the government's partnership with the \nprivate sector is the most effective and expedient step we can take at \nthis point in time. The Kennedy-Gregg-Frist bioterrorism law was an \nenormous step forward. The funding support provided by Senators Byrd, \nStevens, Harkin, and Specter and other appropriators is also essential. \nThis public sector investment must now be joined by legislation that \nwill foster a commensurate private sector response. That is exactly \nwhat the Lieberman-Hatch bill, the Biological, Chemical and \nRadiological Measures Research Act of 2002, will do if Congress passes \nthis law.\n  Let me close by saying that I have enjoyed working with Senator \nLieberman in developing this bill and look forward to continuing this \npartnership in the future as we work with other Senators on this \nlegislation. I also want to recognize the efforts of Chuck Ludlam on \nSenator Lieberman's staff for all the work he has done to bring the \nbill to this point. Senator Lieberman and I urge our colleagues to \nreview the ``Biological, Chemical and Radiological Measures Research \nAct of 2002''. I hope that our colleagues will conclude that this \nlegislation deserves to be near the top of the agenda when the 108th \nCongress convenes in January.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S.J. Res. 50. A joint resolution expressing the sense of the Senate \nwith respect to human rights in Central Asia; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 50\n\n       Whereas the Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan, \n     Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan provided \n     the United States with important assistance in the war in \n     Afghanistan, from military basing and overflight rights to \n     the facilitation of humanitarian relief;\n       Whereas America's victory over the Taliban in turn provided \n     important benefits to the Central Asian nations, removing a \n     regime that threatened their security, and significantly \n     weakening the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a terrorist \n     organization that had previously staged armed raids from \n     Afghanistan into the region;\n       Whereas the United States has consistently urged the \n     nations of Central Asia to open their political systems and \n     economies and to respect human rights, both before and since \n     the attacks of September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, \n     and Uzbekistan are members of the United Nations and the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, both of \n     which confer a range of human rights obligations on their \n     members;\n       Whereas according to the State Department Country Reports \n     on Human Rights Practices, the government of Kazakhstan \n     harasses and monitors independent media and human rights \n     activists, restricts freedom of association and opposition \n     political activity, and allows security forces to commit \n     extrajudicial executions, torture, and arbitrary detention \n     with impunity;\n       Whereas according to the State Department, the government \n     of the Kyrgyz Republic engages in arbitrary arrest and \n     detention, restricts the activities of political opposition \n     figures, religious organizations deemed ``extremist,'' human \n     rights activists, and nongovernmental organizations, and \n     discriminates against ethnic minorities.\n       Whereas according to the State Department, the government \n     of Tajikistan remains authoritarian, curtailing freedoms of \n     speech, assembly, and association, with security forces \n     committing extrajudicial executions, kidnappings, \n     disappearances, and torture;\n       Whereas according to the State Department, Turkmenistan is \n     a Soviet-style one-party state centered around the \n     glorification of its president, which engages in serious \n     human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrest and \n     detention, severe restrictions of personal privacy, \n     repression of political opposition, and restrictions on \n     freedom of speech and nongovernmental activity;\n       Whereas according to the State Department, the government \n     of Uzbekistan continues to commit serious human rights \n     abuses, including arbitrary arrest, detention and torture in \n     custody, particularly of Muslims who practice their religion \n     outside state controls, the severe restriction of freedom of \n     speech, the press, religion, independent political activity \n     and nongovernmental organizations, and detains over 7,000 \n     people for political or religious reasons;\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom has expressed concern about religious \n     persecution in the region, recommending that Turkmenistan be \n     named a Country of Particular Concern under the International \n     Religious Freedom Act of 1998, and that Uzbekistan be placed \n     on a special ``Watch List'';\n       Whereas, by continuing to suppress human rights and to deny \n     citizens peaceful, democratic means of expressing their \n     convictions, the nations of Central Asia risk fueling popular \n     support for violent and extremist movements, thus undermining \n     the goals of the war on terrorism;\n       Whereas President Bush has made the defense of ``human \n     dignity, the rule of law, limits on the power of the state, \n     respect for women and private property and free speech and \n     equal justice and religious tolerance'' strategic goals of \n     United States foreign policy in the Islamic world, arguing \n     that ``a truly strong nation will permit legal avenues of \n     dissent for all groups that pursue their aspirations without \n     violence''; and\n       Whereas the Congress has expressed its desire to see deeper \n     reform in Central Asia in past resolutions and legislation, \n     most recently conditioning assistance to Uzbekistan on its \n     progress in meeting human rights and democracy commitments to \n     the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That it is \n     the Sense of the Congress that:\n       (1) the governments of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, \n     Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan should accelerate democratic \n     reforms and fulfill their human rights obligations including, \n     where appropriate, by--\n       ``(A) releasing from prison all those jailed for peaceful \n     political activism or the non-violent expression of their \n     political or religious beliefs;\n       ``(B) fully investigating any credible allegations of \n     torture and prosecuting those responsible;\n       ``(C) permitting the free and unfettered functioning of \n     independent media outlets, independent political parties, and \n     non-governmental organizations, whether officially \n     registered or not;\n       (D) permitting the free exercise of religious beliefs and \n     ceasing the persecution of members of religious groups and \n     denominations not registered with the state;\n       (E) holding free, competitives, and fair elections;\n       (F) making publicly available documentation of their \n     revenues and punishing those engaged in official corruption;\n       (2) the President of the United States, the Secretary of \n     State, and the Secretary of Defense should--\n       (A) continue to raise at the highest levels with the \n     governments of the nations of Central Asia specific cases of \n     political and religious persecution, and urge greater respect \n     for human rights and democratic freedoms at every diplomatic \n     opportunity;\n       (B) take progress in meeting the goals outlined in \n     paragraph (1) into account when determining the level and \n     frequency of United States diplomatic engagement with the \n     governments of the Central Asian nations, the allocation of \n     United States assistance, and the nature of United States \n     military engagement with the countries of the region;\n       (C) ensure that the provisions of the Foreign Operations \n     Appropriations Act are fully implemented to ensure that no \n     United States\n\n[[Page S10729]]\n\n     assistance benefits security forces in Central Asia \n     implicated in violations of human rights;\n       (D) follow the recommendations of the United States \n     Commission on International Religious Freedom by designating \n     Turkmenistan a Country of Particular Concern under the \n     International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 and by making \n     clear that Uzbekistan risks designation if conditions there \n     do not improve;\n       (E) work with the Government of Kazakhstan to create a \n     political climate free of intimidation and harassment, \n     including releasing political prisoners and permitting the \n     return of political exiles, most notably Akezan Kazegeldin, \n     and to reduce official corruption, including by urging the \n     Government of Kazakhstan to cooperate with the ongoing United \n     States Department of Justice investigation;\n       (F) support through United States assistance programs those \n     individuals, non-governmental organizations, and media \n     outlets in Central Asia working to build more open societies, \n     to support the victims of human righrs abuses, and to expose \n     official corruption; and\n       (3) increased levels of United States assistance to the \n     governments of the Central Asian nations made possible by \n     their cooperation in the war in Afghanistan can be sustained \n     only if there is substantial and continuing progress towards \n     meeting the goals outlined in paragraph (1).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S.J. Res. 51. A resolution to recognize the rights of consumers to \nuse copyright protected works, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution that \nspells out what I believe should be the basic rights of consumers to \nuse and enjoy legally acquired copyrighted works. The purpose of this \nresolution is simple: to establish the principle that as the Nation's \ncopyright system evolves and adapts to new technologies, it must \nrespect and preserve the interests of consumers. I am joined in this \neffort by my friend and frequent collaborator, Representative Chris \nCox, who has already introduced a similar resolution in the House.\n  In today's information age, intellectual property rules are the oil \nthat helps keep the economic engine running smoothly. Digitization and \nthe rise of the Internet have given the engine a big boost by creating \nnew and more efficient ways of circulating, manipulating, and using \ninformation. The pace of these developments has left the copyright \nsystem scrambling to keep up.\n  Industry working groups have been meeting over the past several years \nto negotiate new copy protection rules, but consumers have not always \nhad a prominent seat at the table, and there is a real risk that the \ninterests of consumers could get short shift. That is why I believe it \nis important to affirm that new copyright protection systems must not \nbe allowed to undermine or erode the existing rights and expectations \nof consumers. Existing copyright laws, under the doctrine of ``fair \nuse,'' permit consumers to make copies of content for limited, non-\ncommercial purposes. A new copyright regime for the digital world must \nnot narrow or limit these rights. It would be a terrible irony if the \nadvances in digital technology were to result in a step backwards for \nconsumers.\n  I expect to see a great deal of activity on this subject during the \nnext Congress--on the legislative front certainly, but also in further \nnegotiations between industry groups and in efforts to devise new \ntechnological approaches. To ensure that the scope of ``fair use'' in \nthe digital world will not be any narrower than it has been in the \nanalog world, I believe it would be helpful for Congress to spell out \nits expectations concerning what legitimate fair use includes. That is \nwhat this resolution aims to do. Specifically, it says that consumers \nof legally acquired content should be permitted to make copies for \npurposes of using the content later (time-shifting), using it in a \ndifferent place (space shifting), or making a backup; to use the \ncontent on different platforms or devices; to translate the content \ninto different formats; and to use technology to achieve any of these \npurposes. Copyright law should not give copyright holders the ability \nto prohibit such legitimate, personal, non-commercial activity.\n  It is clear to me that the content industries face very serious \nchallenges in preventing piracy, and that intellectual property \nprotections must be strong. People and companies that create \ncopyrighted works must be fairly compensated, and piracy must be \npunished. America's information-based economy depends on it.\n  But efforts to combat piracy must not come at the expense of \nlegitimate consumer uses of intellectual property. That would be \nthrowing out the baby with the bathwater.\n  I understand that the content industries have serious concerns about \nthis resolution. I have listened to them, and I can appreciate theirs \nfear that, for example, expressing consumer rights in too absolute a \nfashion could open the door to someone making 1,000 copies of a CD to \nshare with all their friends and acquaintances at no charge. That is \nnot my intention. So the resolution I am introducing specifies that the \nrights in question must be exercised in a reasonable, personal, and \nnon-commercial manner. The rights are not absolute.\n  Going forward, I intend to continue to listen to both sides of this \ndebate, and to support solutions that do not upset the balance in \nexisting law between commercial use and non-commercial, personal use. I \nwant to protect the interests of both copyright holders and consumers. \nBut the fact is, as of today, nobody in the Senate has stepped forward \nwith legislation on the consumer side of this issue. This resolution \nhelps fill that void.\n  Introducing this resolution now, with the end of this Congress \ndrawing near, Congressman Cox, and I are essentially laying down a \nmarker for next year's debate. I will work closely with my Chairman on \nthe Senate Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, and others to move the \nissue forward.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This resolution may be cited as the ``Resolution for the \n     Tripling of Biomedical Research''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that appropriations for the \n     National Institutes of Health should be tripled over the ten \n     year period from fiscal year 1999 to 2008.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to submit a \nresolution with respect to the National Institutes of Health. The \nprogress on medical research has been astounding, thanks to remarkable \nbiomedical research and achievements.\n  When I came to the Senate after being elected in 1980, the budget for \nthe National Institutes of Health was $3.6 billion. The Senate bill \nthis year will advance that funding to more than $27 billion, and a \ngood bit of that growth has been occasioned by the resolution which was \npassed in 1997 to double the NIH funding over a 5-year period.\n  Today I am submitting a resolution to triple the NIH funding over the \n10-year period from fiscal year 1999 through the 2008.\n  When the resolution was passed to double NIH funding, that was a \nstatement of the Senate's druthers, so to speak. It has been very hard \nto get the dollars, but we have managed to do so.\n  In 1998, Senator Tom Harkin, who was then ranking member, and I, \nchairman--Senator Harkin and I have passed the gavel back and forth, \nand it has been a seamless transition. I much prefer to be the \nchairman, but when Senator Harkin is the chairman, our partnership is \nsuch that we move ahead in the public interest. I learned a long time \nago, if you want to get something done in Washington, you have to cross \nparty lines.\n  In 1998, Senator Harkin and I asked for an additional $1 billion. The \nBudget Committee turned us down. We came to the floor and lost on a \nvote of 63 to 37, but got out our sharp pencils and\n\n[[Page S10731]]\n\nfound the $1 billion as a matter of priorities.\n  Having lost on the effort for $1 billion, we came back the next year \nand asked for $2 billion. Again, we were defeated on a floor vote. \nAgain, we established priorities and found the $2 billion. We had a \nnumber of votes and had difficulties in coming to the figure, but the \nlast recorded vote on the NIH budget was 96 to 4.\n  There have been remarkable achievements by the National Institutes of \nHealth. NIH research has developed effective treatments for acute \nleukemia.\n  NIH research in the past 30 years has doubled the life expectancy of \nsickle cell disease patients.\n  NIH research has resulted in the identification of the genetic \nmutations for osteoporosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou \nGehrig's disease, cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, skin cancer, \nbreast cancer, and prostate cancer.\n  A third of all known genetic defects affect the nervous system, and \nso far more than 200 genes have been identified that can cause or \ncontribute to neurological disorders, with a better understanding of \nmultiple gene influences on disease risk, progression, and severity.\n  Research by the NIH has brought remarkable progress with the first \ntreatments for acute stroke, spinal cord injury, new immune therapies \nthat ameliorate symptoms and slow the progression of multiple \nsclerosis, and increased drug and surgical options for Parkinson's \ndisease, epilepsy, and chronic pain.\n  Research sponsored by the National Institutes of Health has been key \nin the development of the MRI, magnetic resonance imaging, positron \nemission tomography, and other imaging technologies.\n  Emerging understanding of the principles of biomimetics has been \napplied to the development of hard tissue, such as bone and teeth, as \nwell as soft tissue, and this field of study holds great promise for \nthe design of new classes of biomaterials, pharmaceuticals, diagnostic \nand analytical reagents.\n\n  Notwithstanding all of these achievements, Americans continue to \nsuffer greatly. Women have traditionally been under-represented in \nmedical research protocols, yet are severely affected by diseases, \nincluding breast cancer, ovarian cancer, osteoporosis, and \ncardiovascular disorders.\n  Cancer remains a comprehensive threat to any tissue or organ of a \nbody at any age and remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.\n  The extent of psychiatric and neurological diseases poses \nconsiderable challenges in understanding the workings of the brain and \nnervous system.\n  Recent advances in the treatment of HIV illustrate the promise \nresearch holds for even more effective, accessible, and affordable \ntreatments for persons with HIV, but at least 320,000 Americans are now \nsuffering from AIDS and hundreds of thousands more with HIV infections.\n  The written resolution, which I am submitting, chronicles in greater \ndetail the severe problems facing Americans with Parkinson's, \nAlzheimer's, heart ailments, cancer, and many other afflictions, but \nalso we note the tremendous achievements of the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  There remains a great deal more to be done, and since November of \n1998, when the stem cell phenomenon came upon the scene, we now have a \nreal opportunity for enormous progress with stem cell research. That \nrequires a change in Federal law on the Federal funding, and it is \ncontroversial because stem cells come from embryos. They come from \nembryos which are discarded.\n  Characteristically, when a dozen or so embryos are created for in \nvitro fertilization, many--8, 9, 10--are discarded, thrown away. If \nthose embryos could produce life, that would be their highest form, and \nthat is what should be done. But if the choice is discarding them or \nusing them to save lives, it seems to me the choice is clear: To use \nthem to save lives.\n  Last year, I suggested, successfully, that we have $1 million for \nembryo adoption in our appropriations bill to encourage people to come \nforward and adopt embryos, but still many remain to be discarded.\n  Confusion has arisen over an issue of what is called therapeutic \ncloning which is confused with human cloning. There is, I think, a \nconsensus, if not unanimity, that human cloning is undesirable. But \nnuclear transplantation, which has been mislabeled as therapeutic \ncloning, offers lifesaving procedures.\n  In essence, it takes a skin cell from a person and places it into an \negg with the nucleus removed. The stem cells produced from this process \nare not rejected and can be inserted in the brain for people who suffer \nfrom Parkinson's.\n  Legislation will soon be proposed which will promote Federal funding \non important stem cell research which has the potential to save \nmillions of lives.\n  These issues of disease which confront America involve virtually all \nAmericans in terms of someone in a family or a friend or an \nacquaintance suffering from these ailments.\n  To reiterate, Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nsubmit a resolution to triple funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth over a 10-year period beginning in 1999.\n  As chairman, and now ranking member, of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee for Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and \nRelated Agencies, I have said many times that the National Institutes \nof Health is the crown jewel of the Federal Government--perhaps the \nonly jewel of the Federal Government. When I came to the Senate in \n1981, NIH spending totaled $3.6 billion. In fiscal year 2003, $27.1 \nbillion is recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee. If this \nrecommendation is signed into law, it will result in a doubling of the \nfiscal year 1998 level within a 5-year period. This money has been very \nwell spent. The successes realized by this investment in NIH have \nspawned revolutionary advances in our knowledge and treatment for \ndiseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, \nmental illness, diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease, ALS and many \nothers. It is clear that Congress' commitment to the NIH is paying off. \nNow it is crucial that increased funding be continued in order to \nconvert these advances into treatment and cures.\n  Our investment has resulted in new generations of AIDS drugs which \nare reducing the presence of the AIDS virus in HIV infected persons to \nnearly undetectable levels. Death rates from cancer have begun a steady \ndecline. With the sequencing of the human genome, we will begin, over \nthe next few years, to reap the benefits in many fields of research. \nAnd if scientists are correct, stem cell research could result in a \nveritable foundation of youth by replacing diseased or damaged cells. I \nanxiously await the results of all of these avenues of remarkable \nresearch. This is the time to seize the scientific opportunities that \nlie before us.\n  On May 21, 1997, the Senate passed a sense of the Senate resolution \nstating that funding for the NIH be doubled over 5 years. Regrettably, \neven though the resolution was passed by an overwhelming vote of 98 to \n0, the Budget Resolution contained a $100 million reduction for health \nprograms. That prompted Senator Harkin and myself to offer an amendment \nto the budget resolution to add $1.1 billion to carry out the expressed \nsense of the Senate to increase NIH funding. Unfortunately, our \namendment was tabled by a vote of 63 to 37. We were extremely \ndisappointed that, while the Senate had expressed its druthers on a \nresolution, it was simply unwilling to put up the actual dollars to \naccomplish this vital goal.\n  The following year, Senator Harkin and I again introduced an \namendment to the Budget Resolution which called for a $2 billion \nincrease for the NIH. While we gained more support on this vote than in \nthe previous year, our amendment was again tabled by a vote of 57 to \n41. Not to be deterred, Senator Harkin and I again went to work with \nour subcommittee and we were able to add an addition $2 billion to the \nNIH account for fiscal year 1999.\n  In fiscal year 2000, Senator Harkin and I yet again offered another \namendment to the Budget Resolution to add $1.4 billion to the health \naccounts, over and above the $600 million increase which had already \nbeen provided by the Budget Committee. Despite this amendment's defeat \nby a vote of 47 to 52, we were able to provide a $2.3 billion increase \nfor NIH in the fiscal year 2000 appropriation's bill.\n\n[[Page S10732]]\n\n  In fiscal year 2001, Senator Harkin and I yet again offered an \namendment to the Budget Resolution to increase funding for health \nprograms by $1.6 billion. This amendment passed by a vote of 55 to 45. \nThis victory brought the NIH increase to $2.7 billion for fiscal year \n2001. However, after late night conference negotiations with the House, \nthe funding for NIH was cut by $200 million below that amount.\n  In fiscal year 2002, the budget resolution once again fell short of \nthe amount necessary to achieve the NIH doubling. Senator Harkin and I, \nalong with nine other Senators offered an amendment to add an \nadditional $700 million to the resolution to achieve our goal. The vote \nwas 96 to 4. The Senate Labor-HHS Subcommittee reported a bill \nrecommending $23.7 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion over the \nprevious year's funding. But during conference negotiations with the \nHouse, we fell short of that amount by $410 million. That meant that in \norder to stay on a path to double NIH, we would need to provide an \nincrease of $3.7 billion in the fiscal year appropriations bill.\n\n  The fiscal year 2003 bill, reported on July 22, 2002, by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, contained $3.7 billion which will complete \nour doubling effort.\n  We have fought long and hard to achieve a doubling of the NIH \nresearch dollars, but until treatments and cures are found for the many \nmaladies that continue to plague our society, we must continue our \nfight.\n  I, like millions of Americans, have benefited tremendously from the \ninvestment we have made in the National Institutes of Health. That is \nwhy I offer this resolution today--to call upon the Congress to triple \nthe funding for the National Institutes of Health, so that we can \ncontinue to carry forward the important research work of the world's \npremier medical research facility.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the resolution, together \nwith a schedule which sets forth the progress necessary to achieve the \ntripling of the NIH funding over the allotted period, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       In FY1998, the NIH appropriation was $13.6 billion. In FY \n     2003, the Senate Committee mark is $27.2 billion. To achieve \n     tripling, the FY 2008 level must be $40.81 billion.

Jackson served as the Senator from the \n     State of Washington from January 3, 1953, to September 1, \n     1983;\n       Whereas Senator Jackson fought tirelessly, in spite of \n     opposition from the executive branch, to expose human rights \n     violations in the former Soviet Union and to find a way for \n     Soviet Jews to worship freely;\n       Whereas on October 4, 1972, Senator Jackson first \n     introduced legislation that linked United States trade \n     benefits, now known as normal trade relations, to the \n     emigration and human rights policies of Communist or formerly \n     Communist countries;\n       Whereas Senator Jackson, in introducing the legislation, \n     stated ``In moving as we are today we are giving birth to a \n     bipartisan coalition for freedom. It is the least we can \n     do.'';\n       Whereas Senator Jackson expressed the importance of \n     exposing the human rights situation in the former Soviet \n     Union by quoting Russian Nobel laureate Alexander \n     Solzhenitzyn's statement that ``there are no internal affairs \n     left on our crowded earth'';\n       Whereas Senator Jackson's legislation became known as the \n     Jackson-Vanik Amendment and was enacted into law on January \n     3, 1975, as title IV of the Trade Act of 1974;\n       Whereas by highlighting human rights abuses in the former \n     Soviet Union and other Communist countries, the Jackson-Vanik \n     Amendment helped pave the way toward the end of the Cold War, \n     aided in the activation of United States' and multilateral \n     mechanisms to promote human rights globally, including the \n     Helsinki Final Act, and reaffirmed the role of Congress in \n     formulating our Nation's human rights policy;\n       Whereas the Jackson-Vanik Amendment opened the door for \n     over 1,000,000 Jews to emigrate from the former Soviet Union \n     and its successor states;\n       Whereas since 1975, over 500,000 refugees from areas of the \n     former Soviet Union, many of them Jews, have been resettled \n     in the United States and over 1,000,000 Soviet Jews have \n     immigrated to Israel;\n       Whereas former Soviet dissident and current Israeli cabinet \n     minister Natan Sharansky called the Jackson-Vanik Amendment \n     ``the turning point not only in the exodus of the Jews but in \n     the ultimate victory of the West over the Soviet Union in the \n     Cold War'';\n       Whereas Natan Sharansky also hailed the Jackson-Vanik \n     Amendment as a ``historical and practical weapon'' for \n     Zionists that added to the spiritual weapon of their Jewish \n     heritage;\n       Whereas on the 20th anniversary of the passing of the \n     Jackson-Vanik Amendment, Ehud Olmert, the Mayor of Jerusalem, \n     stated that Henry Jackson was ``a leader, a pacesetter and an \n     inspiration for all, who forced his will on the U.S. \n     leadership and across the world''; and\n       Whereas October 4, 2002, marks the 30th anniversary of the \n     introduction of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes Senator Henry M. Jackson for the \n     introduction of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, a historic piece \n     of legislation that paved the way for millions of refugees to \n     flee Communist oppression and hastened the end of the Cold \n     War;\n       (2) commemorates the 30th anniversary of the introduction \n     of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment;\n       (3) reaffirms the commitment of the Senate to combating \n     human rights violations and promoting tolerance and freedom \n     throughout former Communist nations and worldwide; and\n       (4) congratulates Mrs. Helen Jackson and the Henry M. \n     Jackson Foundation for continuing Senator Jackson's vision \n     and passion for dialogue, understanding, and human freedom.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 349--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRINTING OF A REVISED EDITION \n                     OF THE SENATE RULES AND MANUAL\n\n  Mr. DODD submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 154\n\n       Whereas Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone was born in 1916 in \n     Buffalo, New York, son of Salvatore and Dora Basilone, one of \n     10 children;\n       Whereas John Basilone was raised and educated in Raritan, \n     New Jersey;\n       Whereas, at the age of 18, John Basilone enlisted in the \n     United States Army, principally seeing garrison service in \n     the Philippines;\n       Whereas, after his honorable discharge in 1937, Sergeant \n     Basilone, known by his comrades as ``Manila John'', returned \n     to Raritan;\n       Whereas, seeing the storm clouds of war hovering over the \n     Nation, and believing that his place was with this country's \n     fighting forces, Sergeant Basilone enlisted in the United \n     States Marine Corps in July 1940;\n       Whereas, on October 24 and 25, 1942, on Guadalcanal, \n     Solomon Islands, Sergeant Basilone was a member of ``C'' \n     Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Regiment, 1st Marine Division, \n     and was in charge of 2 sections of heavy machine guns \n     defending a narrow pass that led to Henderson Airfield;\n       Whereas, although Sergeant Basilone and his machine gunners \n     were vastly outnumbered and without available reinforcements, \n     Sergeant Basilone and his fellow Marines fought valiantly to \n     check the savage and determined assault by the Japanese \n     Imperial Army;\n       Whereas, for this action, Sergeant Basilone was awarded the \n     Congressional Medal of Honor and sent home a hero;\n       Whereas, in December 1944, Sergeant Basilone's restlessness \n     to rejoin his fellow Marines, who were fighting the bloody \n     island-to-island battles en route to the Philippines and \n     Japan, prompted him to volunteer again for combat;\n       Whereas, on Iwo Jima, on February 19, 1945, Sergeant \n     Basilone again distinguished himself by single-handedly \n     destroying an enemy blockhouse while braving heavy-caliber \n     fire;\n       Whereas, minutes later, an artillery shell killed Sergeant \n     Basilone and 4 of his platoon members;\n       Whereas Sergeant Basilone was posthumously awarded the Navy \n     Cross and Purple Heart, and a life-sized bronze statue stands \n     in Raritan, New Jersey, where ``Manila John'' is clad in \n     battle dress and cradles a machine gun in his arms;\n       Whereas, in 1949, the United States Government commissioned \n     a destroyer the U.S.S. Basilone, and in November 1951, \n     Governor Alfred E. Driscoll posthumously awarded Sergeant \n     Basilone the State of New Jersey's highest decoration;\n       Whereas, following World War II, Sergeant Basilone's \n     remains were reinterred in the Arlington National Cemetery;\n       Whereas Sergeant Basilone was the first recipient of the \n     Congressional Medal of Honor awarded in World War II;\n\n[[Page S10734]]\n\n       Whereas Sergeant Basilone was also awarded the Navy Cross \n     and the Purple Heart, giving him the distinction of being the \n     only enlisted Marine in World War II to receive all 3 medals; \n     and\n       Whereas commemorative postage stamps have been commissioned \n     to honor other great heroes in American history: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) a commemorative postage stamp should be issued by the \n     United States Postal Service honoring Gunnery Sergeant John \n     Basilone; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncalling on the United States Postal Service to issue a commemorative \npostage stamp honoring an extraordinary American hero: Gunnery Sergeant \nJohn Basilone. Basilone is the only person in American history to be \nawarded both the Congressional Medal of Honor and the Navy Cross. Only \none USPS stamp has ever commemorated an individual Marine, a stamp \nfeaturing John Phillip Sousa; it bears noting that although Sousa was a \nMarine, he was not selected for his service on the battlefield. It is \ntime to remember the tremendous sacrifice of at least one individual \nMarine, John Basilone, an American Patriot.\n  John Basilone was raised in Raritan, New Jersey, one of ten children \nin a large Italian-American family. Soon after he turned 18, Basilone \nheeded the patriotic call and enlisted in the US Army. Basilone was \nimmediately sent to the Philippines where he earned a nickname that \nwould stick with him for the rest of his career. ``Manila John.''\n  Following his tour of duty in 1937, Basilone returned to Raritan. But \nhe wouldn't stay there long. In July 1940--with much of Europe at war \nan the United States on the brink ``Manila John'' left New Jersey, \nenlisting in the military once again, this time joining the United \nStates Marine Corps.\n  On October 24, 1942, Basilone earned his Congressional Medal of \nHonor. He was sent to a position on the Tenaru River at Guadalcanal and \nplaced in command of two sections of heavy machine guns. Sergeant \nBasilone and his men were charged with defending Henderson Airfield, an \nimportant American foothold on the island. Although the Marine \nContingent was vastly outnumbered and without needed support, Basilone \nand his men successfully repelled a Japanese assault. Other survivors \nreported that their success can be attributed to one man: ``Manila \nJohn.'' He crossed enemy lines to replenish a dangerously low stockpile \nof ammunition, repaired artillery pieces, and steadied his troops in \nthe midst of torrential rain. He went several days and nights without \nfood or sleep, and the US military was able to carry the day. His \nexploits became Marine lore, and served as a patriotic inspiration to \nothers facing daunting challenges in the midst of war.\n  For his courage under fire and profound patriotism, Basilone was the \nfirst enlisted Marine to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in \nWorld War II. When he returned to the United States, he was heralded as \na hero and quickly sent on tour around the country to help finance the \nwar through the sale of war bonds. The Marine Corps offered to \ncommission Basilone as an officer and station him far away from the \nfrontlines.\n  But, Basilone was not interested in riding out the war in Washington, \nD.C. He was quoted as saying, ``I ain't no officer, and I ain't no \nmuseum piece. I belong back with my outfit.'' In December 1944, he got \nhis wish and returned to the frontlines.\n  General Douglas MacArthur called him ``a one-man army,'' and on \nFebruary 19, 1945 at Iwo Jima, Basilone once again lived up to that \nreputation. Basilone destroyed an enemy stronghold, a blockhouse on \nthat small Japanese island and commanded his young troops to move the \nheavy guns off the beach. Unfortunately, less than two hours into the \nassault on that fateful day in February, Basilone and four of his \nfellow marines were killed when any enemy mortar shell exploded nearby.\n  When Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone died, he was only 27, but he had \nalready earned the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Navy Cross, the \nPurple Heart, and the appreciation of his Nation. Basilone is a true \nAmerican patriot whose legacy should be preserved.\n  Now more than ever, the United States needs to honor and praise the \ncourageous efforts put forth by the men and woman of our military.

Mr. REID (for Mr. Dodd) proposed an amendment to the bill S. \n969, to establish a Tick-Borne Disorders Advisory Committee, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Lyme disease is a common but frequently misunderstood \n     illness that, if not caught early and treated properly, can \n     cause serious health problems.\n       (2) Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is \n     transmitted by a tick bite. Early signs of infection may \n     include a rash and flu-like symptoms such as fever, muscle \n     aches, headaches, and fatigue.\n       (3) Although Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics \n     if caught early, the disease often goes undetected because it \n     mimics other illnesses or may be misdiagnosed. Untreated, \n     Lyme disease can lead to severe heart, neurological, eye, and \n     joint problems because the bacteria can affect many different \n     organs and organ systems.\n       (4) If an individual with Lyme disease does not receive \n     treatment, such individual can develop severe heart, \n     neurological, eye, and joint problems.\n       (5) Although Lyme disease accounts for 90 percent of all \n     vector-borne infections in the United States, the ticks that \n     spread Lyme disease also spread other disorders, such as \n     ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and other strains of Borrelia. All \n     of these diseases in 1 patient makes diagnosis and treatment \n     more difficult.\n       (6) Although tick-borne disease cases have been reported in \n     49 States and the District of Columbia, about 90 percent of \n     the 15,000 cases have been reported in the following 10 \n     States: Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, \n     Rhode Island, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Delaware, \n     and Wisconsin. Studies have shown that the actual number of \n     tick-borne disease cases are approximately 10 times the \n     amount reported due to poor surveillance of the disease.\n       (7) Persistence of symptomatology in many patients without \n     reliable testing makes treatment of patients more difficult.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF A TICK-BORNE DISORDERS ADVISORY \n                   COMMITTEE.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Committee.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, there shall be \n     established an advisory committee to be known as the Tick-\n     Borne Disorders Advisory Committee (referred to in this Act \n     as the ``Committee'') organized in the Office of the \n     Secretary.\n       (b) Duties.--The Committee shall advise the Secretary and \n     Assistant Secretary of Health regarding how to--\n       (1) assure interagency coordination and communication and \n     minimize overlap regarding efforts to address tick-borne \n     disorders;\n       (2) identify opportunities to coordinate efforts with other \n     Federal agencies and private organizations addressing tick-\n     borne disorders; and\n       (3) develop informed responses to constituency groups \n     regarding the Department of Health and Human Services' \n     efforts and progress.\n       (c) Membership.--\n       (1) Appointed members.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall appoint voting members to the Committee from among the \n     following member groups:\n       (i) Scientific community members.\n       (ii) Representatives of tick-borne disorder voluntary \n     organizations.\n       (iii) Health care providers.\n       (iv) Patient representatives who are individuals who have \n     been diagnosed with tick-borne illnesses or who have had an \n     immediate family member diagnosed with such illness.\n       (v) Representatives of State and local health departments \n     and national organizations who represent State and local \n     health professionals.\n       (B) Requirement.--The Secretary shall ensure that an equal \n     number of individuals are appointed to the Committee from \n     each of the member groups described in clauses (i) through \n     (v) of subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Ex officio members.--The Committee shall have nonvoting \n     ex officio members determined appropriate by the Secretary.\n       (d) Co-chairpersons.--The Assistant Secretary of Health \n     shall serve as the co-chairperson of the Committee with a \n     public co-chairperson chosen by the members described under \n     subsection (c).

GOALS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that, in carrying out this \n     Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (referred to \n     in this section as the ``Secretary''), acting as appropriate \n     in consultation with the Director of the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention, the Director of the National \n     Institutes of Health, the Committee, and other agencies, \n     should consider carrying out the following:\n       (1) Five-year plan.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Secretary should consider the establishment of a plan that, \n     for the five fiscal years following the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, provides for the activities to be carried out \n     during such fiscal years toward achieving the goals under \n     paragraphs (2) through (4). The plan should, as appropriate \n     to such goals, provide for the coordination of programs and \n     activities regarding Lyme disease and other tick-borne \n     disorders that are conducted or supported by the Federal \n     Government.\n       (2) First goal: diagnostic test.--The goal described in \n     this paragraph is to develop a diagnostic test for Lyme \n     disease and other tick-borne disorders for use in clinical \n     testing.\n       (3) Second goal: surveillance and reporting of lyme disease \n     and other tick-borne disorders.--The goal described in this \n     paragraph is to accurately determine the prevalence of Lyme \n     disease and other tick-borne disorders in the United States.\n       (4) Third goal: prevention of lyme disease and other tick-\n     borne disorders.--The goal described in this paragraph is to \n     develop the capabilities at the Department of Health and \n     Human Services to design and implement improved strategies \n     for the prevention and control of Lyme disease and other \n     tick-borne diseases.

Mr. President, S. 2239, the FHA Downpayment \nSimplification Act, has been cosponsored by 23 Senators, including 15 \nmembers of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. This \nlegislation takes a program that has been in place since October, 1997, \nand makes it permanent. The program simplifies the downpayment process \nfor FHA borrowers which, in turn, makes it work better for lenders, \nrealtors, and sellers, as well. The bill was also amended by Senator \nReed and others to prevent an increase in the GNMA fee from taking \nplace in 2005. This fee increase is not\n\n[[Page S10744]]\n\nneeded for the safety or soundness of the GNMA program, and it raises \nthe costs of the program for homeowners. Finally, included with this is \nan amendment that has been worked out by Senators Corzine and Gramm to \nindex the FHA multifamily loan limits. This will help keep the \nmultifamily loan limits viable as costs go up in the future.\n  This legislation is supported by HUD, the Mortgage Bankers \nAssociation, the National Association of Realtors, and the National \nAssociation of Homebuilders. If the Congress does not act, the \nauthority to use the simplified downpayment calculation will expire at \nthe end of the year, resulting in a more complex process and higher \ncosts for thousands of American homebuyers.\n  I urge that the legislation, S. 2239, as reported out of the Banking \nCommittee be taken up with the amendment and passed. I ask unanimous \nconsent the letter from the Congressional Budget Office be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 18, 2002.\n     Hon.

The estimated costs are for \n     the provisions concerning down-payment simplification for \n     FHA's mortgage guarantee program, and the fee charged by \n     GNMA. These provisions are explained below.\n     Down-payment simplification\n       Currently, the down payment for FHA's single-family program \n     is calculated using a formula established in 1996. Under this \n     formula, the maximum mortgage amount that FHA could insure is \n     determined by a fixed percentage of the home value. The \n     authority to use this formula is scheduled to expire on \n     December 31, 2002, but this legislation would make its use \n     permanent.\n       Based on information from FHA, CBO estimates that \n     continuing the use of the current downpayment formula would \n     slightly increase the cost of guaranteeing FHA loans because \n     it would lead to a small increase in the loan-to-value (LTV) \n     ratios for about 15 percent of the loans guaranteed each year \n     after 2002. The LTV ratio indicates how much equity a \n     borrower initially has in the home, and serves as a good \n     predictor of the likelihood of default. On average, borrowers \n     with less equity (that is, higher LTV ratios) have higher \n     default rates than borrowers with more equity. We estimate \n     that this provision would increase the cost of guaranteeing \n     some loans, resulting in a cost of $6 million in 2003 and $40 \n     million over the 2003-2007 period. The estimated changes in \n     FHA's loan subsidy cost--which are treated as discretionary \n     spending--would be recorded in each year as new loans are \n     disbursed.\n     GNMA guarantee fee\n       GNMA is responsible for guaranteeing securities backed by \n     pools of mortgages insured by the federal government. (These \n     securities are known as mortgage-backed securities or MBS.) \n     In exchange for a fee charged to lenders or issuers of the \n     securities, GNMA guarantees the timely payments of scheduled \n     principal and interest due on the pooled mortgages that back \n     these securities. Under current law, GNMA charges lenders or \n     issuers an annual fee of 6 cents for every $100 (6 basis \n     points) of guaranteed mortgage-backed securities backed by \n     single-family loans. Furthermore, a fee increase to 9 basis \n     points is scheduled to take effect on October 1, 2004. \n     Section 901 would repeal that fee increase. CBO estimates \n     that eliminating the fee increase would increase the subsidy \n     rate associated with the single-family MBS program and \n     increase the demand for the program.\n       Based on information from GNMA, CBO estimates that lowering \n     guarantee fees would reduce the subsidy for the single-family \n     MBS program from negative 0.56 percent to negative 0.37 \n     percent. (As with the FHA single-family program, GNMA \n     guarantee fees for the mortgage-backed securities more than \n     offset the costs of expected defaults, resulting in net \n     collections from the MBS program.) Under the bill, CBO \n     expects that extending the lower fee of 6 basis points would \n     allow GNMA to remain competitive with other MBS programs and \n     continue to guarantee more than $100 billion worth of \n     mortgage-backed securities, as it does under the current fee \n     structure. Thus, while repealing the fee increase would \n     result in a less profitable program, this loss would be \n     partially offset by additional receipts stemming from an \n     expected increase in demand for GNMA services of about 25 \n     percent. On balance, CBO estimates that implementing this \n     provision would cost $56 million in 2005 and $173 million \n     over the 2005-2007 period.\n     S. 2239--FHA Downpayment Simplification Act of 2002\n       Summary: S. 2239 would permanently change the process the \n     Federal Housing Administration (FHA) uses to determine the \n     amount of a down payment that is necessary for mortgages on \n     the single-family homes that it insures. This legislation \n     also would repeal a 3 basis point increase in the Government \n     National Mortgage Association's (GNMA's) guarantee fee, \n     scheduled to be implemented in 2005 under current law.\n       CBO estimates that implementing this legislation would cost \n     $6 million in 2003 and $213 million over the 2003-2007 \n     period, assuming appropriation action consistent with the \n     bill. Enacting this bill would not affect direct spending or \n     receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not \n     apply.\n       S. 2239 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 2239 is shown in the following table. \n     The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 370 \n     (mortgage and housing credit).\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 2239 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in UMRA and would impose no costs on state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Previous CBO estimates: On August 21, 2002, CBO transmitted \n     a cost estimate for H.R. 3995, the Housing Affordability Act \n     of 2002, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the \n     Judiciary on July 23, 2002, and on September 10, 2002, CBO \n     transmitted a cost estimate for H.R. 3995 as ordered reported \n     by the House Committee on Financial Services on July 9, 2002. \n     Both versions of H.R. 3995 include the provision included in \n     S. 2239, and our cost estimates are the same.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Susanne S. Mehlman. \n     Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Greg Waring. \n     Impact on the Private Sector: Cecil McPherson.\n       Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n\n[[Page S10745]]\n\n\n  Mr. REID.

I ask unanimous consent that we now proceed to S. Res. 350 \nintroduced earlier today by Senator Feinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 350) expressing sympathy for those \n     murdered and injured in the terrorist attack in Bali, \n     Indonesia, on October 12, 2002.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, on October 12, the world was shocked as \nwe learned of the tragedy in Indonesia. As news spread across the \nglobe, we heard about the victims, the missing, and the utter \ndevastation unleashed by a group of nameless and faceless murderers. \nNew Yorkers and Americans understand the grief that has enveloped those \nwho lost loved ones in the Bali bombing, and we wish them solace in \nthis time of great personal loss.\n  This was the largest terrorist attack since September 11, and while \n13 months have passed since that fateful day in September, the images \nof that day remain crystal clear in our minds. While words often fail \nto provide comfort, perhaps knowing that there are others who can \nempathize with the shock that's felt in the days and weeks and months \nafter such a tragedy, can console a grieving nation, city, and friend.\n  After the attacks on the World Trade Centers, New Yorkers were so \ngrateful for the outpouring of support that came from every corner of \nthe globe. It is a sense of solidarity that no country wishes to share, \nbut we must use it to strengthen our efforts in our war against \nterrorism.\n  In the weeks and months ahead, New Yorkers will do everything we can \nto help those impacted by the bombings in Bali. This act of terror has \ntaken nearly 200 lives and injured hundreds. These were parents, \nchildren, husbands and wives and friends from so many countries: \nIndonesia, Australia, Japan, Italy, Great Britain, South Korea, \nGermany, and two Americans. Five Americans are still unaccounted for. \nFor many, watching family members go to hospitals in Bali carrying \npictures of their loved ones is an all too familiar sight. But every \nopportunity to maintain hope in a desperate time should be pursued.\n  Bali is known as a peaceful place where people from many different \nreligions, races, and backgrounds can come for relaxation and \nrecreation. Its hospitality is honored around the world. These bombings \nwere a deliberate attempt to disrupt that tranquility and undermine the \nIndonesian government and its economy. We stand with the Indonesian \ngovernment as they seek to punish those who are responsible and root \nout the terrorists in their midst.\n  Australia was also deeply impacted by these bombings, and to date \nthey are mourning the loss of 33 citizens and wait desperately to learn \nabout 119 who are still missing. In New York's time of need, Australia \nprovided us with so much kindness and generosity. They supported our \nefforts to defend freedom and we send our deepest condolences to the \nAustralian people.\n  Last week, we were reminded that the terrorists are still organized \nand determined to inflict violence and bloodshed in furtherance of \ntheir destructive goals. Whether it is murdering innocent people on \nvacation or bombing a French tanker in Yemen or killing American \nsoldiers in Kuwait, those who wish to do us harm will continue to \ndisrupt this world until we stop them. We must maintain our resolve to \nseek out and destroy every network in every country until the war on \nterror has been won.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the resolution and preamble be \nagreed to, en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements in relation thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 350) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 443, S. 2530.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2530) to amend the Inspector General Act of \n     1978--5 U.S.C. App--to establish police powers for certain \n     Inspector General agents engaged in official duties and \n     provide an oversight mechanism for the exercise of those \n     powers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking \nup S. 2530, a bill to provide statutory law enforcement authority for \ncertain Inspectors General, which I have introduced along with Senator \nLieberman. In July of 2000, the Governmental Affairs Committee held a \nhearing on Inspector General issues. Among the issues addressed in that \nhearing was the need for statutory law enforcement authority. This bill \nwas reported favorably by the committee on June 25, 2002 without \nopposition.\n  Currently there are 23 Offices of Inspector General whose qualified \nlaw enforcement agents are deputized by the Attorney General on a \nperiodic basis. Over the last five years, IGs have been responsible for \nover 25,000 successful criminal prosecutions, over $12 billion in \ninvestigative recoveries, and over 35,000 suspensions and debarments \nbased on their investigations. In addition, they have played key roles \nin numerous joint task forces with Federal, State and local law \nenforcement officials. Under the current system, the Attorney General \nmust renew each of these law enforcement deputations periodically.\n  Unfortunately, there are some problems that exist under the current \nregime. First, the deputation process places a heavy burden on the U.S. \nMarshals Service. The Marshals Service is given responsibility for \n2,500 IG agents without sufficient resources to conduct proper \noversight. In addition, as we learned at our hearing, gaps in the \nrenewal process could compromise ongoing investigations. Finally, many \nare concerned that the current blanket deputation process could leave \nan agent's actions open to legal challenge.\n  This bill would remedy these problems without conferring any \nadditional authorities on the IGs. And it provides for more oversight \nthan currently exists under the deputation process. Specifically, it \nrequires that the IGs conduct periodic peer reviews of their use of law \nenforcement authority and to provide reports from those reviews to the \nrelevant IG as well as the Attorney General. Those peer reviews are not \ncurrently required under the deputation process. If the Attorney \nGeneral determines than an IG no longer needs law enforcement \nauthority, or that an IG has violated relevant guidelines, then that \nauthority can be rescinded. Simply put, by making the process \nstatutory, we will solidify a process already in place, provide for \nmore oversight of the law enforcement authority than currently exists, \nand relieve some unnecessary administrative burdens.\n  In addition, I believe that the bill is even more important in light \nof the events of September 11. The IGs provided valuable personnel and \nlaw enforcement assistance in the months following the tragedy. They \nserved as sky marshals while permanent personnel were being trained. \nThey helped the FBI run down leads in its followup investigation. And \nthey worked within their own agencies to provide information about \nindividuals on the FBI's watch list. The IG community's law enforcement \nagents provide a valuable\n\n[[Page S10750]]\n\nservice to this country, on top of the valuable service they provide \nevery day, and they deserve to be recognized for what they are--\nvaluable law enforcement agents.\n  I am pleased that the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation have written to me in support of the legislation. The \nJustice Department suggested one change in the legislation--that the \nAttorney General be allowed to rescind law enforcement authority for \nindividual agents as well as for entire offices--and I am happy to add \nthat provision. I am gratified that the Senate will move forward with \nthis important legislation and send it to the House.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of each of these letters be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2002.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Governmental Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thompson: This responds to your request for \n     the views of the Department of Justice on S. 2530, a bill \n     ``[t]o amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. \n     App.) to establish police powers for certain Inspector \n     General agents engaged in official duties and provide an \n     oversight mechanism for the exercise of those powers.'' \n     Subject to the concern outlined below, we support enactment \n     of this legislation.\n       Under administrative procedures that are currently in \n     place, Inspector General agents are granted ``blanket special \n     deputations'' (including law enforcement authorities, such as \n     the authority to make arrests and to carry firearms) by the \n     Attorney General. As part of this program, the Attorney \n     General is able to rescind or suspend the police powers of \n     individual Inspector General agents for failure to comply \n     with guidelines governing the exercise of the special \n     deputation police powers that the Attorney General has \n     granted. Proposed section 6(e)(5) of the Inspector General \n     Act, however, only permits the Attorney General to rescind or \n     suspend the police powers of an entire Office of Inspector \n     General upon a determination that the respective Office has \n     not complied with applicable guidelines promulgated by the \n     Attorney General. Because such an action against an entire \n     Office of Inspector General could severely disrupt numerous \n     ongoing criminal investigations, such an enforcement \n     mechanism is neither desirable nor practicable. Accordingly, \n     we strongly recommend that the Attorney General's current \n     authority to suspend police powers of individual agents for \n     failures to comply with applicable Attorney General \n     guidelines or standards be incorporated in the bill as an \n     important component of the oversight of the respective \n     Inspectors General offices.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views \n     regarding this legislation. If we may be of additional \n     assistance, we trust that you will not hesitate to call upon \n     us. The Office of Management and Budget has advised that \n     there is no objection from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program to the presentation of this report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Daniel J. Bryant,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 4, 2002.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Governmental Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thompson: The Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     supports the passage of S. 2530, a bill ``[t]o amend the \n     Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C.

The FBI reviewed the bill and \n     made some recommendations which were forwarded to the \n     Department of Justice. The Department of Justice has \n     forwarded its recommendations to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Robert S.

Mr. President, today I rise to thank my colleagues for \ntheir unanimous support of S. 2936 which will adjust Federal employees \nretirement computations to offset reductions in their retirement \narising from on-the-job injuries covered by the Workers Compensation \nprogram. An extraordinary amount of hard work went into this \nlegislation and I would like to thank my colleague from New York, \nSenator Clinton, for her most valuable assistance on her side of the \naisle in pushing this important measure through the legislative \nprocess. I would also like to thank Senators Akaka, Cochran, Lieberman, \nand Thompson of the Governmental Affairs Committee for their advice and \nbipartisan support, and Senator Warner for his support from the first \nday I introduced this bill.\n  S. 2936 addresses a problem in the retirement program for federal \nemployees that has been recognized but unresolved since 1986 when the \ncurrent retirement system was established. Unfortunately, complications \narising from the Tax Code and the Workers Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \nhave blocked any solution.\n  My resolve to address the problem was inspired by Ms. Louise Kurtz, a \nfederal employee who was severely injured in the September 11 attack on \nthe Pentagon. She suffered burns over 70% of her body, lost her \nfingers, yet fights daily in rehabilition and hopes to return to work \nsome day. Current law does not allow Mrs. Kurtz to contribute to her \nretirement program while she is recuperating and receiving Worker's \nCompensation disability payments. As a result, after returning to work \nand eventually retiring, she will find herself inadequately prepared \nand unable to afford to retire because of the lack of contributions \nduring her recuperation.\n  As Ms. Kurtz's situation reveals, federal employees under the Federal \nEmployees Retirement System who have sustained an on-the-job injury and \nare receiving disability compensation from the Department of Labor's \nOffice of Workers' Compensation Programs are unable to make \ncontributions or payments into Social Security or the Thrift Savings \nPlan. Therefore, the future retirement benefits from both sources are \nreduced.\n  This legislation offsets the reductions in Social Security and Thrift \nSavings Plan retirement benefits by increasing the Federal Employees \nRetirement System Direct Benefit calculation by one percentage point \nfor extended periods of disability.\n  The passage of this bill ensures that the pensions of our hard-\nworking federal employees will be kept whole during a period of injury \nand recuperation, especially now that many of them are on the \nfrontlines of protecting our homeland security in this new war on \nterror. By protecting the retirement security of injured federal \nemployees, we have provided an incentive for them to return to work and \nincreased our ability to retain our most dedicated and experienced \nfederal workers. This is a reasonable and fair approach in which the \nwhole Senate has acted in a logical and compassionate manner.\n  I wish to reiterate my gratitude to Senators Lieberman and Thompson \nand their staffs for their assistance in passing this legislation. I \nalso wish to thank Office of Personnel Management Director Kay Coles \nJames and Harry Wolf, Ted Newland, and Mary Ellen Wilson of her staff \nfor helping craft this legislative solution to a heretofore insolvable \nproblem. They are truly wonderful, creative, caring, and principled \nleaders who worked long hours to accomplish this equitable solution.\n  I am glad to see the Senate come together and pass this important \nlegislation and again thank my colleague from New York for her \nleadership. I have truly enjoyed working with her for the successful \npassage of this positive and constructive legislation that will improve \nthe retirement security of America's dedicated federal employees.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate agree to the committee \nsubstitute; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the \ntitle amendment be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable with no\n\n[[Page S10752]]\n\nintervening action or debate, and that any statements relating to this \nmeasure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the consideration of H.R. 5651.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5651) to amend the Federal Food, Drug and \n     Cosmetic Act to make improvements in the regulation of \n     medical devices, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support passage of H.R. \n5651, ``The Medical Device User Fee and\n\n[[Page S10753]]\n\nModernization Act of 2002.'' Just as passage of a user-fee program was \na breakthrough in the regulation of critical prescription drugs, this \nlegislation is a breakthrough in regulation of lifesaving medical \ndevices, devices that can open blocked arteries, keep hearts beating, \nsave the lives of stroke patients, and diagnose deadly cancers in time \nfor effective treatment.\n  Currently, because FDA lacks adequate resources, too many critical \ndevices are unnecessarily slowed in their progress to patients' \nbedsides by the regulatory process. At the same time, careful FDA \noversight is essential to assure that patients not suffer serious \ninjury or even lose their lives because of devices which are unsafe or \nineffective.\n  By assessing a modest fee on device manufacturers, raising the level \nof appropriated funds, and setting ambitious performance targets for \nthe FDA, this bill is just what the doctor ordered to speed life-saving \ndevices to the market while protecting the public health.\n  The goal of establishing a user-fee program for medical devices is \none that I have pursued for more than a decade. I am gratified that \nthis legislation finally brings that goal to fruition. It will mean \nlife and hope for thousands of patients each year.\n  The legislation also improves regulation of potentially faulty and \nharmful reprocessed devices. Patients deserve to know that the devices \nthat are used in their medical treatment are safe and effective, \nwhether they are being used for the first time or whether they are \nbeing reused.\n  The legislation provides for a new regime of third party inspections \nfor device manufacturers who manufacture products for both the United \nStates and export. This regime will reduce duplicative inspections, \nwhile assuring that FDA remains the final arbiter and safety check on \nthe quality of the manufacturing process for medical devices.\n  For many years, the FDA's Center for devices and Radiological Health, \nCDRH, has needed additional funding and staff to better assure the \nsafety and effectiveness of new and innovative medical technologies. As \nthe coauthor of the Medical device User Fee Act of 1994, I have long \nadvocated medical device user fees and I am proud that we have finally \nsecured such funding through a fair and efficient system of user fees.\n  This legislation will provide great benefits to patient health and \nsafety. I am confident that these fees will assure greater certainty \nfor consumers and manufacturers that the FDA can meet its statutory \nresponsibilities for the timely and thorough review of medical devices.\n  Under Federal law, medical devices must be reviewed by the FDA prior \nto marketing. These reviews must be completed in accordance with \nambitious statutory timeframes. While the FDA has done an excellent job \nof reviewing lower risk devices in a timely manner, it has frequently \nlacked the resources and staff to achieve similar success with the most \nsophisticated devices, which require premarket approval.\n  Under this legislation, device companies will pay the FDA fees for \nthe application they submit for review. These fees will raise nearly \n$150 million over the next 5 years. The legislation also calls for tens \nof millions of dollars in newly appropriated funding for the FDA's \ndevice center.\n  These funds will be devoted to reviewing device applications and to \nassuring the post-market safety of devices. I am pleased that the \nlegislation authorizes an additional $3 million in fiscal year 2003 and \n$6 million in fiscal year 2004 for the post-market surveillance of \nmedical devices.\n  I want to acknowledge the contributions of Senator Hatch in ensuring \nthat the user fees are fair and equitable to small businesses and \nstartup companies.\n  The user-fee program will sunset after 5 years, allowing Congress to \nreview whether it has expedited the review of devices and whether \nimprovements are needed to better assure public health and safety.\n  In addition to medical device user fees, the legislation strengthens \nthe FDA's regulation of reprocessed devices. I believe that the \nAmerican people will greatly benefit from the new requirements for \nsubstantial equivalence determinations and premarket approvals of such \ndevices. I am particularly pleased that there are robust requirements \nfor the assurance of safety and effectiveness of any reprocessed class \nIII devices, such as angioplasty balloons or heart valves.\n  Finally, the legislation authorizes a 10-year program for third-party \ninspections of device manufacturing plants. This will enable FDA to \nbetter target its enforcement resources--resources that we also \nincrease in the legislation. To ensure that third parties operate \nappropriately, the bill places important controls over conflicts of \ninterest and places third parties at risk of significant civil \nmonetary, criminal, and debarment penalties, if they act in a manner \ninconsistent with public health and safety.\n  Moreover, the bill limits inspections to plants which manufacture \ndevices for export, and ensures that FDA conduct every third inspection \nbefore additional third-party inspections take place.\n  Let me acknowledge the important work of Congressmen Tauzin, Dingell, \nGreenwood, Congresswoman Eshoo, and Senator Gregg, the ranking member \nof the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, in drafting \nthis legislation. I also want to acknowledge the leadership role played \nby Senator Wellstone in moving this legislation through the Senate, and \nby Senator Durbin in enduring strong protections over reprocessed \ndevices.\n  I would like to thank FDA Deputy Commissioner Lester Crawford, \nAssociate Commissioner Peggy Dotzell, Associate Commissioner Amit \nSachdev, Center for Devices Director David Feigel, Linda Kahan, and \nFrank Claunts.\n  I want to recognize the hard work and dedication of Michael Myers, \nDavid Nexon, David Dorsey, and Paul Kim on my staff, as well as Vince \nVentimiglia with Senator Gregg, Pat Morrisey, and Brent Delmonte with \nCongressman Tauzin, and John Ford and David Nelson with Congressman \nDingell.\n  Let me also recognize the contributions of Patti Unruh and Richard \nMcKeon with Senator Wellstone, Lisa German and Daborah Wolf with \nSenator Jack Reed, Adam Gluck with Senator Harkin, Deborah Barrett and \nStephanie Sikora with Senator Dodd, Christina Ho with Senator Clinton, \nRhonda Richards with Senator Mikulski, Anne Grady with Senator Murray, \nDean Rosen with Senator Frist, Anne Marie Murphy with Senator Durbin, \nBruce Artim and Trisha Knight with Senator Hatch, Karen Nelson and Ann \nWitt with Congressman Waxman, and Steve Tilton with Congressman \nBilirakis.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of H.R. 5651, \n``The Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002.''\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments \nconcerning the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002, \nwhich was passed by both the House and Senate earlier this morning.\n  This legislation was the product of a tremendous amount of hard \nwork--from folks in both Chambers and on both sides of the aisle--and \nincludes the most significant improvements in the way medical devices \nare reviewed and regulated, arguably since 1976.\n  More importantly, these changes will have a very positive and lasting \nimpact on both patients and consumers.\n  The legislation accomplishes this in several ways:\n  User Fees: First, it ensures adequate resources for the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA), by creating a new user-fee program, modeled after \nthe one used to review drugs and biologics--which has been incredibly \nsuccessful.\n  FDA resources at the device center have dramatically declined in the \nlast 10 years, resulting in significant staff turn-over (as high as \n10%) and increased review times (more than 400 days per submission when \nthe statute requires reviews of 180 days).\n  By charging manufacturers a reasonable fee for reviewing their \nproducts, FDA can hire more staff, meet review deadlines, and ensure \nthat patients have timely access to the newest, most innovative medical \ntechnologies. I particularly want to thank my friend from Utah, Senator \nHatch, for his work on this issue.\n  Moreover, in order to protect some of the smaller companies--\nincluding a substantial number in New Hampshire--the bill in many cases \nexempt or significantly reduce these fees.\n\n[[Page S10754]]\n\n  Re-Use: Second, the legislation provides greater protection to \npatients from reused and reprocessed medical devices. The bill ensures \nthat medical devices--especially some of the more delicate, high risk \nproducts, such as angioplasty balloons--are not used over and over \nagain on different patients without first demonstrating that this can \nbe done safely and reliably.\n  On that note, I would especially like to thank Senator Durbin for his \ninvaluable assistance in working with us to craft this very important \nprovision. I believe that it will save a great many lives. The \nlegislation that he and I worked on this summer and have introduced \nseparately today represents the foundation for the final product \nincluded in this bill.\n  Third-Party Inspections: Third, it increases the frequency and \nquality of inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities--both \nhere and abroad--by allowing inspections from FDA-accredited third-\nparties.\n  On average, the FDA is currently able to inspect a U.S. facility only \nonce every 7 years, and foreign facilities once every 11 years. This is \nunacceptable and in direct contravention to the current statutory \nrequirement for inspections every 2 years.\n  By augmenting FDA's inspection capabilities, we will help ensure that \nthese medical devices are being manufactured in accordance with \nestablished manufacturing practices.\n  Modernizing FDA: Finally, the bill brings FDA regulation into the \n21st century, by instituting electronic labeling, electronic \nregistration, and modular reviews of applications. It also establishes \na more effective review process for the fastest wave of innovative \ncombination biotechnologies, including drug and biologics coated \nstents, drug pumps, and engineered tissues.\n  Working together, these changes will give FDA the tools it needs to \nwork more effectively, and to get the next generation of life-saving \nmedical devices into the hands of doctors and patients more quickly \nthan ever before.\n  I am also pleased to report that this legislation is widely supported \nby the administration, FDA, patient/consumer groups, industry, and \nprovider/hospital groups.\n  I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish here today and \nbelieve that this legislation will have a tremendous positive impact on \npeople's lives as they enjoy the benefits of today and tomorrow's \nmedical technology.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to applaud my colleagues in \nboth the House and the Senate, particularly Congressman Billy Tauzin, \nCongressman John Dingell, Senator Judd Gregg, and Senator Ted Kennedy, \nfor reaching a compromise on this important legislation. I know that \nthere were several difficult issues to be negotiated, and I am pleased \nthat we were able to reach a bipartisan agreement before the end of \nthis Congress.\n  I support this legislation because, first and foremost, it could \nincrease the quality of patient care. At the same time, it will also \nprove beneficial to the manufacturers who make these devices, and the \nhospitals and health care providers that use them. By creating a system \nof user fees for FDA approval of medical devices, we are ensuring that \nlife-improving and life-saving technologies will be available on the \nmarket in a more efficient and timely manner. Put more simply, this \nbill could save lives. In creating a user fee structure, we are \nexpanding a model that has already proven dramatically successful in \nthe prescription drug market.\n  This bill will also have a positive impact on patient safety by \nexpanding FDA regulation of the medical device reprocessing industry. \nDevice reprocessing can certainly be beneficial when used \nappropriately. There are environmental benefits, as well as cost \nsavings for hospitals. However, we must ensure that patient safety is \nnot sacrificed. This legislation will do that by providing us with a \nbetter understanding of the impact that reprocessing has on the safety \nand efficacy of devices, and allowing the FDA to prevent the \nreprocessing of devices when safety is in question.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for working so diligently to come to \nthis agreement, and I proudly support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10754-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10754-S10755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today on behalf of \nthe Health Care Safety Net Amendments Act, which passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a wide margin earlier this week. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this critical bill. This legislation represents \nan important next step towards improving the quality and availability \nof health care services for our nation's uninsured and medically \nunderserved.\n  This critical legislation strengthens our Nation's health care safety \nnet and is vital to helping millions of uninsured Americans get the \nhealth care they need. Far too many Americans lack health insurance \ntoday. We must tackle this problem head on to reduce the number of \npeople who are not receiving care. This bill takes important steps to \nexpand access to care and responds to the challenges providers, \nparticularly our community health centers, face.\n  The Health Care Safety Net Amendments Act reauthorizes the \nConsolidated Health Center program, the National Health Service Corps \nand the rural health outreach and telehealth grant programs, and \nestablishes the Healthy Communities Access Program. Together, these \nprograms represent our first line of defense in providing health care \nto the nation's uninsured and underserved. The bill increases funding \nfor these programs, expands access to health centers, improves existing \nhealth infrastructures and takes steps to improve the recruitment and \nretention of health professionals in underserved areas.\n  A key component of the bill is an increase in funding for the \nConsolidated Health Centers program, providing more than $1.3 billion \nfor this program. This increase further demonstrates the commitment to \nthis program, which today serves more than 9 million people each year. \nThis is critical to achieving President Bush's goal of doubling the \nnumber of community health centers across America.\n  In 1996, the Health Centers Consolidation Act reauthorized the \ncommunity health centers, the migrant health centers, health centers \nfor the homeless, and health centers for residents of public housing \nuntil 2001. Today, our nation's health centers face difficult \nenvironmental and operational challenges. Not only do they serve a \nsignificant number of uninsured and increasing numbers of immigrants, \nbut health centers are also affected by aging facilities and \ndifficulties in recruitment, retention, and retraining of health center \nleadership. Today's legislation responds to those difficulties in order \nto reinforce the important work being done by our Nation's health \ncenters.\n  The bill also expands and strengthens the National Health Service \nCorps, a program that has placed over 20,000 health care providers in \nhealth professional shortage areas in the last 30 years. Presently, \nover 4 million people currently receive care from National Health \nService Corps clinicians. However, to help communities meet their basic \nhealth care needs, more clinicians are needed in these areas. The \nlegislation improves recruitment and retention of health care \nprofessionals through expanded use of scholarship and loan repayment \nprograms and added flexibility for local communities.\n  Finally, data indicates that uninsured individuals receive most of \ntheir care from private health care providers and that private \nhospitals bear over 60 percent of the costs of uncompensated care; and \nprivate, office-based physicians provide more than 75 percent of the \nambulatory care for uninsured patients with Medicaid coverage. Given \nthis, today's bill takes into account safety net providers other than \nthose supported by Consolidated Health Centers and the National Health \nService Corp, such as local hospitals and emergency room departments, \npublic health departments, home health agencies, and many other health \ncare organizations, through the establishment of the Healthy \nCommunities Access Program that seeks to integrate all of the safety \nnet providers within a community.\n  I appreciate the hard work and dedication to this issue among my \ncolleagues, including Senators Kennedy, Gregg and Bond and \nRepresentatives Tauzin, Dingell, Bilirakis and Brown. I also appreciate \nthe hard work of my\n\n[[Page S10755]]\n\nstaff, Shana Christrup, Craig Burton and Dean Rosen, on this important \nbill.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my reservations with the \nMedical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002. While the \nlegislation offers some improvements to the current medical device \napproval and regulation process, I have serious concerns about some \naspects of the bill and about the process leading to its impending \npassage in the Senate.\n  User fees will allow the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, to \nexpedite the review and approval of medical devices, resulting in \nfaster patient access to new and potentially lifesaving technologies. \nThird party inspections similarly have the potential to enhance the \nagency's ability to ensure that manufacturing sites are meeting FDA \nquality standards for device production. And regulating the \nreprocessing of single use devices should be a positive step for the \nsafe use of these devices. All of these elements of the legislation, \nhowever, carry significant potential risk. In our attempts to enhance \nthe efficiency of an agency to which we are not able to give adequate \nappropriations, we run the risk of undermining FDA's scientific and \npolicy authority and its vital public health mission.\n  It will be up to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, of which I am a member, to pay close attention to the health \nand safety implications of these provisions as they are implemented. As \npart of that ongoing oversight, the committee should review and \nevaluate the manner in which the bill was written and passed. While I \nunderstand the importance of this legislation, I am deeply troubled by \nthe lack of a formal process in its development and consideration. I \nassure you and my colleagues that I will be paying close attention as \nthese new provisions are implemented in the coming months, and I urge \nmy colleagues to do likewise to protect the public health and maintain \nthe vital mission of the FDA.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to this matter be printed in \nthe Record with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 5651) was read a third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10755-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10755-S10767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET AMENDMENTS OF 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nsupport of the Senate passage of the Health Care Safety Net Amendment \nof 2002--a bill that could not have been realized without the strong \nsupport received from both sides of the aisle. I want to commend \nSenator Frist and Senator Gregg for their unfailing dedication to the \ngoals of this legislation. Senator Reed and Senator Harkin contributed \nto this bill in important ways by expanding access in underserved areas \nto pharmacists and chiropractic doctors. I also must express my \nappreciation to Congressmen Bill Tauzin, Mike Bilirakis, Sherrod Brown, \nand John Dingell for all their hard work in reaching agreement. Most of \nall, I would like to recognize the unfaltering efforts of Senator Dodd, \nwho as always, was determined to improve the delivery and quality of \nhealth care to poor and vulnerable populations.\n  Thirty years ago, Congress created the health centers program in \nresponse to an urgent need. At that time, there were growing numbers of \nAmericans who lived in medically underserved areas and lacked access to \nbasic primary care. And for the past three decades, the health centers \nprogram fulfilled the crucial role of a safety net for our nation's \nmost vulnerable and underserved populations.\n  I am proud of the hard work and dedication of our community health \ncenters. In 2000, health centers provided more than 9.6 million people \nwith cost-effective, high quality, preventive and primary care at more \nthan 3,000 sites across the country. Of those served, 500,000 people \nwere homeless, 600,000 were migrant and seasonal farm workers and \n55,000 were residents of public housing. Clearly, this program has been \nsuccessful in meeting the goals of its creators.\n  That is why I urge the Senate to approve the Safety Net Amendments of \n2002--critical legislation that includes the reauthorization of the \ncommunity health center program. Today, the need for a robust safety \nnet is more pressing than ever before. The Census Bureau recently \nreported an increase in the numbers of uninsured to 41.2 million, an \nastounding 14.6% of the population.\n  This increase resulted from a drop in the number of people covered by \nemployment-based health insurance. With the economy in its weakened \nstate, the Congress cannot sit idly by as more and more Americans see \ntheir access to health care slip from their grasp. Once more, Congress \nmust recognize a responsibility to ensure adequate health care to all \nAmericans and strengthen the programs that have been proven effective \nin delivering care to the uninsured.\n  Passage of the Safety Net Amendments is the first step to closing the \ndangerous gaps in our health care system. Not only does it strengthen \nthe community health center program, it also reauthorizes and improves \nthe National Health Service Corps, a program that enables health care \nproviders to serve in medically underserved areas. The bill enhances \nthe delivery and integration of rural health care services. It \nencourages the development of innovative telehealth technologies that \ncan connect remote areas with providers. It addresses the serious \nshortages in dental care in many communities across the country. \nFinally, it authorizes the Healthy Communities Access Program (HCAP), \nan existing initiative that has been successful in integrating and \nimproving care to needy populations. This program brings together \npublic and private providers and encourages them to work collectively \nto enhance the health care of the uninsured. HCAP has spurred the \ndevelopment of creative and effective solutions to health care delivery \nproblems that are models of innovation and collaboration for us all.\n\n  In approving, the Safety Net bill, we will not only offer hope to \nmillions of struggling families, but we will provide them with the \nsecurity that even without health insurance, there is someone they can \nturn to for help.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am proud to support the Health Care \nSafety Net conference agreement passed today. This legislation re-\nauthorizes and strengthens several programs that provide critical \nservices to the uninsured and medically underserved. With the recent \nannouncement by the U.S. Census Bureau that there are now 41.5 million \nuninsured Americans, this legislation comes at a crucial time. The \nsafety net legislation will ensure that\n\n[[Page S10767]]\n\nmillions of Americans who are uninsured or who lack adequate health \ninsurance coverage will at least have access to preventive and basic \nprimary health care services in their communities.\n  The legislation reauthorizes the community health centers program, \nwhich provides needed health care services, including outpatient \ndental, diagnostic, treatment, preventive, and primary care--in under-\nserved rural and inner-city areas. These services are provided through \ncommunity health centers, migrants health centers, farm-workers, health \ncenters for the homeless, health centers for residents of public \nhousing, and healthy schools programs. It also re-authorizes the \nNational Health Service Crops, a program that trains and places health \nprofessionals in areas where there are shortages of qualified \nprofessionals. Finally, the legislation establishes the Healthy \nCommunities Access Program, which will help coordinate community \nservices for the uninsured.\n  I believe this legislation represents what can be achieved when good \npolicy and bipartisanship overcome politics. A priority for President \nBush, this legislation is an important piece of his agenda to ensure \nthat all Americans have access to health care services. As a next step, \nI look forward to working with the President, and my colleagues in the \nSenate and House, to ensure that all Americans have access to \naffordable health insurance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the House amendment to the bill, and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 969, and the \nSenate proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 969) to establish a Tick-Borne Disorders \n     Advisory Committee, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the consideration \nof the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today \nto signal the passage of important legislation designed to combat the \ndevastating illness of Lyme disease. The objective of this bipartisan \nconsensus legislation is simple--to put us on the path toward \neradicating Lyme disease--a disease still unfamiliar to some Americans, \nbut one that is all too familiar to those of us from Connecticut and \nthe Northeast.\n  The impact that Lyme disease can have on its victims is tremendous. \nThe disease first achieved prominence in the 1980s in the state of \nConnecticut and got its name from the town of Lyme, CT. Today, \nConnecticut residents have the dubious distinction of being 10 times \nmore likely to contract Lyme disease than the rest of the nation. \nHowever, Mr. President, the incidence of Lyme disease nationwide is on \nthe rise. In fact, cases of Lyme disease have been reported by 49 \nstates and the District of Columbia. Since 1982, the number of Lyme \ndisease cases reported to health officials numbers more than 145,000. \nHowever, reports indicate that the actual incidence of the disease may \nbe many times greater than current figures suggest.\n  Health problems experienced by those infected with Lyme disease can \ninclude facial paralysis, joint swelling, loss of coordination, \nirregular heartbeat, liver malfunction, depression, and memory loss. \nBecause Lyme disease frequently mimics other conditions, patients often \nmust visit multiple doctors before a proper diagnosis is made. This can \nresult in prolonged pain and suffering, unnecessary tests, costly and \nfutile treatments, and devastating emotional consequences for victims \nof Lyme disease and their families.\n  The legislation that we pass today is a continuation of earlier \nefforts to stem the growth of Lyme disease and\n\n[[Page S10768]]\n\nother tick-borne disorders. Through an amendment that I offered to the \nFY 1999 Department of Defense appropriations bill, an additional $3 \nmillion was directed toward the DoD's Lyme disease research efforts. \nThis signaled an important first step in the fight to increase our \nunderstanding of this disease, but clearly more remains to be done. The \nlegislation we pass today further continues these efforts.\n  Central to this legislation, is the creation of a federal advisory \ncommittee on Lyme disease and other tick-borne disorders. This advisory \ncommittee will bring together members of the scientific community, \nhealth care providers, and, most important, those most personally \ntouched by this devastating disease, Lyme patients and their families \nthemselves. It is my hope that the important work of this, the first \nfederal advisory committee on Lyme disease, will lay out a concise and \nworkable federal blueprint for combating this debilitating illness.\n  Additionally, this legislation will establish clear goals for federal \naction designed to conquer Lyme disease and other tick-borne disorders. \nIn laying out these goals, the legislation offers a framework for the \nfederal government that includes research, treatment, and prevention \nefforts designed to stop the growth of Lyme disease and other tick-\nborne disorders.\n  The legislation passed by the United States Senate today also \nauthorizes $10 million for federal activities related to the prevention \nand effective treatment of Lyme disease and other tick-borne disorders. \nThis critically important funding will also provide needed research \nfunding for vector-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Rick \nSantorum, the legislation's chief Republican cosponsor, for his \nsteadfast support of this initiative. It is due to his support, the \nsupport of my colleagues on the Senate HELP Committee, and the support \nof the Lyme disease community that we are here today on the verge of \nsignificantly strengthening the federal commitment to eradicating Lyme \ndisease. I pledge to continue to work with my colleagues to ensure \nvigorous and effective oversight of the legislation's implementation in \norder to ensure that our intent is fully realized.\n  I think I can speak for all of my colleagues when I say that we look \nforward to the day when Lyme disease no longer causes so many to \nsuffer. This legislation offers an important and critical step toward \nthat laudable goal.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Dodd has a substitute amendment at \nthe desk, and I ask unanimous consent for its consideration; that the \namendment be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that the bill, as amended, be read three times, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements \nrelating to the matter be printed in the Record, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4894) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To provide for a complete substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Lyme disease is a common but frequently misunderstood \n     illness that, if not caught early and treated properly, can \n     cause serious health problems.\n       (2) Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is \n     transmitted by a tick bite. Early signs of infection may \n     include a rash and flu-like symptoms such as fever, muscle \n     aches, headaches, and fatigue.\n       (3) Although Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics \n     if caught early, the disease often goes undetected because it \n     mimics other illnesses or may be misdiagnosed. Untreated, \n     Lyme disease can lead to severe heart, neurological, eye, and \n     joint problems because the bacteria can affect many different \n     organs and organ systems.\n       (4) If an individual with Lyme disease does not receive \n     treatment, such individual can develop severe heart, \n     neurological, eye, and joint problems.\n       (5) Although Lyme disease accounts for 90 percent of all \n     vector-borne infections in the United States, the ticks that \n     spread Lyme disease also spread other disorders, such as \n     ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, and other strains of Borrelia. All \n     of these diseases in 1 patient makes diagnosis and treatment \n     more difficult.\n       (6) Although tick-borne disease cases have been reported in \n     49 States and the District of Columbia, about 90 percent of \n     the 15,000 cases have been reported in the following 10 \n     States: Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, \n     Rhode Island, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Delaware, \n     and Wisconsin. Studies have shown that the actual number of \n     tick-borne disease cases are approximately 10 times the \n     amount reported due to poor surveillance of the disease.\n       (7) Persistence of symptomatology in many patients without \n     reliable testing makes treatment of patients more difficult.\n\n     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF A TICK-BORNE DISORDERS ADVISORY \n                   COMMITTEE.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Committee.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, there shall be \n     established an advisory committee to be known as the Tick-\n     Borne Disorders Advisory Committee (referred to in this Act \n     as the ``Committee'') organized in the Office of the \n     Secretary.\n       (b) Duties.--The Committee shall advise the Secretary and \n     Assistant Secretary of Health regarding how to--\n       (1) assure interagency coordination and communication and \n     minimize overlap regarding efforts to address tick-borne \n     disorders;\n       (2) identify opportunities to coordinate efforts with other \n     Federal agencies and private organizations addressing tick-\n     borne disorders; and\n       (3) develop informed responses to constituency groups \n     regarding the Department of Health and Human Services' \n     efforts and progress.\n       (c) Membership.--\n       (1) Appointed members.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall appoint voting members to the Committee from among the \n     following member groups:\n       (i) Scientific community members.\n       (ii) Representatives of tick-borne disorder voluntary \n     organizations.\n       (iii) Health care providers.\n       (iv) Patient representatives who are individuals who have \n     been diagnosed with tick-borne illnesses or who have had an \n     immediate family member diagnosed with such illness.\n       (v) Representatives of State and local health departments \n     and national organizations who represent State and local \n     health professionals.\n       (B) Requirement.--The Secretary shall ensure that an equal \n     number of individuals are appointed to the Committee from \n     each of the member groups described in clauses (i) through \n     (v) of subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Ex officio members.--The Committee shall have nonvoting \n     ex officio members determined appropriate by the Secretary.\n       (d) Co-chairpersons.--The Assistant Secretary of Health \n     shall serve as the co-chairperson of the Committee with a \n     public co-chairperson chosen by the members described under \n     subsection (c). The public co-chairperson shall serve a 2-\n     year term and retain all voting rights.\n       (e) Term of Appointment.--All members shall be appointed to \n     serve on the Committee for 4 year terms.\n       (f) Vacancy.--If there is a vacancy on the Committee, such \n     position shall be filled in the same manner as the original \n     appointment. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy for an \n     unexpired term shall be appointed for the remainder of that \n     term. Members may serve after the expiration of their terms \n     until their successors have taken office.\n       (g) Meetings.--The Committee shall hold public meetings, \n     except as otherwise determined by the Secretary, giving \n     notice to the public of such, and meet at least twice a year \n     with additional meetings subject to the call of the co-\n     chairpersons. Agenda items can be added at the request of the \n     Committee members, as well as the co-chairpersons. Meetings \n     shall be conducted, and records of the proceedings kept as \n     required by applicable laws and Departmental regulations.\n       (h) Reports.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 24 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the activities carried \n     out under this Act.\n       (2) Content.--Such reports shall describe--\n       (A) progress in the development of accurate diagnostic \n     tools that are more useful in the clinical setting; and\n       (B) the promotion of public awareness and physician \n     education initiatives to improve the knowledge of health care \n     providers and the public regarding clinical and surveillance \n     practices for Lyme disease and other tick-borne disorders.\n       (i) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this Act, $250,000 for each \n     of fiscal years 2003 and 2004. Amounts appropriated under \n     this subsection shall be used for the expenses and per diem \n     costs incurred by the Committee under this section in \n     accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. \n     App.), except that no voting member of the Committee shall be \n     a permanent salaried employee.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR RESEARCH FUNDING.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated $10,000,000 for \n     each of fiscal years 2003 through 2007 to provide for \n     research and educational activities concerning Lyme disease \n     and other tick-borne disorders, and to carry out efforts to \n     prevent Lyme disease and other tick-borne disorders.\n\n     SEC. 4. GOALS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that, in carrying out this \n     Act, the Secretary of Health\n\n[[Page S10769]]\n\n     and Human Services (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Secretary''), acting as appropriate in consultation with \n     the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, the Director of the National Institutes of \n     Health, the Committee, and other agencies, should consider \n     carrying out the following:\n       (1) Five-year plan.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Secretary should consider the establishment of a plan that, \n     for the five fiscal years following the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, provides for the activities to be carried out \n     during such fiscal years toward achieving the goals under \n     paragraphs (2) through (4). The plan should, as appropriate \n     to such goals, provide for the coordination of programs and \n     activities regarding Lyme disease and other tick-borne \n     disorders that are conducted or supported by the Federal \n     Government.\n       (2) First goal: diagnostic test.--The goal described in \n     this paragraph is to develop a diagnostic test for Lyme \n     disease and other tick-borne disorders for use in clinical \n     testing.\n       (3) Second goal: surveillance and reporting of lyme disease \n     and other tick-borne disorders.--The goal described in this \n     paragraph is to accurately determine the prevalence of Lyme \n     disease and other tick-borne disorders in the United States.\n       (4) Third goal: prevention of lyme disease and other tick-\n     borne disorders.--The goal described in this paragraph is to \n     develop the capabilities at the Department of Health and \n     Human Services to design and implement improved strategies \n     for the prevention and control of Lyme disease and other \n     tick-borne diseases. Such diseases may include Masters' \n     disease, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, other bacterial, viral and \n     rickettsial diseases such as tularemia, tick-borne \n     encephalitis, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, and bartonella, \n     respectively.\n  The bill (S. 969), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10769-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AMENDING THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 4013.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4013) to amend the Public Health Service Act \n     to establish an Office of Rare Diseases at the National \n     Institutes of Health, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the consideration \nof the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend the Senate today for its \nbipartisan action in approving the Rare Diseases Act of 2002 and the \nRare Diseases Orphan Product Development Act of 2002. These two \nmeasures will enhance the prospects for developing effective care, \ntreatments and cures for literally thousands of rare diseases and \ndisorders.\n  Congress has a longstanding commitment to provide this support. In \n1983, we passed the Orphan Drug Act to improve the development of \ntreatments for rare diseases and disorders. These diseases affect small \npatient populations, typically smaller than 200,000 individuals in the \nUnited States. They include Huntington's disease, myoclonus, ALS (Lou \nGehrig's disease), Tourette syndrome, and muscular dystrophy.\n  The Rare Diseases Act and the Rare Diseases Orphan Product \nDevelopment Act build upon the enormous success of the original Orphan \nDrug Act, which encouraged the development of over 220 treatments for \nrare diseases and disorders.\n  The Rare Diseases Act of 2002 provides a statutory authorization for \nthe existing Office of Rare Diseases at the National Institutes of \nHealth and authorizes regional centers of excellence for research and \ntraining with respect to rare diseases. This proposal originated with \nthe NIH, in recommendations of a Special Emphasis Panel convened to \nexamine the state of rare disease research. The Panel itself was \nconvened in response to a request of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee in 1996, and it is appropriate that we are today introducing \nlegislation which represents the fruition of a long, deliberative \nprocess involving both Congress and the NIH.\n  The Rare Diseases Orphan Product Development Act increases funding \nfor the Food and Drug Administration's Orphan Product Research Grant \nprogram, which provides vital support for clinical research on new \ntreatments for rare diseases and disorders. This funding will encourage \nmany more commercial sponsors to investigate and develop vital new \nmedicines.\n  Although each rare disease may not affect many patients, 25 million \nAmericans today suffer from the 6,000 known rare diseases and \ndisorders, including more than 600,000 in Massachusetts. Anyone who has \na family member or friend who suffers from a rare disease or disorder \nknows the importance of developing new treatments and helping patients \nto obtain these potential cures. Today's passage of these two bills \nwill provide the resources necessary to continue to develop new \ntreatments and even cures for millions of Americans.\n  I would also add that these bills are intended to build upon previous \ncongressional efforts to expand research and development for all rare \ndiseases and disorders. Senator Hatch and I introduced the Rare \nDiseases Act, upon which these bills are based, to expand and enhance \nexisting initiatives underway at the various institutes of NIH with \nrespect to different rare diseases, including but not limited to \nmuscular dystrophy, Huntington's disease, and ALS (Lou Gehrig's \ndisease). I believe the NIH will act upon these new bills in the \nappropriate spirit, by building upon current activities and investments \non rare diseases and disorders.\n  I commend the National Organization for Rare Diseases for its \ntireless and continuing leadership on these basic issues. I also \ncommend Senator Hatch for his leadership on this issue in the Senate, \nand I commend Congressmen Waxman, Shimkus, and Foley for their \nleadership in the House of Representatives. I know that all of us look \nforward to the implementation of these important measures we are \napproving today.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today I rise to comment on the Clark County \nConservation of Public Lands and Natural Resources Act of 2002, which \nis important to southern Nevada and a priority for the Nevada \ndelegation. This broad-based compromise legislation is also important \nfor America. The many provisions in this legislation reflect the many \nchallenges faced by southern Nevada. I would like to highlight some of\n\n[[Page S10770]]\n\nthe ways in which the Clark County Conservation PLAN will enhance the \nquality of life and economic opportunities for Nevadans at the same \ntime we protect southern Nevada's environment for the benefit of future \ngenerations.\n  When Congress passed the Southern Nevada Public Lands Management Act \nin 1998, we made the decision that it was in the public interest to \ntransition away from federal-private land exchanges and competitively \nauction those parcels of land deemed by the BLM as suitable for \ndisposal. This decision has proven quite effective and fair and \nrepresents the future of land privatization in Nevada and the West. \nHowever, at the time the law was enacted, Congress did contemplate that \na limited number of ongoing land exchanges should be completed because \nof their benefit to the public. The Red Rock Canyon-Howard Hughes \nexchange is one such exchange. This land exchange has been contemplated \nfor a number of years and enjoys unusually broad support ranging from \nthe County to the environmental community. The time when this exchange \nshould have reached completion through the administrative process has \nlong since passed and a legislative resolution is now in order.\n  Nevada has nearly 100 wilderness study areas on federal land across \nthe state, which remain de facto wilderness until Congress acts. These \nareas, which are primarily owned by the Bureau of Land Management, are \nmanaged to protect wilderness character of the lands under current law. \nThose of us who wrote this bill hold different views regarding \nwilderness. But in developing the wilderness component of this bill, \nSenator Ensign, Congressman Gibbons and I made good faith compromises \nthat protect all interested parties as we designated 18 wilderness \ntotaling about 450,000 acres and released 220,000 acres from wilderness \nstudy area status. We believe that this solid compromise represents a \ncritical step toward addressing the outstanding wilderness issues in \nthe state of Nevada.\n  The Clark County Conservation PLAN Act modifies the Southern Nevada \nPublic Lands Management Act and expands the so-called Las Vegas valley \ndisposal boundary. This expansion will make an additional 23,000 acres \nof BLM land available for auction and development.\n  One of the most important infrastructure issues facing southern \nNevada is siting a new international airport. The County's preferred \nsite is in a dry lake bed between Jean and Primm, Nevada south of the \nLas Vegas Valley in the Interstate 15 transportation corridor near the \nCalifornia border. Congress made federal land at that site available \nfor use as an airport, pending environmental reviews. The Clark County \nConservation PLAN complements that law in two important ways. First, \nour bill conveys federal land adjacent to the proposed airport to the \nClark County Airport Authority so that it can promote compatible \ndevelopment within the area impacted by the noise of the airport. \nSecond, our bill directs the Bureau of Land Management to reserve a \nright-of-way for non-exclusive utility and transportation corridors \nbetween the Las Vegas valley and the proposed airport. However, both of \nthese provisions are contingent upon a positive record of decision on \nthe environmental impact statement for the planned Ivanpah Airport.\n  One of the most precious areas in southern Nevada is a humble canyon \nnear Henderson. It is an area graced with hundreds of petroglyphs. This \ncanyon is in desperate need of protection because it is within a short \nwalk of the Las Vegas valley. Similar resources elsewhere in the desert \nSouthwest have been destroyed by urban encroachment.\n  The Clark County Conservation PLAN designates the Sloan petroglyphs \nsite and the area that comprises most of its watershed as the North \nMcCullough Mountains Wilderness. This wilderness combined with about \n32,000 acres of open space comprises the proposed Sloan Canyon National \nConservation Area. The NCA and wilderness will provide critical \nprotection for the Sloan petroglyphs, preserve open space near \nHenderson's rapidly growing neighborhoods and together represent a \nlegacy of cultural and natural resource conservation our grandchildren \nwill value dearly.\n  The sheer number of public lands bill requests Senator Ensign and I \nreceive is daunting. If we introduced separate legislation to address \neach legitimate issue that constituents bring to our attention, we \nwould create an awkward patchwork of new federal laws. The Clark County \nConservation PLAN provides a comprehensive vision and framework for \nconservation and development in southern Nevada that balances competing \ninterests.\n  The final title of our bill includes a select few of the many \nimportant public interest land conveyances. For example, we include two \nland grants to further the higher education mission of Nevada's \nuniversity system.\n  Our bill conveys a small active shooting range to the Las Vegas \nMetropolitan Police Department for training purposes. We grant a modest \nparcel of land to the City of Las Vegas for the development of \naffordable housing. These small but important actions will help our \ncommunities, law enforcement, and educational system better serve \nsouthern Nevada.\n  I would like to address some concerns regarding provisions in the \nHouse version of the Clark County Conservation PLAN raised by a number \nof Nevadans some of which may be shared by the Chairman of the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Bingaman. The title in \nquestion involves a Bureau of Reclamation title transfer and confusion \nover whether this provision would be subject to existing laws and how \nthe final maps will be drawn. I want to emphasize to my colleagues that \nthis legislation transferring right, title and interest in the Humboldt \nProject specifically contemplates in section 808 that the Secretary of \nthe Interior will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, \nthe Endangered Species Act, and all other applicable laws, such as the \nNational Historic Preservation Act, prior to any conveyance of title. \nIn passing this legislation, Congress intends that a thorough \nenvironmental analysis of the transfer be undertaken prior to transfer \nso that decisionmakers are fully informed of any environmental impacts \nassociated with the transfer. In fact, section 804(e) addresses the \nissue of the costs associated with complying with NEPA, again \nunderscoring Congress's anticipation that a thorough NEPA review will \nbe undertaken. In addition, it is our intent that an analysis of any \nspecies listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species \nAct take place prior to the transfer. Congress recognizes that these \nenvironmental reviews are necessary prior to conveyance to ensure that \nany appropriate conditions to mitigate impacts of the transfer can be \nimplemented. I think the language of the bill is straightforward but \nappreciate the concerns that have been raised in this regard and hope \nthat my statement clarifies this point.\n  In addition, section 803(a) references a map dated July 3, 2002, \nwhich depicts the lands and features of the Humboldt project. \nSubsection (b) of section 803 directs the Secretary to submit a map of \nthe Humboldt Project Conveyance as soon as practicable after the date \nof enactment of the legislation. In case of a conflict between the map \nreferred to in subsection (a) and the map submitted by the Secretary \nunder subsection (b), the map referred to in subsection (b) is to \ncontrol. This provision is included to allow only for clarifying \nclerical and technical modifications to the map. We anticipate that any \ndiscrepancy between the maps referred to in subsections (a) and (b) \nwill be minimal.\n  Senator Ensign and I are proud of the progress we have made and \nbelieve that this bill could serve as a model for bipartisan \ncooperation and constructive compromise. We are grateful for the work \ndone in the House of Representatives by Congressman Gibbons and \nCongresswoman Berkley to convince their colleagues of the importance of \nthis bill which led to a unanimous favorable vote on October 16.\n  I also appreciate the assistance we received from Senator Bingaman \nand Senator Wyden, as chairmen of the full and subcommittees with \njurisdiction over this bill, they played critical roles in improving \nthe bill. In addition Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nstaff worked very hard, particularly over the past month to perfect \nthis legislation. The long hours and expertise of these professionals, \nincluding David Brooks, Kira Finkler, Patty Beneke, Bob Simon, Shelley \nBrown, Sam Fowler, Dick Bouts, and Jim Bierne and House staff including \nRobert Uithoven, Rick Healy, Jim Zoia, Tim Stewart, Rob Howarth, Lisa \nPittman, Lisa Daley and Dayne Barron, made passage of this bill \npossible but more importantly made our bill better. Often overlooked in \nthe development of a bill such as this one is the\n\n[[Page S10771]]\n\nwork done by federal employees who work for the public land management \nagencies. In the development of this bill, however, such oversight \nwould be inexcusable because Bob Abbey, Mark Morse, Laurie Sedlmayr, \nDonn Siebert, Robert Taylor, Demetrius Purdie-Williams and Jeremy \nNoble, Bill Dickinson, Dick Birger, and many others provided valuable \ninsights and assistance without which this bill would not have been \npossible. John Lopez of Senator Ensign's staff and my staff met with \nhundreds of Nevadans to ensure that this bill is a Nevada bill that is \ngood for America. Among these individuals, Clint Bentley, John Wallin, \nJeremy Garncarz, Blake Monk, John and Hermi Hiatt, Larry Johnson, Roger \nScholl, Elise McAllister, Terry Crawforth, John Moran, Jr., Kevin Mack, \nChuck Musser, Jane Feldman, Doug Hunt, Pam Wilcox, Kelly Jensen, Cal \nBaird, George Reyling, Toni Worley, Mike Carey, as well as \nrepresentatives of the many municipalities in Clark County played \nparticularly important roles. Countless others provided constructive \nsuggestions and support that led to this point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read three \ntimes, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for S. 1868, the National Child Protection and Volunteers for \nChildren Improvement Act of 2002. This bill will help protect children, \nseniors, and the disabled by making criminal background checks more \naccessible to care-providing and mentoring organizations. I am pleased \nthat the Senate has approved this important piece of legislation.\n  In May of this year, S. 1868 was favorably reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee. Since that time, Senator Biden and I have worked to refine \nthis bill. I want to thank him for his tireless efforts to improve this \nlegislation. We have produced a bill that will greatly improve the \nbackground check process, thereby reducing the possibility that \ndangerous individuals will interact with children and other vulnerable \npeople.\n  S. 1868 is critically necessary because of the serious problems that \nplague the current scheme for conducting background checks. The current \nsystem is governed primarily by the National Child Protection Act of \n1993, NCPA, and the Volunteers for Children Act, VCA. These Acts were \ndesigned to encourage states to develop background check procedures for \nvolunteers and employees who interact with children. In addition, the \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 expanded the \nreach of the NCPA to the elderly and those with disabilities.\n  While these Acts were significant milestones, we have learned that \nthe process must be improved. First of all, many states are returning \nbackground checks after significant time has passed. In 1998, the FBI's \nCriminal Justice Information Services, CJIS, Division performed a study \non the amount of time it took states to process fingerprint checks. The \nresults were troublesome. On average, it took states an average of \n117.6 days to perform a state check and forward the fingerprint to the \nFBI for a national check. This time lag is obviously a problem for \norganizations that rely heavily on volunteers.\n  Additionally, some states charge very high prices for background \nchecks. Organizations that have a large number of volunteers are often \nforced to spend a lot of money on these checks. In addition to \ndiscouraging volunteerism, the high costs dissuade organizations from \nperforming background checks on their volunteers and employees.\n  S. 1868 helps to solve these problems by making background checks \nunder the NCPA more readily available. As amended, S. 1868 permits the \nstates to retain their crucial role in performing background checks, \nbut also provides a role for the Federal government. If a state \ncomplies with the NCPA, returns background checks in a timely fashion, \nand charges no more than $18, the state will remain the sole government \nentity that can perform a background check in that jurisdiction. \nHowever, it a states does not develop a qualifying program within a \nyear of enactment, care-providing and mentoring organizations in that \nstate will have the option of requesting background checks directly \nfrom the Federal government.\n  This bill would create an office within the Department of Justice \nthat would receive requests for background checks. The results of \nbackground checks would then be returned to the entities, enabling them \nto make informed decisions. The office would also be required to \ndevelop model standards to guide entities in making fitness \ndeterminations.\n  I would like to point out that some states may have established \nqualified state programs in some areas but not in other areas. This \nlegislation does nothing to prevent the Attorney General from \ndesignating a state as having a qualified program for some NCPA \npurposes, but not for others. Therefore, if background checks are \nperformed adequately for those who work with the elderly, but not for \nthose who work in other areas, the Attorney General would have the \nauthority to designate a qualified state program for the particular \npurpose of working with the elderly.\n  Senator Biden and I have developed a good bill. We have streamlined \nthis legislation and removed many of the provisions objected to by the \nDepartment of Justice. We have developed a background check scheme that \nwill preserve the role of the states in the background check process. \nWe have also provided organizations with the ability to ask the Federal \ngovernment for a\n\n[[Page S10777]]\n\nbackground check if the state fails to develop an adequate system.\n  This bill is important for the well-being of our children and is a \nproper use of Federal resources. The Congress should use all reasonable \nmeans to ensure that criminals do not have access to children, seniors, \nand the disabled. I am proud to support this legislation, and I am \npleased that the Senate has approved these significant protections for \nthe most vulnerable in our society.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank my \ncolleagues for passing H. Con. Res. 406. This resolution commemorates \nthe tremendous sacrifice made by so many Lao-Hmong during the Vietnam \nWar.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I am proud to represent one of the \nlargest Hmong populations in America. My experience as a Senator has \nbecome so much greater as a result of coming to know the noble history \nand rich culture of the Hmong people in Minnesota. I am in awe of their \nsacrifice for the American people.\n  Hmong soldiers died at ten times the rate of American soldiers in the \nVietnam War. Yet, because America's war effort in Laos was covert, the \nsacrifices and service of the Hmong and Lao veterans is still largely \nuntold. The legislation we passed today is a tribute to the Hmong \npeople's sacrifice for our country. It is a small but meaningful step \nin honoring and fulfilling our debt to the Hmong and Lao veterans and \ntheir families.\n  This resolution also commends the leadership of the Lao Veterans of \nAmerica for its work in passing several pieces of legislation I \nintroduced with Congressman Vento that would expedite citizenship for \nHmong veterans and their wives. In addition, they led the fight to \nerect a monument in Arlington National Cemetery in honor of the Hmong \nwho died in the Vietnam War. The Lao Veterans of America, including \nCherzong Vang, in Minnesota, and Colonel Vang Yee Vang, Executive \nDirector of the organization, has worked tirelessly to educate Congress \nand the public about the history and contributions of the Hmong people \nin our county. This resolution is a fitting response to this important \nwork.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for passing this excellent and overdue \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10777-4", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10777-S10778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DESIGNATING OCTOBER 10, 2002, AS ``PUT THE BRAKES ON FATALITIES DAY''\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to the consideration of H.R. 5596.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5596) to amend section 527 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to eliminate notification and return \n     requirements for State and local party committees and \n     candidate committees and avoid duplicate reporting by certain \n     State and local political committees of information required \n     to be reported and made publicly available under State law, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate today \nis passing H.R. 5596, a compromise bill aimed at improving disclosure \nby Section 527 political organizations and relieving certain 527 \norganizations from arguably duplicative filing requirements. I want to \nthank my colleague, Senator Hutchison, as well as our colleagues in the \nHouse, for working steadfastly with us to draft this bill in a manner \nthat achieves its purpose, but does not open any loopholes in the \noriginal section 527 reform law.\n  In June 2000, Congress passed the first significant campaign finance \nreform measure in a quarter of a century. The so-called Section 527 \nreform bill dealt with a truly troubling development, one whereby \norganizations that received tax-exempt status by telling the IRS that \nthey exist to influence elections denied the very same thing to the \nFEC.As a result, these self-proclaimed election organizations engaged \nin election activity without complying with any aspect of the election \nlaws, influencing our elections without the American public having any \nidea who--or what--was behind them.\n  The 527 reform law enacted in 200 put a stop to that, by requiring \norganizations claiming tax-exempt status under Section 527 of the \nInternal Revenue Code to do three things: (1) give notice of their \nintent to claim that status; (2) disclose information about their large \ncontributors and their big expenditures; and (3) file annual \ninformational returns along the lines of those filed by virtually all \nother tax-exempt organizations.\n  During the approximately two years that the 527 reform law has been \nin effect, that law has blasted sunshine onto the previously shadowy \noperations of a multitude of election-related organizations. Through \nthe filings Section 527 now mandates, the American public has learned a \ngreat deal about who is financing many of these organizations and how \nthese organizations are spending their money. As outlined in report \nissued earlier this year by the group Public Citizen, the 527 reform \nlaw brought us the knowledge that 25 of the largest 527s raised over \n$67 million between July 2000 and December 2001, and that they spent it \non a plethora of campaign activities--most significantly those pre-\nelection issue ads that we all know so well and that are often \nindistinguishable from candidate ads. We've also learned from these IRS \nfilings the specifics about who was trying to influence particular \nelections and where their money came from. Were it not for the 527 \ndisclosure law, we probably wouldn't have any of this information, and \nwe probably would have had a lot more shadowy groups operating in the \nelection system--ones that slithered away on their own because they \ndidn't want to face the disinfectant of sunshine.\n  These filings will become all the more important come this November, \nwhen the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act--the McCain-Feingold bill--goes \ninto effect. As we all know, at least some of the soft money donors who \nwill no longer be able to give to political parties will be looking for \nother ways to influence our elections. Donations to 527 groups will \nprobably top many of their lists, because these are the only tax-exempt \ngroups that can do as much election work as they want without \njeopardizing their tax status. With the\n\n[[Page S10780]]\n\npotential for all this new money coming in, it is critical that we have \na healthy 527 disclosure regime in place.\n  Although the 2000 law has been a tremendous boon in the fight for \nclean and open elections, the 527 disclosure regime does have some \nproblems. Public interest groups that use the disclosure reports tell \nus that those reports lack important information needed to understand \n527s' activities, and, more importantly, that the reports are hard to \naccess and analyze. A new report by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance \nInstitute's blue ribbon Task Force on Disclosure, for example, \nconcludes that ``there is a serious lack of meaningful web disclosure'' \nby the IRS of 527 group activities, and calls upon Congress to mandate \na fully searchable database and electronic filing. Put simply, the \npublic needs more information to be reported and it needs the IRS to \nprovide better access to it.\n  Just as importantly, concerns have been raised about the law's impact \non State and local political organizations that already fully disclose \nto the public all of the activities covered by the 527 reform law. When \nwe first enacted the 527 reform law, we made clear that we believed \nthat 527 organizations, as a condition of receiving the federal benefit \nof tax exemption, owed the public disclosure of certain information \nabout themselves and their activities. A number of State and local \npolitical organization have now convinced us that they already disclose \nthat information on the State level, thereby already serving the law's \npurpose, and that there is no reason to require them to report the same \ninformation again to the IRS.\n  The bill we are considering today seeks to comprehensively address \nall these problems. First, it makes important and necessary \nimprovements to the reporting and disclosure requirements, to enable \nthe public to have better access to more information. For example, \norganizations will have to provide more information about the \ncontributions they receive and the expenditures they make--providing \nthe dates of both them, as well as the purpose of their expenditures. \nThe added requirement to state the purpose of an expenditure will be \nparticularly helpful in allowing the public to see whose money is \nsupporting particular candidates. I hope that in implementing this \nprovision, the IRS makes clear that organizations should state the \npurposes of expenditures with specificity, including whether particular \nexpenditures are in support of, or opposition to, particular \ncandidates, as well as the name and office sought by any such \ncandidates. The bill we are considering today also requires 527s to \nprovide updated information on themselves if there is any material \nchange in the basic identifying information they filed with the IRS. \nThis important change will make sure that the public can at all times \nlocate these groups and know who is running them.\n\n  At the same time, as we are improving the nature of the filings, we \nare also mandating better disclosure of them. From here forward, all \n527 filing reports on their contributors and expenditures will have to \ndo so electronically, and the IRS will have to make those reports \nsearchable on, and downloadable from, the Internet. This will vastly \nimprove the public's access to information about, and understanding of, \n527 organizations and their activities.\n  The second major feature of this bill is its elimination of arguably \nduplicative reporting requirements. In particular, it grants relief \nfrom the 527 reform law to a number of organizations that focus on \nState and local elections and that are regulated by State disclosure \nlaws.\n  First, the bill fully exempts from its mandates State and local \ncandidate and party committees. Under the reform law, these committees \nmust notify the IRS of their intent to claim Section 527 status, and \nthey have to file annual information returns if they have over $25,000 \nin gross receipts. They do not, however, have to file contribution and \nexpenditure reports. Since the reform law went into effect, we have \nbecome convinced that the burden imposed on these committees by the two \nrelevant disclosure mandates outweigh the public purpose served by \nrequiring them to comply with these mandates.\n  By exempting them from the contribution and expenditures reporting \nrequirements that lie at the heart of the Section 527 law's disclosure \nregime, the original reform law recognized that State and local \ncandidate and party committees do not generally pose the threats the \n527 law intended to address. In contract to other political committees, \nthere is never any doubt as to who is running these committees or whose \nagenda they aim to promote. Just as importantly, State laws regulate \nand require disclosure from all of these committees.\n  Different considerations apply to the case of so-called State and \nlocal PACs. The bill grants more limited relief to a carefully defined \nset of these groups. In granting this relief, we have walked a very \nfine line. On one hand, we want to recognize the fact that every State \nrequires disclosure from political committees involved in that State's \nelections and that many State and local PACs covered by the 527 reform \nlaw therefore are already disclosing the information the 527 law seeks. \nOn the other hand, we still believe that there is a strong public \ninterest in knowing how the federal tax-exemption under Section 527 is \nbeing used by these organizations, and we most decidedly do not want to \nexempt from the law's disclosure requirements any State or local PAC \nthat does not otherwise publicly disclose all of its activities.\n  To exempt a State or local PAC merely it claims that it is involved \nonly in State elections and files information about some of its \nactivities with a State agency would risk creating a massive loophole \nthat could undermine the 527 reform law. That is because just as prior \nto the passage of the 527 reform law, some 527 groups were claiming \nthat they were trying to influence elections for the purposes of the \ntax code, but not for the purposes of the election laws, a broad \nexemption for State or local PACs could lead some groups to claim that \nthey are influencing State elections for the purposes of Section 527 \nbut not for the purposes of the State disclosure laws.\n  So, we have reached the following compromise. First, we are not \nexempting any of these organizations from the Section 527(i) \nrequirement to notify the IRS of the intention to claim Section 527 \nstatus. Unlike candidate and party committees, it is not always clear \nto the public who is behind these groups or what their purposes are, \nmaking the information filed in these notices important sources of \notherwise unavailable information. Moreover, because we are not \ncompletely exempting these groups from the law's other disclosure \nrequirements, the notice requirement will be critical in helping the \nIRS and outside groups monitor compliance with the law's other \nmandates. In light of that, we believe the minimal effort required to \nfile the 527(i) notice is worth the tremendous value of giving the \npublic some basic information about these groups.\n  Second, we are granting an exemption from the Section 527(j) \ncontribution and expenditure reporting requirements to some of these \norganizations, but only if they can meet certain strict requirements. \nThe group's so-called exempt function activity must focus exclusively \non State or local elections; a group that engages in even the smallest \namount of activity related to a federal election will not be entitled \nto this exemption. The group also must file with a State agency \ninformation on every contribution and expenditure it would otherwise be \nrequired to disclose to the IRS. This requirement ensures that \nCongress' conditioning of tax exemption on complete and full disclosure \nis not compromised.\n  In addition, these State filings must be pursuant to a State law that \nrequires these groups to file the State reports; this requirement seeks \nto prevent organizations from hiding truly federal activity by \nvoluntarily reporting to a State where reports may not be as readily \naccessible as are federal reports. Moreover, no group will be able to \ntake advantage of this exemption if the State reports its files are not \npublically available both from the State agency with which the report \nis filed and from the group itself. Finally, this exemption also is not \navailable to any organization in which a candidate for federal office \nor someone who holds elected federal office plays a role--whether \nthrough helping to run the organization, soliciting money for the \norganization or deciding how the organization spends its money. I \nshould note here that the use of the word ``solicit''\n\n[[Page S10781]]\n\nin this case is meant broadly; if a federal candidate or office holder \nsuggests that money be given to a committee or directs it there in \nanyway, then federal disclosure is mandated.\n  In short, this bill exempts from Section 527(j)'s contribution and \nexpenditure reporting obligations only those groups that truly and \nlegitimately engage in exclusively State and local activity and only \nwhen they already report to their State on all of the information the \n527 law seeks. This latter condition is important not just because it \nprecludes the hiding of federal activity, but also because we believe \nthat even those groups involved in exclusively State and local \nelections should face some disclosure requirement if they are to take \nthe federal benefit of tax exemption under Section 527.\n  Finally, the bill makes a small change to these State and local \ngroups' obligation to file an annual information return when they do \nnot have taxable income. Under the current law, they must file such \nreturns when they have $25,000 in annual receipts; the bill increases \nthat trigger to $100,000. Like all other 527 organizations, though, \nthey still will have to file such returns if they have taxable income.\n  To help walk my colleagues through this bill, I am attaching at the \nend of my statement a section-by-section of the bill and ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record after my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Again, let me thank Senator Hutchison in particular \nfor her efforts on this bill. I believe we have worked out a good \ncompromise, one that grants relief where it is warranted, but does not \nin any way threaten to open up a loophole in the law. I thank her for \nthat, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                           SECTION-BY-SECTION\n\n       Section 1 exempts State and local candidate and party \n     committees from the requirement to notify the IRS of their \n     Section 527 status (Form 8871) and makes that exemption \n     retroactive to the date of the 2000 law's enactment.\n       Section 2 exempts qualified State or local PACs from the \n     requirement to file reports with the IRS detailing their \n     contributions and expenditures (Form 8872). It defines a \n     qualified State or local political organization as one which: \n     (a) focuses solely on State or local elections; (b) reports \n     and discloses information about all of its sizable \n     contributions and expenditures under State law; and (c) does \n     not have a federal candidate or elective office holder \n     playing any material role in the organization or raising \n     money for it. The provision makes clear that an otherwise \n     qualified exempt State or local PAC does not lose its \n     exemption simply because there are certain variations between \n     State and federal law with respect to reporting of \n     contributor and expenditure information.\n       Sections 3(a)-(b) repeal certain changes the 2000 law made \n     to the requirements governing the filing of tax returns (Form \n     1120) by political organizations. Although political \n     organizations are exempt from taxation on most of their \n     income (such as contributions), certain income may be subject \n     to federal tax. Prior to the 2000 law, only Section 527 \n     groups with taxable income had to file the Form 1120. The \n     2000 law required most 527s to file the form, whether or not \n     they had taxable income. Section 3(a) restores the pre-2000 \n     law and puts 527s on a similar footing to other tax-exempt \n     organizations with respect to the 1120 Form by requiring \n     filing of the form only if the organization has taxable \n     income. Section 3(b) restores the pre-2000 law by making \n     clear that the tax returns of 527s with taxable income are \n     confidential.\n       Section 3(c) exempts a number of organizations from the \n     requirement to file the Form 990 annual information return. \n     Exempt groups will now include State or local candidate and \n     party committees, associations of State or local officials \n     and groups filing with the FEC. The section also provides \n     that qualified State and local PACs must file the 990 only if \n     they have at least $100,000 in annual gross receipts (other \n     non-exempt groups must file the 990 if they have at least \n     $25,000 in annual gross receipts). Finally, the section \n     directs the Treasury Secretary to adapt the 990 form, which \n     was not developed for political organizations, to seek \n     information relevant to the activities of Section 527 \n     organizations.\n       Section 4 directs the Treasury Department to work with the \n     FEC to publicize the 527 law's reporting requirements.\n       Section 5 authorizes the Treasury Secretary to waive \n     amounts imposed for failing to file 8871 notices or 8872 \n     reports if he concludes that the failure to file was due to \n     reasonable cause and not willful neglect.\n       Sections 6(a), (b) and (d) modify existing law regarding \n     noncompliance. Section 6(a) provides that organizations that \n     fail to notify the IRS of their intent to claim Section 527 \n     status will have all of their so-called exempt-function \n     income subject to taxation, regardless of whether that income \n     was segregated for use for an exempt function. Section 6(b) \n     provides that the procedures used for collecting amounts \n     imposed for failing to comply with the 8872 contributor/\n     expenditure reporting requirement are akin to those used to \n     collect penalties from tax-exempt organizations that fail to \n     file the form 990 (this section affects the process of \n     collection, not the amount collected). Section 6(d) makes \n     clear that the tax code's existing criminal fraud penalties \n     for anyone who willfully furnishes information to the IRS he \n     knows is false or fraudulent also applies to 8871 and 8872 \n     filings.\n       Sections 6(c), (e), (f) and (g) make changes to certain \n     disclosure requirements. Section 6(c) streamlines the 8871 \n     notice requirement by eliminating the need to file the notice \n     in writing; only electronic reporting of the notice will \n     remain. Section 6(c)(1) adds the date and purpose of \n     expenditures and the date of contributions as required \n     information on the Form 8872. Section 6(e)(2) mandates \n     electronic filing of the 8872 contributor/expenditure \n     reports, and Section 6(e)(3) requires that the IRS make \n     information in those reports available to and searchable by \n     the public on the Internet and downloadable to personal \n     computers. Section 6(f) amends the 8871 notice to require \n     filers to note whether they intend to claim an exemption from \n     the 8872 contribution/expenditure reporting requirement or \n     the form 990 annual return requirement. Finally, Section 6(g) \n     requires organizations to file amended 8871 notices within 30 \n     days of any material change of the information on the \n     previous 8871.\n       Section 7 provides that forms already filed and made public \n     by the IRS under current law will remain public after this \n     bill becomes law. This provision is needed because many of \n     the bill's exemptions are retroactive, and without Section 7, \n     the IRS could be found in violation of taxpayer \n     confidentiality rules for posting filings that were public \n     under the original law but will no longer be public after \n     this bill's enactment.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements related thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 5596) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10781-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10781-S10782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AUTHORIZING REPRESENTATION BY SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. REID.

The plaintiff, Judicial Watch, Inc., is a legal \nwatchdog group that has pursued numerous civil suits against the \nGovernment and its agencies and officials. In this case, Judicial Watch \nhas sued former President Clinton and several current and former \nMembers of the Senate and the House of Representatives, alleging that \nthose officials conspired to pressure the Internal Revenue Service to \ninitiate and continue an audit of Judicial Watch in retaliation for its \nactivities.\n  The plaintiff in this case has named the current and former Senators \nas defendants in this suit based solely on the fact that these Senators \nsent routine transmittal letters to the IRS forwarding constituent \ncorrespondence inquiring why Judicial Watch was entitled to the \nbenefits of tax-exempt status. Merely because of those routine buck \nletters, Judicial Watch alleges that those Senators entered into an \nunlawful conspiracy to pressure the IRS to continue to audit it in \nviolation of its constitutional rights.\n  This resolution authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel to represent the \nSenate defendants in this action.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, a Federal information in the Northern \nDistrict of New York has been filed against an individual on four \ncounts of refusing to follow lawful orders, obstructing a corridor, and \ntrespass inside a Federal office building in Syracuse, NY.

Mr. President, we have, I am sure, a few other items to do \nbefore we close until later next month. I just want to say, first of \nall, the Presiding Officer is so available and I appreciate that very \nmuch. We all do. As I am sure everyone in this Chamber knows, it is \ndifficult late at night to find people willing to preside, and the \nSenator from Minnesota, Mr. Dayton, is always so courteous and willing \nto preside. I told him personally what an excellent job he does. \nPresiding is more than just being here. The Presiding Officer has to be \nfirm and consistent, as he is.\n  Also, Mr. President, it took a lot to get to where we are tonight. I \nread through these items very quickly, but people work for days, weeks, \nand months on some of this legislation. As I read the titles, some may \nnot seem too significant, but they are important, and we were able to \npass them tonight.\n  Also, it is hard to describe to the viewing public how hard the staff \nworks, without the attention we get, to get us to where we are. The \nstaff certainly deserves more attention than they get. Anything that \nhappens in the Senate, we take the credit, but we should give them some \nrecognition. We would not be where we are without them.\n  To do all this takes a lot of people: the Official Reporters, those \nwho are experts on different legislation. Senators' staff have been \nwaiting here for days, it seems, but it has only been hours, to see \nwhat happened to legislation on this final day before a somewhat long \nbreak. In addition we have the Parliamentarians, the legislative and \nJournal clerks, and all the various staff. The staff who are here \ntonight--Senators are going to go home at 10:25 p.m.--will be here for \nhours working on the Record, and other issues. We have the pages who \nare juniors in high school, but they are here with us doing what we ask \nthem to do.\n  This is really a team effort. To all the security people, and the \nothers, I express my personal appreciation for everything everybody \ndoes to allow us to get our work done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair fully concurs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/17/senate-section/article/S10782-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS THROUGH NOVEMBER 12, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.
